From industry to pvp, to exploration and politics - I&apos;ve done it all, and it was a great game in the past. But the eve of today is an empty shell of what it was, it&apos;s a dying game, kept alive by people who have invested too much in eve over the years to quit, people who have 4+ accounts and sometimes upwards of 8 or 10 accounts.
<br>
<br>The people who play this game are some of the most belligerent people you&apos;ll ever meet, it attracts a certain kind of personality, and the learning curve is so steep it filters out the vast majority of people who quit usually within a month or two. In short - the community is horrible, extremely elitist and snobby. They have a saying in eve, if a player quits eve and joins WoW, the IQ of both games goes up. The attitude amongst eve players is &apos;we&apos;re the best&apos;, and as someone who joins now, 12+ years after it went live, that doesn&apos;t include you, which leads me to my next point.
<br>
<br>Eve&apos;s skill system is real time, so you&apos;ll have to catch up with people who have a decade head start on you or you&apos;ll have to buy a skilled-up account, at huge cost. You&apos;ll be told you&apos;re useful as a new player and that you can do anything you want, but you really can&apos;t. You won&apos;t be able to compete industrially without months of skilling, and massive amounts of reading of guides and how-to articles, you won&apos;t be able to compete in pvp without about six months experience, the meta in pvp is tech3 or faction cruisers which will cost you an arm or a leg and when they&apos;re gone they&apos;re gone - which also means pvp rarely happens unless one side already knows who&apos;ll win.
<br>
<br>Another reason you won&apos;t be able to compete is the price of things. The devs, CCP have artificially raised prices over the last few years in the hopes of selling PLEX, eve&apos;s version of &apos;gold currency&apos;. A few years ago a battleship would cost you about 60 million, now it&apos;s over 200 million. most things are 3x to 5x the price these days - so if you want half a chance, be prepared not only to pay the subscription fee, but also fork out a nice bit of real-life cash so you can compete in pvp, or get that nice missioning battleship.
<br>
<br>Speaking of the devs, did I mention they&apos;ve been found cheating at their own game? Rigging in-game events for their pals, spawning money-printing blueprints for other pals, constantly lying about pay-2-win which they&apos;ve tried to sneak in a few times now, hiring their in-game pals who have little clue about the game itself and proceed to make terrible changes. CCP have had multiple flops, eve is their ONLY successful game and they&apos;ve bled it dry to make (or half make) other games which never come close to release and are shut down after a few years of development. In fact, CCP&apos;s employee numbers have halved since 2011, with entire departments being fired on short notice, and the player numbers for eve are down to the levels they were at in 2006 - sound like a healthy MMO?
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also worth pointing out that apart from the head guy himself, none of the devs are the &apos;original&apos; devs from when the game was first released in 2003 - all the old devs that gave eve its great vision of a dark futuristic harsh place where around every corner is death - they&apos;re all gone, off to greener pastures or retired. The people who run eve now are mostly former players that have been hired by CCP, players that in some cases didn&apos;t play the game for more than a year (the learning curve is 6 months alone). Players that have old pals in-game, and biases they took with them.
<br>
<br>And this all leads to the point I&apos;m trying to make, if you want to play eve it&apos;s too late. You should have picked it up back in 2006 to 2009, these days it&apos;s in decline and it&apos;s really more like a second job you pay for. Pvp has declined rapidly to blob vs blob, the standard of pvp has become 1 billion (15 euro) isk ships, the old-boys of the game like me have it all sewn up, we can spend in a day without a second thought what it will take you a month to earn (unless of course you fork out real-life cash for PLEX, which is what the aim was when all prices were artificially inflated). All the &apos;lawless&apos; space of zero-zero is all sewn up, you can come here, but you&apos;ll have to pay a nice tax to do so and you&apos;ll have to obey the &apos;owner&apos; of that space - in short you&apos;ll be a tax income to some guy or bunch of guys who&apos;ve played the game 10+ years.
<br>
<br>If you really want to play it, wait until it&apos;s free2play, which it will likely be within two years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5403433">Expand</a></span>

I ran missions, explored wormhole space, station trading, and mining.  However, I quit because this game is very focused on the sadistic side of human behavior.  You cannot prevent someone from killing you and taking all of your hard earned stuff.  You can avoid being killed for a short time but eventually you will be eaten by the bigger fish.  This is what they don&#x2019;t tell you - this game needs new blood so that the bigger fish can consume you.  As a new player you are constantly flying around in fear of being cannibalized by others.  I could never destroy something that I know takes somebody much effort to create &#x2013; and for this you will be labeled despairingly as a Carebear.  I can understand that you are better than me and you caught me and you destroyed my ship.  However, it doesn&#x2019;t stop there.  After your ship is destroyed they Pod you (and they really don&#x2019;t have to do this) and you have to start all over again.  The worst part is that people are constantly trying to scam you.  They say they want to help you but in the end they take advantage of you.  This is completely allowed - The game developers say this is the beauty of the sandbox mode.  I say it is &#x201C;Lord of the Flies&#x201D; in space.  A bunch of kids on a deserted island and all hell breaks loose.
<br>
<br>Sandbox mode?  Don&#x2019;t think so.  How can this be a sandbox game when you are limited to where you can go, and do, as a solo pilot?  Yes, a few good people exist but you can&#x2019;t trust anybody.  I live this in real life why would I want to spend my recreational time doing this?
<br>
<br>If you are a sadist then please play this game and enjoy yourself.  I would rather you live your fantasy online than in real life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4111757">Expand</a></span>

A mind-blowingly, awe-inspiringly spectacular game.There is no other game out there that can match Eve in terms of its sheer scale. You can do pretty much anything, from running a massive mining corporation to participating in fleet battles between hundreds of players, to exploring the depths of space for artifacts. The website is filled with stories of huge incursions and important power-players struggling for dominance in a galaxy-sized battlefield.
<br>
<br>Too bad you won&apos;t experience any of it.
<br>
<br>While Eve is a big game, you won&apos;t discover anything new or do anything important. Initially released in 2003, pretty much anyone who&apos;s anything in New Eden has been playing for quite a few years. Now, a dozen years later, everything in the game has been done and done again by those who spend their entire lives in a chair facing a computer screen.
<br>
<br>Now, nobody in their right mind would expect to make the front page in an MMO during their first month of play. However, the game has become so hollow, with such a massive investment of time to do anything even remotely interesting (often measured in months of real-life time) that a newcomer has absolutely no chance of doing anything on-par with those who&apos;ve been playing for a few years. The seemingly massive scale is betrayed very quickly when you realize that you are just a meaningless speck of dust in a cold and unforgiving universe. Normally this would be okay. But in Eve, you will still be that same speck of dust a month later. And a month after that.
<br>
<br>There are other problems, like an unusually hostile community, but these can pretty much be overlooked if you&apos;re a sufficiently think-skinned person. That doesn&apos;t change the fact that there is virtually no room for progression without giving away a few years of your life to a meaningless grind. If you decide to get it now, good luck. Don&apos;t expect any satisfaction.
<br>
<br>In the end, if you&apos;re looking for a game to have even a little bit of fun and relaxation, then Eve is not your game. If you&apos;re looking for a neverending grind where the &quot;scale&quot; is merely a facade that only the best of the best can enjoy, then give Eve a try. After all, there&apos;s always the free trial. if you manage to accomplish anything in that timeframe, feel free to call me up and tell me how.
<br>
<br>Is Eve fun? Yes. But all the fun&apos;s been had already.
<br>
<br>Is Eve a good game? Undoubtedly. But it&apos;s already been played to completion. There are better options out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5308682">Expand</a></span>

There aren&apos;t really any goals even hinted at. You can set yourself goals but chances are you&apos;ll quit the game before you achieve them. You can pretty much either go into Industry, Missioning or PvP, but they all play out pretty much the same. Lock onto target, activate modules, wait, then repeat or warp out.<br><br>You would think that a game set in space would feel huge and open, but EVE Online is possibly the most claustrophobic game I have ever played, when warping between things, it feels like you&apos;re in a small room crammed in with a load of other people.<br><br>Over all the game is worth a try, because 300,000 people can&apos;t be wrong, the game can be fun. How ever most PvP results in who ever has the bigger blob wins, industry is all about who can sit around in a belt wasting all day, while they make as small a profit as possible thanks to macro miners ruining prices of minerals and products. Missioning results in you asking for a room full of NPCs, warping to the room full of NPCs, killing all the NPCs in the most mind numbing combat any game has ever made and then warping back and asking for a new mission.<br>The game really needs more focus. I just don&apos;t understand why anyone would really want to play EVE &quot;Spreadsheets&quot; Online all day, with pretty much you&apos;re only reward being more ISK, or a destroyed ship.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1448661">Expand</a></span>

He who has stuff or tons of friends, goes around picking on the weak and yes, they can detect and come after you no matter where you are. Some find this fun, the problem is that its mindless. A few reviewers write that the game has a hard learning curve, but it really does not. You can learn how to fly anything once you learn what the equipment does then its just a matter of quick min/max depending on functionality but its moot and the game boils down to he who can afford better stuff = win. New players are at a huge disadvantage and are reduced to fodder for everyone else or are forced to join gangs (I dont call them guilds in this game). Thats basically Eve in a nutshell, if it were not for trolling/zerging weaker enemies, there is not much to do. Mining and missions are insanely boring and not well implemented. PvE is not done well as enemies are dumb as door knobs and easily defeated by re-configuring your ship or using a different ship as needed. The AI does not work together even when they have numbers and frankly... its embarrassing, and soooo boring due to how slow it is.
<br>
<br>Now lets talk about the worst part of this game. Skills are learned through a timer in real time... yep. You read that right. You click on the skill you want to learn, then you wait. As you move up in skills, the time to level new skills goes up significantly. Some skills take a week to level if not more (this is where I stopped). There is an obvious problem with this system. The person who has played longer will have a huge advantage over someone new because they simply spent more time in the game leveling skills. It does not matter if they are skilled or not, this system is so imbalancing that its comical. Dont listen to the zealots who review this game highly. They will tell you the game is balanced and new players have a chance, they really dont unless the veteran player is drunk and asleep at the keyboard. Veterans of the game are handed huge advantages in almost every way (dont forget they will also be very rich and can afford any ship they want) and since this game is all about PvP, you will never encounter a fair fight in this game. Thus, PvP is moot. Its like an adult picking a fight with a kid. Its trivial 99% of the time and not fun unless you are the type of enjoys this sort of thing. To that, I say, grow a spine.
<br>
<br>Very badly designed game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4876732">Expand</a></span>

As an open world MMO you&apos;re free to explore and do as you please, but this freedom comes with a lack of any direction. There&apos;s not much in terms of story. The only single player &quot;story&quot; is had by performing extremely repetitive missions for agents which usually involve fighting other ships. There is no such thing as EXP. The player learns new skills over time, which take progressively longer depending on the level of the skill. This means that there is zero chance of ever catching up to someone who&apos;s been playing for a year, as there&apos;s no skill point cap. Thankfully, the skills are trained offline too, and you can allot skills to be trained in a queue. &quot;Death&quot; or the destruction of your ship has severe consequence. Ships can cost millions of ISK (the currency) and making ISK takes time. You can buy insurance, but this usually doesn&apos;t even cover half the cost of the ship when it&apos;s fully fitted with weapons. Some good points are: Faction wars, player made economy, many jobs ranging from pirate to miner. Social engineering is also permitted, unlike in other games where it&apos;s forbidden to scam other players. In Eve, anything goes. You&apos;ll often find a scammer or two in local chat offering a dodgy deal. However the game takes serious time and effort to get anything out of. I&apos;m talking years of dedication. Eve takes itself very seriously and unlike WoW, it is NOT a casual game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2421393">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First, PvE combat is simple and repetitive. Just stay at the optimal range of your weapons and pick off enemies as they follow you in a straight line. The scenarios I played had no real variation in NPC placement or tactics, and a player frigate is more than a match for even an NPC battlecruiser. The game assigned me the same missions multiple times, although I hardly noticed given that missions were so indistinguishable.
<br>
<br>But let&apos;s talk about PvP, which everyone says is EVE&apos;s strong suit. Unfortunately, a large part of PvP is equally repetitive. Apart from large-scale corporation warfare, most kills are scored by campers who set up near the gates between star systems and kill incoming ships before they can react. EVE veterans will tell you this game mechanic helps make the game harsh and unforgiving, and they&apos;re right. It just doesn&apos;t make it challenging.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s assume you slip past the gate camps and find some players to fight. For PvP, there are some deep game mechanics in which skills to train first and which equipment to buy. Unfortunately these choices are all trumped by quantity. If your opponent has brought more of his friends, has spent more in-game money on his ship, or has accrued more skill points purely by playing the game longer than you have, then it doesn&apos;t really matter whether you fit your ship with Anode Light Electron Particle Cannon I or 125mm Carbide Railgun I, does it?
<br>
<br>This means that a typical PvP encounter will be either easy or impossible. For example, Easy: You (and possibly your buddies) ambush an asteroid miner, who may even not even be actively playing. Impossible: You and your buddies are attacked by a pirate gang with large ships and years worth of skill points.
<br>
<br>You can take steps to get more of the easy encounters and fewer of the impossible ones. Scanning probes, cloaking, and warp travel introduce elements of stealth and speed. These can be entertaining (and very suspenseful!). They also makes it easier for you or your enemies to slip away, further reducing the chance of a real fight.
<br>
<br>Long-time players say that unless you have lots of skill points (and lots of real-world skill as a gamer), you will lose money on PvP. To get that money back you&apos;ll need to mine asteroids (basically sit AFK), hauling goods (again sit AFK), or run repetitive PvE missions (you can probably go AFK for some of those too). There are plenty of games out there that provide more challenging PvP combat without any need for PvE grinding.
<br>
<br>EVE is a huge community and obviously I can only review the part of the game I played. You might have a great time in a huge null-sec alliance participating in fleet battles. But I&apos;ve seen the YouTube videos of these battles, and I don&apos;t believe they&apos;re worth months of grinding and real money payments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4995469">Expand</a></span>

The only kind of people who should regard playing this game are disabled ones, because they have enough free time to grind for credits so they could choose not to pay this game with real money, and it will sure take all of their free time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170170">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve best heard it described as &quot;hours of mind-numbing boredom punctuated by moments of intense action,&quot; and that description holds up. You&apos;d do best to learn as much as you can about it before you start. The tutorials have gotten better recently, but they really can only do so much. Eve rewards research, planning, knowledge, ambition, courage, and desire. It is not for people who need to be told what to do as in modern &quot;theme park&quot; MMO. It is truly a sandbox where you can do as you please but must face the consequences of your actions. It is certainly worth a download (not from Steam, that version acts weird with your Steam account) and a trial. As the devs say, &quot;either you quit in the first few days of your trial period or you subscribe forever.&quot; It&apos;s much more than spreadsheets in space, but the spreadsheets do help.

<br>Added bonus: free expansions approximately twice a year and the ability to pay for game time with in-game currency.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604468">Expand</a></span>

The font is horrible and cannot be scaled up except in chat windows. The inevitable result for me is discomfort and eyestrain whenever I try to play this game. For me, this is a complete deal-breaker.<br><br>Apart from that, the game is highly intimidating. PvP is a huge focus of the game (really, almost everything in the game has a PvP element, even if its an indirect one) and there are a lot of trolls, scammers and people who will generally just do anything they can to get ahead. Very little in the way of clear-cut goals are presented to you, so to maintain interest in this game, you need to develop a passion for it and be very self-motivated (or else, play with someone who is strongly motivated and will bring you along for the ride). There are lots of roles you can fill in EVE, but finding your place can be very difficult. You can&apos;t really play through the tutorials and the PvE missions (which get boring fast) the game puts before you and be a competent contributing member to a group of pilots, especially in PvP. You need to receive training from a player-run corporation or else take your lumps and lose a lot of ships (probably both) before you&apos;re any good. And that means you&apos;ll be flying cheap little frigates or maybe cruisers with cheap fittings for a few months. This will try your patience.<br><br>Another problem with finding a role to play in EVE is that the game heavily rewards skill specialization, and skills in this game are earned passively. If you want to be a battleship pilot, that&apos;s great, but to be an effective battleship pilot, you need a lot more than just the skills necessary to actually fly a battleship. You also need the respective support skills that will allow you to fit the right array of modules, and reasonably high level of skills in using those modules effectively. If you want to fly a covert ops frigate for performing reconnaissance, you need different suite of abilities that have a limited amount of overlap with the skills necessary for performing other roles. Manufacturing or research require a different host of abilities. So while you may be tempted to try on many different hats and spread your skills around, the more you do so, the longer it will be before you achieve mastery in any one thing.<br><br>What this game does offer is a player-driven world/sandbox that is unlike anything offered by any other MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1626725">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is very slow, so slow that i actually fell asleep in a combat mission!  I guess shooting dots isn&apos;t my thing, cause that&apos;s all combat is in Eve.  I felt like i was playing pacman, going from level to level just eating dots and that wasn&apos;t very satisfying.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t expect physics either from this game, all combat is automated and there is no manual actions unless you count clicking a module and watching it do the interval thing.  You can sort of steer your ship, but that too is mostly automated.  It is probably safe to say most of this game is automated for you.
<br>
<br>Interactions with planets, stations, other ships and all that stuff that makes space life fun is non existent.  You can dock with stations, but you just get close and dissapear.  Epic right?  You cannot enter orbits and there are only a few ships you can dock and interact with.
<br>
<br>The economic part of the game was pretty impressive and seemed just as complex as a real one.  It is full of scams though and deters players from actually using it at all.
<br>
<br>I could go on all day with this so ill just sum it all up.  Eve has the potential to be the best game ever made and i truly believe that, but it is crippled by so many things like automation that will keep it at the bottom instead of the top.  If you like action you will definately not like this game at all.  If you like using calculators and spreadsheets, then sign up right away.  It all comes down to what the player likes, but in my opinion you don&apos;t really &quot;play&quot; this game at all, it plays itself for you in most cases.
<br>
<br>So i gave it a 2 for the graphics and the ability to exit the game quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2265954">Expand</a></span>

Fans will talk about the lack of the usual MMORPG grind, but EVE compensates by making every task mind-numbingly slow (and, worse, mostly automatic). They will speak highly of its &quot;open-ended structure&quot;, but this is just a euphemism for the game&apos;s complete lack of focus. One for those who enjoy reading books containing blueprint diagrams of the Starship Enterprise, methinks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=716399">Expand</a></span>

<br>I can`t detail the game in this review, cause it is huge, so many paths, so many opportunities. It would take me thousands of words only to scratch the mechanics and the general stuff; so I won`t do that.
<br>
<br>Maybe the game has some particularities that will exclude the players that hope for something predetermined, as &quot;aim and shoot, fast reward in serotonin, you never loose, you never win anything&quot;, instead it grows on you, and will make you realize how much emptiness resides in the current gaming world. So if you are tired with the boring, identical games that pop up today, you should try this one.
<br>
<br>EVE is hard, EVE is unique, EVE is deep, EVE will consume you and will reward you.
<br>
<br>A 10/10 for the wonderful experience that this game offered me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190867">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pro&apos;s: player run universe and generated content. fully player run market. best pvp in the gaming industry
<br>However this game has heavy detractors from it right now
<br>
<br>Cons: **** customer service, always say no policy. &apos;its not us, its you&apos;
<br>perhaps
<br>
<br>The worst community in gaming history. this game is fully of hateful people, no getting around this. the entire community is scammers, no lifers, pure hateful people, cowards
<br>
<br>You will be shunned and hating for trying to create content and making this game worth while to play.
<br>Known bugs that refused to be fixed. The community is actually mathematically smarter than the employers. I am not kidding you, the forums are loaded with masters in math, the CCP employee&apos;s cannot understand the majority of &apos;how to fix this part of your game&apos; with a user helping them out for FREE.
<br>
<br>CCP decided to hire one of its subscribers in order to help the game, but like all players who want the play the game their way, the game has gone down the crapper. This person has released several new ships that are completely biased to a certain play style tailored to ganking. which is currently the majority of game play. like i said ive been playing when there was 50000 people logged in at the same time playing eve and it was amazing. currently at most there is only 20000 people logged in playing, the only players left are the die hard bitter vets who will play the game until it drops.
<br>
<br>It is a WoW clone now. logi has become so pertinent in PVP these days its just warriors and healers. that is all. nothing different.
<br>
<br>It is also a pay 2 win game. the more you pay, the more you can do the more you can win. simple.
<br>
<br>The game is fundamentally broken and will stay broken, ccp will not change the game to make it more realistic or more fun because they have realized that the player base wants certain things to stay EXACTLY they way they are and be coward spineless losers. THEY WILL LOOSE their player base if they change the game for the better. Because all the relevant players that would have supported it, are gone, they have fed up with ccps bull****.
<br>
<br>spoilers? you will play for 2 years before you can be good in the ship you want to fly. simple as that, do NOT waste your time. youtube pyrion flax&apos;s guide to eve online, watch it and stay away from this **** hole game.
<br>
<br>Market? just about the only real reason to play this game is wheeling and dealing. the market is tense. however if you try to do anything, industry, manufacturing, invention, transportation(WHICH DOES not exist becaues you just pay for a 2nd account to have hauling for free, as a result, actual hauling like in a real game is non-existant and failed mechanic because you are allowed to have more than 1 character), is all pointless because its all done by some russian ahole for .0000001 ISK per hour to under cut the guy doing it for .0000002 ISK per hour(eve currency)
<br>
<br>if you wanna get good at pvp, you have a read a book about all the stats in eve and what it does. period. it will take you 2 years of solid pvping to fully understand it and you will still get killed by somebody who has more real life money than you.
<br>
<br>once ccp has your money its GG, **** customer service, i mean i truly haven&apos;t seen terrible service like this since ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4412171">Expand</a></span>

I loved the character customization and the variety of ships and roles. The space is amazing. There&apos;s this nice sense of seriousness when you talk about player formed corporations etc. But after these good sides the game went completedly downhill for me. The UI gets VERY frustrating, the font is horrible and most of the time your screen is full of sh*t that you can&apos;t see anything. The game is NOT newbie friendly. The missions are way too complicated and boring. Nothing else than point, click and wait. I wasted 1 hour on trying to figure out how to do an air show mission, but I don&apos;t if it whether was bugged or something else but I just couldn&apos;t get through it. And the buggy controls and confusing space  wont help anything. Also it feels like there&apos;s no one around. I just sometimes saw one another ship going somewhere, nothing special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2296450">Expand</a></span>

The constant development of expansions makes this game better and better. One does ask the question though &quot;why the hell am I playing this&quot; while they are waiting for the next mining cycle. Then they quit. I quit and played about 3 or 4 times. I won&apos;t be going back unless it goes FTP</span>

The most important thing you need to know is that CCP (developer) claims that this is a pvp game. The whole concept however of the gameplay within eve online makes you not want to pvp. There are 3 types of systems high/low/null sec , basicly in any of them pvp is impossible. There are simple features CCP can place into their game which will improve their gameplay, however they seem to be more busy with making a 3d station while negleting pvp and pve content. If there is a chance and time you do find yourself pvping then eve online offers you the most passive and boring pvp combat you can expect from a mmo. You orbit around your target at your optimal range and you basicly let the skillpoints do the rest. The skillpoint system is another thing that really makes me give eve online a bad review, having to wait almost 40 days for 1 upgrade is a bit to much. Playing the game also doesnt help you achieve your goals faster. Now about the pve. The pve in eve online is non existent, the missions you do are boring and basicly the same all the time. This is also one of the things ccp can put some effort in to improve pve, however as i said before their priority&apos;s are messed up and making 3d stations to burn down your video card is more important. Conclusion:<br><br>If you are looking for a pvp game look somewhere else since Eve Online isnt giving you any sort of pvp combat.<br>If you are looking for a pve game then also look somewhere else since Eve online isnt giving you any sort of good pve content either.<br>If however you like to piss people off and annoy people eve online could be something for you by becoming a pirate.<br>If you like to spend 99% of the game afk making isk ( in game money ) then Eve online can also be something for you by becoming a miner.<br>If you like to scam people in a game then Eve online can also be something for you by afking in stations and try to scam people with contracts.<br>If you like to have to wait hours and sometimes days before you get into a pvp combat which isnt really that special gameplay.<br>Then in this case aswell Eve online could be something for you.<br><br>So basicly if you want to spend your time and money on a game which doesnt bring you any sort of fun then Eve online it something for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1780488">Expand</a></span>

The training time can be reduced by implants which cost a fortune and of course you lose them if your capsule gets blown up so CCP got the grinding part covered nicely. All of this could be acceptable if the game was captivating, but EVE lacks any story apart from a few mission arcs and no effort have been made to change this. The missions given to your by the regular agents are repetitive either kill, mine or fetch this or that.<br><br>The UI is terrible, the only complex thing about this game is learning to use it&apos;s ugly, old &amp; awkward interface.<br><br>In addition you have no direct control over your ship in any way (No WASD or Mouse), flying in space consists of telling your ship to approach or orbit around ships or other objects the terrible pathing algorithm makes navigating near anything a nightmare.

It is a high quality game at a low price, with no fee for the client and FREE seasonal expansions. The PvP in this game is spectacular with a good group of pilots and since it is a true sandbox game, the possibilities really are limitless.</span>

<br>If you&apos;re the sort of person who likes to pick on defenseless other players, almost kill them, ransom them for the majority of their in-game assets, and then kill them up anyway just for fun, then this is, as far as I know, the only game where such conduct is not a ToS violation  but rather an accepted way of living for many players.
<br>If like most people, you find the above unethical, horrifying, or just downright vicious, EVE is not the right game for you.
<br>I&apos;ve always been a fairly competitive PVP player (spend a lot of my time on SC2 ladder)  but EVE is way beyond what even I am comfortable with. EVE is a universe where anyone can randomly kill you at any time for no reason. There is no safety  anywhere. One of the players&apos; mottos is &quot;don&apos;t fly what you can&apos;t afford to lose&quot;  because you can and will get randomly ganked by much higher-level players for no reason, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.
<br>IMHO, this is not the way to run a game. It caters to the most sociopath players, and anyone even suggesting that PVPers could do their thing in their zones, and PVEers could be left alone in theirs is labelled a &quot;carebear&quot; and mercilessly mocked by other players. The whole game is built on a brutal, exploitative attitude where everyone is out to get everyone else  and that just doesn&apos;t make for a very nice environment to play in.
<br>I really did try to give this game a chance. I played for a few months. I flew every class of ship up to and including battleships, but in the end, the fancy graphics and the hype just couldn&apos;t cover up that this is essentially a game for sociopaths.
<br>If you&apos;re a sociopath, this will be your paradise. If you are a normal person, then stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3141146">Expand</a></span>

I recommend this game to people which have some patience and are opened for new types of MMO games. There is probably  a lot of haters but you should give this game a try</span>

There&apos;s a steep learning curve, very steep. The game doesn&apos;t teach you everything, and there&apos;ll be things you still don&apos;t understand after six months of playing. You virtually cannot be successful by yourself in this game, you have to join up with corporations (their version of guilds) at one point to have any chance. The drawback to this is most of the time these corps (guilds) is just a method of the leaders to get the lower members to do all the work for their own goals and they reap most of your rewards. Also there&apos;s a lot of scamming and theft that goes on within corps and in the game in general. It takes incredibly long to do anything in this game, we&apos;re talking days and even months. Skilling your character to the top levels of one skill can take months, and there&apos;s lots of other skills you need. A max skilled character take years, while a decent character will take six months at least. There&apos;s no way to really make it go much faster as skilling takes place in real world time. For example, you pick a skill you want to level up and after one day or whatever (whether you&apos;re playing or not) you get that level up. It might not seem so bad, but there&apos;s high skill levels that require 30+ days for just one skill level, you&apos;re going to need multiple skills like that. It&apos;s very time consuming loading out your ship, you have to put multiple components into it. When you die, you lose everything on your ship. You have to start all over from scratch building your ship again. Factor in that you can&apos;t just get your ship and all the components you used in one place, you have to go all over the place to buy everything again. Travelling around takes forever too. Ship combat, while graphically looks good and appears quite complex is actually pretty boring. You target the other ship and set your weapons to fire, then you watch as the ships exchange fire back and forth until somebody dies or runs away. This might be alright in other games, but you&apos;re usually always outclassed by people playing the game longer than you because they can fly better ships. It&apos;s not because they have more resources than you either, it&apos;s only because they&apos;ve been playing longer. You need certain skills levels to fly better ships and use better ship components. What&apos;s worse is even if you&apos;ve been with the game for years and have the best ship possible, it doesn&apos;t matter because if you get jumped by 30 or 50 people in smaller much inferior ships, you&apos;ll still lose; once your awesome ship is destroyed you may have to spend a lot of time and resources to replace it, assuming you haven&apos;t gone bankrupt at that point. In real world terms, it&apos;s virtually your house burning down and you have to rebuild from scratch. Getting jumped by a lot people happens all the time. People wait in groups at the entrances to areas for people to wander in to attack them. If you come in with a valuable ship or a smaller group, they will lock you down so you can&apos;t run away and they&apos;ll call for all their buddies online to show up. It&apos;s happened on many occasions where really valuable ships get caught and hundreds (yes hundreds) of ships show up just to destroy it. The only way to move around is to try to sneak through or moving in well armed fleets, no guarantee though. Also due to the game mechanics, big ships have a hard time killing smaller inexpensive ships. This means even if you&apos;re flying a big mean ship, you can&apos;t kill the little ships so if enough of them are swarming you, you&apos;re dead. This means the fleet you&apos;re traveling with must have ships that can handle them. Again meaning you can&apos;t really do things on your own effectively. People also hunt you down if you&apos;re doing stuff in their controlled areas, constantly interrupting you from doing things. Much time will be spent trying to elude people. The social environment is horrible as well since the game is rife with scamming and distrust. You pretty much only trust your corp members (who some actually do try to steal from you or the corp or are spies for other corps....seriously this happens often). Anybody you met at random, you can assume they&apos;re going to try to kill you and they&apos;re going to assume the same about you. The game has no real ingame story and purpose, it&apos;s a sandbox. While great since you can come up with any goals you like, realizing those goals are very unlikely. It is exceedingly difficult to get ahead as the game is setup that way and the competition from others who&apos;ve been playing the game longer than you. The worse con is everything takes so incredibly long because it&apos;s a subscription based game, you have to pay monthly to play. Trying to pay for the subscription with ingame money is too hard as you have to be decently skilled up (6 months at least), know people, and be playing constantly for that month to make enough to pay for that month. This game is a trap!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3117220">Expand</a></span>

Boy it was the best &#xC2;&#xA3;3 i&apos;ve ever spent! - At first I didn&apos;t like EVE - i felt like i was a lone wolf in the middle of a massive solar system &amp; that was it, so basically thrown in at the deep end with nothing to do. But the key to enjoying EVE is to find yourself a good corporation that you can become friends with the people in it. That way you gain a SENSE OF PURPOSE which keeps you wanting to subscribe - so i am now a fan of EVE whereas before i never used to be. This game has a rubbish metacritic score due to the time it was reviewed, but there is always new content - so maybe it should be reviewed again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2313578">Expand</a></span>

<br>On the other hand, there is some good things, like graphic and music and character customization.

Just recently logged in again to see the changes.
<br>
<br>THE GOOD: excellent dev support - constant high quality updates. Massive universe, 5,000+ star systems, well modeled planet / moon systems. Immersive gameworld - lots to discover. Interesting game mechanics. Complex interactions between ship systems means lots of quality OCD time for detail-oriented strategy gamers. Combat is an intricate dance of range, speed and damage types vs. defense types. Game rewards planning and quick thinking.
<br>
<br>The experience of being a new player in EVE is akin to being in in a Firefly class ship in the Star Wars universe, although instead of two sides there are hundreds. You can live a desperate life on the raggedy edge of space or join a corporation as low scout on the totem pole. Both roles are fun for awhile but you will spend most of your time in either case trying not to get destroyed. Run, Forrest, run!
<br>
<br>THE BAD: You will never be awesome. Skills train in real time - unless you can time travel back to 2004 you will always suck. A skilled player with several years of skill-time can blow your battleship to flinders using his escape pod. It&apos;s like fighting vampires.
<br>
<br>Unrealistic physics model. No Newtonian movement system. Cut power and you coast to a stop. No gravity. No science in the fiction - Okay, so call it science-fantasy instead - but it lacks appeal there as well. Ships flip around on their central point instead of using maneuver jets or making graceful Star Trek turns. Battleships should not flip around like frigates. Combat ranges reduce everything to blips - you can&apos;t see your enemy - not interesting.
<br>
<br>Unappealing ship models. Badly designed. Asymmetrical in a bad, ugly way.  No freedom of design - only fittings (and there are usually only a few ways to fit a given ship properly) - confusing ship names instead of classes. (Quick! What&apos;s a Rapier class? A Tengu? A Prophecy? What&apos;s attacking you? Too late, you&apos;re dead).
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION: If you are a fan of the epic space opera genre and a hardcore strategy game fan you owe it to yourself to play EVE for a couple of months. It is worth the money. It is also a tantalizing look at things to come. Someday there is going to be a game on this scale (or larger) with much better game mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2508157">Expand</a></span>

Much of the learning curve has been leveled out, but it is still one of the highest in the industry.  You should know that this is a true SANDBOX.  You have to have to be a proactive person to enjoy the game.  You need to set goals for yourself.  Outside of a few overarching story lines, the content is pretty much up to you as a gamer.  I have had some great times playing, many times I was just doing something risky and ended up in the right place at the right time.
<br>
<br>This is a game where making friends is also a must.  Just like the MMOs of old, you will need friends to venture out of the safe areas of &quot;High Sec.&quot; (High Security)  You MIGHT get lucky, but most of the time, you will just get ganked by a rat (short for: pirate) who is &quot;gate camping&quot; (waiting at jump points frequently used by noobs to short cut a long journey).  There are two acronyms in EVE you will run into:
<br>
<br>NBSI (Not Blue, Shoot It) - Blue color tags represent allies or friends.  In other words shoot anyone you don&apos;t know.  (for fun, name your first few ships: 0000FF.  The HTML code for blue.  Having a ganker laugh may be all the time you need to get away)
<br>HTFU (Harden The [guess o.O] Up) - You need a thick skin to play the game.  It&apos;s not for the timid or solo player.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for an in the cockpit view, this is not the game.  There are a few new ones coming out that will scratch that itch.  This is has frequently, with good cause, been called Spreadsheet Wars.  This is an external view with simple 300-1000 poly count ships.  The skinning and tessellation have done WONDERS and it looks just like a recently released game, especially with the last update: Kronos.  It&apos;s keeping up with the times and after 11 years they have to be doing something right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5052033">Expand</a></span>

To say that it brings out the worst in people, well it&apos;s close, they&apos;re just being who they really are. So it&apos;s more like the perfect venue for them to act out in a way they can&apos;t in RL.
<br>I&apos;ve really tried to like the game and have gone through the trial and subbed twice but I&apos;ve regretted it both times. The Corporations (Guilds) in the game are the least friendly, least social people I have ever come across in any MMO in the last five years. I could go on....but I&apos;ll just leave it at this: Don&apos;t waste your time on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5665431">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&apos;t spoil even 0.1% of this game, because I didn&apos;t see any of it. Why? I didn&apos;t have six months to &apos;get into it&apos;. It&apos;s a brilliant escape from reality for those with social difficulties and a serious fondness for graphs.
<br>
<br>Odds are if you are reading this then you are probably less &apos;Call of Duty&apos; and more....well EVE Online than your average gamer, because the way the fans sell this game doesn&apos;t exactly make it sound thrilling, or even that interesting. What you are promised is some sort of &apos;real life, in space&apos; - where you can be a space trader....and sell minerals....and blow other people up whether they want to or not.
<br>
<br>I never saw the last bit, but I engaged in 25 solid hours of the mining and floating around bit. 25 hours over 14 days and let me tell you I didn&apos;t enjoy a single second of it. I was constantly waiting for this amazing fun to start that had people literally giving up on their real lives to live their space life, and it never came. A few reasons why I think -
<br>
<br>1. It is spreadsheets in space. It&apos;s a cliche, but it really is. It&apos;s impossible to be &apos;good&apos; at this game, what you can do is have spent a lot of time paying a monthly subscription, and thus have accumulated more numbers on your spreadsheet, this allows you to get loads of other numbers on other spreadsheets that others don&apos;t have.
<br>
<br>Visually, it&apos;s not rewarding. The reward comes from having bigger numbers on your spreadsheet, and using this to...grief other players?
<br>
<br>2. It takes TOO **** LONG. If someone told me I&apos;d have to 1) pay a monthly subscription and 2) could only level up by waiting real life, human hours in game or out, I would assume you were joking. They&apos;re not joking in reference to EVE, you are expected to wait MONTHS in order to be able to participate in anything like the game experience you will have heard fanboys talk about. You wont be brokering trade alliances, or griefing anyone. You&apos;ll be paying &#xA3;15 a month to click on asteroids, waiting for your skills to level up until you have some sense and quit.
<br>
<br>3. This is clearly a jerk-off for people who have already put in a few thousand hours. The people who enjoy this have already spent a few thousand hours making their spreadsheet the most comprehensive. They are the people who enjoy this. They have been playing this for 13 years. Unless they quit, and you start playing for 13 years you will never be as &apos;good&apos; as them, because they paid their subscription longer.
<br>
<br>Positives? The graphics are &apos;OK&apos;, the ships look good and sometimes the space scenery looks &apos;impressive&apos; but the visuals are repetitive to say the least.
<br>
<br>The crux of it is I don&apos;t want to meet the sort of person who can actually get into EVE, because I am terrified that someone so fond of spreadsheets might exist in the world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=6201801">Expand</a></span>

All the things you can do and see but you can get bored. Luckily that&apos;s only half the game, its also very much a social platform. I hate those posts where people say is awesome play it or its stupid don&apos;t without any explanation as this game needs it. So if I can do something about that I will. Research this game before you play it!!! This game has a lot to it. Sometimes too much for people to take in. But if a massive sandbox game is what you are after, then this is the game for you. Of course only if you can do one thing... Understand that you will die, you will lose in-game money and hours of time, and you will be frustrated. But if you come out of those experiences with understanding and knowledge then you are winning this game. If you do decide to play this game, do the tutorials. If you get confused, there are people in game who will help you. You can join chat channels where hundreds of people help newbies. and once you understand the basics. I would then recommend joining the recruitment channel and posting that you are a new player looking to get into the game. you will likely get swarmed with invites. try a few over a month. find a group of people you click with and find your niche in this game. But most important of all. Enjoy this game for what it is, a huge social sandbox where you lose big and you win big. there are ups and downs, but again if you don&apos;t let the losses hold you down, you will enjoy this game and probably spend years playing it with some new found friends from all over the world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=6498414">Expand</a></span>

As ever, a reader should discard any review of a multiplayer game where the reviewer has failed to play the game with other people. Lo and behold, most of the negative reviews on this game are from people who start out saying &quot;I spent a day figuring this game out&quot; or &quot;I couldn&apos;t get into it&quot; or &quot;who plays this piece of crap&quot; or &quot;I like the character creator herpderp&quot;. If you aren&apos;t willing to take the time to play a multiplayer game with multiple players, you&apos;ve never played it. That&apos;s rule number zero. Rule number one is increasing reward for increased risk. With EVE, this is true ingame and out. Risk more time and more resources, put yourself out there and meet new people and you may well be rewarded with endless fun and the best gaming experience there is -- or your name might be googlebombed if you try to become an internet celebrity like The Mittani did. Risk your ship and your ISK and you might make it big, or you might get ganked on the way there.  The trick is managing those risks. Rule number two: EVE can be modelled as one big series of prisoner&apos;s dilemmas. Is the chatty guy in local out to get you? At what point should you grab the loot accrued with your newfound friend and run? Are the people around you whom you have chosen to risk trusting going to take everything from you tomorrow, or while you sleep?
<br>
<br>Rule number three: specialize. Yes, there are people smarter than you who have been playing this game for almost a decade. Yes, you may never catch up to them. But skills work such that no one character has them all, and this is unlikely ever to happen as CCP grows the game. If you choose a niche or playstyle (do your research) and if you apply the resources to hand intelligently, and better yet if you team up with people you can trust, nothing can stand in your way. A corollary of this is specialist knowledge: don&apos;t hand out the tricks of your trade for free, or you won&apos;t be able to charge as much for them. And so, I leave the rest of the rules for you to discover. Here&apos;s a rubik&apos;s cube. Go **** yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2594872">Expand</a></span>

Going through the nightmare of right clicking through the ui is not something I consider to be &quot;fun&quot;. The game plays itself really. I liked most of the concepts of what there is to do. Maybe be a pirate/pvp, industrial(which is nothing more then grab some of this rock and sell it), and just grabbing random missions from agents back at a station. Now...i&apos;m not sure why you would want to pay so much for this game either...it boggles me. I might consider paying 3-5 dollars/mo. but 15/mo being the smallest obligation is kinda high. I&apos;m not a fan of &quot;i&apos;ll sit and wait&quot; type crap. To warp, I click a few things and wait....I click a few buttons to mine, now I wait....I bring ore back by clicking &quot;warp to station&quot; and want to refine/make items(if you have blueprints) and now you have junk that gives ISK(the currency of EVE) Corperations(guilds, clans, etc) are something you can join so that you have a group of helpful people to play with. Makes it a MMO. No point in it being that otherwise. Lets add people to the mix to help/interfere with the game. Which the game falls short due to the things to do, no major roles in corperations. Now I didn&apos;t play for a really long time, maybe that wasn&apos;t enough to find out more or appreciate the game more like others, but when I play a game, I would think spending 10 hours plus might give you enough of a reward to want to keep playing(in other words, spend more money) When you play a MMO or RPG, you want to come back to it because you loved the story, or now you have a role in the mmo world. EVE doesn&apos;t feel that way at first. After learning the basics so that you can even start to play, you really don&apos;t have much there that helps coax you into going further. It feels like a dead end almost. I started to get going but found out after going down the industrial path, I need someone else to help me mine. I can do it alone, but it takes forever. Not much reward after either. All in all this game needs to really revamp how it plays I would think. I want to &quot;play&quot;. Not que up a few things and let it play for me. Its all the same, combat/mining/traveling to other systems. Just not much there that keeps you yearning for more. Not a horrible game, just boring. Awesome concept, just shallow gameplay. Good looking ships and stations, but ships are the only stepping stones that would keep you going. Stations...no other real purpose except to act as safe zones and/or selling/buying points. If EVE can start to deliver the whole package that they talk about, I would play it more. As of now, and where we stand....it feels like a beta that is stretched out enough to try and be a game. Only to get you to pay so that they can hopefully someday deliver that promise that your sinking your money into. Lets hope that day comes sometime soon.<br><br><br>Just not enough to pay 15/mo in my opinion!!!!! 300,000 people at 15/mo=4,500,000.00 a month....wtf is taking so long for the &quot;EVE Promise&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1711839">Expand</a></span>

With the new updates the game is a totaly new beast, the size of the world alone is more than enough to get you into the game.  There is no level system it is all skill based,  If you love MMORPGs as much as me, take it from a true gamer, this is one of the beast ones out there.</span>

That, and trying to get even MORE used to this incredibly complicated and difficult to understand game. The character creation is kind of nice (sculpting is kind of hard to do, though, and you have very few options clothing wise), but the game is very laggy and system intensive, so I had some trouble making my character.

<br>Well, to top it all off, it has a monthly fee. Over 100 dollars a year. Reoccurring, too.

You definitely have to give this game a try, if you find it diffcult to learn is because is like nothing you have played so far, but that is not bad, just ask your questions on chat, grab a corporation and learn the ways of the game, it really worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2303253">Expand</a></span>

Various patches over the years and a whole graphics overhaul  have let eve survive where others have failed... it might not have the biggest online community, around 30-50000 players online usually, however the universe is very much alive, there is a tremendous amount of skills to train, and a  lot of information to take in, so it takes patience and dedication to truly get the best from EVE. Also with the upcoming &quot;Dust 514&quot; FPS on PS3 in the pipeline that ties in directly with the EVE Universe, this MMO is about to get bigger. Eve is not for everyone, but if you like ship to ship combat in a universe bigger than Pamela Anderson&apos;s cup size then give it a try.

Totally disgusted with WoW kind of games&quot;. After a bit of youtube watching I decided to try out this beautiful looking, breathtaking and very brain-promising space simulation ready to buy subscription.
<br>------
<br>After installation which also runs on MAC, I proceeded to character creation. &quot;Very detailed, very easy to use&quot; thought I with joy, taking care and time to perfection my in game myself. I can even get scarfs, even change lighting. What a beginning.
<br>------
<br>I read with interest information about the in game factions and carefully chose my bloodline. Ready.
<br>------
<br>&quot;I wish you see this. I am in a vast, huge futuristic station. It&apos;s far bigger anything you&apos;ve ever seen. Tutorial asks me to undock. Click. Now, I am actually flying in the space! I can zoom out and in totally, looking in every detail of my little ship. Or is it capsule? It&apos;s like an egg. Let me think why would it be shaped that way. Aerodynamics. Look at all these buttons around. I am sure all mean something and I am sure everything is there for a reason. Oh wait. I am flying.. ou, just straight towards a huge planet. It must be it&apos;s gravity pulling me down. Oh no, no.. how do I stop it? Oh... well.... I just flew trough planet.&quot;
<br>------
<br>My simulation expecations were shattered. My hopes for learning about science were shattered. My illusions for exploring and knowing the Universe were shattered.
<br>------
<br>Being let down, kept playing. My impression is going to improve. I learn a bits from tutorial. About ship equipment, wait, it reminds me a little bit of Wow gear or all other games, no, just coinsidance. About combat - you actually lock target and then press buttons and shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot. No, only coinsidance this game is about much more than that. It&apos;s not like the others. This game is made out of real players. Not any Npcs. Does it say agent? What does it do when I accept this mission? Oh. I have to fly somewhere, kill something and bring something back. No.. it&apos;s... did I use word coinsidance?
<br>------
<br>Ehm... I do like 25th tutorial missions. I kind of stopped reading it. Only clicking accept, then wrap to (it&apos;s flying around 5 light years in a second) then take or kill and then come back, then complete mission. No, surely NPC is not going to tell me how amazing I am whatsoever, or that I did something noone has done before.
<br>------
<br>Well.. it&apos;s like my 30hour of gameplay maybe and I... I feel like quitting. Or should I play another 1000 hours (people in Eve spent even 10.000 hours of pure gameplay) just to earn trillion or gear up or kill another player? Oh right, the original system such as this has its cost. You know, let me evaluate. In there, you have gun level 1. When you want gun level 2, you need money. To earn money you besically need to study a book. Wide one. When you get your gun level 2, you can kill player with gun level 1. Target him and ratatatatatatata shoot shoot shoot. And he actually detonates. I am not kidding.
<br>------
<br>Today, right decision was made. Low security part of the Universe, that was my brave destination. With warm and eager heart I set my autopilot and watched all these wallpapers on the screen that look like stars and planets. I might put one on my desktop. Finally arriving. Ratatatatatatatata bum. I am webbed I cannot escape. I scream out for my life for the pirates to let me be. They do not listen. They charge. After amazing and memorable 2seconds fight I explode. Still in my capsule. Bum bum bum, my capsule explodes and with last swearing I end up my final breath, my body falls upon indifferentness of the Universe. This is the end.
<br>------
<br>All of a sudden, i wake up in new, identical body. With all money, maybe even all skills having all ships I had in the dock. End of my story. Epic story. I heard EVE are submitting user stories? Will you help me to send them this one?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3966315">Expand</a></span>

Yes almost all my free time (now les because iam dad) Now back to the point. The game is growing slow but still growing. The implant the new 3D station walk Well a 1 room place but still this crappy bugged space game have become one of the best game out there. Why iam saying this because it is. This is a very hard game very very hard to master. Even with this new guild wiki and more you need to practice allot. Don`t forget every one that say this game sucks is because of  3 things. 1 boring 2 not his standerd game 3 dont like space games. Yes indeed there are bugs still here and still not fixs but the are working hard to make this game user friendly and thats indeed happening. Its is easier to learn and play when back in my time 10 years ago. Dont get me wrong here people but you need to get patience if you dont have that dont try it. Because the boring will get you faster than you can think about it. Also just try the 14 days and play the tutorial and stay at your general corps and read help chat and ask help. People will try to help you. Now if you dont like the game in this 14 days dont play it wait till to make it easier for you. Have fun pilot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1849289">Expand</a></span>

You will need months before you can do anything interesting, as the skill system is simply membership based. Want to specialize in something? Good. Plan your skills, wait a few months, and there you are! In the meantime feel free to get bored as much as you like. People tend to value what they invest time in, so this is a good marketing strategy, but a boring videogame. Want to fight? Target the enemy, turn on your weapons and start to orbit, wait for the game to do the rest. All other professions revolve around making more ingame money for the sake of it, and are even more boring and repetitive. After a while I realized that I didn&apos;t enjoy the game by itself, but what I was imagining while playing it, which is something I can do for free. True: after many months spent waiting for your skills to develop, you may buy a PLEX, ingame time other players bought with their irl money and sell for ingame currency (another proof that this game greatly rewards basement dwelling rich people), you just need to grind a few days for ingame money. You also need that money to buy ships and weapons tough, which basically means you&apos;re going to spend a lot of time grinding for money anyway, unless you open your wallet and start selling PLEXes yourself. This game succeeds in creating a complex fictional economy, and before a battle you need to spend time thinking about how to fit your ship, so if your idea of fun is seeing a big, fictional bank account grow, or meticulously planning your ship&apos;s equipment and then watch as the game plays with it, and you have a lot of time on your hands, then by all means play eve online. Otherwise, go play a decent game. One thing I want to add, as a physics student: THIS IS NOT A SPACE SIMULATOR, even if some people may say the contrary. There is no gravity, you can literally warp trough stars and planets, collisions deal no damage, no solar wind effects, and god help you if you find yourself maneuvering near any large object, hopefully this is going to take less than a few minutes. The game is really bad at plotting a course around obstacles, and you can&apos;t steer your ship, you can only point it towards another object. Nothing in the right direction to maneuver to? Too bad, come back in five minutes, maybe your super advanced ship managed to understand how to avoid a big static rock.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2309904">Expand</a></span>

Immersive world, great community, brilliant strategy, legendary graphics for a world of its size. Every aspect of the game draws you in if you survive the first 5 or so hours of elarning the basics (which I doubt many of the negative commenter&apos;s did). A game not for a 13 year old Runescape addict, but for a mature gamer ready to use their head to win a fight rather than having the bigger numbers necessarily. Take the time to learn the game before you judge it, until you see through the click interface to the makings of something that will only improve with time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2013576">Expand</a></span>

That mean that even after years you won&apos;t really be able to compete the game &quot;veterans&quot;. 4) Last but not least, i simply don&apos;t have any fun playing this game.

<br>All of you already read about open world, economy, interaction, alliances etc. Yes, this is EvE.
<br>The game is like another life.
<br>And what is very interesting - you can make studies of people behavior, economy, system performance etc. based on EvE &quot;virtual-real&quot; world.
<br>I started my adventure with EvE in 2009 and it is still my favourite title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3915092">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>i would say you could enjoy this game if you like something that is pretty much a part-time job, since you play this game to achieve and work toward something, which the 30k-50k people who log in daily apparently want to work and get something, that is what you are doing, working, its not relaxing whatsoever, unless working to get money and then bigger ships and then plotting to kill other ships with very complicated builds is your idea of relaxing. even so i love this game and im fine with working at it, since its awesome feeling for me to achieve something, barter with people, take others out. so yes play it if you want to work, AVOID at all costs if you want to relax. :)
<br>
<br>Update. i wasnt trying to put down the game, hence why i gave it a 10, its just extremely difficult and confusing to get things going and the fun about this game is by accomplishing something difficult and it requires alot of thought and concentration to get things done correctly, also lots of dependency on interacting with real players if you really want to do the most awesome stuff.
<br>
<br>so as far as playing a game to relax like skyrim or something where you explore and take in the sights, this is not like that, your in the world to gain more power, by money or fighting or something, so trying to get more power and become stronger and better is not the most relaxing thing to do right after work but i find this game when i have the time or money to play it very rewarding and fun, just not relaxing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4147841">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> When I saw the trailer of this game. I became very curious of what is this game all about. The first time I played this game I was amazed first with the character creation, then the very long yet very imformative tutorial. Up to the mining and joing a corporation. This game really rocks!!! I just love how CCP made the game.</span>

Which is the skills... The skill training is RADICALLY different, and i know i can say that with much, uncontroversial, confidence. people also say that this makes people pay more, or makes them stay and pay real money to learn skills for years. this is TOTALLY FALSE, in the fact that they are not trying to take your money. This MMO game is different in the way that you can buy TIME, with game money. The game allows you to buy PLEX on the game market to PAY FOR REAL TIME. MUST i say it again? You can but 30 days of game with game money! i have yet to encounter a popular MMO with a subscription to do this. the first thing that comes into my mind is WoW, this does not let you pay for time, but this is because it does not have the LONG TERM GAMEPLAY that EVE does. Lets say that two different people are just starting off playing both EVE, and WoW at the same time. The WoW player will have a fairly easy time in the beginning, go through the game get to level 80 and... well quit, or make a new character, THAT&apos;S IT? Yes WoW is FUN, for a period of time. EVE on the other had Makes it VERY HARD in the beginning, the LEARNING CURVE IS THAT OF A BABY TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT THE HYPOTHETICAL MULTIVERSE MODEL, WITH NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. i say that with great confidence because most people die right when they log on, because there brain is overflowed with how much you can do, and how challenging it can be AT FIRST. ( i like to show this with the learning curve graph located here: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3088/2335016192_6003c39c4c_z.jpg?zz=1 ). but when you do learn all there is to EVE it is amazing and fun. the long term gameplay for EVE online is overwhelming. That with its amazingly newb friendly, and amazing community of players and developers makes it, To me, one of the greatest MMORPG games ever developed, maintained, and played by thousands of players IN ONE CONTINUOUS UNIVERSE....10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158816">Expand</a></span>

<br>The &apos;place for noobs&apos; is (novice outpost), something like a dungeon where you have ship limit of tier 1 frigates. The problem is, Eve considers its ok to let 6y old players get inside too, with their +%dmg skills.
<br>Not sure why they failed to grasp the concept of having a place where noobs can fight noobs.
<br>I am not a fan of waiting 1 year so I can finally measure my real skills and knowledge of the mechanics against other players. The only way to win a fight and have fun with it, is if you bring a number of friends, which with a huge amount of strategy and coordination, can finally manage to one guy down.
<br>Ofc there are many ways to play this game. You can choose to transport stuff from one place to another and get cash. Or mine and get cash. Or kill npc-s and get cash. Or do missions and get cash. But these aren&apos;t any fun. They are as boring as any other game which supports farming of something. Actually the farming in Eve is terribly boring. Even killing of spiders in WoW is a lot more fun. And the last way to play that game is to go to 0.0 sec and be a part of corporation and its wars. What you&apos;ll be doing is camping their systems all day long, waiting for someone to show. You will be given a ship and told what to do. With your tight specialization. Since you wont be doing any dmg with miserable skills, you can pretty much just slow people down, disrupt their warp drives, repair other ships, jam their targeting or tracking. Only one of these at a time. And ofc you will be the first one to die. If CCP could manage to realize that this game needs at least 50x time reduction on skills (Currently you need at least 1 year to only max your frigate, which is the first ship class and there are 20 more). Sorry, but I dont have time to wait for it, nor the noob friends inside to help me out. My 10 friends which I play other games with, they don&apos;t want to join it too, because they have heard its retarded slow. And its true. Nevertheless, buy that game, play it, die all around the place, have fun. Its educational and a lot of things are very much fun. That free trial is made exactly for that, to recruit new victims for the bored old players which pay their game :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894707">Expand</a></span>

Note, many newcomers are often &quot;intimidated&quot; by the sheer size of EVE (with 5000+ solar systems and a motto that goes &quot;It&apos;s your life, do what you want&quot; I can understand it) but don&apos;t let that stop you. After I had finished my first two-week trial I had already earned about 12 million ISK (InterStellar Kredits or something like that, money for short), gotten a Tristan-class frigate, a Thorax-class cruiser and an Iteron-class transport vessel and I had already joined a corporation (compares to guilds and such in other MMORPGs). So as you can see, the trial is very rewarding if you just play 2-3 hours a day of it. EVE is well worth the money I&apos;m paying for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=690478">Expand</a></span>

You will love it if you love games where you can explore and make choices. It&apos;s a great Sci-Fi game that you won&apos;t regret playing if you learn it well. The community is also great. I got a lot of help there. There are plenty of staff on board to give you advice and help you. I don&apos;t think the learning curve being steep is enough to justify lowering this rating, because the fun you get afterwards is worthwhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4143307">Expand</a></span>

<br>after 6 hours or so of the game , i realize how simple it really is , there is alot more micro managment than there needs to be, but i love the difficulty, it means you will have something to do since achieving the top is so far away and endless, in wow you level 2 months later you stop playing, if you can earn your sub in wow like EVE, i think it would have given players something to do while we wait for expansions and updates, instead of just nothing to do because everyone is to casual.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4146652">Expand</a></span>

Of course, there&apos;s plenty of reward for those that can sit there all day too :) I really hope the community continues to grow, as I&apos;m interested to see where the developers will take it.

Definitely worth the investment, especiall now that you can get it for only $20 (with the first month of play free).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=673679">Expand</a></span>
