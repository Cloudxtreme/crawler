Year after year, OOTP Developments puts out a premier product. The scope of this game is amazing. You can manage teams from the Major Leagues through the minor leagues to international ball. I have had a blast playing this game. Highly recommended.</span>

If you&apos;re not familiar, you control all of the GM and Manager duties, and have the capability to manage the games real time if you&apos;re so inclined. You don&apos;t actually hit or pitch the ball, but if you&apos;re the type to pick up a console sports game and sim the games while acting as the GM you absolutely need to buy this game now.</span>

It&apos;s not an arcade title, but rather it puts you in the driver&apos;s seat of your favorite baseball franchise. Trade players, draft the next superstars, scout foreign countries, call all the shots from dugout, watch how your players develop in the minor leagues and play into the infinite future. The game comes with real players &amp; teams (full MLB 2014 Opening Day rosters plus complete minor leagues, and also 7 international leagues with real players / teams) and also every season in MLB history (1871-2013)  which you can replay or start your alternate history with. On top of that, you can create fictional leagues or combine any type of league in your own baseball universe. The possibilities are endless!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245428">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it can be like playing a spreadsheet, but there are times that&apos;s exactly what I want to do. (My 9 back to back championships in the European Baseball League with the Paris Blues attest to that fact.) OOTP 15 gets a lot of points for its baseball simulation, which is excellent. It immediately loses them because it crashes all the time! Literally more than any game I have ever seen, including ArmA 2 (which was a disaster at launch). Normally, my procedure is to start a fictional league and simulate a hundred years or so of history to give the league some &quot;meat&quot; (hall of fame players, records to break, historical dynasties, and so on). Typically, that takes a few hours. OOTP 15 seems to crash at least every three or four seasons, meaning that before I finally gave up it had taken me hours of running the thing to get from 1900 to 1930. I hate to say it, but until it&apos;s fixed, the game simply isn&apos;t worth its price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4254736">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you want a baseball video game like The Show or want to be the next Babe Ruth, both at bat and on the mound, this isn&apos;t the game for you.  This isn&apos;t for you to swing the bat or throw the pitch, this game is for the person who thinks he can be a major league manager or general manager.  Evaluate players, build your organization, set the strategy, make draft picks and trades to try to build your dynasty, cut the veteran when he his bat is more detrimental than his experience is a plus or promote that hot rookie straight from AA ball to the big leagues.  Again, this is a management sim and one of the best of it&apos;s kind regardless of the sport.
<br>
<br>Is it perfect? No but it is as close as any game can be.  The support from OOTPD is superb. They listen to their customers including adding features suggested in their forums.  They will work with you on any issues you have and with any game this complex there may be some issues.  When there is an issue found they work with you to get it fixed and issues patches when they are needed.
<br>
<br>This is the total package: Great responsive support and the ultimate Baseball Management Game.  I have been playing it since OOTP9 and every year it just gets better.
<br>
<br>If management simulation is what you are looking for then you have found it.  If you love Football Manager and either love baseball or want to learn about the game then OOTP15 is the next natural step for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/out-of-the-park-baseball-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4337972">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I have played every version since v1. OOTP 15 is another solid home run. My only complaint is the 3D Stadium Model is very much a first attempt and is not on par with the rest of the game. Having said that and based upon prior experience with the franchise I do like the concept and I think eventually (probably around 16 or 17) it should be very good.</span>
