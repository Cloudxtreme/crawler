This chapter however has one hard last level (out of 8) which will require some skill. If you buy this game, you won&apos;t buy it for the challenge or the game mechanic as it is already included in HoMM 3, but you buy it for the story, as the story is really good and is a part of the main hero: Tarnum&apos;s tale. If you only read the summary on wikipedia page, you won&apos;t get the whole things, there are more than that in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heroes-chronicles-warlords-of-the-wasteland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3991898">Expand</a></span>
