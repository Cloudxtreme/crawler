<br>It&apos;s difficult not to compare this to Metal Warriors for SNES, but that was the experience that I was looking for when buying this game.  I feel it was a step back mechanically from SNES.   Mainly the button mapping.  It&apos;s great that you want a retro feel and you allow button mapping, but we&apos;ve had 6 button controllers since the 90&apos;s.....you don&apos;t need to bind melee with shoot.  I would also like to have a seperate hold button for my fire arc rather than holding down my shoot button to do that, forcing me to time my jumps and movements with my gun&apos;s rate of fire.   This makes me feel like I have less control of my mech.
<br>Movement of this game is very slow.   You are walking everywhere.  Yes, Mechs are slow, but every game usually adds something to help out.  I am not always boosting up, can&apos;t I boost forward in the air (like the SNES)?  Or something like the &apos;skates&apos; from Heavy gear?  I have 8 more buttons on the 360 pad.  That won&apos;t happen, though, because the levels are very small and faster movement would reveal that.
<br>These problems could actually be ignored if the story were less boring.  But it&apos;s a Japanese game, and that&apos;s clear with the timer.....It&apos;s all about the score.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s good.  $6 is a fair price.  It was worth skipping a Starbucks coffee.
<br>
<br>+ It hits the retro feel without being cheesy about it.
<br>+ Good character design.
<br>+ decent weapon variety (6)
<br>
<br>- Sloooooow movement (not sluggish)
<br>- Music is alright, but nothing that I will be whistling on my way to work.
<br>- 6 actions tied to 4 buttons.
<br>- One mech, no customizing
<br>- Single Player
<br>
<br>If you are looking at this game and haven&apos;t played Metal Warriors, I also suggest finding a copy of that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gigantic-army/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879038">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you liked the old school arcade 2d scrollers you might like this, it&apos;s a bit like Metal Slug or Contra but with its own flavor, the robot is pretty slow but you can dash and you will need to master the jetpack too, in the end the most fun is with blowing enemies up, destroying mini bosses and huge bosses is also quite gratifying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gigantic-army/user-reviews?user_review_id=4650740">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, if you grew up playing games from 16 bit era, you&apos;ll enjoy Gigantic Army. This is pretty much a modern version of the old classics from the SNES, Genesis and Neo Geo. The controls are very good, the game is full of awesome bosses and the level of difficulty is decent. The doesn&apos;t have a save feature, so you&apos;re gonna have to beat in one go, just like the old days.
<br>
<br>And that means you&apos;re gonna die until you memorize the game and figure out the best strategies to beat. However, the game is not that hard. It took me about 2 hours to beat it on normal.
<br>
<br>Pretty good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gigantic-army/user-reviews?user_review_id=6112712">Expand</a></span>
