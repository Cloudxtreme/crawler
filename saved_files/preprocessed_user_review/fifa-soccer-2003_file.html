The thing that really separated this game from any other football game (TIF, PES etc.) is the fact that this really had atmosphere, and the graphics were not even matched until FIFA first appeared on the xbox 360, 4 years later. Quite simply one of the most classic games to have graced the PS2. Also, this game has such a great degree of control over the players, the user can truly feel the players&apos; movements. Many people have criticised the free kick system in the past, and true, you can score from the half-way line every time, but still, the system gave the player far better control over free kicks than ANY football game since. If there were to be any criticisms of this game, they would be that the player movement is somewhat clunky, and that the amount teams included in the game is quite low. These criticisms however are all against games on the market today, a full 8 years on, with FIFA 11 being the main game for comparison here. To conclude then, a clear classic, and if i was judging this game in 2003, then it would be a 9 or 9.5, but as it is, today, it will have to settle for an 8. A great game though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-2003/user-reviews?user_review_id=1525405">Expand</a></span>

Defence in this game is realy unreal and the way players wait for the passes to reach them inside the area is absurd. Also, the menus could be beter. Free kicks are mutch better now!</span>

My only complaint about this year&apos;s game is that it is very difficult to make headers in every occation, I hope this will be fixed in the 2004 game.
