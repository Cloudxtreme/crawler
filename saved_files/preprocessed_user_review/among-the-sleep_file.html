<br>
<br>Sound effects are done well and I request gamers to use headphones, when turning 2 years old again. It really adds to the overall ambience of the game, which is very scary.
<br>More than once have I been reminded of my earliest childhood memories and fears. It sometimes is, simply put, terrifying.
<br>
<br>Controls are o k a y. Nothing more.
<br>A bit clunky at times, it might go on your nerves, but it&apos;s nothing one would start hating the game over!
<br>
<br>The story, I haven&apos;t experienced yet, at least not to full extent, which is why I cannot really rate anything here. What I DO can say is this: from what I have seen up to now, the story is all right and fits perfectly into the rest of the &quot;set&quot;.
<br>If you bring the right &quot;setting&quot; for this game, I guarantee, you will have a lot of fun with it! And it mighgt give you shivers at times and remind you of the creeps you experienced, when you were a little child.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4271637">Expand</a></span>

And surprisingly my 120,000 subscribers agreed after they saw the playthrough or just played it themselves. Of course it all comes down to speculation and opinion but honestly I&apos;m shocked... angered to see this game with a 66 next to it. You give Call of Duty Advanced Warfare an 83? SSX received nearly a perfect score. Remember Far Cry 2? You gave that an 85 despite the entire gaming community showing up on that page to tell Metacritics how wrong they were. 168 positives, 75 mixed and 180 negatives says something guys.... WoW expansions get a safe 85 too... wait a minute, Metacritics you really like 85 don&apos;t you? Despite that score the WoW fans went on to say some of the expansions weren&apos;t all that great... and these are people who actually know the game and most have played since Vanilla WoW so obviously their knowledge on the subject surpasses critics who pick it up do a few raids than move on to their reviews.
<br>
<br>So why go so harsh on indie games and give the cookie cutter vanilla games that never change a damn thing showing other gaming companies &quot;hey if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it&quot; when the truth is... we should be rewarding games that actually try do something different. Games that take chances and go above the norm to bring something new to the table. No? Screw that we just want the same old stuff every time? It&apos;s really disappointing to see that coming from the people who are responsible for setting the example of what good games are. I got nothing against Far Cry, Call of Duty or WoW I&apos;ve actually played those games and enjoyed them. And don&apos;t bother saying CoD Advanced Warfare actually tried doing something different. They saw Titanfall, Destiny, Borderlands and Defiance then said &quot;okay people still like guns but futuristic stuff is what&apos;s popular now... let&apos;s copy that&quot; well fantastic. Hell even their little brother Treyarch covered that genre already with Black Ops 2. Personally I prefer Treyarch CoD but anyways.
<br>
<br>Among the Sleep didn&apos;t deserve that 85? Why? It didn&apos;t steal from Amnesia (The Dark Decent not the piggy one) by having inventory and sanity effects? It wasn&apos;t a long game? Maybe because it wasn&apos;t that scary? Is that what makes these games good? Amnesia was a masterpiece yes, but leave it alone. It was special in it&apos;s own regard. This game wasn&apos;t supposed to be all that. It wasn&apos;t even marketed as a really scary game, it was labelled more along the lines of dark and creepy. This was about the story, the immersion, the experience and the atmosphere. And in those aspects this game succeeded.
<br>
<br>This game has easily one of the most gripping story&apos;s I&apos;ve ever seen in a game. Oh sorry it didn&apos;t have a happily ever after cop out ending... sorry it made you think. Sorry this game actually tries to give the player something else to think about. While games are a way to escape reality, this game was about a toddler trying to escape his own. But when the game ends it pulls him back, saying imagination is alright but eventually we must face reality. I guess when a game reminds you of reality it becomes bad? Graphics... amazing. Level design... incredible. Imagery... among the best in gaming. Sound... beautiful. Story and atmosphere... you know what? I&apos;ll say it, that ending hit me harder than The Walking Dead did. I know I know... that&apos;s one of my favorite games of all time. I&apos;ve regarded Walking Dead to be one of the best games I&apos;ve ever played. Not saying this game out did TWD no no... but in a much shorter amount of time the game was able to make us care about the main character, the story.... we genuinely worried about the mother and most importantly we hoped nothing bad happened to that Teddy Bear.... or maybe that last one is just me but I loved that teddy.
<br>
<br>There are so many hidden things regarding this game. The monsters and what they really are... why they are portrayed in that way. Even the monster&apos;s mechanics explain the story. BUT I will not spoil this. Nope. This is like 6th Sense level of endings. It&apos;s a heavy spoiler... so heavy it will ruin the game. So no, I will just say play it. Metacritic... if you want people to take you seriously you&apos;ll reconsider that score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4878126">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>OTHER THOUGHTS: To be perfectly honest the game is lacking construction and it has a bit of a boring storyline, you make your way through what seems like the young girls dreams, where you tag along with your talking teddy bear to find your mothers memories. There are these black like figures that leark around her dream world and will follow and attack you if you get too close, the game can get very confusing at times making it difficult to figure out the direction you must go. The games ending is very strange and makes you feel like you have accomplished nothing, but overall, i enjoyed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4250330">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4240559"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Ever heard of the Courage the Cowardly Dog theory? Yeah. Let me begin by say that I am a huge, huge pansy when it comes to horror games. The &quot;helpless collector being chased&quot; genre of horrors games barely phases me, but I couldn&apos;t stand the first 45 minutes of Outlast without Alt-F4ing and never returning.
<br>
<br>This game is not scary, and I personally feel it shouldn&apos;t be marketed in the same way that a game like Amnesia or Slender is.  I would imagine the Oculus Rift would change my opinion, but I lack the change to pick one up. The best this game has to offer is being creepy. That unsettling, Tim Burton-esque taste lingers with this game. It is by no means outright disturbing, at any point; but with the right music, some twisted, foggy, uprooted trees and a splash of Dr. Seuss-tier surrealism, this game does an okay job of creeping you out.
<br>
<br>One thing to appreciate about the game is that it really is the &quot;horror&quot; game for everyone. It&apos;s entirely playable and completable to even the largest of wimps (me) and very consistent in it&apos;s spookiness every level. The only time I can really say my heart sank was an instance where I hadn&apos;t realized I was being chased (due to my headphones rear speakers failing to function) and was grabbed and and forced to stare into the black void with eyes that is this game&apos;s monster. It&apos;s a cheap scare, something Slender can do just as well as this game, but with this game it&apos;s a rare occurrence and not the main gimmick.
<br>
<br>The game is composed of four very short separate levels after the &quot;intro&quot; where the game takes place in your real house and not some kindergarten MC Escher painting. The levels all carry the same pseudo-surrealist vibe in that it&apos;s comprised of mainly just a bunch of doors all over the walls, misshapen rooms and enlarged or upside-down objects; nothing too unique.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll find that after the initial house level, the fact that you&apos;re a baby becomes completely irrelevant because the worlds you explore after your house don&apos;t seem to have any concrete reference of size. Some settings are much too grand and large for anyone, some are fit to make your 3-feet tall self feel like an adult.
<br>
<br>The first level or &quot;intro&quot; was the most interesting part of the game for me, and it only lasts 15-30 minutes. You, the player, are quickly introduced to your baby character&apos;s best friend, a teddy bear, in a most unsettling way, followed by him saying some very unsettling things. He turns out to have no mal intent, surprisingly, because what he says initially suggest otherwise. Other than nonsensically being your source of light, your teddy bear has no real use, is the only talking character for the majority of the game, but hardly ever talks. His soothing and inquisitive voice provides relief at times, but he stays dormant for the most part unfortunately.
<br>
<br>The fourth level was very disappointing to me, but still respectable. (minor spoilers ahead, but I won&apos;t reveal the actual ending) It&apos;s a five-minute walkthrough of your daylit home, cramming the unexpected twist ending into a small fraction of the game&apos;s wopping hour and thirty minute story. The twist had my mouth agape for a minute, but I had my suspicions from the very beginning of the game. There are clues strewn throughout the game that people with functioning brains such as myself and most other people that played the game can easily put together to form big hints as to what the twist may be. Like, seriously, they&apos;re huge.
<br>
<br>(MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD) For example, a drawing that can be found, clearly scribbled by a child of your age, depicts the scary female monster of the game teasing a depiction of a baby with an elephant toy. Some 20 minutes later you complete a level by stumbling upon one of your own memories, basically a 3D flashback, and it&apos;s a depiction your mother teasing you with an elephant toy. Put &apos;em together folks, and you get your uber deep hamfisted twist 40 minutes before the game is even over.(SPOILER OVER)
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth playing mainly because it takes so little of your time, and maybe you&apos;ll put a thing or two together and just appreciate it as a short story that could only be truly told in the form of a video game. It&apos;s like a spooky, darker Gone Home that doesn&apos;t suck and isn&apos;t bogged down by sluggish controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4240559">Expand</a></span>

When i was browsing Steam for myself she saw the image with the kid in pyjamas and his teddy bear and recently she asked me about it. I had zero clues what game she wanted to see me playing, even went googling stuff like &quot;game with kid in pyjamas&quot;. By coincidence, a good friend of mine from Norway was playing this and he told me how much he loves it. When i went on the store page i have realised this was the game my kid wanted. I didn&apos;t want to buy it at first, wanted to check if it is a proper game to present to children, but meanwhile my friend asked me to check my mail (he gifted it to me). Anyway i went into it right away and i was amazed by the beauty of this concept. The game is creepy, but at the same time, you realise you are seeing it through the perception of a little kid at the age from which we don&apos;t really remember anything. (at least i don&apos;t) so it stimulates your curiosity. I only got to chapter 3 so far, i have played it with my kids on my shoulders and because they had to go to sleep, they made me promise that i will not continue one single bit without them witnessing it. The game is a jewel, a work of art. It is a product that delivers satisfaction. I totally recommend it. Looking forward to seeing more games like this one. Good job, Krillbite Studio!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4302699">Expand</a></span>

Some of the early sequences are a little bland,  but man... Does the game and tone  really  come alive throughout.
<br>Design 10/10. Great yet simple puzzles / fetching abound, however everything you&apos;re doing has  a point, and the symbolism behind the whole story isn&apos;t in your face, but subtle, there, and does  A  LOT for  the  game if  you take your  time and soak  it in.
<br>Story: 10/10  Once  again the imagery helps tell  the story of what is going  on.
<br>Ending 9:10 I wasn&apos;t  necessarily expecting what happened  and  the  feelings that I had. It felt  like the whole game was  building up towards this moment, and taking in the visual queues before it didn&apos;t leave me  any less slack jawed.
<br>Length: The one  area that I&apos;ll  rate down. 6/10. Everything about this game is amazing,  from the budget that the  team worked with, their passion for the game, and design of levels / items / story. The only thing I wish is  that when it seemed like the feels were hitting home, it was over :(
<br>
<br>Overall a great  game and way to spend 2 1/2 - 3hrs. Take your time and  appreciate the  ride,  journey, and attention  to detail  that  this team has put into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4239319">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s too short for the price tag and there isn&apos;t much replay value as I don&apos;t think any of the game is procedurally generator. Worth a play through definitely, but I would wait for the price to come down. Also, where the hell is chapter 5? It skips from 4 to 6?</span>

The story in the game is interesting, but it&apos;s presented in very non involving way. The interaction and gameplay is minimal and not very engaging. I wish they made several interesting story driven puzzles in the game to make it more engaging and interesting. I guess everything depends on the budget. These games have been in development in several years and it is kind of disappointing that it didn&apos;t deliver better product. The game doesn&apos;t last for long, which is kind of a good thing, but at the same time it is kind of disappointing. I guess it had something to do with its lack of interesting stuff to do in the game, with it minimal gameplay. All you can do is crawl and walk, and interact with some furniture&#x2019;s on the basic level, like climb up on the chairs or open draws to climb up higher, push some buttons and some similar stuff. You can also use your teddy bear as a light source. This game had a potential to be really great, but, in the end, it didn&apos;t quite make it. Would I recommend it to anybody? On the rainy dark and grey day will this game perhaps be interesting to check out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4250473">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are good for a cheap production, and it is a little eerie for the first 30 minutes, but once the game really starts it just looks too colorful and bubbly to be scary, and the teddy bear is just annoying.  There are hardly any real puzzles and he pretty much tells you what you need to do for all of them.  It isn&apos;t hard to figure out what exactly is going on in the game.  The ending was no surprise, and in fact it felt very cheap and tacked-on compared to how I imagined it ending.  I thought it would be much more compelling.
<br>A far better game (in story, graphics and game play) along the same lines thematically is Papo &amp; Yo.
<br>But if you&apos;re looking for a creepy horror experience with pretty much the same level of &quot;puzzles&quot; as this game (i.e. nonexistent), Outlast is a far better option.  This is more of a horror game for an 8-year-old.
<br>I must say I did enjoy the first-person view much more than usually being able to see arms and legs.  But Outlast has that too and also does that many times better.
<br>It is a novel concept, but it just doesn&apos;t have the story or game play to back it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4255503">Expand</a></span>

There are some creepy scripted scares (one involving a woman by a well comes to mind), a few easter eggs to find, and some genuinely frightening sequences a la &quot;Amnesia: The Dark Descent.&quot; Yet, for a game this short, I can&apos;t help but feel these are too few and far apart (not to mention largely ineffectual during repeated play-throughs). Thankfully, in between the scares are some nifty set pieces and interesting level designs to keep interesting. I also have to tip my hat to the sound team at Krillbite; they must love making people squirm because, by the end of the game, every creaky floorboard, every rusted hinge, every strange noise will make the game&apos;s peaking mechanic essential. It&apos;s no doubt the most immersive part of the game. All in all, I&apos;d recommend this game to survival horror aficionados, but with some reservations; the story is weak and mostly uninvolving (though they deserve credit for focusing on the abstractness of the theme), glitches cause some puzzles to be unsolvable (a simple &quot;Load Last Checkpoint&quot; always fixed that), and the graphics leave one wanting.  The length and actual amount of scares, also, are disappointing, but it&apos;s nice to see a different approach to this genre that doesn&apos;t include buckets of blood and torn limbs (excluding stuffed animal limbs). I&apos;d certainly keep my eyes on the developers. They have plenty of talent and, having gotten to know them through the Kickstarter campaign, are extremely nice people who really deserve your support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4235159">Expand</a></span>

I say it&apos;s about the type of psychological horror Among the Sleep brings to the table. This masterpiece truly brings the player into the world of a toddler, dealing with certain events through the eyes of one. The ending is truly breath-taking and moving. Some say it brings them to tears, some say they can relate to it. The game&apos;s level design and graphics are outstanding and the sound effects and music is chilling. The overall gameplay is smooth, with a few minor bugs here and there. I 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a different horror game. One that truly messes with your head.
<br>
<br>PROS: Good graphics, great sound effects and music, smooth game play, immersing, great game feel, excellent ending.
<br>
<br>CONS: A bit expensive on steam. Minor graphical glitches, audio might cut out a few times, and the biggest complaint from players is length. The game is about 3 hours long if not rushed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4242926">Expand</a></span>

There are many &quot;indie&quot; horror titles on the PC platform as of late, and many of them aren&apos;t very good, but Among The Sleep manages to trump most of them...although just barely.
<br>
<br>The idea of playing a two-year-old is pretty unique, and handled well enough. The environments in Among The Sleep range from colorful to washed out, and just like inside a child&apos;s mind- everything can turn from happy-go-lucky to extreme horror in an instant. Levels often go from seeming harmless rudimentary puzzle solving to running for your life and hiding in an instant, and encounters with the game&apos;s creepy surrealistic environments and enemies is eerie and entertaining.
<br>
<br>But, for every good aspect of Among the Sleep, there&apos;s a troubling one as well. The level design is interesting, but the puzzle solving is cheap. The enemies are freaky but there are few times when you&apos;re actually in danger. The game strings you along at a good pace, but the experience is too short overall...these are just a couple of problems with the game.
<br>
<br>Add to that several unforgivable progress blocking bugs that many people have run into...and overall Among the Sleep feels like it was rushed along a bit too much. Even the ending feels pretty phoned in, and the build up to what could have been an emotional and poignant resolution just kind of dies immediately and forgettable.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think it&apos;s a good horror title...but it needed some extra attention before being released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4239645">Expand</a></span>

Game is overall brilliant and I have had so much fun playing it so far! the levels are very well detailed sadly the game is a lot shorter than I expected... but I still say it&apos;s worth the money :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4241421">Expand</a></span>

<br>The most enjoyable nightmare you&#x2019;ll ever have
<br>Among The Sleep is an Adventure horror game where you play as a toddler.
<br>The story starts on your birthday and you&#x2019;re given a teddy bear as a gift, the rest of the story you and your new friend take an adventure through the developing mind and imagination of a toddler growing up in a broken home.
<br>If you grew up watching rugrats or remember being terrified of silly things as a child, you&#x2019;ll really appreciate the thought that went into the design of this game as a whole.
<br>The Closets are deep and mysterious, plants are like a forest, you&#x2019;ll go through caves, creepy playgrounds, the basement, the game does a wonderful job at keeping you tense and anxious even if you stop yourself to make sense of your surroundings,
<br>much like when you were little it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you keep telling yourself it&#x2019;s just a coat on a rack, its dark and spooky, and you&#x2019;re not about to get out of your bed to test your theory.
<br>A monster might grab your feet on the way there.
<br>But if you get scared, all you have to do is hug your teddy.
<br>When you hug him he&#x2019;ll light the area a little bit to make it easier to see.
<br>You can either walk or crawl in this game, and you can pick up items, pull items, and climb them. The gameplay consists of very easy problem solving like collecting 6 owls to weight down a sea saw/ teeter totter, or collecting a needed key for a lock, halfway through this 4 hour game if you take your time to explore and collect the drawings, you&#x2019;ll start to notice a survival horror type creature that if it catches you you get a continue screen.
<br>These moments can be terrifying.
<br>All you can do is hide and sneak around it.
<br>Among The Sleep is more about its overall experience than it is it&#x2019;s actually gameplay and that isn&#x2019;t bad at all.
<br>The story is deep, the level design and immersion is near perfect.
<br>The friendship between you and your teddy is magical, and the horror elements are terrifying towards the end of the game, even after the pieces of the story all fall together.
<br>If you haven&#x2019;t got enough of the story by time the credits roll, the console version of this game comes with the prologue dlc.
<br>If you&#x2019;re not a trophy hunter you&#x2019;ll likely miss it, because it&#x2019;s buried in the chapter select, so make sure you play it, it will add about 30 minutes to your play time with equal quality of the main game.
<br>All in all there&#x2019;s magic here, and you owe it to yourself to experience this game.
<br>
<br>For what it is
<br>Adventure Horror Game
<br>9/10
<br>overall:

<br>If you like horror and &apos;outside-the-box&apos; games, buy it!
<br>
<br>What can I add after finishing the game? Around the half I started getting afraid that it would turn into yet another &apos;collect 3 puzzles to unlock all 3 passages and off you go&apos; kind of game. Fortunately I was wrong. It eased on that to focus on psyche later on. All in all a great thrill ride! It took me over 5 hours to finish the game (without getting lost).
<br>
<br>The only cons I&apos;ve found are poor quality assets from time to time. Sub-par models and textures in the outdoor levels, some missing sounds (from interactive objects) and terribly looped sounds (washing machine). Lack of positional audio (binaural, HRTF etc.) is also a downside.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 8/10
<br>Audio: 7/10
<br>Overall: 8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4566403">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the originality and the concept of being a 2 year old. On so many levels this game reminded me of one of my all time favorites Sanitarium.  As the kind of person who usually plays horror games in the dark with headphones on, I can truly say there have been a few terrifying moments. Like so many indie games out there with very little game time I do admit it is kind of overpriced. At 10$ it would be the perfect game to play for an evening or two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6094171">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It MUST be said that i only played around 1 hour of it - so this is more a &quot;first look&quot; review. However - during this 1st hour, the game committed a cardinal sin from my point of view - it was boring. I caught myself asking myself why i was playing - and if there wasn t something better to do with my time.
<br>
<br>I categorize this game as an &quot;adventure&quot; - so i put the story before everything else in this case. When it comes to the story, i do not really make many compromises &quot;just because it is an indie game&quot;. I can live with a weaker fidelity, maybe a bad UI or clunky controls when it is from an indie developer, but in terms of story, i expect 100% - and i did not get into it.
<br>
<br>again - it is likely my own fault in case the game caught on later - as many adventures ( or stories for that matter ) do.
<br>
<br>What is left is a very nice idea that simply did not work for me. - a highly subjective 5/10 from me. but other adventures have done a better job immersing the player from the very start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4348555">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a little bit scary. Trying to avoid the monsters did freak me out a bit. It does a good job of making you feel small in a big world.
<br>
<br>I like how unique the game is seeing everything through the eyes of a infant.
<br>
<br>This game is definitely worth playing, it was interesting and fun mostly.
<br>
<br>6/10 I rate it as ok as it&apos;s a bit too short taking me just over 4 hours to complete as I did not rush and I got lost a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6039469">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere in the game is amazing. The sounds you hear and the things you see keep you on edge for the entirety of the game. There&apos;s so much tension that even the slightest move can scare you. (I screamed when a chair moved.) The story can be a little hard to understand, but once you understand it it is extremely moving and tear-jerking. The graphics and music are phenomenal. You really feel as if you are in the nightmare world that the game has you exploring. Overall, Among the Sleep is one of the best indie games I have ever played, and I highly recommend it to fans of horror.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872891">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For an indie game, it&apos;s is almost one of the best of its kind. One thing being the good 3D graphics, despite the texture quality being a little bit on the low side, losing its 1 point. The game play keeps you on the edge of your seat as a baby having to deal with its mom disappearing due to a metaphorical storyline, making you ponder about all the possibilities. Leading to a climactic ending to which no one could have expected! The puzzles may be simplistic, but only adds to the realism that the main protagonist&apos;s mind is still developing as a young baby. Can&apos;t say that the game itself is very long, but it&apos;s a game you can play over and over and not get tired of the grim storyline and climactic events.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6330385">Expand</a></span>

<br>2) Those who expected AAA Crysis-ish graphics. Sure it doesn&apos;t have some kind of ultra-realistic VR graphics, but the graphics are more than decent and not an issue for immersion.
<br>3) Those who found the game too short. Indeed I finished it in less than 5 hours.
<br>
<br>Overall a good game. Wouldn&apos;t buy at retail price ($15), but okay on sale around $6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/among-the-sleep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6910621">Expand</a></span>
