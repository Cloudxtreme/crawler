Before even thinking of commenting on how a racing game handles play it on a Logitech G25 and on the Simulation settings. I laugh at these idiots complaining how bad the physics and handling is when they are playing it with WASD or arrows. Second of all, this game is only 1 in 3 NFS games coming out for real systems. The other 2 is a free run game set in Carbon and Most Wanted and is only online where you have a sandbox mode and play with people around the world. The other game is a tuner game made by Criteron. So obviously this game is made to please the semi-arcade gamers. IMO, this game is very enjoyable when played wiht a simulation spec wheel and there is nothing better than going round the &apos;Ring in a Zonda R, as this game does perfectly. Please wait until the other NFS come before complaining that its not like MW or Underground.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85258">Expand</a></span>

Cars are incredibly detailed. The dashboards are incredible. I could play on very high detail with 16x AF and 2x AA and it was really fluid except on some rare occasion when you&apos;d have 8-10 cars bumping on each other in a curve. It&apos;s really not serious however. The controls are really advanced. If you play with a gamepad, you really can&apos;t use experience steering. I did it for half of the game. It works but it&apos;s really frustrating and I don&apos;t recommend it. Playing on normal with adjusted deadzones and sensibility, it started to shine. All the curves were tricky and rewarding but not frustrating. AI is tough. I&apos;m playing at medium and I&apos;m regularly beaten. You can&apos;t really win without going a bit on the risky side. I guess it could be easier if I bumbed other cars more but I don&apos;t find it as fun as going for precision and working my way up by making perfect corners. The game XP system is rewarding. Making perfect corner (following the help line while not touching another car or grass and by following speed guideline) marked the curve as Mastered. If you master all the curves of a track, you get a kind of achievement. Great stuff. I also like that you get point when you cleanly pass someone. If you trade paint, you&apos;ll also get points however so.. whatever happen, you never feel screwed. Always finish race because even if you loose, you&apos;ll get XP for the track. So it&apos;s still great stuff. You can also concentrate to master curve for example. The physic can be a bit screwed up however. It&apos;s easy to completely lift another car in the air by just going for his back-side. It&apos;s a bit weird and when it happen, cars looks like toys. When you crash in a wall or take a car from the side, it looks perfect however. You get AWESOME feedback with blur and the screen desaturate. You really get confused youself and seriously.. crashing hurts. It&apos;s so good in fact that I hope to see more game do that. The driver animations inside the car are awesome too. When taking a rough turn, you see the driver really holding the wheel hard and going with all his strength. You can almost feel the Gs yourself. To me, it&apos;s more technical than GRID by far. Grid had more arcade feel, even if it&apos;s awesomely rewarding too. In Grid, I can absently do a track and win. In NFS, you can&apos;t. You have to really focus on the track and put a little somehting that&apos;ll make a difference. Tracks are beautiful. Some curves are really tricky and the line help really had to the driving experience. I haven&apos;t finish the game yet but I&apos;m on Tier 3 now. What I didn&apos;t like was that the tracks were often only 2 laps. It makes things really short and if you don&apos;t go aggressive from the very beginning, you just can&apos;t win. I would have prefered 4 laps or something like that. I&apos;ll have to see if I can change that for career. I know you can in Quick Race however. You seem REALLY limited in term of racing type. You get Racing, Drift, Battles, Time Attack. I liked Grid Drift FreeStyle and the Togue. Time attack just feel exactly like Races but lap-time count instead of race time. Battles are even less fun. While technical, it feel a bit plain to me and if you crash, there seem to be an elastic logic where the AI will go less fast. I didn&apos;t like it. The game is still worth trying however, really. I don&apos;t call it a definitive buy but if you&apos;re looking for a new racing game and are interested by racing simulation, I&apos;d take this. You&apos;ll get challenged by every corners! If you prefer a more arcade feel, take GRID. Drift is REALLY tricky. I only tried it on experienced handling. I&apos;ll have to try again. It took me a long time to even get the race and I never did one cleanly. Definitely more technical. 8.7/10 ATI HD4870, Intel E8400, 4GB of RAM and Win7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85632">Expand</a></span>

While during the time of NFS the first and NFS SE my TT rankings were on a hair length from the world record without having to dedicate one bedroom for a formula 1 cockpit Fair play, playability (Sidewinder 3d pro) and days of training motivated by an unrivaled sense of immersion of open road driving supercar feeling NFS Shift lets down quickly. Driving skills need to be maintained. You really thinks that after 15 years you can still handle a super car? + Graphics they are very ok especially in motion + Sounds of engines: lovely + Sense of speed + We can buy some upgrades -Drifting occurs at slow speeds on roads that are wide as a highway (I hereby thank 89 Audi 80 Turbodiesel with Econo 175 width tires for saving my life many times at high speed 90km / hr corners) -Learning curve by fake realism -Tuning controls can be a pain (unlike Grid, you have to quit your race to fine tune sensitivity, dead point etc,... Crazy) -No damage model, no punishment, no total loss. (apart from the hood obstructing your view) -because of no damage model you can skillfully use other cars as means of braking -because lacking damage model results in lack of tension and educational value like in Toca 3 (cars are supposed to be higly vulnarable to impact / abuse just like the humans they contain) Despite the renewed realism touch, NFS Shift&apos;s damage model is so bad it compares to playing a FPS in god mode. I can reassure those of you preferring the god mode racing that the all times standard view where you &quot;control&quot; the care by floating in the air 10m behind your car is still available (tradition dating from the times that rendering a cockpit was technically impossible.) Missed chance. I see no evolution here so I can only conclude this game is aimed at the next army of teenagers that plays their first likewise racer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85616">Expand</a></span>

The cars are beautifully modeled and unlike most people say the handling isn&apos;t that bad, hell I&apos;m surprised I&apos;m able to play it properly just with the keyboard. The tracks detail is rather average but sound quality is very good. Shift does indeed have its problems but as a gamer I&apos;m able to go beyond those problems and found myself addicted to the game. The level of car costumization is reasonable and the paint tool alows the players to express their creativity on the cars paint job. I believe the game is rather good overall and hope EA continues to improve the Shift franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=737787">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t know if I wanted to buy this at first but after playing the demo, I&apos;m going to buy it right now! Play the demo and see for yourself.</span>

Sure there are no new ideas, but when you have fallen so far, you go back with what you know works. I voted 10 cause readers are morons. No replays? all you do is slide? clearly you have something configured wrong or badly. Not the games fault.</span>

This game might not be the most realistic racing game out there, but it sure is a lot of fun playing. And after all that&apos;s the only thing that counts.

All I can say from my experience is, that with a good racing wheel (using the thrustmaster rgt) and a bit setting-customizing the games handling (even with aids completely turned off) is in no way unplayable. Its challenging, yes. But please come on: get a grip all you cowards.</span>

It&apos;s more fun than Forza or Turismo, and more realistic than GRID or DIRT. It runs perfectly smoothly on my 1.5-year-old system. The game can be played as either a simulation racer or an arcade racer as the handling mode can be adjusted to suit professional simulation down to beginner arcade mode driving assists, and the AI can be changed in difficulty. A lot of people who are complaining about the handling simply don&apos;t know how to drive with the added realism and should probably just decrease the handling mode, decrease the AI difficulty, and increase the number of driving assists used.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=84857">Expand</a></span>

Playability issues are the main problem, but the moderators have suddenly disappeared when SHIFT came out... wonder why? If you need a racing game now, get Dirt 2 for xbox360 or ps3. I&apos;d avoid this game at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85076">Expand</a></span>

It would seem the highlights of EA&apos;s franchise is underground 2 which, ok wasn&apos;t THAT realistic compared to simbins games (gtr 1+2, gt legends and RACE) or to codemasters grid, but it was fun to play, gave you a fair amount of a challenge and didn&apos;t pretend to be anything that it wasn&apos;t, a true simulator. OK the graphics might be pretty but that&apos;s the only thing good i can say about it and to be honest when your immersed in a game you kinda forget all the sparkling polygons flying by because your concentrating and having fun. So my advice would be leave this drissmal game on the shelf, save 15 or 20 quid and go buy GRID, Dirt or a simbim game, i guess the next racing game to look forward to is codemasters f1 2009 game, and unlike EA, codemasters don&apos;t continually let you down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=86222">Expand</a></span>

The cars handle like shopping trolleys whether you&apos;re using a steering wheel or a gamepad, whether you have all the assists on or off, it&apos;s makes absolutely zero difference to whether your car handles like it&apos;s supposed to. I am constantly wrestling with every car, some may say this is how a simulation is supposed to be... all lies. a simulation is supposed to be realistic. This game however, is not; even as an arcade racer, it just isn&apos;t fun to play. If there was ever a case where the high-profile reviewers were allured by EA, this is it. Shocking game, if you want to buy a decent racing game until F1 2010 comes out, may I suggest Grid, GTR2 or Dirt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85705">Expand</a></span>

It try&apos;s to be semi realistic, yes maybe the cockpits are kind of there, however, the handling of the cars is rediculous. utterly brainless. The graphics are too. Lots of nice flashy rubbish, which doesnt represent anything close to even semi realism. Its all very tacky. oh so tacky.. its even tackier than the underground series. It feels more like a meeting in a car park with your suped up corsa than any other nfs game. The controls are also really really bad... I tried and failed to get any kind of feeling of the cars with my logitech g25. The sensitivity is all over the place, and the same goes with the deadzone, no matter how hard i try to mess around with the settings, its either way too sensitive or i not at all.. Some of the reviews ive read are laughable, 9.0&apos;s and 80%+ haha, it almost makes me wonder if they are paying the magazines/reviewers to give it an obviously fake score... This was the nail in the coffin for nfs. once an amazing cop chasing/robber chasing thrill ride, to a local meet up at tesco&apos;s car park with a few chavs, who have the brainpower of 0. what a joke....(although the gfx are nice :P ).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85494">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a complete and utter mess. There is a massive stickied complaint thread over at EA: Shift Technical forum from those using AMD hardware. Issues are but not limited to stutter, microstutter (with single video card with high FPS), pausing, warping, and lower then expected frame rates regardless of resolution with reduced IQ settings. Some tracks simply crash/loop or have black sky boxes. Other reported server input lag or the game simply doesn&apos;t work at all. The majority of complaints seem to come from those with Radeon video cards and/or using AMD CPUs. Some nvidia users are not immune to this but they are the exception not the rule. Some believe that the issue is the use of CPU physx. PC Game Hardware states that physx is used in this game for low level calculation, etc. As for the actual game play the AI is horrendous. They play as if you are online against users who are playing a racing game for the 1st time. That&apos;s the best description I can provide you. You have AI rammers, AI who slow down for no reason, will block you from passing, etc. There is an unnatural oversteer to cars that are upgraded. Or the car would unnaturally slide around mild corners at lower speeds. The tuning aspect of this game isn&apos;t working properly were under/over steer sliders may have been switched. Also some reported having to restart a race more then once to get their tuned settings to work with that vehicle. I can go on and on about this game but it&apos;s obvious wasn&apos;t ready to be released. The only truth to this game is that it has a higher poly count then Grid. This is using the original released version using the 1st patch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85138">Expand</a></span>

As soon as you hit 60MPH it feels like somebody has replaced your suspension with pogo sticks the cars cant even drive in a straight line without losing control. This has to be one of the worst driving games on handling and physics since the PS1 days and i have played loads of Driving games since then. If you want a Sim get Race07 GTR or Forza if you want Arcade get GRID until something else comes along that honestly is better. All i can say is roll on forza 3 good times to come :) avoid this EA lack of creativity garbage EA big boys are killing the industry by eating up all the little boys they are killing the imagination that came from the numerous small guys that used to be out there how long are we the consumer going to put up with this and this trend that has been happening since the beginning of this decade. slightly mad studios is about the most appropriate name i could come up for the developers you have to be mad if you think this absolute s**t is going to compete with Forza, Grid, Colin Mcrae and dare i say the evil PS3 Gran Turismo (lol) all these titles leave you standing eating their brake dust if you had any sense of decency you should call in a product recall redevelop this tripe and refund all the mugs like myself that believed the paid of reviewers and the well presented ad campaigns. (i did give it a fair attempt of 2 days of frustration i cant take no more after upgrading my RX8 to max spec it still handles like a robin reliant with two fat ladies sat in the back).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85212">Expand</a></span>

Even if they get to patching it, they surely have blown the Christmas season by letting this out in such a state. I&apos;m returning mine and getting another copy of RFactor instead. Just mind-boggling how poor the final product turned out.</span>

Seen what they are? They&apos;re not Sim games and never will be as long as EA is publishing. However, this game is probably the most fun I&apos;ve had with NFS since Underground 2. I enjoy the sim style mixed with arcade options. Playing this with anything less than an analog gamepad is just asking for a headache. You NEED analog shoulder buttons for gas and brake or you&apos;ll never drive properly in this game. Graphics are fantastic, and the sense of speed is great (although the blurring of the gauges is kinda funky). Sounds are top notch, if you have 5.1 speakers you&apos;ll want to crank them. Cars can be a bit touchy if you don&apos;t play with the control settings to find the setup you like, so make sure you spend a good half hour tweaking until you&apos;re happy. AI can be a little funny at times, been rear ended coming into a corner more than a few times, and the take certain corners really slow. Overall great mix of sim/arcade styles. Pick it up if you aren&apos;t a nutball who expects something this isn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=741143">Expand</a></span>

However, poorly executed physics and unrewarding gameplay dissapoint all round. The game has a very uneven learning curve where smaller races are far too easy and then become disproportionally more difficult with each progression through the game. If you&apos;re likely to be using the keyboard rather than a wheel, don&apos;t buy this game, buy GRID instead. The controls are so unforgiving that all the rear wheel drive cars (almost all of the top-end ones) are unusable because of uncontrolable oversteer round the gentlest of corners. If you do have a wheel, you still won&apos;t be impressed as the physics and car control are well below standard. The graphics are completely unremarkable and don&apos;t measure up to Gran Turismo 3 on a PS2. In particular, dissapearing objects and cars in the rear-view look rubbish. Despite being relatively large compared to other titles like GRID, the game feels poorly finished and generally unsatisfying. It just doesn&apos;t measure up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85521">Expand</a></span>

After the first races if have to say that i can&apos;t support the high Metascore. The games has some serious issues: - The AI Even after a very bad first race i was classified as Experienced, so i set it to Pro :) With the AI set to Medium i was easily seconds ahead. With the AI on Hard i was still doing good. Well, not all the time, read on. - The handling Well, on the first tracks i did good. On the last of the first 5 the car handled very different and i had almost no chance of winning. So i went back and set the driver level back to Experienced. Now it was just too easy to drive around. It is also a balance issue. If you set it to Experienced it is too easy. If you set it to Pro it is too hard. - more handling I know that early cars are not really good, but on the later tracks my RX8 felt really bad on Pro. No matter what i did it was spinning almost all the time. Little error here, spin, little error there, spin. In the winding and tight tracks it was useless. It felt like the game just wants to spin you and there is simply no chance of recovering. - even more handling i normally use the hood camera, but the game starts with the cockpit cam. What i immediately noticed was the sluggish response of the steering wheel. It responded like it was pulled by a rubber string. And this is exactly how the driving feels. This makes it even harder to try to catch the car&apos;s rear. And many times the car was just swinging from one side to the other like an old car. With full level 1 upgraded on a sports car this shouldn&apos;t happen. I have driven Colin McRae Dirt and GRID where the response is perfect. These are proper racing games. The car response is direct and you can immediately feel the reaction of the car to your action on the controls. Then you can struggle with the track, you improve yourself, you race the opponents. In NFSS you struggle with the handling mostly. I don&apos;t feel like i am racing, more like a test driver in a bad car. I can&apos;t concentrate on the race because the car feels so bad. But a big disappointment is the way NFS is going. I played all PC NFS titles and it was a great series. But it was going downhill. In the beginning NFS was about racing on public roads with sport/supercars, also against the police. Now it is closed circuit racing, which is rather boring. I can&apos;t understand how editors can say that it catches the spirit of NFS. It doesn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=84809">Expand</a></span>

When I heared there was a new Need for Speed game out I was quite excited, I was expecting an arcade style thriller similar to the likes of Underground one and two or carbon. When I actually played the game however I soon realised that this is a completely different game probably designed by a team that doesn&apos;t even know the makers of underground and carbon. The game itself is a poor atempt at a realistic racing simulator game. The whole engine is fataly flawed, the cars handel worse than any vehicle I have ever come across, the graphics seem like they are modern graphics pasted on to an outdated engine and the in game loading times are ridiculous especially when you think about what it is you&apos;re waiting for. A game that I generously gave a 4/10. It is unclear what style the design team were going for when creating this game and I suspect this game is the result of too many ideas with poor implementation. In summary I would recommend this game to no one, it is a waste of money and the Need for Speed franchise need to realise we dont want games like Shift or even pro street, we want games like underground or most wanted. If you are looking for a fun arcade racing classic go for Race Driver Grid (PC). If on the other hand you are looking for a realistic driving sim GTR2 Evolution (PC) is not great but alot better than this. On the other hand if you own an Xbox get Forza 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=84902">Expand</a></span>

The cars do not drive well; the AI drivers are terrible slowing down way too much at turns; and when you do inevitably hit another car, the collision physics is embarrassing. It is not a fun game to play at all. The cockpit view is unimpressive and the effects are forced. If you want to play a game with a great cockpit, try Dirt2.</span>

The handling and physics could have been put into a game called &quot;Gas Powered Shopping Carts!) and been awesome, but retarded. The cockpit of my vehicle in real life does not tremble and shake when I get to 60 mph, sorry. I don&apos;t get tunnel vision at 70 either. If you hit the nitrous in this game the engine revs up no matter what speed you are going! I was going 160mph in my 700hp Camaro 2010 and hit the nitrous and it fricken went from 6000rpm to rev limiter and the speed went up 2mph! Like it was on ice. What the **** EA!

The AI is pathetic, the driving sucks, the upgrades are the same bolt-on no-sense crap usually found in NFS games. The car stats are bar graphs. This game really is EA&apos;s attempt to make a Grid, and it&apos;s a miserable failure.

Bad physics, terrible control, not-quite-there visuals and a half-hearted attempt at intruding into the sim genre rather than staying closer to NFS&apos;s more arcade style roots makes for a dismal game. Bring back NFS 2 SE.</span>

Terrible car physics. EVERY single car oversteers. No amount of tuning or suspension upgrades resolves this. Not to mention every little bump causes your car to hop. Only adding to the already bad camera. Very poor controls. The steering always feels delayed, like the driver never used a steering wheel before.

<br>i dont understand why they bothered to add vinyls and such when there is no way you can see them since there is no 3rd person camera, meaning driving different cars doesnt change the experience by much. all you&apos;ll notice is better speed, etc
<br>ive been playing and loving NFS since porche unleashed. ive completed the careers for underground 1&amp;2; most wanted, carbon, i liked them all, yet i uninstalled shift after 2 days..  -all the (terribly boring) cutscenes (for example before and after each race) cannot be skipped.
<br>the critics who gave this an 83 mustve been either high or very well paid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1363556">Expand</a></span>

The handling is absolutely dreadful, this game is trying to position itself as a combination of GRID and sim racing and as a result fails at doing either one of those. Went into the closet after less then half an hour of playing...</span>

<br>
<br>Came 1st place: mode: RACE _ Laps: 8 _ car class: same class _ opponents: 6 _ Time: midday _ track: Alplental
<br>
<br>Race car to drive: Porsche Carrera GT
<br>
<br>((Gameplay, ADJUST CONTROL)):
<br>SDZ:0 _ ADZ:5 _ BDZ:0 _ CDZ:5 _ SS:95 _AS:75 _ BS:90 _ CS:30 _ SSS:2 _ IS:off _ CYA:Normal

<br>
<br>Now go and test play this game, and see who&apos;s the real idiots! Never seen AI drivers so crazy! If to play by AI Difficulty: MEDIUM, it would turned out to be like the movie DAYS OF THUNDER with a lot of cars went sideway on the track, or driving back into the track without giving way to you high speed travelling car, and with bot-cars spinning out of control ALL BY ITSELF like it&apos;s beating it&apos;s own meat, or suddenly handbraking right in front of you without any reason (same with AI Difficulty: hard), and dead slow speed at bends. The AI is a good laugh, as 1 or 2 of them are aimed to slow you down so other cars can sped way ahead!
<br>
<br>Playing by AI Difficulty HARD isn&apos;t so bad, but still there a few good laughs!
<br>
<br>Too bad it has no GRID AND ARCADE mode that allows more acade like gaming, fine tune all the cars so they&apos;re suitable to play keyboard like the other game GRID.
<br>
<br>Steering lock? I tried to Google it but seem to came up with nothing much. If steering lock is set too high and along with low GEARING (higher acceration), the steering of the car may go dead (locked) when going around a bend. Get a wheel for real? Or rather play GRID? Get GRID first, then don&apos;t forget this GOOD LAUGH game that suddenly handbrakes right in front of you like it has seen a ghost of a steering wheel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962932">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not the kind of game you can just floor it and go, nor is it the best simulator out there, it&apos;s just something fun. Kind of a cross between the simulation and arcade styles. The cars them selves don&apos;t match their real world equivalents, but meh, it&apos;s still a fun game.</span>

Although the game is visually and aurally magnificent, once you&apos;re past the first few tiers and get into the higher level cars, the game just falls apart. As previously mentioned here, the bugs simply prevent this game from getting any higher of a score. It took me forever to beat the Bugatti Veyron Invitational thanks to the bouncing physics problem, and then when I did, the game caused my PS3 to reset to the XMB! That&apos;s happened over 4 times since I started playing on Friday. That&apos;s simply ridiculous! It blows my mind the review that have been given by the above websites. Did they play it any farther than Tier 2? Just a horrible, horrible job...where was the QA on this game? EA still hasn&apos;t learned that the developers need time to get things right. I expect more from a Console game. I expect it to be near bug-free and to just work. Now, console games are apparently no different than what has become of PC gaming. Release then Patch. EA has reall screwed the pooch on this one. I&apos;m returning it on Monday and picking up GRID or Dirt 2 instead. Shame on the professional reviewers, too! You guys have lost alot of respect from me on this one!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=85746">Expand</a></span>

Thats why everyone is giving it bad reviews. i have played the game a lot. got used to it and turns out its not bad at all. Car selection is amazing, just cant see it beating forza motorsport 3. Personally i was expecting street racing but its not. theres no other leading games designers doing street racing games i wonder why.</span>

At first glance it looks and feels like a decent race simulator but once you dive deeper it starts to fall apart. I&apos;m quite a racing fan and have played tons of racing games, both semi arcade and simulation, but I can&apos;t recall having so much frustration with one of them like I did with NFS Shift. There is so much wrong with this game. The controls being the main issue. I tried playing it with my xbox360 gamepad but it&apos;s just way too sensitive. Steering (which is pretty useful while driving) is so hard because your driver is turning the wheel left and right at the speed of light. There&apos;s no linear delay. Add the factor of some realistic friction and even your Fiat Panda will go ice skating after each corner. This actually concerns the main skill you&apos;ll need for the game: DO NOT SPIN OUT. In general all the opponents are way slower but don&apos;t seem to suffer from faulty monkey steering wheels. You can however tweak the controls (did didn&apos;t really work for me) and maybe a future patch will solve this problem but till then I don&apos;t recommend this game to anyone without a steering wheel (and helmet). Don&apos;t even think you can play this game with only a keyboard. Another issue are the loading times. I&apos;ve quite an high-end game machine but the loading times are way too long. Most of this time the hard disk isn&apos;t active so the game is probably precalculating, which could have been done in advance and saved on disk. Even when the next event contains the same drivers, the same track, the same everything: the loading screen appears (with some very exciting hints and tips). There&apos;s a mini map in the lower right corner, which shows the track you&apos;re racing. This is ofcourse quite handy if you don&apos;t know the track and it would be alot handier if it didn&apos;t have an alpha blending of 20%. It&apos;s way too transparent to be any helpful. What I do like however was the great cockpit view. I mostly race all games in from the cockpit view but this one is without doubt the best. The fov is just right and the blur effects are great. The graphics are good/okay. But nothing near breathtaking. I&apos;ve played the game on a GTX285 and it runs fine (ofcourse), but since the lack of polish in all other areas it wouldn&apos;t surprise me that you actually need quite a decent card. Don&apos;t believe the skin deep reviews on the web. A user score of 45(!) against 85 should say enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=86078">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s possible to slide your Aston Martin into a wall at 80MPH and come away with nothing more than a slight pull to the left. The cockpit view, however, is pretty freaking sweet. I&apos;ve never been able to drive from the cockpit view, even though I&apos;d like to consider myself a simulation driver. They&apos;re too cramped, too wide, too narrow, too whatever, to drive from. In NFS:S, however, the cockpit view is spectacular! I absolutely loved it. The blurring at speed was a little over the top, but it&apos;s not TOO bad.

I&apos;ve played a lot of Forza 2, so I come from a background of half-sims, and I personally love this game. The rewards system is not perfect but being rewarded for smashing into other cars is quite fun (very unrealistic but if I really wanted to race a car I&apos;d race a car, not play a game.) The cars are excellent, they all mostly oversteer but that&apos;s fine I find it challenging, and best of all all of the tracks are extremely bumpy which is something I haven&apos;t experienced in a game before. However, the load times are immense, and for this reason I do not play it. As a game, it is very good and very fun. As a technical feat, it is a horrific failure. Only buy it if you have a solid state drive and you feel lucky. Game reviewed is version 1.1 (first patch).

With all driver aids on - easy opponents, automatic braking, traction control, no damage, driving line - the game&apos;s circuits can be navigated with one hand on the controller. Turn them off and it&apos;s totally different. Your opponents aggressively attack you. Take a corner at speed and you&apos;ll spin out. Crash at all and it&apos;s game over. Shift is the first racing game where I&apos;ve wanted to drive using nothing but cockpit view. It&apos;s thrilling, peering over the steering wheel as the screen shakes slightly because of the speed, feeling like the car is just moments away from flight. It also seems authentic. Shift is an excellent balancing act between arcade racing and simulated driving, but there&apos;s danger when mixing styles that you end up satisfying neither group of fans. The hardcore get annoyed by all the whoosh-banging menus and lapses of detail. The common man gets intimidated by statistics and toe angles, that&apos;s why the user score is far lower than critic score. But Shift is the best attempt in a while at providing something that balances both, while providing a route for the unintiated into an imposing genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=742631">Expand</a></span>

This is the pinnacle of the genera and given the decline of the excellence of PC gaming and rise of console mediocrity it will likely never be surpassed! Codemaster is our only hope. BTY Who is paying the so called expert reviewers who gave this 8 and 9 out of 10? Kudos to &quot;PC format&quot; for having the guts to tell everyone the truth. I&apos;ll give this 6 out of 10. If I though it was the best they could do.

Trust me, no other games are like this one.
<br>
<br>Need to pay great amount of attentions to the speedometer when coming up to a bend/turn, need to let go of the accelerator in the right time and brake as little as possible, let it slide smoothly around a bend or corner (with as little brakes as possible when doing it), as medium to hard braking makes the steering go poorly or even locked up when turning. Sometimes the same goes with the acceleration key, need to let go of it for a second before it can steer more effectively, the effects are not at all times the same, seem like a bug or defective to me.
<br>
<br>Circuit/track surfaces is also a great issue here, the race track is not all flat sideway RIGHT before some bends/turns (not all of them), even at the right speed the car can lost traction control coming up around a bend when it&apos;s tyres got bumped off the track&apos;s uneven surface, causing the steering to malfunction, it&apos;s really critical as which side of the track you stick to when coming up to a turn.
<br>
<br>There are 3 icons (LED  lights) at the bottom right corner of the HUD: brake, ?engine/wheel and tyres. When most of the 3 LED lights comes on and off a lot, that mean the steering is more likely to lock up at high speed turns. Not easy to master as how to play, you can&apos;t brake a lot in this one, if you did then the effective of the steering goes poorly.
<br>
<br>BRAKE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, let go of the accelerator to cut speed than using brakes a lot, need to make it not too heavy and not too light, or else the steering goes bad when all the 3 LED lights comes on constantly.
<br>
<br>Few of the AI cars can go really fast at unrealistic gravitation and traction factors, the high speeding car&apos;s animations is like the AI car is a fired out rocket than a road machine that has traction and road grip matters, as the AI car can go at SUPER high speed around turns and bends without any smokes coming out from the tyres.
<br>
<br>Unbalanced AI difficulty HARD, as the AI skills varies by each time you quit the race to the game&apos;s main menu before returning to the SAME race SETUP again. Each random draw of AI skills varies greatly for the same AI difficulty level selected, as you may find 1 of them reasonably hard, and rest of them unplayable hard as the AI goes at godlike speed.
<br>
<br>There are sets of AI skills just for the AI difficulty HARD, they&apos;re almost like either 1 of these:
<br>1. All of them Speeding very fast ahead with unrealistic speed that you can barely catch up to the SLOWEST AI car, but it really depends on which car you&apos;re driving.
<br>2. Most of them Speeding ahead with reasonable speed, but has a couple of the last cars in the fleet to knock you knock like they&apos;re assassins.
<br>3. Most of them Speeding with slower speed, as a couple of them goes at very high speed at the front of the fleet.
<br>
<br>If sometimes you find it too hard to play the AI difficulty HARD, please try to play AI Difficulty medium, BUT when AI difficulty medium turned out to be too easy, then try play with more laps, more AI cars, no traction control and stability control, turn off as many helps as possible, tune the car to make it&apos;s handling worse than better so as to make the race against the AI more challenging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-shift/user-reviews?user_review_id=3981224">Expand</a></span>
