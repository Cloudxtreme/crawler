This game is worth a full 60$ even though it&apos;s only 8$. The game is about Developer Davey Wrenden showcasing games from his friend Coda.
<br>
<br>SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON&apos;T WANT SPOILERS. Now here&apos;s the crazy thing: Coda doesn&apos;t actually exist. After doing some research there is no person in relation with Danny with that name. The best theory that I&apos;ve seen is that Coda is a metaphor for Davey himself. The house cleaning part imo, is him creating the Stanley Parable.
<br>
<br>Anyway the game is extremely artsy and extremely personal. I understand that people don&apos;t have the emotional capacity to deal with this type of stuff, hence negative reviews. But this was the first time that any sort of media ever has made me cry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5535936">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a game I would give this game a 4. Since it is simply not fun. it lacks even the enjoyment of exploration the Stanley parable had. it is, 95% linear. It is possible though that the reason i didn&apos;t find much interest in the story is because the lesson it tries to teach is one i have already learned. this reason is also probably why so many reviews call this game pretentious.
<br>
<br>I very much recommend this game to fans of the Stanley parable, and people that feel they need external validation for being happy, and I hope the creator&apos;s next work will have more appeal for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5842745">Expand</a></span>

I said &quot;to an extent&quot;, because The Beginner&apos;s Guide is so much more experiemental, new, unconventional, and just that much more brilliant. So if you want to try something, mature, and groundbreaking in video games, if you believe video games, aside from their animations and aesthetic, can be considered as Art, than this this may be for you.

<br>As for what the game really is: You play through a series of levels as a very emotional story unfolds. Those levels can, and often are, simply walking from one end of a room to another. However, the artistry is hard to ignore, and the excellent narration makes them even more thrilling.
<br>
<br>If you want a game to paralyze you in deep thought for hours after completion, this is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=6717696">Expand</a></span>

<br>It was too lengthy for me. I didn&apos;t like the linearity of it and at times it was just far too long in the tooth.
<br>The voice acting was okay I guess, but it lacked the same standard of that used in the Parable, in that it seemed to be in need of more enthusiasm and I don&apos;t think a bit of humour being injected into it would have gone amiss either.
<br>Whilst it was a good idea, I don&apos;t think the execution went quite to plan with this one. Maybe it&apos;s just me - but I didn&apos;t really rate it  - as you can tell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5590049">Expand</a></span>

If you want an insight into our need for validation as human beings, and the pain of the creative process, then 8 bucks and an hour and a half of your time for The Beginners Guide is the single greatest investment I can imagine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5529628">Expand</a></span>

I personally think the story of the game is great and it&apos;s true that you don&apos;t have to do anything by yourself but to me that&apos;s no problem. The only problem of the game is: you have to like it. And this is not a game like any other game, so you can&apos;t say &quot;I like game xy so I will like this one too&quot;. You just have to try it by yourself. No rating on this site will help you. I read some of the bad reviews they all say &quot;save your money&quot;. But you shouldn&apos;t. Whether you like the game in the end or not in my opinion it&apos;s worth a try.
<br>And to all who say, people who like this game will say this game is misunderstood: no it isn&apos;t it&apos;s just not for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5527949">Expand</a></span>

I believe video games are the most powerful medium of expression through their audiovisuals, writing, and mechanics. Unfortunately I haven&apos;t had the experience of playing a game that fully capitalizes on all of these aspects to make a truly meaningful and moving piece. It may be out there and hopefully we tap into this medium more in the future. This game is like a blank painting that says &quot;this is art&quot; and then &quot;this isn&apos;t art&quot; and then &quot;how dare you.&quot; If you are going to make art, make it. In an attempt to make itself seem more intellectual and meaningful this game intentionally misleads and confuses its audience. If confusion was part of the narrative it would be more acceptable, but this was a clear trick used to fluff up an other wise empty game with some bits of meaning. I love Jim sterling but there&apos;s a reason he literally says nothing about the game in his review. There&apos;s no substantive analysis of this game and once you see through that it&apos;s clear that everyone else is calling this art because it seems artsy to them. We can have a discussion about whether or not art needs to have a point or whether or not it can intentionally deceive you. However, to me this game was simply using these things a mask to look and feel meaningful rather than genuinely being it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5528743">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game gives you the chance to see a persons years of work and analyze his thought process, his feelings, his inner thoughts that he maybe would not share with anyone else.
<br>Suggesting you new ideas and questions, that you probably didn&apos;t asked yourself before, a new perspective into the process of making a game and how close to the developer it will be and, in my opinion, how almost all indie games really are.And the implication of the narrator makes you feel that you are not alone in this journey only to find that you looked the wrong way at the game, it&apos;s not about who you think it is and you tried to analyze the wrong person all along.
<br>
<br>In my opinion this is a great game that thins the line between art and games even more that shows that a game could be a lot more than just a game.
<br>Just by the fact that it made me think about a lot of actions that even I make daily is impressive.
<br>
<br>The last thing I would like to say is that I am a little sad that a lot of people did not really understand the idea of the game expecting it to be fun or to have interesting gameplay and didn&apos;t get the fact that is something totally different, I would even say a bit experimental.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5533862">Expand</a></span>

<br>Here we go. You are the player.
<br>Its that simple.
<br>Forget about Dave, think about you. Think about modern gaming. Why are YOU there and what do YOU expect. First time it did occur to me was the tv faces asking me how it was before.
<br>Well, yep, they were only shapes of triangles and squares, but it did work. How to left the prison, how to get out?
<br>Returning puzzle, to go out and yet advance, u need to look at things behind you, and proceed. It&apos;s not about being stuck in the past. It&apos;s showing the way to move forward, but with accepting the heritage of games. It was never about graphics and pointless grind, it was always about ideas. Thats why u get this cleaning section in the game. Isn&apos;t that what WoW has become, and other MMORPGS followed? Brings this, get this there, kill this in this amount, rinse, repeat.
<br>Thats also why, I think, we get this prison section of this game.
<br>Games changes but prison remains. Whatever u decide doesn&apos;t matter, as game won&apos;t think about your answer, it will just launch convenient script. U may see 100 variables = games, but the point in all of them is the same - your actions doesn&apos;t matter, cause there&apos;s a scripted story and u will follow it, no matter if u want.  That&apos;s the prison.
<br>Now, remember this colorful picture? Yes, from a distance it was beautiful, and u wanted to go near it to see it in all its glory. That&apos;s today games for you. You come closer, and what u see? Well, just dots. Colorful, but mundane dots.

<br>
<br>The &quot;walking simulator&quot; that this type of &quot;game&quot; belongs to is essentially an audiovisual gallery. Interactivity is minimal, gameplay mechanics simply don&apos;t exist. Look around, move around, press buttons in the game. Maybe open a door. That&apos;s the extent of the interactivity.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s fine. There are games, such as the Daveys &quot;The Stanley Parable&quot;, which are essentially the same thing. The Stanley Parable was well received, and I enjoyed it myself. I feel like this is a cash-in on the reputation gained from that game.
<br>
<br>Spoilers will follow, because the excuse of it being &quot;misunderstood&quot; falls if I show that, yes, I do understand it, and no, it is not a good story.
<br>
<br>The narrator claims early on that the game is a compilation of real &quot;games&quot; his supposedly real &quot;friend&quot; named Coda made. Which, really, are just maps in a game engine. None of them contain novel gameplay. The &quot;games&quot; are terribly broken, and utterly terrible. The narrator claims to gleam insights into the mental state of his friend from these games.
<br>
<br>His friend was apparently reclusive, and seemed to entertain themselves by making these games. The narrator claims Coda was &quot;depressed&quot;. Coda later on dismisses this, in the final level. How someone could think that a person with depression would be able to go through the menial task of mapping menial levels is beyond me, and that&apos;s where the idea that this game is actually a compilation of real games begins to fall.
<br>
<br>The idea is that Coda is frustrated by the narrator compromising his artistic integrity by modifying the often impossible-to-solve puzzles to be solvable or skipable. Coda at one point creates a game about how people would persecute him if he stops making games- something that he apparently was doing for his own enjoyment. There&apos;s no reason for him to stop enjoying making games for himself. Additionally, there is no reason for Coda to keep supplying his &quot;friend&quot; with games, either. So, the idea of the game being &quot;a real story&quot; has fallen completely.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s left? Having to listen to the narrator feign an emotional breakdown due to guilt over having made things worse for Coda by sucking the fun out of making games. I can relate to the idea of trying to fix people, but messing things up. I truly can. But an emotional appeal from a stupid character in a scenario that seems unrealistic prevents any true emotional attachment to them.
<br>
<br>Save your money, and more importantly, save your time. This game has a very slow pace, and considering the nonexistent payoff, it makes a dentists appointment seem more rewarding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5526753">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now The Beginner&apos;s Guide is nothing of that. It&apos;s essentially about someone presenting you the &quot;games&quot; that his friend made. They aren&apos;t actually games, they are levels, well, part of levels,.. well a bunch of assets thew together and not being polished at all. That&apos;s the point of the game, saying that his friend have social anxiety and depression and that it reflected on his work making ugly inconsistent levels. Thing is, it never lead anywhere other than that, it does not try to convey a message or something. You just slowly advance through bad levels until you reach the end and the credit starts. It&apos;s absolutely boring and pointless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5526842">Expand</a></span>

However, if you&apos;re like me then you&apos;ll get so much out of this game&apos;s short run time that you won&apos;t be able to get it off of your mind for hours, maybe days. It introspects the player and, despite being a tour around another person&apos;s collection of games, clearly signifying it is not *your* story to project yourself onto, it makes the player look at the narrative from their point of view and makes them think deeply about what they&apos;ve just played and how it makes them feel. Deeply uncomfortable and well worth a spare 5 quid.

<br>A piece of art (and not as a compliment, it is excactly what it is- art.) that will make you think long after you finish the game, feel a bit different then before, look at things in a different perspective (at least untill your life routin will take away this feelings) and even make you sign-up to metacritic to write a review...</span>

I personally think the story of the game is great and it&apos;s true that you don&apos;t have to do anything by yourself but to me that&apos;s no problem. The only problem of the game is: you have to like it. And this is not a game like any other game, so you can&apos;t say &quot;I like game xy so I will like this one too&quot;. You just have to try it by yourself. No rating on this site will help you. I read some of the bad reviews they all say &quot;save your money&quot;. But you shouldn&apos;t. Whether you like the game in the end or not in my opinion it&apos;s worth a try.
<br>And to all who say, people who like this game will say this game is misunderstood: no it isn&apos;t it&apos;s just not for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5535815">Expand</a></span>

Some games do that, such as Presentable Liberty, but in that case they do at least make the player involved by telling them a story, making identifiable characters and making the player care for them. The Beginner&apos;s Guide fails at that as well, making the narrator-author the only reference point for everything, giving the &quot;player&quot; absolutely no way of getting the gist of the plot. Which is fair because there is none, it&apos;s just a 90-minute rant from the author trying to get the audience to care about what is essentially a self-centered hipster rant. The &quot;experience&quot; would still be good since it can appeal to some people, but...it&apos;s being SOLD. And for a way higher price than many more entertaining games with way more longevity. It&apos;s like a social experiment trying to see how effective it is to use a bandwagon effect and have people gush about the game whether it can actually be called a game or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5847378">Expand</a></span>

<br>You play the game, and it&apos;s an open-ended emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lot of open questions. The great thing about this is that it forces you to think about it.

<br>It&apos;s literally a joke on pretentiousness, and as such it&apos;s very clever and worth 11/10. However, I&apos;m giving it a 0 because it&apos;s a joke, not a game.
<br>

<br>A more subtle albeit still effective way to get food on your plate would have been a free-to-play game in which you incite your die-hard fans to donate money to you, through appeal to emotions and armchair philosophy, a subject you seem to master. Even though this would have reduced drastically your income for this great work, you would have kept face at least.
<br>
<br>I award you 1 point out of 10 to fulfill the validation you so desperately seek and congratulate you on the great financial scam you&apos;ve been exploiting since &quot;The Stanley Parable&quot;.

<br>
<br>Here&apos;s what the game is: Davey Wreden, creator of The Stanley Parable, makes you walk through a bunch of garbage, throw-away games one of his friends supposedly made with the Source engine while he pretentiously overanalyzes everything in them. His friend never published these games because they are, in fact, trash, throw-away &quot;games&quot; he made using the Source engine.
<br>
<br>No Davey, there aren&apos;t boxes in the sky of your friend&apos;s garbage Couter-Strike map because they are supposed to represent the fragmentation of his metaphysical superego. They&apos;re there because he was just messing around with the editor and randomly put ridiculous objects all over the place.
<br>
<br>And no Davey, the games aren&apos;t unfinishable because they represent the inconquerability of life. They&apos;re unfinishable because they&apos;re garbage, throw-away works he didn&apos;t care to finish or never got around to finishing.
<br>
<br>Makes me question if The Stanley Parable was even as good of a game as I thought it was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5522639">Expand</a></span>

<br>So</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Having played the &quot;The Stanley Parable&quot; (great game), I gave this a try. This game literally put me to sleep. I dozed of twice. It is that boring. I should have stopped playing after the first level but my curiosity and high hopes that it would get better kept me grinding through it. It never got any better. Took me almost two hours to complete and that was too long for this crap.
<br>
<br>So what&apos;s the game about. It&apos;s a narrated first person tour through a set of bad Half Life 2 levels. You know the kind that 12 year old newbs in the HL2 mod scene use to make as their first level a decade or more ago. The narration attempts to be smart and deep but ends up being pretentious and laking in story or humor. There are no game play mechanics nor game play to speak of. I would argue this is not even a game. This is no &quot;Stanley Parable&quot;. Not even close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5527716">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game itself is **** but, again, it&apos;s also an important reminder that wrapping and publicity can make you buy **** if you aren&apos;t mindful of the fine print. Or it&apos;s a solid argument for game piracy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5635529">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It all falls very short. The game is very slow paced, with no part of the game or narration being particularly interesting. Given the slow pace, combined with the short game length, you are left wondering what you spent your money on, and an entirely forgettable experience. If you are reading reviews to figure out whether or not the $8 is worth it, I&apos;d advise you to skip this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5910939">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As soon as i saw this was made by the same guy who made Stanley Parable, i tought &quot;Whoa! Here&apos;s a game with interesting morals and innovative mechanics! I bet i can replay it over and over!&quot;. Nope. It&apos;s just a guy talking for one long, long hour about the unfinished games his &quot;friend&quot; made.
<br>
<br>He goes on to overanalyzing everything and &quot;deducing&quot; his friend was depressed, anxious, and many other things. We later learn that he was just an artsy fartsy dick, as his friend made a game for him basically telling him &quot;Dude i&apos;m not depressed go **** yourself&quot;, and &quot;Stop showing my games to people&quot;, which is not something he followed since this game actually exists. He then has an emotional breakdown and asks his friends for forgiveness (NOT A GOOD IDEA, SINCE, YOU KNOW, THIS GAME EXISTS), and the game ends. That&apos;s it fellas!
<br>
<br>Also, HE added the lampposts to the games and overanalyzed them, saying it was coda who put them there. Makes me wonder what else he changed to make the games more artsy.
<br>
<br>So yeah, not much here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5535699">Expand</a></span>

What I love about Davey&apos;s games are that they appear simple, but the narrative is so powerful that the game shoots into the stratosphere. In this game you travel through several games a friend of Davey&apos;s created over the course of a few years, and you go on an emotional and psychological journey into interpreting what may have been happening in the creator&apos;s mind while making the games. EVERYONE needs to play this game. It is only about 3 hours or so to play through all the way, and it is worth every second. It makes you question so much in life, and this game is an art-piece and an adventure into the psyche that I will never forget!

There&apos;s no grand journey nor end goal, there is simply someone&apos;s interpretation. Davey Wreden takes you on a guide through a series of small game prototypes developed by a friend known as Coda and tries to learn more about this friend through his games alone.
<br>
<br>SPOILERS My own interpretation of the game is how others read meaning into a piece of work, be it a game, movie, TV series or book and try and find their own goals, often getting frustrated if they don&apos;t find it.  I&apos;ve done some story writing in the past and have a bad habit of dropping an idea midway through. I usually write these stories for myself to get ideas I like onto paper/word and share them to see if anyone likes them (because it seems pointless to keep it to myself to me), but I do wonder if the handful of readers I attract by pure luck get disappointed when I suddenly up and vanish onto a new idea.
<br>
<br>It also makes we wander how more successful creators feel when they suddenly get a passionate fanbase they&apos;re not sure how to deal with. They may feel trapped as they try and deal with this monstrous fanbase clamouring for more of their work.
<br>
<br>But that&apos;s just how I saw it. The game&apos;s meant to be open to interpretation and there&apos;s many interesting ideas you can come to. It&apos;s not &apos;fun&apos; in the traditional sense with little in the way of actual gameplay (the jump scare I was expecting to appear half the time never showed up), but I found it far more fulfilling then any number of hours spent thoughtlessly fighting online in a military based shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=6060672">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros
<br>+Great Narration and well told story
<br>+Design of the game was well made
<br>+Chapter Select lets you select chapters (once you started one) whenever you want for replay value
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Very short and simple
<br>-Its like your practically watching a movie or listening to audio, not much gameplay or choice
<br>-Visuals use early levels of source engine, not the best looking game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=7464352">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you have played it, The Beginner&apos;s Guide is what you would get if you made one of the branches in The Stanley Parable 90 minutes long. You&apos;re playing a story, and not a very interactive one. It&apos;s mildly intriguing for a bit, but the premise winds up wearing thin by the end.</span>

It plays out more like a personal dairy of sorts, detailing the thought processes of Davey Wreden and his realisation of the error of his ways. There are many interpretations you can take, and it&apos;s up to you whether you believe the narrator is being honest or not. The writing did not come across as pretentious, but I think some of its ideas could be conveyed with a little more subtlety and perhaps less melodrama. Visuals were not impressive from a technical standpoint, though sound design was excellent. On the whole, I was satisfied with the overall product. At about 1.5 hours, it&apos;s a game that should be finished in a single sitting.

But for anyone thinking about buying it, just be aware that it&apos;s not there to be a fun or an enjoyable little game. It&apos;s meant to tell a story, and ask some questions while doing it. It&apos;s more art than game, and for the price I spent, I feel like it&apos;s worth it.</span>

TBG is an very well-conceived commentary on the human condition - or A human condition - as it walks the player through a series of games created by a friend of his named &apos;Coda&apos;. The intention here is to provide us with insight into Coda&apos;s psyche by way of the games he creates, but it&apos;s much more layered than that simple premise. Davey plays narrator here with a charisma and insight that is impossible not to appreciate and drives the player forward on the search for answers. And yet, even to say &apos;answers&apos; is an injustice in and of itself. This is an experience that is open to interpretation; indeed it thrives on it. Can we know a person more intimately through their art? Or does it serve more of a template for ourselves to project upon? How can you tell the difference? The closing minutes deliver a gut-punch of emotional and narrative turmoil that has to be experienced to truly appreciate. In the way that only the best narratives can, it invites scrupulous interpretation long after the credits roll. In a reaction that was totally out-of-character for me, I emailed Davey after playing (he actually provides an email address in the opening moments) simply to expel my pent-up thoughts and offer my compliments to his work. If you enjoyed The Stanley Parable, The Beginners Guide is a must. It treads different ground than it&apos;s predecessor, but excels in it&apos;s intentions just as well; I would even say better. Stop reading and go spend 90 minutes in a gaming experience unlike any other.

It starts as a pretentious criticism of simple games, then it becomes a dialogue between the developer and the critic and then the games start to criticize the pretentious critic himself. Not surprised pretentious game &quot;critics&quot; didn&apos;t like the game, it&apos;s laughing at them. To be fair though, it is a walking simulator with very simplistic art assets, so some people might find that a problem.

I&apos;m the kind of person that generally finds it difficult to stay away from google and Wikipedia really in watching or playing just about everything. I find it hard not to spoil things for myself because I always want to know what&apos;s going on, I like to be able to give little tid bits and details to people like a directors commentary when I share it with them. I&apos;ll watch the same thing several times over just so I can watch it with other people. And I feel validated by it. I get my sense of self worth from sharing things with other people and getting their approval. I fought that urge hard while I was playing this game and I&apos;m glad I did, even though now I plan on tearing the internet apart to get every little bit I can from it. The truth is, this game hinges on your ability to relate to the story being told, and the medium through which it is being told. I could tell from the first minute that I was going to like this game, but by the end it tore me open like no game, film, TV show, or book has in a very long time, and I&apos;m currently studying philosophy and literature so I&apos;m going through some fairly heavy stuff. This game scared me, it made me look at myself in a way that I haven&apos;t, maybe ever. Please play this game, even if you end up hating it, play it. It&apos;s really not a walking simulator, it&apos;s a whole new thing, a whole new genre, and at the same time so unique, so special, that I can&apos;t imagine it ever being repeated. It&apos;s a genre of one. That alone is worth the price of admission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-beginners-guide/user-reviews?user_review_id=6505799">Expand</a></span>
