It may not be my GOTY (Tactics Ogre will probably snatch that one), but it very well could be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739271">Expand</a></span>

After an hour I removed it from steam. It doesn&apos;t suck and the game is a somewhat an interesting hybrid, but there is just nothing compelling to make you want to explore more, play more, or achieve... anything! It&apos;s just a game with very little diversity in enemies, story, or art. It just kind of yammers on at it&apos;s own pace. I love achieving all the goals in games like MarioWorld Galaxy, and playing through top down RPGs.. This just seems to have jumbled the two genre&apos;s together haphazardly. Save the cash for better indie titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1773821">Expand</a></span>

<br>While the game is fairly short about 5-6 hours there is an harder version unlocked on completion.
<br>So after like 12 months of been unsure, i bought and i loved it.</span>

All the pieces came together for an amazing experience. This goes on for around ten or more levels then the gameplay peaks and becomes tedious. You fight wave after wave of enemies that you block or dodge or die. This would be fine except that it goes on for ten or more waves without respite. You fight the same enemies over and over again. The exact same fight, over and over. This highlighted the lack of depth in the combat system which killed the game for me, I didn&#x2019;t want to play it again and I don&#x2019;t care what happens to characters or the world the developers created. The whole experience came apart. Bastion was so well polished, right up until it wasn&#x2019;t, at all. The keyboard/mouse combo was broken, so I played with a controller. 6/10 for half a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3219205">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The RPG elements revolve around the bar you first build where as you go up in levels you gain slots to put in different potions that give your characters different passive/conditional boosts like 15% damage resistance, +10% max health and many others. Also you are able to upgrade your weapons from the items you pick up, each one giving your weapon a different boost like faster reload time, increased damage and you have to choose between the two, but once it&apos;s bought you can alter the upgrades to change for whatever situation you think you&apos;ll run into like increasing the spread of a blunterbuss or instead going for improved damage.
<br>
<br>You also get a chance to go to what&apos;s known as &quot;Who-knows-where&quot; to fight waves of enemies to grind out xp and &quot;cash&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3406876">Expand</a></span>

This game is a nice surprise for anybody looking for something fresh and easy to play. Bastion is an action RPG with some innovative points. The most important is the voice of a narrator telling the story as you advance in the game. It is a great tool that invites to keep playing in order to find out new details about the Kid and the Calamity. The game is structured in different areas that are dynamically built as the player moves. They are generally short, so they are perfect if you just want to play for a while after a hard day of work. As a consequence, Bastion is not very long (it took me 8 hours), but in my opinion it has the right length for its prize. There is a wide range of weapons available. They are given to the player as new areas are finished, and allow for different combat styles (ranged, melee or a combination of both). There is also a counter system in order to give back some damage if the corresponding key is pressed at the precise moment.<br><br>I think Bastion will be specially enjoyed by all those who played 2D action RPGs during the 16-bit console generation. It is like a look into the gameplay of the past with an updated technology... And it works!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1763870">Expand</a></span>

The second is the challenges for each weapon, some were so easy I could pass them with no weapon upgrades at all and others were so hard I could hardly pass them with all weapon upgrades with different combination&apos;s.

The world, music, combat, graphics...the game has no flaws and this from a guy who looks for flaws in his games.

<br>If the developers of this gem are thinking about the sequel/or just another title, I would definitely put multi-player/co-op into the equation.</span>

The music is good, and beyond awesome in a few places.  The narration is partly a neat gimmick, talking about what you do as you do it, but it&apos;s also very effective in serving up the story and back-story while allowing you to keep beating up enemies.  The narrator&apos;s voice acting is perfect.  Combat is good, with dodge, block, and counter mechanics.  I expected it to play like Diablo or Torchlight due to the top-down view, but it feels more like God of War or Bayonetta (minus combos).  The RPG and customization elements are well done, giving numerous play-style possibilities without being overwhelming.  You can switch your choices around enough that you won&apos;t feel like you&apos;re stuck with bad decisions forever - once you have everything, all options are available.  When discussing the game with other players, its great to see how everyone has their own personal preferences for weapon combinations and upgrades - almost every combination is both viable AND unique.  In addition to giving plenty of options for how you want to beat up the baddies, one of my favorite features of the game is the ability to dynamically buff the enemies for greater challenge and greater reward, reminiscent of the difficulty settings in The World Ends With You.  Instead of just increasing the enemy health and damage, there are 10 different options available that you can mix and match, such as faster enemy movement, enemy health regeneration, and enemies drop bombs when defeated.  While the game is mostly linear, the story is good and made better by how it&apos;s delivered.  The game is neither too short nor too long.  After completing the story, you can carry your items, level, and upgrades over to New Game Plus, which you&apos;ll need to do in order to fully upgrade everything and access the hardest difficulty settings.  With the extra weaponry and difficulty options available the second time through, it doesn&apos;t even feel repetitive.  My total time played is about 23 hours for two play-throughs and 20/20 achievements.  I recommend using a gamepad, but mouse+keyboard is perfectly playable, and even better for some weapons.  In summary, Bastion is a game that does almost everything well.  If you have any doubts, check out the free demo on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739150">Expand</a></span>

But for me it&apos;s all about the game play. Luckily Bastion delivers an excellent experience in both game play and story. I&apos;ve read about how Bastion is supposedly like Diablo or Torchlight. In my opinion it&apos;s nothing like those games. It&apos;s short, sweet, and full of diversity of game play. A good example: The game isn&apos;t an endless loot grinding dungeon crawler. Nor is it a mindless hack and slash. Combat involves timing attacks for critical hits, timing blocks to do counter attacks and timing your evasive rolls to miss incoming enemies. Weapons aren&apos;t replaceable objects valued only for their precious stats. They are reliable tools, each doing something uniquely different and at the same time being good for more then one thing. As you upgrade your weapons they even offer two avenues for enhancing their effectiveness at different styles of play (I must add that I find it awesome that you can change your weapons upgrade trees after you purchase them).  Maybe you think upgrades are cool and all, but your more interested in how difficult the game is. Admittedly it&apos;s not all that complicated to complete the game as presented to you. What IS hard is obtaining the XP and upgrades. So how is that fun? Because you can make the game HARDER. There are idols you can activate that make all enemies more powerful with a specific skill or attribute. You can activate up to ten of these idols simultaneously, and for each one you add you will receive more XP and more money. So not only are you making the game harder (which in my opinion is more enjoyable), but your also making it easier to get levels and unlock new upgrades. In my opinion it&apos;s all of these things that make Bastion a great game (and a superior action based RPG). Skill not Tedium. Tools not Trinkets. Collecting not Consuming. And a reward for those of us who are up for a challenge or two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1763735">Expand</a></span>

Very few other games I&apos;ve played have nailed story-telling and atmosphere the way Bastion does. That said, the game does have minor flaws, but they&apos;re forgivable simply because of how memorable the experience is.<br><br>Bastion&apos;s strong points lie in how brilliantly the atmosphere has been crafted, weaving story and mood right into the gameplay. The game has a narrator who guides your character along his journey, elaborating his story with little details based on your actions. This is key to video game story-telling -- it makes you, the player, feel in control of the story, rather than having it read to you via cutscenes or dialogue. The stylized visuals and haunting soundtrack add to the effect, creating a dream-like atmosphere in which the player truly feels like a part of an unfolding tale.<br><br>The gameplay itself is functional. The mechanics are akin to those of a simplified action RPG, where you can hold a number of weapons to perform simple attacks. The various weapons can be upgraded, but the combat never really deviates from its simple hack-and-slash format. In this sense, the combat isn&apos;t terribly innovative or inspired, but it&apos;s decent enough to carry you through the game.<br><br>The biggest flaw I can think of is the WASD control scheme for the PC version of the game. You can immediately tell that it was designed for console controllers, because the isometric viewpoint leads to somewhat awkward movement using just the WASD keys. At times this gets irritating, and has more than once led to interruptions in battle due to my character falling off the level. However, this is a minor issue that&apos;s easy to overlook in light of the brilliance of the rest of the game.<br><br>You know that a video game has something special to offer when, at its end, you simultaneously feel sad that it&apos;s over, and eager to play the entire thing again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765342">Expand</a></span>

It was mentioned in a beta Diablo 3 video and I thought &quot;Eh, what the heck, might as well kill some time with some other action RPG, if it&apos;s worth it&quot;. And in one sentence, it is very worth it. I got a demo which was just about enough to get me really interested and the full game straight after. I got the game yesterday and since then I barely have been able to stop playing! Bastion is monumental. It has great story narrative, it has lovely smooth hand art graphic and everything works just great. The only tiny little bit that I would complain about is that you can&apos;t run through an area once you&apos;ve completed it (picked up a core or a shard for example, and left), that is one and only downside, because it really forces you to keep your eyes peeled and you SHOULD explore as much as you can if you want to play the game to its fullest. Other than that, there&apos;s nothing to complain about. Combat is great, it&apos;s skill rewarding, every weapon really feels different and you&apos;ll certainly grow in fond of those that suit your playstyle. What I really love is the idol mechanic. By activating various idols of local gods, you can diametrally change the flow of the game. If you run around without idols, the game will be fairly easy, but you will hardly ever get a new spirit slot in your Distillery. Once you have 3, 4, 5 and more active, you&apos;ll really be tearing your hair out sometimes, but you&apos;re gonna grind a lot more XP and fragments, so it&apos;s worth it. For its price and the fact that it&apos;s been done by a team of 7 people, it&apos;s absolutely amazing. Great work, Supergiant, keep going, I&apos;m totally gonna support you if the quality of the next titles doesn&apos;t dwindle.<br><br>PS: To goodterling... Try turning some idols on, you jerk. Bastion is way better than say Magicka, which really gets too repetitive after a few hours, Bastion gives you a plenty of variety in fighting based on which weapons you use and it doesn&apos;t lose pace the entire playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769618">Expand</a></span>

There are elements in this game that will not only appeal to the casual gamer, but allows a critical gamer such as myself to sit back and ponder, Why are people that care this much about producing not only a game that is fun to play, and play again and again, but an honest and beautiful work of art, the underdogs of gaming production?  You will step into this game, admiring the almost cartoon like graphics, and you will almost immediately begin to understand how the narrative will not only push you forward, but takes time to entertain you when you decide to step aside and spend your time exploring a level.  At one point in the first level, I decided to just break everything, and after a few minutes of doing so, the narrator kindly applied the line to his story,  &quot;And the kid just raged for a while.&quot;  And that, Is what sold me.  This is not a cheaply done gimmick where you hear the same voice actor repeating lines and announcing for the 100th time that you&apos;ve killed a baddie.  This is effort. And that, I do believe, is all it takes to make the gaming community respond with enthusiasm.  So put you big pants on EA,  And stop trying to sell a game to the general masses, dumbing it down, and spoon feeding it to anyone you can impress with a new sims expansion, And take one out of the books from the little guys.   All you need to focus on, Is making a game that is fun to play.  In the age of information, marketing has no place in the development stage.  When a game is good.  We will hear about it, one way or another.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1810691">Expand</a></span>

The story is great...as you probably have heard yet, there is a narrator through the whole story to tell the story and to give tips.

The narration and the visuals blend in to the overall wonderful feeling of this game. Does the gameplay suffer because of this? Not at all. The controls are smooth and simple, giving you the whole fun of a hack and slash game. An Indie game that greatly surpasses big titles out there.</span>

Now, I&apos;m not a fan of hack-n-slash gaming nor of RPGs; but Bastion got through my initial prejudice. It manages to strike just the right balance between action that&apos;s never repetitive, almost always challenging without demotivating, and just plain fun; character development and upgrades that keep you engaged and looking to experiment without overwhelming you with options; and above all, a compelling and immersing story that keeps you wanting to find out what happens next.  The graphics are beautiful even if not state-of-the-art. The game is displayed in an animated pseudo-3D isometric view, with some cut scenes hand-drawn. This isn&apos;t your latest realistic FPS with the latest GFX, but it suits the game just fine. My only issue here is that the character&apos;s movement sometimes seems robotic and reminiscent of 90&apos;s-style frame-animated isometric shooters.<br><br><br>The soundtrack -- a pretty important element for me in games -- passes my &quot;Will I listen to this later?&quot; test with flying colors. In fact I&apos;m going to buy it despite the relatively steep price compared to the game itself ($10 for the OST, $15 for the game, and no actual discount when buying the two together). The story, as mentioned, is the heart of the game. It unfolds slowly, bit by bit, in the narrator&apos;s old, raspy voice, mirroring and shedding light on your actions. This ambitious concept could&apos;ve gone wrong in so many ways, and yet the folks at Supergiant Games got it pretty near perfect, to the point that it is an almost profound experience at times. The narration is a huge boost to the storytelling aspect of the game and makes it that much easier to immerse yourself in it, but that won&apos;t be worth anything without a good story, which Bastion luckily has. Like Braid before it, Bastion knows how to tell a good story, using your in-game actions to advance the plot -- but not always in the way you expected, making you wonder who&apos;s playing with whom. I think this element could&apos;ve been used a little more heavily, but I&apos;m still very happy with the result. The game play is intuitive and simple, yet complex enough to keep your interest. There are a variety of different mechanics all interacting with each other, so you never sink into a repetitive routine or &quot;farming&quot;. Sometimes it feels a little too linear -- most maps basically have a single path you&apos;ll have to go through -- but then, when it matters, the game presents you with some tough choices and lets you choose without bias and with no obvious right or wrong answers. All in all, it&apos;s an very enjoyable game that doesn&apos;t require a huge commitment but certainly leaves its mark on you. I&apos;m definitely going to play the last part again to explore some other choices, and then there&apos;s &quot;New Game Plus&quot; which promises a different experience altogether (haven&apos;t tried it yet). Supergiant definitely made an effort to provide replay value here and that&apos;s appreciated. Even without it, the primary story line is good enough that I&apos;d be completely content to just wrap it up, 3 days after I started playing, with just the story and the soundtrack as memories of the experience. So, aside from some minor issues, I think this is a pretty amazing game, definitely worth its price. Try out the demo if you haven&apos;t yet, and then go play the real thing. You&apos;ll be richer for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1982638">Expand</a></span>

The only negative thing I can think of is that the &quot;new-game plus&quot; feature just doesn&apos;t really do it for me in terms of adding replayability.    But for a game that can be had on Steam right now for less than $3, this title is well worth the money, even if you only get one play-through.</span>

The little details sprinkled throughout the game such as artifacts, and the &quot;Who Knows Where&quot; reflections give so much life to the story that I was immersed. There&apos;s nothing complicated about Bastion and that&apos;s what makes it elegant. The story is, for the most part, simple and easy to follow, and focuses more on the emotional aspect. The art and soundtrack work to the games advantage here, and create a wonderful and immersive experience. The best part of Bastion is that everybody will take something different out of it. Some people will revel in the well-tuned hack and smash gameplay (side note: the game does a good job mixing up the combat system throughout the game and making the player feel powerful), some people will feel enchanted by the music and art, and others will be taken aback by the sheer emotional depth to the plot. There are just enough decisions throughout the game to make it interesting, and the quality of the ending is something all game developers should strive to emulate. I had goosebumps, if that&apos;s any indicator. Overall a spectacular game that deserves every bit of praise it gets. The primary downsides of it are that it can get a tad repetitive, depending on how often you switch up your weapons, and some players might be annoyed with one of the turns in the plot (I won&apos;t spoil anything). These faults are fairly minor though, and I had no problem cruising through this game in a state of total bliss. Very solid 9/10,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3114276">Expand</a></span>

Unlocking some really cool weapons as you go along the levels, being able to hold two at a time and also being able to unleash a special ability. What really made me indulge into the game was it&apos;s sheer simplicity, the more you play the more you want to go on. It is not a very long game but the experience is worth it. Yes, yes, you could say the game is easy, I&apos;ve heard that numerous times before. But that is only a small problem as you could add shrines to increase the games difficulty.
<br>All in all, A really great indie game, a must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2911154">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The history line is all based on the dialog of the narrator, Rucks, one of the survivors. The history is beautiful and fascinating, though confusing and one might easily get lost (lots of parts of the narration is done in the middle of the action, that makes hard to pay attention in the plot). The characters (as well as the protagonist) are completely silent , but impressively charismatics, due to the narration.
<br>
<br>The Arts are AMAZING: the concept art is something beyond the limits, the graphics are lovely and the Soundtrack is perfect. The narrative, graphics and sound are perfectly engaged one with each other, making the conjunct being something near perfection.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is good. One has twelve options of weapons, with up to ten upgrades (which you choose 5), each one specific for each situation. You have also the secret skill, which is related to the weapon you are holding. The fights are dynamic, though repetitive. The training camps and &quot;Who Knows Where&quot; add to the game some dynamics and parallel activities, leaving the linearity of the game. You can also buy stuff, change the level of difficulty of the levels (in a extremely creative way I must say), upgrade weapons, add some spirits (items that gives you some special abilities) and talk to the survivors (when you collect some mementos).
<br>
<br>The game itself is quite linear, with some levels where you have to try over and over again to complete. Besides this tiring characteristic, the variety of options, mixed with the perfection of the Art elements (sound, concept and graphic) and the brilliant narrative, makes Bastion a &quot;must have played&quot; game for all the lovers of good games.

Bastion has a refreshing narrative which keeps you gripped throughout the game, with thanks to the narrator in the background. The soundtrack for it is absolutely gorgeous and is one of those soundtracks which will be stuck in your head for weeks.

The game layout and pacing are good, always allowing players to get back into the action with little slowdown. The way the story unfolds with a commentator commentating on events and the players actions is original and provides some good context to the story. There even are some nice touching moments in the story and atmosphere which may start to pull the emotion strings a little. The graphics and music are very good featuring a nice art style with an original mix of western and anime. The weapons and game play are very fun and its great to have challenges that give the player the chance to get good at all weapons while being rewarded. The game makers of Bastion were really on to something but I cant help but feel that while the story is good, given its potential it could have done more and been truly great and awesome. I also feel that more could have been further done with the emotion felt by the events of the story but how much more can we expect from a small Indy developer?

I was expecting a bright hack-and-slash game along the lines of Torchlight and instead got a piece of art that inspired in me true feelings of courage and compassion. This is clearly not the game for everyone, judging by the few negative user scores on here, but you need to understand what this game is trying to deliver in order to appreciate it. Bastion is an Action RPG, yes, but the mechanics of the game are ultimately designed as a device to deliver the story. The mechanics of the different weapons themselves were varied enough that I had a lot of fun testing out and mastering new loadout combinations. The game really shines, however, when you pay close attention to the adaptive narrator, and to the scripted scenes. The juxtaposition of the somber and gritty story and the bright and fantastic art design is accomplished in an amazing manner and just seems to add greater depth to the story of Caelondia and the Ura and the rest of their world. The timing and pace of the story are perfect, even more so that they are designed to progress based upon the character&apos;s actions. It really makes you feel as though you are experiencing and creating the story, rather than tapping buttons and watching a screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2091750">Expand</a></span>

But this game really hooked me in from the beginning, it&apos;s story is melancholic yet hopeful, it&apos;s art style is reminiscent of Korean cartoons that I&apos;ve watched and the game play is pretty entertaining. The one standout feature of this game is the soundtrack which is head and shoulders above any game soundtrack I&apos;ve heard. Unlike most games which have just a generic &quot;epic&quot; music score, this game&apos;s soundtrack is varied, very interesting and blends many music styles together.<br><br>Altogether, it&apos;s a great game.

In all this I still think there was a bit too much monotony to the game, and it was shorter than I expected.  The character modifications were too few also.  I enjoyed the idea of having special levels just to get a good challenge with the weapons.  The overall western-dystopia genre is very polished in this one.</span>

It join&apos;s up with Braid, Capsized and Limbo in the elite, handcrafted, polished and hand-painted 2D games of this generation. A unique aspect of this game is the highly detailed narration. It engages you like few games can, and adds a totally different look on the story. Immediately, it connects you with the main character giving you a portal into the character of his personal thoughts that you wouldn&apos;t otherwise have. It seamlessly creates a story book feel while at the same time it feels like you are writing the narrators lines before your eyes. Even if you find a path that isn&apos;t the main one, or you just spam buttons or sit there, the narrator will comment about it. The controls are very straightforward, with an easy-to-grasp tutorial at the beginning. The music is something stellar as well, and it brings you into the mood of the character. I gave it a 9/10 because there is not much replay-ability. The price could possibly be lowered $5 for this reason. That&apos;s the only flaw I have with this game.<br><br>Check the demo out on Steam!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724436">Expand</a></span>

There are no cutscenes or discussions, because everything happens while you are fighting your way through the stages.
<br>
<br>The graphics are top-notch, hand-drawn 2D goodness and animations are perfect. On top of all these goodies, the gameplay delivers as well. The gameplay is solid and easy to learn, but it might get a bit repetitive if you don&apos;t change your weapons that often.
<br>
<br>Bastion isn&apos;t without downsides. It has a few very annoying features like the fact that you can&apos;t replay stages/challenges once you have completed them. You are also forced to lose one of your weapon when you find a new one in the stages, because the new weapon replaces one of the old ones. The game is quite short also, about 6-10 hours depending how well you want to search the places. Replayability is average even with the newgame+.
<br>
<br>To sum it up: Bastion is a game with a solid gameplay and an excellent groundbreaking storytelling-element, which I&apos;m sure will be copied in the future. If you like Zeldas, secret of mana or other &quot;old-schoolish-RPGs&quot;, be sure to try this one out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739871">Expand</a></span>

While the game&apos;s story consists of linear missions, there&apos;s plenty of customisation with the game&apos;s weapon and skill system, along with optional distractions such as weapons training courses and a flash-back mode to get extra bits and pieces of the story.  With it&apos;s modest $15 price tag, Bastion is difficult not to recommend, and with a demo available there&apos;s little reason not to try it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729020">Expand</a></span>

One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play. 9 out of 10 for this excellent indie game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749289">Expand</a></span>

While I paid two dollars I can say with out a tinge of lying, that I would pay well over 30 dollars if not more, to experience a game like Bastion. The way this game puts you in a world suffering from a disaster and tells you to fix it. With the narration, the characters, and stories behind every little item you find. You grow attached to this world and the people who are left living in it. It causes you to care for the creatures, even the ones that try to kill you... Then it gives you decisions.... Decisions that turn your world in circles... I give this game a ten out of ten, hands down the best single player gaming experience I&apos;ve had in my life. Thank you Super Giant games, thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3373207">Expand</a></span>

They tend to have an interesting concept but they flounder when trying to deliver on it. I am delighted to say that Bastion is one of the most, if not THE most, satisfying games I have played in recent memory. I&apos;m not just limiting that to indie games, I mean games overall. That&apos;s right, I&apos;m putting the quality of Bastion up against that of AAA studios that have gobs more money to work with and Bastion is coming out on top. The visual style hearkens back to a simpler time when games weren&apos;t all about bump maps and huge polygon counts. The art is sharp, colorful, and interesting. The action is exciting, tight, and can be quite challenging when using all of the idols. The music is some of the best that I&apos;ve heard from any game, bar none. The choice of implementing the stylistic narrator is arguably one of the most distinct features of the game, and for good reason, it injects real flavor into the game.<br><br>TL;DR: I enjoyed every minute of Bastion. I did a new game+ and enjoyed every minute of that as well. The game is worth every cent of the asking price and then some. The industry needs more gems like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1758913">Expand</a></span>

This game is probably one of the best games that i have played in a long long time... don&apos;t let its art and cartoony looks fool you, there is some very serious story telling in this game.  The narrator (Rucks, a main charactor in the game) shows you to the refuge of bastion after a calamity happened and wiped out most of your people ( and the enemies people, the Ura).  You have to build this refuge by collecting these blue large shards and bring the bastion into full restoration mode.  This game has my full attention and it is not a game you take lightly.  There is plenty of action and it is strictly storylined base so i suggest you buy it...hell if i know you well enough i&apos;ll pay half of it for you...

The game doesn&apos;t seem to recognize just any gamepad  within the options menu. Only xbox controllers are compatible it appears, I&apos;am using a Logitech dual action controller. I figured this is something that will get fixed in a patch later on. Now on with the review, I have to start off by saying from the opening story that this game rocks serious butt. The simple interface/engine is very unique and immersive from the start, the narrator is simply awesome, extremely funny and very much adds to the cool atmosphere. I think the soundtrack is the best in the business acrossed all platforms against any game, the learning curve is beautiful and this is the best indie game period to date. If you wonder if the $15 price tag is way too much for this game you need your gaming head examined, the price is too cheap and the game is not super long but perfect for the enjoyment you will recieve. Replay value is way up with this game as well so listen on steam you have access to the demo of the game go grab and get hooked, then purchase and start achieving the glow baby! 10 out of 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1723949">Expand</a></span>

Maybe the narrator is a good idea, but I like when a story is told with nice cut-scenes, taking a break in the game. And that voice is just annoying after a little while. The controls are not very good and I keep falling down the platforms. The gameplay is not interesting: you keep doing the same actions over and over. You just have to switch weapons sometimes. The tentative RPG options are a failure: weapons and augmentations are very limited and anyways you sort of need to get them at some point; so there is little choice to make by yourself. The story is very boring, I had to force myself to finish it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668931">Expand</a></span>

And because I&apos;d much rather go play new game plus for the third time, I&apos;m not going to prove my point! The gameplay is simplistic, yet fast paced, enough to keep the adrenaline pumping and forcing you to be quick. And, if you find it too easy, you can always evoke the gods (via a shrine) to increase the difficulty in ways that add regeneration to them, or damage, or speed. Things like that. The story... That is what kept me going so strong. The voice of the narrator (Logan Cunningham) is utterly brilliant. My first thought was I&apos;d be afraid of listening to the man talk about everything I did but.. I began doing things for the sole purpose of finding out -if- he would say something. And most of the time, he did. The music is utterly amazing as well. I&apos;ve listened to the soundtrack so many times on their webpage, but haven&apos;t had the ability to buy it yet. It&apos;s a unique list of songs, and all go amazingly with the game itself. There are some powerful and emotional moments in this game. Moments you will probably never forget, and I give it a 10/10 for the fact that I&apos;ve played through it twice so far, and it&apos;s still holding me to it. Supergiant games has made a masterpiece with its first creation. Makes me wonder what they&apos;ll make next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739106">Expand</a></span>

Game play wise it doesn&apos;t do much new, but what it does do it does well. Mechanically it is a strong action RPG with a few nice touches such as a decent selection of varied weapons all of which are fully upgradable, the ability to pick your own difficulty by worshiping certain gods, a home base which can be upgraded throughout the course of the game, and a spirit (drink not ectoplasm) based system which lets you tailor the main character to your own tastes. The game itself is focused almost completely on having you fight through levels and upgrade various things so you can fight through more levels, while this might sound boring to some the constant stream of upgrades keep it fresh as you unlock new weapons and abilities which keeps you wondering what the next reward will be. As stated previously though if you play this game from a purely mechanical view point you will be disappointed, in fact if you can&apos;t appreciate anything but the core mechanics of a game knock about 2 or 3 points off of the score now, while they are strong enough that the game aspect never feels boring they are by no means revolutionary. Where this game shines is the presentation, everything from the narration and story, to the art and music is completely top notch and experiencing more of it is what really drove the game forward for me. All of the levels appear to be hand painted affairs which rival the art in games such as Braid and Capsized, they consist of parts of a once prosperous but now shattered floating city, the parts of which  literally fall into place as you explore the landscape, an effect which doesn&apos;t seem to get old. As you explore the levels the narrator, a husky sounding southern gentleman, explains what you are seeing and how the word used to be, occasionally commenting upon your own actions which really brings you into the game, and I spent a good while trying out different things (such as purposely throwing myself off of a platform) just to see how he would respond. The music is brilliant as well, generally very western sounding (as in wild west) mixed with more contemporary beats and occasionally an almost bangra flavor, the stand out tracks for me though were they 3(ish) songs which sound beautiful and are also very relevant to the characters and their stories. The story itself was good enough to make me invest in the characters and the world and had enough subtle twists that I found it genuinely interesting and cared about how the characters would be effected by the unfolding events.
<br>
<br>There were only two things which really bugged me, the first was the 3D models of the main character and the enemies, though adequate I felt they stood out like sore thumb against the beautiful backdrops of the broken world, and the second was the ease with which you could fall of platforms in some situations, however as the game is quite forgiving this wasn&apos;t really a massive problem.
<br>
<br>Overall if your eyes and ears work and you can enjoy a game based on its being beautiful as well as being a good game mechanically then this one is definitely for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739336">Expand</a></span>

Also, just to say about the comment &quot;DantheMan&quot; made; you CAN use a 360 controller (and most likely others) to play the game. So please don&apos;t make it seem like it is keyboard only. To go with that; its not a game that is really suitable for mouse use (imo)</span>

I don&apos;t own a console myself, so I can&apos;t really compare the two versions.<br>The game starts out with the kid waking up to a world that is falling apart. The calamity is here. You are immediately greeted with stunning visuals. The hand painted backgrounds with their many colors combined with the somewhat chaotic feel of a world in pieces, where the ground sort of rises before your feet give the game a great atmosphere that fits the game well.<br>The sound is amazing and I recommend you go buy the soundtrack. It&apos;ll be worth it. It sort of has a western theme to it.<br>The most important aspect of this game is probably that it&apos;s more the telling of a story than anything else. Sure, the combat system is fun and fast paced but there isn&apos;t really much depth to it. No, the most important thing is the story and how it&apos;s told, and that&apos;s the most interesting part. The game is narrated by a stranger you meet and his voice is just godly. It&apos;s like caramel running through your ears. He gives the story a whole lot of depth as you move along in the game while commenting on your actions in a way that I&apos;ve never seen done before. The stranger is a character of his own, he&apos;s not just &quot;the voice in your head&quot;. He actually has a purpose in this story.<br>If you&apos;d like to spend a few hours on a great story then go ahead, buy this game, you won&apos;t regret it. Just don&apos;t expect too much from the gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bastion/user-reviews?user_review_id=1846343">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well done indie developers, keep up the great work!</span>

Cool narrator, good story, many weapons and skills, and many cool new and fresh ideas. Pair that with a fantastic soundtrack and gorgeous full HD 2D graphics, and you&apos;ll get the best bang for the buck in a long time. And it has a lot of replayability too!</span>
