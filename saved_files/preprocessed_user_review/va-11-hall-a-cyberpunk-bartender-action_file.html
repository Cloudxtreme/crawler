Making friends where you can, dealing with tragedies, experiencing both the best and worst parts that life has to offer, all while trying to pay off your damn bills before your power gets cut or your landlord evicts you. With a great soundtrack, strong characters, a really appealing artstyle, a nailed cyberpunk style, and great tone, this game has a lot to offer.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also one of the few to nail an online message board depiction without being overly forced or cringey, so, that&apos;s a plus too.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend at the very least picking up and playing the demo and maybe seeing a clip of the first day or two if you&apos;re not sure if you wanna buy it yet, but this is a game that I want to see more of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/va-11-hall-a-cyberpunk-bartender-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=6576907">Expand</a></span>

The characters aren&apos;t bland or boring. The artwork and artstyle is cute and neat. The game is actually pretty fun and doesn&apos;t take itself too serious.</span>

And I&#x2019;m delighted that the full version has, so far, surpassed all my expectations and hopes.
<br>
<br>VA-11 Hall-A is kind of hard to pin down. At heart, it&#x2019;s basically a visual novel, but rather than making binary choices that filter you off down one of several discrete routes, the choices you make as protagonist Jill when going about her daily life at home and at work affect what happens next in the story, including the characters you encounter, how Jill gets along with her clients and co-workers and how everyone reacts to the events unfolding in the backdrop.
<br>
<br>Interestingly, VA-11 Hall-A presents its overarching narrative almost entirely from the perspective of Jill behind the bar and in her apartment. Significant things happen in the world, but you don&#x2019;t see them directly; instead, you tend to see the people involved immediately before and/or after the events, or read about them on the news web pages and forums the morning after. Sometimes whether or not you dosed them up with alcohol before the event in which they were involved has an effect, too; prepare to feel guilty if that happens!
<br>
<br>To give too many examples would be to spoil the experience, so I&#x2019;ll leave it at this: VA-11 Hall-A does a much better job of almost any visual novel I can name at making its world feel &#x201C;alive&#x201D; and like the actions you take actually matter, rather than simply picking a route through the story. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with the latter approach, of course, but this way of doing things helps keep the people who expect a bit more in the way of traditional &#x201C;gameplay&#x201D; happy as well as those of us who are along for the ride primarily from a narrative perspective.
<br>
<br>To sum up: great writing, wonderful characterisation, superb music and a glorious, beautiful PC-88 style aesthetic (with perfect pixel aspect ratio even scaled up to 1920&#xD7;1080) makes for an absolutely lovely, unconventional and entirely memorable game.
<br>
<br>I adore VA-11 Hall-A and pray with all my heart that it sees the success it deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/va-11-hall-a-cyberpunk-bartender-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507745">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yeah, that&#x2019;s who you&#x2019;re playing as.
<br>
<br>Valhalla is less of a game and more of a visual novel; the only &#x201C;gamish&#x201D; aspect of it is mixing drinks for patrons. This is really nothing more than following directions 90%+ of the time; rarely, they will give you something you need to think about (usually &#x201C;the usual&#x201D;, requiring you to remember what your patrons liked the last time, but sometimes they&#x2019;ll try to be tricky and ask you for something specific &#x2013; cold and sweet (so some sweet-tasting drink with ice in it), or even for something more obscure based off of something someone said previously).
<br>
<br>Alas, this is the limit of the game&#x2019;s interactivity. While there are a handful of times you can give someone another drink and get a different reaction out of them, mostly you are just following orders and clicking through what amounts to a visual novel.
<br>
<br>And this would be fine if it was actually a good visual novel. Unfortunately, it isn&#x2019;t.
<br>
<br>The game has a cast of characters, and the characters actually do have character. Gil, Jill&#x2019;s coworker, is a man with a mysterious past which is played for laughs, as your boss Dana is constantly trying to figure out what the deal with him is, while simultaneously Jill worries over him a bit. Dana herself is a boisterous bit of comedy relief herself, but she has a good head on her shoulders and is a good person, albeit one who also relies on the &#x201C;mysterious past&#x201D; gag a bit. Jill herself is a kind of sad girl at times, but she has a particular sense of humor (she finds the Bad Touch drink amusing, and she enjoys puns) and she certainly plays off of and teases other people a bit, even while she is grumpy at other times &#x2013; and a bit more troubled than she lets on by her own past (which takes a bit to come up). Jill also definitely has a crush on her boss, which lends a slight tilt towards some of their interactions.
<br>
<br>The patrons also have character &#x2013; there&#x2019;s Dorothy, the Lilim (android &#x2013; or I suppose gynoid, seeing as she&#x2019;s female) sex worker. She is a complete pervert, but is just so cheerful about it that she really is the high point of the game, grossing out Jill with her stories while simultaneously amusing her and showing just how much she cares. Dorothy genuinely cares about Jill, and Jill cares about Dorothy as well. Alma is another patron who shows up a lot, a female hacker who just got out of a bad relationship and who is another friend of Jill&#x2019;s. As the game goes on, you meet a lot of other people, some of them fairly forgettable, others who stick out just for their weirdness (and rely too much on it for their characterization), others who just show up and leave without leaving much of an impact on the player, and one, a kindly White Knight (basically a paramedic/rescue worker) named Sei who you end up worrying about after some bad stuff goes down, along with her catgirl friend Stella.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem with this is that while some of the characters actually do build up some emotional bonds with the player, it ultimately doesn&#x2019;t feel like it goes much of anywhere. Around a third of the way through the game, something bad happens to Sei, and the characters worry about them&#x2026; but ultimately, while the plot seems like it is going to be some big thing, it doesn&#x2019;t go anywhere. There&#x2019;s a hacker called White_Rabbit who is involved with that whole thing, but they seem to just kind of fade out of the plot, and you never actually interact with them in person, just read news stories about them in the paper. Alma complains about White_Rabbit towards the beginning, and then as it fades from prominence she starts talking about other things. A plot about Jill&#x2019;s ex-girlfriend comes up, leaves, comes back, then leaves again before returning at the very end of the game, and is the closest thing there is to a main plot &#x2013; but it only really involves a couple characters.
<br>
<br>And this is really where the game fails. There just isn&#x2019;t a point to it. There&#x2019;s no overarching plot tying it all together. A glitch girl who keeps showing up seems like she might be related to the whole thing, but the subplot doesn&#x2019;t ultimately go anywhere interesting, and I never really ended up caring about her beyond &#x201C;Why is she important?&#x201D; There&#x2019;s no real payoff with Jill&#x2019;s feelings towards her boss, nor Dorothy&#x2019;s feelings towards Jill. You never find out what the real deal was with Gil or Jill&#x2019;s boss.
<br>
<br>In the end, there&#x2019;s nothing that ties the lives of the characters together beyond brief interactions, and in the end, there&#x2019;s not some way that this all gets tied together into any sort of coherent story. Even the plot that the bar is going to shut down at some point in the indefinite future gets no payoff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/va-11-hall-a-cyberpunk-bartender-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=7266279">Expand</a></span>
