I can honestly say this is one of the first tower games I&apos;ve played that gave me the same excitement I felt as a kid.  The developers are also very responsive on the steam forums.  If you loved playing Sim Tower as a kid pick up Project Highrise - you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span>

I checked the forum to see if there were any redeeming qualities and immediately found a (locked) thread about poor balance and bugs.

<br>Balancing the many (many) needs of your tenants, along with designing something aesthetically pleasing is deceptively difficult. It&apos;s true that there&apos;s not much variation between room types, but the workshop will soon sort that out.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s ALWAYS something wanting your attention and I&apos;ve already been playing for a few hours and it feels like five minutes.
<br>
<br>There are lots of different types of offices, restaurants, shops and apartments to build, each influencing something near it in different ways.
<br>
<br>For example;
<br>
<br>One office wants greater variety in restaurants that serve dinner, you plop it down and the guy next to him starts to complain about the smell.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the restaurant complains because they can&apos;t empty their rubbish, so you pop a rubbish bin down; the guy near that starts to moan about the smell and next to the restaurant has become too noisy so one of your tenants demands a rent decrease.
<br>
<br>I love this sort of thing because it absorbs you for hours. I really love this game - I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a perfect balance to be struck with placement but I&apos;m yet to find it. I&apos;m enjoying the search though!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-highrise/user-reviews?user_review_id=6752011">Expand</a></span>
