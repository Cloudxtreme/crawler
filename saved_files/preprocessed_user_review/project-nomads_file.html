Junky controls and boring combat, paired by missions that can be either mildly interesting, or outright tedious. Still, it is one of my most memorable games due to its uniqueness and style. Upgrading your island is fun at the start till the midpoint of the game, where you hit max capacity and upgrading means only meshing together artifacts of the same type, to increase their level. Character choice matters little in terms of variation, but plenty in terms of firepower. John&apos;s machine guns feel too weak compared to Suzie&apos;s and Goliath&apos;s.
<br>Making your island larger or better armored and styled would go a long way. Your buildings are too vulnerable at times, they can easily be wiped and be irreplaceable. I find myself often having to fly ahead and clear enemy defenses with my aircraft, which is also pretty simplistic. It could also use more variation in terms of 3rd-person combat with your character, albeit it was clearly unrefined as a mechanic as a whole.
<br>Exploring for artifacts can sometimes be one of the more fun aspects of the game.  I absolutely hated though the Shark level and the vortex following that, it only made for frustration, especially with the bad &quot;formation&quot; detection mechanic. You will find yourself very often abusing the save/load mechanic because you missed a bomber coming your way, or you jumped too short, or your turrets blew up and they cannot be replaced.
<br>Flying only in predetermined paths with your island also feels pretty restrictive,it could use more player-driven choice.   Soundtrack is mediocre as you would expect, although it has a uniqueness of its own. I cannot speak for the multiplayer as I never had the chance to try it.
<br>Overall, memorable concept and idea, pretty unpolished execution. I&apos;d adore a refined sequel of this,  and even though it has plenty of problems , it is worth playing through for the experience it offers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-nomads/user-reviews?user_review_id=7467881">Expand</a></span>
