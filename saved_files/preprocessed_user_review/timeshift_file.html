In fact, I got through half the game before I was fully able to exploit the time controls to get out of sticky situations.  Buy this one now, especially you can get it so cheaply on sites like Ebay.</span>

On the surface, yes it&apos;s an above average FPS with a gimmick but the gimmick on this one is the stuff that lesser (and some greater) games dream of.</span>

Multiplayer is like a completely different game, but no less fun. A must buy for any gamer looking for a unique shooter.</span>

A variety of enemies with different abilities and tactics, and a hands-off predator-style gameplay that makes no bones about how to play it. To describe it one word: &apos;Fun.&apos; The story is obtuse and hard to get into, even if there&apos;s nothing new about the writing, and I&apos;d love to have seen a some more uses for the time-reversal ability. Where this game falls short for me is that the time abilities don&apos;t always mesh well with the gunplay. Using them in the vehicle sections and bypassing traps and hazards is where the game really shines, and the game could have used more of them or a more physical combat system akin to Mirror&apos;s Edge or Assassin&apos;s creed... A game which uses giant zeppelins and crimson-skies inspired planes, was just begging for a swashbuckling fight on board a giant air craft. But these are wishes for a different game. As it stands, TimeShift was worth it, and something I would play again and again simply because it is of a kind which comes around only so often. Enough potential in it&apos;s current form but begging for so much more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/timeshift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749260">Expand</a></span>

With the poor content delivery for online, and troubles and infact the inability to even patch the game makes this game extremely difficult to even play. The gameplay is poor, graphics are way behind for what it requires and the actual gameplay is lacking a great deal. I would not recommend this game to anyone.</span>

And when you do choose the slow down, pause, or reverse time you just run up to an enemy and shoot them in the face a few times. It gets a little repetitive. That said, I have recommended it to people with consoles who can rent it.</span>

<br>
<br>[SPOILER WARNING]
<br>The story is quite basic and you&apos;ll learn more along the way but the movies often just show short sentences like &quot;He checked the suit yesterday, and wanted to revert to old style?! Why is that?&quot;.
<br>
<br>The ending is one of the lousiest I&apos;ve seen, with absolutely no real bossfight, just a standard shoot some bad guys, and then run left/right and avoid missiles. You don&apos;t even get to kill the bad guy. And while you&apos;re actually glad to finally be back in your own universe the damn AI suddenly decides to timeshift to prevent a paradox...
<br>[SPOILER END]
<br>
<br>The audio setup was bad as if you play on standard settings you&apos;ll not be able to hear the radio chatter.
<br>
<br>It feels as if the game is lacking features, like &quot;intercepting enemy radio&quot; feature as the  S.S.A.M even announces it near the beginning of the game but nothing happens.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what they thought of when they thought of the story (probably Half-Life) but having you assaigned to missions without even talking to people really is weird if you have no real reason for it (Gordon did, TimeShift-dude didn&apos;t).
<br>
<br>Half of the pussles of the game are just push-a-button-and-run-across type of play since the AI knows what&apos;s best almost every time. I actually needed to press manualy one time throughout the whole game (thanks for that AI, took me 20 min to figure out that you where wrong).
<br>
<br>Most of the time the timeshifting abilities where great but you lacked a better use of the Rewind Time ability, since when you die you do it quickly and with almost no option of pressing the rewind keys.
<br>
<br>Do not expect anything huge from it. It can be very addicting at first time but after you&apos;ve beaten it once there is just a slim chance you&apos;ll play it again within a month.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/timeshift/user-reviews?user_review_id=67603">Expand</a></span>

The time-related &quot;puzzles&quot; are all canned, as the game tells you which power to use and there is no other way past them. Even if you see another way that seems perfectly logical, invisible walls will force you to take the route the developers intended. The AI dosen&apos;t really go beyond &quot;stand still and shoot&quot;, &quot;charge straight ahead and shoot&quot; and &quot;follow pre-scripted cover commands&quot;. The actual time-manipulation tricks are good fun for a while, but make the game far too easy. Add ridiculously powerful, unbalanced weapons (did a game that allows you to slow down time really need an auto-sniper with no downtime between rounds?) and you end up with a package that will appeal to genre newcomers or those who beat HL:E2 and need some affable fodder to slug through before Crysis arrives. Unless you really need another FPS immediately, wait for the barrage of titles hitting shelves throughout the holiday season or wait for the price to drop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/timeshift/user-reviews?user_review_id=404498">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game itself is short and the learning fast and difficult spike is not high. I finished it and my only regret was the very shallow storyline. Still, Sierra did a very good job, IMHO as this game is worth a 8/10, specially for its innovative system and thus it is recommended for the casual player of FPS, like me.
<br>
<br>Thanks Sierra for this good game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/timeshift/user-reviews?user_review_id=6901270">Expand</a></span>
