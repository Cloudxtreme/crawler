<br>
<br>Mounts are designed to be the main feature and it shows. Each mount is unique and maps are designed specifically with their strengths and weaknesses in mind. Swapping between them is a joy and as you unlock their abilities, you discover new places you can reach.
<br>
<br>The maps are filled to the brim with locations to explore and enemies to fight. Diverse combinations of enemies can pose varying risks depending on your skill choices and some are their own little puzzle.
<br>
<br>Path of Fire unlocks the joy within a game that was already vastly improved under new design direction and marks what I can only hope is a golden age ahead. Now is the time to dive headlong into the world of Tyria. TO VABBI!

<br>
<br>The game evolved since launch, that&apos;s true, but at quite a slow pace.
<br>
<br>The expansion stories were a lot shorter than the main one and a lot more convoluted.
<br>
<br>The new classes that were added with the expansions are a bit of a fresh air, but ANet doesn&apos;t know how to make them fit in the different aspects of the game (PVP, PVE, Raids).
<br>
<br>Spellbreaker from the last expansion doens&apos;t have a place in Raids, as an example. Scourge was so nerfed that it lost it&apos;s place in any raid for more than 3 months.
<br>
<br>ANet doesn&apos;t seem to test what they do and then it takes 2+ months for them to fix it.
<br>
<br>Classes are absurdly unbalanced in PVP, you can take an overpowered one and simply cheese you way to the top tiers.
<br>
<br>End game content (I include making new Legendary items, high level Fractals and Raid Wings in this category) are slow, very slow to come out. We had to wait 6 months for a new raid wing (had 4 before that), and ONE YEAR for 01 new fractal level. That is RIDICULOUS.
<br>The new legendary items are lackluster. As an example the new rifle and shield are simply garbage when compared to the previous ones. The medium legendary armor look absurdly crap, when compared with it&apos;s heavy and light counterparts.
<br>
<br>Now they decided and go heavy with the lootbox system. It was ALREADY present in the game, with Black Lion Chests, but now they decided to introduce Random Mounts for a price. When they are not random, which are 2 atm, they are extremely overpriced.
<br>
<br>Oh, and I forgot to mention that they slyly changed most of their servers to Amazon ones, giving most of their player base worse pings, while a minority ended up getting better pings, and they don&apos;t even acknowledge that.
<br>
<br>So yeah, that&apos;s it I guess. A game with potential, but huddled together with a greedy, lazy management.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7813930">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>While there are plenty of events, there is a lack of event chains and event achievements.
<br>
<br>Mastery exp is too easily gained (Down from 13.5mil to complete a track in HoT, to 2.5mil to complete a track in PoF? Need a happy medium).

<br>Once again, I overall loved this expansion and highly recommend it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7560363">Expand</a></span>

The expansion is a throwback to Guild Wars: Nightfall, having the player return to Elona for the first time in over 200 years. For any original Guild Wars players, this expansion is something you should definitely own. The new content is appealing to players of more traditional MMO&apos;s as well, with the long speculated introduction of a mount system that can be used in vanilla maps as well.
<br>
<br>Further new content includes 9 new elite specializations for the existing 9 classes, which can be unlocked through the new maps, or with skill point currency the player already owns. This makes character progression quick and much more enjoyable than most games. There are numerous new collections available which grant items and achievement points, many more than Heart of Thorns launched with. Arenanet has also introduced the bounty board system, which is an open-world group content system with repeatable contracts that allow you to hunt down a specific enemy for rewards greater than those you would find just by running through the maps blindly. These bounty targets have randomized effects attached to them akin to Diablo 3 elite prefixes. Because of this each bounty target has to be fought in a slightly different way.
<br>
<br>With Living World Season 4 launching in about 3 months, players can expect more content to come soon, with at least 4 major content patches scheduled next year, provided Arenanet can keep their 3 month release cadence. With the base game just passing two years of free-to-play status, Guild Wars 2 is still one of the best western MMO&apos;s on the market, and has much more content scheduled into the coming years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7557015">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>PoF is located in wounderfully crafted vast area where you can explore all different types of desert landscapes, take part in lot of events and hunt powerful creatures during bounty hunting. The story is a good step forward from what it was before, there are amazing mounts that each of them has special abilities and functions like springer that takes you to higher locations or jackal that allows you to teleport through sand portals across the map. And another huge feature is a new set of elite specialisations for each core proffesion which allows you to expand your playstyle with tons of new skills. Again if you have old expansion then you have 2 elite specs per profession for different playstyles. You can also play core builds which are also viable in lot of game areas.
<br>
<br>Another great point is that with PoF comes a new living world season (which happens between expansions) - this means that every 2-3 months we&apos;ll get new episode of story and stuff to do. Last season gave one map per episode, so we can expect this to happen as well. This brings a huuuuuge open world zones to explore and fresh content to fill time between expac releases.
<br>
<br>Come, see it for yourself. It&apos;s a great experience! Join the guild, spend time with people chasing bounties, discover tombs of ancient kings, find lost treasures!
<br>
<br>I strongly recommend to also try HoT. But be aware that HoT has a bit more challenging open world than PoF (which means hard to traverse maps and powerful mobs that easily kill you. But when you get use to how to kill them it&apos;s a lot of fun actually).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7559995">Expand</a></span>

<br>The thing with this game is every hour you put in is always worth, most other MMORPG would have made my comeback quite boring since I would have needed to grind all over the new content to get top tier armors and weapons. Not on gw2, once I got the grip and practised my mechanics again I was as good as I ever was, no repetitive grind.
<br>Other games, MOBAS like LoL or DotA you usually end up feeling as if you lost your time when you lose a game. This isn&apos;t what happens playing gw2 everything I do I know it&apos;s useful and will be even if I stop playing and come back 2 years later, which I doubt since the new xpac pof has been a blast to me, I&apos;ve been playing a lot since PoF was released and I&apos;m still shoched at how beautiful the maps are, story has been improved and the mounts have raised the whole game, even core to a new level of fun discovering maps.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m waiting paciently til the xpac raid is released (it&apos;s been stated to be a few weeks after release since it contains spoilers story related) because I had usually been just a raider in gw2, playing the weekly raid and that&apos;s it. Not anymore, I&apos;m having crazy fun playing regular PvE and I doubt it stops soon, 100% worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7560950">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m talking about deep references, even things that hardcore GW1 fans might have missed their first time through.
<br>
<br>So if you are like me and cared about the story ArenaNet were making way back in the mid-2000&apos;s, give this game a go now. It has come a long way from its initial launch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7554462">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s taken a long time for the game to find its footing, and there&apos;s still issues, but this is a seriously good MMO expansion.
<br>
<br>Mounts are fantastic. They handle well, have cool abilities, and are gorgeously animated. ANet has wisely moved away from multi-million xp mastery tracks, and you instead unlock most mount abilities fairly quickly. The difference is huge.
<br>
<br>There are no new dungeons. ANet appears to be wary of that type of content, after many failed attempts to balance rewards of its existing dungeons. They are focusing instead on Raids, which is a strange choice for a game with such enduringly poor profession balance. In a game like WoW, dps differences of 5% are seen as huge. Some GW2 professions can differ by more than 25% - it&apos;s a total farce.
<br>
<br>The new zones are expansive, and an absolute joy to explore. Exploration has always been what GW2 does best, and they fully committed to it in Path of Fire.
<br>
<br>The new elite specs are fun, although balance (of course) varies wildly.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t finished the story, but it&apos;s been great so far. At this point, Heart of Thorns was wrapping up, but Path of Fire is only in its second act. Much more satisfying.
<br>
<br>All around, it&apos;s the best MMO without a subscription you&apos;ll find.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551706">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty is at a good level, harder than base game and HoT, it&apos;s now as challenging as it should be and it may give players an incentive to group together in order to complete events rather than solo. The biggest letdown is the lack of map-wide metas, like the ones we got in HoT, and how that is going to affect replayability.</span>

<br>
<br>The maps are incredible, you needed maps like this, full of beauty, different ecosystems, new enemies and secrets, many secrets !!!
<br>
<br>The mounts give variety in the exploration and that always likes. I&apos;m glad we finally have them! As for the design of the mounts, I find it incredible, they are really well made and feel alive! that each one I have a different type of displacement contributes to this, since that happens in our world, each living being has some unique qualities in which it stands out for better or for worse.
<br>
<br>The events, there is everything from events very similar to those we already know, to totally new ones!
<br>
<br>New specializations bring a wealth of options at the time of combat, new builds can come out and change the Meta, which affects all types of game. They are different and not superior is the key to variety and that in pvp, for example do not always stick against the same builds (obviating higher levels, where the goal is the goal).
<br>
<br>As objects, I suppose that is what you can expect, materials, armor and weapons typical of new areas.
<br>
<br>And it allows access to the living world fourth season. No monthly fee!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551769">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>pros:
<br>Mounts are distinct from mounts in other mmorpgs , are fun too use and don&apos;t ruin the flow of the game.
<br>the new maps are beautiful and huge offering plenty of enjoyable content.
<br>cons:
<br>player population limit per map instance is still the same in the newer maps which are much bigger and so spread players out more.
<br>pvp and wvw mostly not expanded upon.</span>

But everything seems really high quality overall. Almost everything that had community acceptance can be seen in PoF. The maps are beautiful, the music amazing, the content really dense after the 1st map and mounts are probably one of the greatest features to be added in game. Exploring these maps are a treat. PoF is the kind of expansion that gets every little thing completely right.  Even the story, albeit a bit short, is of high quality, rewarding for lore buffs and well presented as opposed to HoT story that has been a bit problematic. Elites are also fun to play but it is too early to really give a critic on them. Overall PoF seems to worth every penny.
<br>
<br>My only two issues with the expansion is the lack of guild content. Guild missions need an update as they have been saturated and buggy for years and PoF would have been a great time to refresh them. Also I am a bit worried about the lack of map-wide meta events in the new maps. HoT maps metas are amazing experiences. It was really problematic that all of the maps were meta-wide maps. Thus reducing them and make PoF maps closer to core Gw2 is a good decision. But not even adding one such map-wide meta is the extreme on the other side. The ideal would be to have such an epic encounter only on one last map representing the peak of the story and lore process just like DS has done with HoT. Hopefully they will add such encounters in the future (LS4 should be coming soon) as they are one of the unique highpoints of the open PvE in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7545117">Expand</a></span>

<br>Classes get an additional &quot;specialization&quot;, which adds or changes some of the class&apos; mechanics. Whereas Heart of Thorns (1st expansion) focuses on map &quot;verticality&quot;, which is sort of like multi-level map layout, Path of FIre emphasizes map &quot;horizontality&quot;, that is it has new maps that are expansive and have diverse terrain. To help emphasize the experience, Path of Fire introduces a unique take on mounts. Mounts have innate abilities that help traverse certain terrain. Masteries are also included in this game, particularly for the mount system. Masteries are account wide progression that functions similar to a skill training system of some RPGs.
<br>
<br>Addendum 1: I forgot to mention it also added a bounty system, similar to hunting special monsters in the Monster Hunter series. Bounties offer a challenge for players who would like to defeat monsters with unique abilities and mechanics, similar to a raid level boss. Bounties could be done solo or with a group of players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7553276">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gorgeous wide open maps that encourage exploration.
<br>
<br>A better balance between solo and group content. You can actually get 100% map completion without having to ask for help in map chat like was necessary in HoT.
<br>
<br>An actual logical integration of the Mastery system via mounts. I was worried adding mounts to GW2 would be gimmicky, but they&apos;re absolutely not. Mounts are used for exploration and transportation and they enabled the maps to grow in size without the gimmicks of updraft gliding and other mastery travel options. If anything adding mounts makes the game feel less gimmicky and more natural.
<br>
<br>The new class specializations are unlocked faster and the new mastery trees for mounts are shorter than their HoT counterparts. This means you spend more time playing through new content and exploring than grinding levels for mastery points. This was a massive problem in HoT that gated content behind mastery skills and then forced players to grind. That grind is absent in Path of Fire. You generally get the basic masteries needed to unlock the majority of the content up front through exploring a new map. The progression is intuitive and occurs naturally. Grinding takes a back seat.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve not finished the story so won&apos;t be able to offer spoilers, but it seems the same stock storyline as we&apos;ve had since LWS2. The plot is interesting enough, but the dialogue often feels kinda dopey. They&apos;ve continued the full voice acting, which is nice provided you can stand the voice actor for your character. Unfortunately you continue to be &quot;along for the ride&quot; so to speak, with your character making decisions without your input. Not that this had any over-arching impact during the vanilla storyline, but it did help with immersion.
<br>
<br>All in all Path of Fire is a much more pleasant experience to HoT. The direction Arena Net chose to go in with this expansion hearkens back to what made the vanilla game so enjoyable and so novel, and throws in a hefty dash of nostalgia from revisiting old GW locations, along with a solid and inspired soundtrack, I feel this was the expansion we had all been waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551645">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now, all those core improvements and the features of HOT are unleashed in the desert, such that the game finally has enough endgame content. Best expansion ever.
<br>
<br>The -1 point is for the lack of new clases. Also, the PvP content could have used more love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551142">Expand</a></span>

Each elite spec. gives your character access to a new weapon and a lot of new skills. There are 5 new maps, which are the largest and best looking maps ArenaNet has created to date. These maps have a lot to do, with many events occurring to keep you busy. Mounts have been added, each with a unique skill to help traverse the desert. These mounts can be used in both the new expansion areas, and the old core and Heart of Thorns maps. The story is great, taking you to many places from Guild Wars 1, and many unique never-before-seen locations. But the expansion doesn&apos;t end there. New maps will be added every few months with the Living Story updates. These updates are free as long as you log-in before the next one is added (if you miss one, you can use in-game currency to buy them).
<br>
<br>The expansion doesn&apos;t add anything new PvP or WvW, but that&apos;s because those are updated regularly when new content is ready (for free, regardless of where you own the expansion or not). You don&apos;t need the expansion for these PvP and WvW updates, even someone who is F2P can play that new content. The same goes for Fractals (mini-dungeons which get progressively harder).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7542111">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Minor bugs here and there and a couple uninspiring elite specializations are so easily overlooked when playing the entirety of this expansion, especially when the price is also very reasonable. Overall, Guild Wars 2 is beginning to age nicely and it becomes abundantly clear with this expansion.  Finally, kudos to Anet for upholding their respectable vision and attitude towards their fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7553059">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s more cinematic than ever before, with interesting and engaging boss mechanics, a lot of &quot;I can&apos;t believe that just happened&quot; moments. There is a healthy dose of well-done humor too.
<br>The new maps are huge and filled with content (i`m a bit sad that there are no new map-wide metas, but heart of thorns was full of them, this now strikes a nice balance between exploration maps and meta maps). There are things waiting for you around every corner, you will have a blast exploring them.
<br>The new enemies are cool and interesting both visually and mechanically, would have been nice if a bit more work went in creating new branded enemy types, but overall that&apos;s a small detail.
<br>The mounts are AWESOME, each one has a different movement ability that lets you go to places you couldn&apos;t without them (for instance one mount jumps long distances forwards, one jumps up really high, one can &quot;run&quot; (kind of glide) over surfaces that would otherwise kill you, like quick sand, and one can use portals scattered around the maps.
<br>The new elite specs are also really cool, much more detailed than the heart of thorns ones, and some of them are so different that it feels like you are playing a totally new class. Balance is a bit off at the moment, since there are basically 9 new classes added, but that will be worked out with future content releases.
<br>Also, for anyone reading this review wondering if you should buy it, take into consideration that if you get it early enough, you will also get living world season 4 for free as it releases, all in the same price.
<br>Overall, I think pof is excellent and would recommend buying it any day</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7553633">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Story is captivating with top tier voice over work, HD cutscenes that calls back to the lore of GW1
<br>- Diverse content for casuals and diehards
<br>- Living World Episodes reoccurring 2 months later
<br>- No Sub Fee
<br>- Low expansion price for the sheer amount of content
<br>- New Elite Specializations

The new maps are a joy to explore with the addition of mounts. Those mounts also aren&apos;t just a boring speed boost. They all feel unique and have specific uses that make some better in situations than others. They&apos;re definitely important for traversing the new maps, not only for how they handle the dangerous terrains, but also because these maps are HUGE. Easily twice the size of the base game maps. I&apos;m not even close to 100% on any of them yet and I&apos;ve already put a good 20 hours in.
<br>
<br>The story is easily the best they&apos;ve done. The villain is actually interesting for once! The story actually has some interesting twists and turns and most importantly, it NAILS the ending. It has a satisfying conclusions whilst also keeping some important story threads around for Season 4 of the living world.
<br>
<br>Now why didn&apos;t I give this a perfect score? Well unfortunately, there don&apos;t appear to be any major world bosses. Bounties have taken their place here and while I think they may actually end up being more interesting in the long run (because of their randomization), they don&apos;t really have the spectacle of bosses like Tequatl or the huge organization needs of the Chak Garent (though some bounties definitely are very tough).
<br>
<br>Regardless of that one complaint, I&apos;m looking forward to playing through this again on another elite spec (I didn&apos;t mention those, but it&apos;s basically like adding 9 new ways to play the game).
<br>
<br>After HoT, I was apprehensive about GW2&apos;s future. PoF has done the opposite and delivered a near perfect expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7543736">Expand</a></span>

<br>Arenanet had taken lessons from the past. All the major issues GW2 had are no more. The game is stable, has a strong content, both casual and end game, it has a lot of variety of gameplay, content, game modes.
<br>The community is very welcoming, and the game is highly populated.

<br>If you ever played GW2 and want to come back, don&apos;t think it twice, just drown into it, you won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7543301">Expand</a></span>

The worldbuilders of Guild Wars 2 has outdone themselves by turning the one most dull biome, the desert, into a nuanced landscape of shape and colors. This is brought to life by gigabytes upon gigabytes of quality voice acting, animations and gameplay carefully designed to promote exploration and, on occasion, cooperation.
<br>
<br>As for the story, avoiding spoilers, let&apos;s just say the writers are showing their respect for the 12 year old franchise by turning over and experimenting with the concepts they have established years ago in order to create a truly enjoyable product that easily beats the last four years of story this game has offered.
<br>
<br>Recommended for anyone looking for a fantasy fix for half the price of a AAA game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7544681">Expand</a></span>

<br>i just wanted to address some of the people who are complaining about this expansion and saying &quot;just trash&quot; about it. first of not having new classes, the new elite spec are the new classes for example the elementalist just look at how many verity of builds we had with tempest and now we get weaver who has a totally different play style and abilities, sure it under the same class name as elemental, but the things he can bring to the table are totally different even if you wanted to go tempest dps it still different to the weaver and the play style, people are still experimenting on different builds and ways to play this elite spec whats the point in having a new class its that it plays and feels different to the others, well weaver plays and feels different to tempest. personally i didnt really like tempest that much, but with weaver i cant get enough and thats not including the whole other different classes that have their new elite spec another example would be the ranger it had druid and now it has soulbeast which plays and feels completely different and unique.
<br>
<br>that said about the class part now to pvp and wvw they already said will be coming out and that they are working on and in terms of new crafting professions not everyone actually likes crafting and to the some who actually do there are new gear and equipment that they can craft there is no need for new crafting professions in addition you can only learn 2 at max 3 crafting professions which a lot of people have already maxed out and i dont think a lot of people are interested in starting the whole process of gathering and max a whole new crafting prof.
<br>
<br>about the game engine saying its old and needs work look at final fantasy or even wow non of these 2 games have changed their game engine because it wont be that easy it&apos;s like saying make a completely new game but with the same setting and if your fps goes down because of the game that just means you need to update your PC.
<br>
<br>this expansion has a lot to offer the content alone is more than enough making people actually communicate and work together to do bounties and other world events, if anything Anet has done a great job in these maps, story, and the new elite specs, also the mounts it&apos;s totally different than all other mounts in other games which are just for increased movement speed each mount actually feels different and unique.
<br>
<br>sorry for the long post, but i got tired of retarded people look for any excuse to bash was a  great job Anet has done and i give them props for it they have improved so much since their first expansion and i havent even mentioned how incredibly amazing the PoF story is, so great job Anet and keep getting better and for those who keep finding fault no game is %100 perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7550765">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Heart of Thorns (HoT), the first Guild Wars 2 expansions, was pretty good in my opinion. It got some things right, and a number of things wrong. For Path of Fire (PoF), the developers successfully identified the aspects of Heart of Thorns that made it fun for players, and they have amplified those aspects for this new expansion:
<br>
<br>[1] Mobility &amp; Exploration. Gliding was hands down the best part of Heart of Thorns. It was a new way to approach exploration, which has always been a key part of the core game with vistas, points of interests and hearts, diving points, jumping puzzles, and more to find. For Path of Fire, they chose to increase mobility &amp; exploration with mounts. Mounts in PoF do even more than gliding did. There is a mount for crossing large gaps in terrain (raptor), scaling cliff-sides (springer), hovering over water and other ground material, and more. There is even a hidden mount that is essentially a much improved form of gliding.
<br>
<br>[2] Elite Specializations. With any major expansion you have to add more combat mechanics. Heart of Thorns did quite well with elite specializations, but again, Path of Fire just does it again and better. For example the Daredevil in HoT only essentially gave you a staff abilities, an extra dodge, and the standard few extra skills. In PoF, the Deadeye give you a new profession skill, new stolen profession skills, rifle abilities, secondary rifle abilities (when you are crouched), a secondary resource meter, and the standard abilities. They just made the elite specialization do more to change your characters and make them unique.
<br>
<br>[3] Maps and re-doable content. Heart of Thorns added little adventures that you can do repeatedly around it&apos;s maps. This was a great idea. But the maps themselves are rather tedious to traverse with so much vertical and branching paths. Path of Fire&apos;s maps are much more standard (they are mach easier to traverse) and they expanded on the re-doing of objectives. If you already beat a hero point mini-boss, but you see someone else doing it, you can go help them and you will still get a reward even though you already did it. Rewards (however small) are great for repeating previous content, and it helps keep places around the world populated. They also added Bounties, which is essentially a way of triggering a mini-boss. This feature is GREAT for small groups of friends, because it allows them to do bosses on their own time and not wait for things to spawn and such.
<br>
<br>Although I really like Path of Fire, there are a few drawbacks/short-falls of the expansion:
<br>
<br>[1] Possibly the biggest one for me is the lack of new armor sets. Guild Wars two has never really had a major push of new armor sets, and it is understandable why. Armor in GW2 effects multiple races, and you have hundreds of dyes that need to effect armor colors, so adding armor is a major chore for the development team.
<br>
<br>[2] World versus World (WvW). This mode has pretty much always been an afterthought since the beginning of the game. There are numerous flaws with the fundamental design of the game mode (as everyone is well aware), but it is still fun for what it is if you learn the ropes of how to be effective. Yes you can use the elite specializations of the expansion in WvW, but much of WvW revolves around moving through a map and taking side objectives from enemy teams. WvW never got a map that was designed around gliding, and it did not get a new map (at least so far) designed around using mounts in Path of Fire. They tried to make a new map with the desert WvW map, but that was a disaster from the ground up. I still think WvW could be an amazing game mode, but it would require some fundamental re-works (such as team selection rather than server-based teams), and it would require new maps that take advantage of the advanced movement options in the expansions.
<br>
<br>[3] Underwater combat. Underwater combat is like WvW in that it has kinda been an afterthought since the game released. It is slower paced than ground combat with less options due to skill restrictions and lack of weapon sets. HOWEVER, mounts could finally provide a solution to make underwater combat more fun. But sadly there are no underwater mounts in the game yet, and there is even a mount designed to float over water so you don&apos;t even have to swim. I personally hope the next expansions for Guild Wars 2 involves the water elder dragon, and it adds underwater mounts that will vastly change underwater combat for the better. (PLEEEASE Arena net. That would be so cool)
<br>
<br>Summary... I love this expansion, and it shows that Guild Wars 2 is not a dying MMO. It has a lot of life left in it, and now is the best time there has ever been to start playing. I can&apos;t wait to see what they do in the future with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7546195">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The expansion brings five maps, the largest maps to date and that is no exaggeration. Combined with increased verticality it takes some considerable time to explore every region and even then you will want to revisit to complete collections and events you missed the first time around. The increased size would be hard to navigate if it was not for GW2&apos;s latest addition, mounts.
<br>
<br>What a breath of fresh air mounts are, unlike other MMO&apos;s Gw2&apos;s mounts are not just a simple speed boost. But rather and completely different way to traverse the terrain, from the Raptors leap to jump large gaps and traverse the terrain quickly, to the Springers jump to reach high up locations. To the Skimmers ability to avoid terrain effects by floating and the Jackals teleportation, there may or may not be a secret mount, which I will not spoil here.
<br>
<br>Just like everything Arena Net do, mounts are approached not just to fill a demand but to introduce something fresh, fun and accomplish in a way that leaves other MMO&apos;s trailing behind.
<br>
<br>The expansion brings a class balance and nine new specialisations to help spice up PvP and WvW with new desert borderland creatures as a bonus. It may not sound like much, but new specialisations and changes to meta are what PvP live for. That said the PvP side of the game is on a different release schedule and given as free updates, it is not something expansion packs are designed to cater to.
<br>
<br>As for the story, it is a truly epic  journey filled with ups and down. The writing has come a long way since the original personal story. The voice acting is superb, especially John DiMaggio (Futurama&apos;s Bender) Canach. The main characters have quite a natural dynamic between them which is occasionally amusing quite, &quot;cuddles&quot;. If you were a fan of the original Guild Wars, you will get a kick out of this expansion due to the numerous call backs to that game.
<br>
<br>Guild Wars 2 has hit a new high, much needed after the divisive Heart of Thorns and year long content drought after. I would happily recommend this expansion especially at the reduced price tag compared to HOT, Arena Net are back on track and the future looks bright.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7550567">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Q: No new Raids, Dungeons, Fractals, sPvP, WvW?
<br>A: The releases of Raids and Fractals have always come with Living world on a release by release
<br>bases, Dungeons have not been touched in many years and have been replaced by fractals, so to
<br>expect new ones is crazy and unproductive. Arenanet has stated many times before that sPvP
<br>and WvW releases always come on their own cadence, as balance and other changes or
<br>additions won&apos;t wait for a major release such as an expansion.
<br>
<br>Q: No Meta events or bosses like the ones in HoT?
<br>A: It is true that PoF does not have the same style of meta events as HoT did, and to some this may be a big problem, many of the HoT metas required huge numbers of people and could take hours to complete, for some this was great for others it was a nightmare. PoF metas are often shorter and don&apos;t require an entire map of people to work together for their completion, Not having the same large metas does two very important things for the game. 1: players who don&apos;t have the time or means to gather with a huge group of people and do a meta for two hours don&apos;t need to, and 2: PoF metas don&apos;t instantly override the need for HoT ones, this means that the Hot metas will still have players in them for a long time to come.
<br>
<br>Q: Less Content than HoT?
<br>A: NO! I don&apos;t understand this thought at all, if you look at the size of the maps, number of events, items, achievements, secrets, bounties, and other new additions PoF has way more actual content than HoT did, just because you could do the Dragon Stand Meta event for 1000 hours doesn&apos;t mean that equates to more content.
<br>
<br>Guild Wars 2 Path of Fire is an amazing expansion and it lays the ground work for a new season of living world that will start 2 - 3 months from now. Arenanet has made huge comprehensive maps that need to be explored to find everything that they have to offer, this exploration is added by the addition of Mounts to the game, but these aren&apos;t your grandmas mounts, each of the mounts has a unique feel and skills that allow you to explore a traverse different areas of the maps. These new mounts are tied to the mastery system which makes much of the exploration feel Metroidvania like, as you see that thing in the distance that you can&apos;t get to yet but with that new mount or new skill it will be within your reach.
<br>
<br>With PoF Arenanet has added 9 new Elite professions which change the feel and style of each class in the game, these changes equate to even more variety and choice when creating your class and choosing how you want to play.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend Guild Wars 2 PoF enough for the cost of this expansion, you get a huge amount of new and enjoyable content, and you get an entire season of new content and story released every 2 - 3 months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7555831">Expand</a></span>

The design philosophy ANet always had only now bears fruit. With HoT we got promised that level cap won&apos;t be ever increased so the old content will still be challenging and worth playing, but it was meaningless because the only endgame content we really had was 4 HoT maps. Now we have HoT, LWS3, HoT Raids AND PoF and soon we will have LWS4 and PoF Raids to play.
<br>New elite specs are amazing and feel like whole new classess, even more so than HoT specs that were already good.
<br>Mounts are the only big new feature, but boy they are fun to use. I never wanted them in GW2 but now I can&apos;t go back, I love them and NEED them. New maps are beautiful and fun to explore.
<br>I liked HoT but because it was so feature-focused, it lacked content. With PoF, we see a payoff of the decision ANet made back then. We have amazing features and a lot of amazing content. Good job, keep it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7588093">Expand</a></span>

<br>I love that the maps are doable solo. Thanks so much Arena Net. I love the freedom to explore in my own time and at my own pace and I feel I can with these new maps. The story was good, a little bit tricky in places but mostly quite manageable for
<br>a noob like me. (You know I think I noticed the companions like Rytlock, Canach and Kasmeer  were being a lot more effective in battles than they have been in previous story missions. Is that my imagination I wonder?)
<br>I have only unlocked a few elites skills so I cant really comment on them now but I am happy there is more choice and weapons to learn about. :)
<br>The reward armors are lovely, I especially like the light and medium ones the best, lovely fabrics and details like tassels and draping.
<br>Overall I think this expansion deserves a solid 9 from an average casual player like me. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7566469">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Visually - the game looks like any other decent MMO.  I found the story a little incoherent.  The combat system is pretty engaging (apart from the recent gamebreaking lapse in class balance) .
<br>
<br>I understand there&apos;s also some angst regarding microtransactions recently.

They added like 4 boss mechanics spread out between about 10 legendary bounties that everyone just swarms for a few minutes and moves on. The new map metas are either impossible to do because nobody knows they&apos;re happening or impossible to do because they were balanced poorly. The only thing to do after you beat the story is get a flying mount and do collection achievements for a not-so-great exotic set. Half of the new specializations are a mess and double the amount of key inputs. Game is rife with little annoyances that will have you quitting in a rage within 2 weeks, guaranteed. Like, HoT before it, wait until they get their act together before you bother with this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7579352">Expand</a></span>

<br>Booring flat maps, no meta events, no epic events, all content like story/mobs/skillspoints ultra esy and casual. Complite all things in 4 days and return to ultra awedome HoT location and Events. Worst expansion for me and loswet hour/gameplay, no bosses no fractals no dungeons no raids no new WwW or Spvp maps, no new class no new races.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/user-reviews?user_review_id=7649203">Expand</a></span>

In terms of story im more than satisfied - quest no 9 &quot;the departing&quot; is one of the best I have ever played.

<br>The expansion story was amazing, it could be seen as a little long but that&apos;s only if you want to finish it in one or two days. Take a week to finish the story, its worth it.</span>
