It has everything a serious MMORPG player would want! Great PvP? Check! Multi-layered PvP (areans, free-roaming and more)? Check! An extremely deep crafting system? Check! Tons of customizations? Check! Economy? Check (auction houses are forthcoming)! Housing? Check! Auto Assault includes some revolutionary mechanics as well, including destructible world and random loot (meaning that hardly ever two drops will be the same). In addition, the countless missions are full of lore, and the setting itself is refreshing. I was never attracted to car games, but Auto Assault just grabbed me and wouldn&apos;t let me go. It will happen to you as well, if you just give it a try.

Content seems stretched over a huge game that leaves large gaps and causes players intrested in feeling something new, whether it be a level, enemy, or area to explore unfullfilled for long periods of time. Also the fee is quite high for a first time entry into the market by an unknown developer with a product of questionable worth. Add to that a plethora of bugs that should of been resolved in the quite long open/semi-open beta and the fact that despite largely lacking instanced maps and missions heavily encourage single player play, the game is a major let down. Perhaps content will be added, or the game itself and its economic model focussed to something more feasible but right now this game is largely a waste of money for what will likely dissapoint most players by the end of their first month playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/auto-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=387745">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s awesome, fast-paced action that feels like Twisted Metal or something but has full RPG stats, elements, and leveling. No death penalty, and the combat feels great! The graphics are excellent with lots of cool weather and stuff going on, there are big duststorms and snowstorms, and excellent weapons and explosion effects also. If you&apos;re the kind of person that wouldn&apos;t normally play a massively multiplayer game you should definitely give this a try, I think you&apos;ll love it as much as I do. Great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/auto-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=386845">Expand</a></span>

I personally love it. Finally an MMO where travelling is FUN. Getting from x to y involves speeding through interesting areas, jumping through groups of enemies with guns blazing and destroying everything in sight. The reason I give it 8 out of 10, is because things like auction houses, skill point respec and more group content should have been there from the start. These are all things that we have been promised would appear, but working on a game for 5 years and not including such essential things is a bit disapointing. However it is still a very fun game, I personally hate driving games but love auto assault.

Great genre. Don&apos;t base the game on experiences you may have had early in beta. The game has come a long way since then!</span>

                                        <span> This is a damn fun game. I played a lot of WoW and Dark Age and got a bit bored with the fantasy setting. Plus compared to Auto Assault, most other MMOs are just plain slow. Actually, it reminded me of some first person shooters that have vehicles in them. So I guess its a nice mix of MMOs and FPSs. That&apos;s pretty cool in my book.</span>

I was hesitant since i&apos;m not a big car fan, but wow...guys, you MUST give it a try, it&apos;s pretty amazing and has potential to be just absolutely epic in it&apos;s PVP. There&apos;s minor bugs, but the dev&apos;s are fixing these like i&apos;ve never seen before, which again, i&apos;ve beta tested tons of mmo&apos;s and the dev&apos;s are really working hard to please all of us and taking our feedback seriously. Try it, you won&apos;t regret it! SOOOO much fun in comparison to other mmo&apos;s and screw WoW, this game has even more items....seriously, that many....crafting is absolutely insane once you understand the in&apos;s and outs of it. Lag is absolutely no prob, and my computer is pretty crappy, yet i can still run it on med/high settings, and this is with 512 ram....breath of fresh air for sure. Only thing that truly bothers me is the player population on launch day, but i think once the reviews start praising this game, that&apos;ll change. Most just aren&apos;t into cars that much, just like i am....you&apos;ll change your mind, oh yes you will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/auto-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=386960">Expand</a></span>

Just so you know, I&apos;m the type of gamer who always wanted to get into Everquest and WoW, but I just didn&apos;t enjoy the combat in them enough to stick it out. Auto Assault is the first MMO that is actually fun for me to play. It&apos;s got all the stuff you&apos;d expect, with character classes, skills, and equipment, but playing the game is much more fast-paced and fun!</span>

Include the technical issues that all MMOs go through in their infancy and you have a game that screams, &quot;Wait a second! Don&apos;t buy me just yet. Give me a chance to walk first...I&apos;m still crawling.&quot; Less organization is required, making it less of an MMORPG than a multiplayer game. Big on action, small on layered content. We&apos;ll have to see how this one progresses - but even The Matrix Online had more to offer at launch than Auto Assault - and we all know what happened to that MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/auto-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=387131">Expand</a></span>

Auto Assault was unique because instead of being a human warlock, you created a character but you would usually be in a vehicles.  I reserved this game from Gamestop when it was first released.  The game was given to the people who reserved a few days earlier then everyone else.  I remember it was Easter weekend.  When I bought the game for some reason most of that week I was out of school.  In about a five day time span I had put in over seventy hours of game play.  There was a monthly fee of fifteen dollars (like usual), with the first being free.  I started off as a Commando and eventually was able to use a tank.  The game featured players to make their own clans, change the colors of their vehicles, and use a mic in game.  Besides being able to get a tank, their was also other vehicles like a motorcycle that could stealth. The quests do get repetitive, but all MMO quests are.  My favorite part of the game was getting loot to customize the vechicle and make it all bad ass.  Their was not a bazillion people when the game released (like World of Warcraft) but their was a lot more then Final Fantasy 11 Online for the Xbox 360 (see previous review).  The game featured PVP death matches that were tons of fun.  Driving around and shooting other people with laser beams and machine guns was great.  About two years after initial launch I began playing the game again.  I realized there were different factions.  There was human, biotic, and some cyborg dudes.  I messed around with the game for another month because I was pissed that my human Commando with the tank had been deleted (I am guessing because of  my inactivity).  I tried out the biotic guys and would say that use poisons and are green.  The cyborg people were the coolest faction.  They have futuristic looking vechiles and for some reason I remember the color red being associtated with them.  This time when I played their was even less people playing.  I would say I saw about hundred people in each city I went to.  I recently checked up on this game found out they have closed down the servers as of 7/02/2007 =( If you are interested in this game then you should look up and find a private server.  If you find one post the link in the comments section (I would not mine playing it again).  This was a great MMORPG and so I deceided to review this game; even though it is dead.  In a way it competes with World of Warcraft as the best MMORPG to me because this game offered what other MMOs have not; kicking ass in vechiles while looting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/auto-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=2506655">Expand</a></span>
