<br>The puzzles are not engaging or difficult. The only thing that takes time is figuring out how to actually interact with them.
<br>The gameplay is boring.
<br>The power mechanics are boring AND slow AND are unreliable AND SOME OF THE &quot;PUZZLES&quot; RELY ON YOU BEING FAST AND ACCURATE WITH THEM LIKE WHY!?
<br>The levels are boring.
<br>Most of the models don&apos;t even look like they belong in the same game.
<br>The sound will randomly BLAST you during completely random moments no matter how low you have it turned. I destroy one block? Sound is fine. The next block? Horrible ear death.
<br>
<br>No matter how DESPERATELY I tried to immerse myself in the story and enjoy it...it was boring and I had to take frequent breaks in order to force myself to pay attention. I just didn&apos;t care at all, it felt so forced and generic.
<br>The lighting is so unbearable. Every area is so dark that you can&apos;t see any detail whatsoever. They obviously did this to discourage you from looking around so you wouldn&apos;t realize how empty the game is. This point is proven when you FINALLY get respite from darkness imprisoning you in the form of a sunny level...and the level is barren and uninteresting.
<br>When I say &quot;empty&quot; I don&apos;t mean short either. They have added levels since this games release, and even show you where you missed collectibles to encourage you to go back to try and find them...but I couldn&apos;t even make it through all of the levels ONCE, why would i want to do it AGAIN? Its empty because there&apos;s just nothing to it. Just another bland &quot;transcendental&quot; puzzle game with absolutely nothing remarkable or special about it.
<br>The game tries so hard to be transcendental I almost feel bad for it.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t notice any game breaking bugs like some of the other reviewers, so maybe they ironed them out? Even then, its not worth your time to play this chore of a game. I did notice one time when I could sequence break the game, but it didn&apos;t matter because I would have been without an essential power for the next part.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>At least the way you interact with the world was almost creative...maybe if they would have let you interact with anything besides the extremely context sensitive puzzle components this would have turned out to be a cooler mechanic
<br>
<br>Other thoughts:
<br>You get an achievement for like everything you do in this game. Did they literally just add fluff achievements to try and make the game look like it had actual content?
<br>
<br>Was Elysia really the most creative name they could think of for their program? How many times do I need to hear that word before it dies. At least Dust: An Elysian Tale was cute and fun and interesting. AND IT WAS 2D. I LIKED THE GRAPHICS OF A 2D PLATFORM SIDESCROLLER MORE THAN A FULLY MODELED 3D GAME WHAT DOES THAT SAY!?
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen some of the positive reviews of this game saying how they are going to play it forever and ever and it makes me wonder if these people are masochists or something? I am willing to give A LOT of breaks to indy companies. Short game, low resolution, muddy sound, bugs, limited animation...thats all okay you didn&apos;t have a huge budget. But for the love of god at least make your art UNIQUE, your levels INTERESTING, your story ENGAGING, and your gameplay FUN. You don&apos;t need to have a huge production value to make a great game, plenty of indy companies have made worse looking games that still CAPTIVATE people with their art direction and story.
<br>I&apos;ve read a lot of the reviews in order to help me formulate what I want to say, and let me tell you I completely disagree with so many of them. The graphics are not interesting or beautiful AT ALL. Its all VERY generic. Sometimes I feel like the critics and users that review these games somehow got a different version.
<br>
<br>If you want a game that centers around a simulated universe or consciousness...go play SOMA, it may be a horror game but you&apos;ll certainly enjoy it more than this. This game just feels so generic I am literally FORCING myself to try and enjoy it.
<br>
<br>I really wish I could say I at least finished the game before giving it a review but I just can&apos;t force myself to play this anymore. I would literally rather go to work for a 12 hour shift than play this game at this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soul-axiom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873677">Expand</a></span>
