Nice background story (and therefore monster, especially the bosses), linear gameplay with arcade-style shooting, acceptable graphic and music..... its worth a budget price, lets say around 15$. Wont last long, but it is still a 5hours of fun killing.</span>

The combat system works well and there arent many bugs i have come across, the graphics are decent - nothing revolutionary but they work well and deliver whats necessary. Sounding in this game isnt an issue, as its clearly not the greatest there is nothing terrible about sound except for when a werewolf &quot;howls&quot;, the standard howl would have made it realistic (as realistic as werewolves are). There are numerous boss battles, some of them are very annoying  because of the difficulty, even playing on easy is going to annoy you against a boss as they can hit you 500 times in a second. Back to the story, its a very good story that has never been touched upon, the ideas are all there, its just a shame that a massive budget wasnt set in, if the graphics were peaked, everything perfectly designed and nothing rushed, this game would be amazing...actually amazing, i really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who doesnt care about the small things, just enjoy a great story line and alot of things to fight. Although its nothing ground breaking, you have to admire what Spark Unlimited did here and play the game for story and shooting Mythical Beasts. A very good game that needed another year in development for extra graphical improvements and better AI</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legendary/user-reviews?user_review_id=1658988">Expand</a></span>

I recommend this game to anybody at all but it does require a unique person to enjoy to the fullest.</span>

This seems to be a low budget game, as you go through the same caves, air vents, and subway stations, and rooms numerous times.  Also, I seemed to run into technical glitches and freezes with annoying frequency.  If you can get it on sale</span>

<br>
<br>Now, there is some stand out moments which are worthy of a mention and it is to do with the levels and the enemies. The mythical creatures are of high quality and of a good variety, but again the poor execution in implementing them into the levels shows amateurish mistakes throughout. They are fun to go up against and on normal difficulty they are worthy opponents. However, they will be clipping in and out of the levels as well as appearing out of thin air as you activate the next section of the level... obviously, the immersion is lost at these poorly designed intervals. It&apos;s a shame because Legendary has been made with a lot of love and it does show. The subject material is well used and the story is well put together nonsense. I played through the game as if I was a play tester pinpointing problems and thinking up new ideas all the way until the end. I enjoyed it a lot and it pains me to say that as you have to delve deep to get the most out of it. You should play it as it is cheap but that price does reflect the quality of most of the game....

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6910326"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Legendary is an absolutely atrocious game. The game looks bad, it plays bad, the story is bad, the voice acting is bad, and the combat is highly unsatisfying.
<br>
<br>The beginning of the game starts with the protagonist, Charles Deckard, finding Pandora&apos;s Box in a museum and opening it under the orders of the millionaire, Ormond LeFey. To open the box he has to stick his hand inside a contraption on the side, which subsequently pierces and brands his hand with a Signet. Upon opening the box, a beam of energy shoots out towards the ceiling destroying the museum, the city, and releasing creatures known as Aniforms.
<br>
<br>A tutorial then explains that Deckard is able to absorb and use &quot;Animus&quot;, which is the life force of all Aniforms. Animus can be used to heal Deckard or to create an &quot;Animus Pulse&quot; in front of him, damaging and knocking back enemies and objects.
<br>
<br>After this Deckard is contacted by Vivian Kane, who was also hired by LeFey to assist his mission. Her main role is to shout obvious things over the radio at Deckard while he&apos;s being attacked by any and everything. She also serves as the narrator for the plot-dump cutscenes.
<br>
<br>Throughout the game you&apos;ll encounter four basic enemies, three &quot;mini-bosses&quot;, and a boss. The basic enemies are used ad nauseum, making encounters increasingly more dull. Most enemies are bullet sponges too, which wastes not only the player&apos;s time but also their ammunition. That or they have to be killed in specific ways, which is neat at first, but annoying in the long run.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s technically another boss at one point in the game but you don&apos;t fight the boss as much as you do grind for and fill three EMP generators with Animus, one of which is constantly moved between floors by annoying fairy-like creatures called Nari.
<br>
<br>Eventually Deckard and Vivian learn that - surprise, surprise - LeFey wants them dead now that they&apos;ve served their purpose and has sent his private security force, the Black Order, to take them out. Vivian then sends a distress signal to the Order of 98 (O98), the group responsible for concealing the Box (by hiding it in a museum?), who help fend the assailants off. Their leader, Lexington, doesn&apos;t trust Vivian since she was working for LeFey, but The O98 agrees to help the duo and give them asylum in exchange for her knowledge of LeFey and the Black Order. Lexington one-ups Vivian by not only shouting at you over the radio, but also by shouting directly in your face during cutscenes.
<br>
<br>Some time later Deckard finds an encrypted hard drive belonging to LeFey that contains details on a machine that can potentially use the Box to control all of the Aniforms that were released. It would also send a massive amount of energy to the Signet on Deckard&apos;s hand, killing him. The O98 also managed to get hold of the Box somehow, but it&apos;s never explained.
<br>
<br>In a shocking twist (that&apos;s sarcasm), it turns out that the hard drive also contained a Trojan Horse virus that shuts down the O98&apos;s power and security protocols. The Black Order swarms the base along with a bunch of Aniforms in order to retrieve the Box. The O98 then swarms the Black Order&apos;s HQ, LeFey&apos;s tower, in order to destroy The Machine. Deckard manages to overload the machine with Animus which causes it to explode, but afterwards the O98 throws him in prison while assuming Vivian was killed in the explosion. It&apos;s then implied that both of them escaped and that Deckard learned how to tame the Aniforms, setting the game up for a sequel that would never happen.
<br>
<br>The story is incredibly clich&#xE9; and I genuinely don&apos;t understand why some people like it so much. Bad Guy hires Not Bad Guy to do Bad Thing, Bad Guy turns out to be Bad, but wait there&apos;s a force of Good who wants to stop the Bad Guy. Not Bad Guy joins the Good Guys in stopping the Bad Guy, with help from Half-Bad, Half-Good Half-Gal. There&apos;s also a recurring theme of attempting and failing to travel by helicopter because there are griffons literally everywhere.
<br>
<br>99% of the &quot;environmental puzzles&quot; come down to holding down &quot;E&quot; to use a valve, a fire alarm, or to shooting the Glowing Thing to Make Stuff Happen&#x2122;. There are also locked doors that you have to bypass by &quot;hacking&quot; the security panel and there are usually several in a row. Each door takes ~4-5 seconds to open, so you&apos;ll find the pace grind to a halt while you wait for the way forward to open.
<br>
<br>Graphically the game looks bad and features terrible animations and textures. There are moments where stuff explodes and objects will no-clip through the environment or through you. The characters have incredibly over-exaggerated gesticulations as well, giving them a very otherworldly feeling. It&apos;s scarier than the monsters sometimes. Some set pieces are nice, though.
<br>
<br>The music is generic, uninspired rock music that all sounds the same. Sound effects are meh.
<br>
<br>The game also crashes frequently and you can fall through the floor in certain elevators by crouching.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legendary/user-reviews?user_review_id=6910326">Expand</a></span>

The majority of levels are relative easy until you get stuck with a too difficult boss (e.g. Minotaur; Kraken) or level. Since this game has the checkpoint system you will pretty much doing that over and over again. It was on steam sale for under 5 euro. For that prize you can safely pick it up and have fun with it but prepared to experience some frustration as well.

<br>I&apos;ve only played for one day thus far mind you, and cannot say if the reviews are right or not in the long term, but if you&apos;ve not played this game yet. It perhaps has the greatest advent I&apos;ve ever seen. The opening hour of play is breathtaking. The monsters are better than any other game I&apos;ve ever played. And anyone who nay says this master piece is missing something wonderful.
<br>
<br>I am just glad I don&apos;t let game reviews think for me. And like Hard Reset, Battle Los Angeles or The Walking Dead (TV based) before this I thought for myself and played what they told me wasn&apos;t worth it because they are dead wrong here and there. &quot;Bad games&quot; apparently rock!!!

Its clearly a lower budget title from 2008, it has ambition and it aims for a cool spectacle littered with setpiece moments but sadly its just not enough for a fully compelling game. Gunplay is suprisingly decent, guns also sound fairly fine and beefy, but the mouse default sensitivity is just god awful, its extremely overly sensitive and turning it down makes aiming sluggish and slow leading to tracking enemies while aiming down sights a misery, clearly devs didnt put full effort into PC version. Still blasting enemies is cheap thrills kinds of fun mostly. Enemies are only challenging if you run into a group of them like a headless chicken and forget youre losing health, other than that theyre just part of the shooting gallery. One small but nice thing was there&apos;s no regenerating health, there were few times i was on my last legs but came through, killed the beasts, got their animus energy and survived which felt good.
<br>
<br>Premise of the game in itself is interesting, but story is extremely generic, made worse by sub par dialogue and voice acting, making the serious tone of the game pretty cringy most of the time. Deckard himself has to be the most forgettable protagonist i&apos;ve ever played as, even Kane &amp; Lynch got more personality than this guy, rest of the cast dont fair any better.
<br>
<br>9 years on game&apos;s graphics havent aged that well, tho theyre servicable and wont make you puke, i guess back in 2008 it was decent looking game, but theres games from that time that have aged far better. Performance wise game ran at locked 60 fps on maxed settings, however there are no individual graphics options, just one slider ranging from Very Low to Very High, again showing simple straight up console port effort. At the end game i also ran into this game&apos;s infamous elevator bug which denied the progression, but it was fixed by simple change in game&apos;s config file as i found out on Legendary&apos;s Steam group&apos;s forum.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legendary/user-reviews?user_review_id=7803066">Expand</a></span>
