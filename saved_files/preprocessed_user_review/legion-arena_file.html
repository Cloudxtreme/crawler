I only got rid of 2 points from perfect because 1. the graphics arent the best and 2. there is almost no one who plays online, if you wanna play online you have to wait for someone to join the channel which could take a while. There are things to do you can add people to your friends list on xfire and see when they are on so you can play multiplayer. But its a fun game. One of the few new games that I can actually say is a fun game with good replayability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legion-arena/user-reviews?user_review_id=384565">Expand</a></span>
