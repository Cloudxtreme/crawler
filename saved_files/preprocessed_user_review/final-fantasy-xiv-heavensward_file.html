<br>
<br>-WoW fanboys who want to see FF fail
<br>-People who are angry they need to do the Realm Reborn story to experience Heavensward.
<br>-Mac Users.
<br>
<br>I will try my best to give an objective review, outlining all the pros and cons of not only Heavensward but of  A Realm Reborn.
<br>
<br>Presentation(10) - This right here is Heavensward&apos;s biggest strength. The story of this expansion is in my opinion, greater than any MMO I have ever played, even rivaled some of SWToR&apos;s stories. If you&apos;re a new player, the starting of the story is slow. I was meh about it, but the story keeps getting better and better. By the time I hit level 50, it was one of the best stories I&apos;d seen in an MMO. By the time Heavensward came around and I experienced 50-60, the story rivaled that of the single player FFs.
<br>
<br>Gameplay(9.5) - This aspect right here is what will split players. There is a 2.5s GCD instead of 1.5s. This can make combat seem slower, and mistakes are punished more severely. It&apos;s really not that bad but it&apos;s all up to your tastes. The three new classes feel and play unique and flow well, though Machinist is a bit weak right now. The side quests are quick are easy, though more of the same fetch quests mostly. Dungeons and raids are fun to play. Crafting is deeper here than in any other MMO. You can switch classes simply by changing your weapon, so there is no need for alts.
<br>
<br>Content(9.5) Oh boy, is there a lot of quality content in Heavensward and Realm Reborn as well. Square Enix churns out content every three months.
<br>
<br>-25+ dungeons, all still relevant because of the duty roulette, a system that awards you experience and tomes at the end. Tomes are like tokens that buy raid gear.
<br>-A challenging 8 man raid with 13 wings(Coil of Bahamut.) This is the bleeding edge of their content, for the hardcore players. Two weeks from now, they come out with a new raid called Alexander. Four weeks from now, they come out with the Savage version of Alexander, a super hardcore punishing version of the raid.
<br>-Three 24 man raids that are all still done. They are not as challenging as the Coil of Bahamut, but they&apos;re not necessarily faceroll easy either.
<br>-Trials/Primals in Normal, Hard, and Extreme difficulty. Trials are a fight against a boss in a single room, no trash mobs. Primals is the same, but they are fights against the Gods of the FF world. These fights are amazing.
<br>-Guildhests. These are like tutorial quests that teach you the mechanics of the game. I believe there is a roulette for this as well, giving vets incentive to run these for tomes, thus helping newbies.
<br>-Levequests. These are quests you with timed objectives that you can activate at any time for good experience, and sometimes other bonuses.
<br>-Fates. Dynamic events that happen randomly in the world that give experience.
<br>-Gold Saucer. A casino type city that lets you participate in entertaining side games such as Triple Triad(a card game.) And chocobo racing.
<br>-Many pets and mounts to collect and farm in the world, along with a plethora of achievements.
<br>
<br>Honestly, 5,000 characters is not enough for me to list all of the content here. The only place I&apos;d give their content a minus is in PvP. Restricting by faction kind of ruined it, and they treat it as a side gimmick, but their PvE content is spectacular.
<br>
<br>-Sound(10) You won&apos;t find better music in any MMO, I can guarantee you that. The voice acting in Realm Reborn was not the best, but progressively got better. I rated sound a 10 because the voice acting in Heavensward is 3x better. These sound like actual professional actors, they really portray the emotion.
<br>
<br>-Lasting Appeal(10) Unlike WoW where you farm your apexis crystals and then stay in your garrison, you will never run out of things to do in FF14. If anything, you may feel overwhelmed, as there will be too much for you to do, so you may have to choose a path at some point. Or just go with the flow enjoy the endless choices available to you at your own pace :). Having a lot of choice means casuals and hardcores both have content made for them.
<br>
<br>-Transition/Launch Issues(9.5) I&apos;ve not seen an MMO launch this smoothly in awhile. Aside from issues on the first hour of EA, 90% of this launch has been playable for most players. The lobby is more unstable than the servers themselves, which are rock solid.
<br>
<br>I really wanted to write more, but alas, this is where I come to a close. A forewarning, you have to complete Realm Reborn&apos;s story before Heavensward. PvP is also not this game&apos;s strong suit. If that bothers you, this game is not for you. Mac client is horrible do not get it. Realm Reborn is very newbie friendly, eases new players in just right.
<br>
<br>So would you rather be farming apexis crystals for yet another recolored mount? Or enjoying the unrivaled adventure that is Heavensward? The choice is yours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5340829">Expand</a></span>

<br>FF XIV is MMORPG based on really fabulous graphic. All characters are well made and look so real. Open world here is really huge and everything is  detailed made. World Hyadelyn and its beauty will devour you. Flowers, trees, animals, everything looks great. World, progressive weather, everything looks so much realistic. Equally good and maybe even better are cities, which look magnificently and they are very detailed made aswell. FFXIV has many strong sides, anyway its graphic is one of the strongest part of the game. Graphic quality of FF XIV is definitely currently number #1 in MMORPGs.
<br>
<br>10/10
<br>
<br>Customization
<br>
<br>The game has a lot of possibilities how to create your character exactly how you want to. Even when character creator is not overcrowded of possibilities, there are more than enough to choose what you want. I did not miss anything special. Color palette is really huge, so you can choose the exact hue you really want to. In game we can find many costumes, weapons, accessories, etc. which you can make, drop or buy for your character (depends what you want of course). FF XIV has pretty decent housing system. You have your own room available from every innkeeper in the game and you can even buy another room from your free company (guild) house. Both u can edit as you like and put there some decorations. Customization of FF XIV is more than decent and most of you will like it a lot.
<br>
<br>9/10
<br>
<br>Combat system
<br>
<br>Combat system in FF XIV is very traditional. Players have many abilities and they use classic &quot;tab&quot; targeting. Basically the combat system is not bad, it still work quite well, it can feel a bit slow though. I have no big problem with FF&apos;s combat system, anyway a bit of innovation would be probably good.
<br>
<br>8/10
<br>
<br>Game content
<br>
<br>FF XIV has good potential focused on PvE. In the game there is even possibility PvP which received a bit of enhancement in HW, but the game feels a lot of like mainly focused on PvE, which is good by the way. There are so many dungeons in whole game, many of them are for leveling or for quests, others are for end game. End game is focused on a lot of on collecting points every week, which you can spend for gear. We can find in game another group content called Trial, there you will face one boss and your reward can be weapon, armor, accessories or in some of them even mount. Main game raid is constructed for 8 players and have 2 difficulties. The hard one is really challenging for hardcore and semi-hardcore players. Another kind of PvE event are FATEs, which spawn on every map and people can do them alone or in groups. Currently the main function of fates are just leveling. Game content is quite good in FF XIV, there are a lot of possibilities what you can do, it tends to be a bit repeatable though, anyway to be honest every MMORPG tends to be repetable/ farmable.
<br>
<br>8/10
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>Story is in many MMORPGs something what is not priority and usually it is pretty bad. That is not case of FF XIV. Here we can find long main scenario quest line, where you can see huge improvement since the game has started until now. Especially HW&apos;s story is simply amazing. Definitely the best MMORPG story I have ever seen. There are many character and you will like them a lot (at least many of them lol), after short while you will see that you are in the story. Story line is enhanced by many awesome cutscenes. This is definitely another very strong part of FF XIV.
<br>
<br>10/10
<br>
<br>Music
<br>
<br>Music is something what Square Enix has always amazing. FF XIV is not different. FF XIV: ARR&apos;s theme song was so much amazing, Heavensward&apos;s main song is at least equally good. Many of in game songs are catchy and relaxing. Music part is just simply excelent in FF XIV.
<br>
<br>9/10
<br>
<br>Value
<br>
<br>Value of game is good for me. It is definitely one of the top MMORPGs and even when it uses subscription model I can see high quality game for our money. To be honest I think it would be even worthy game if you would just play it&apos;s amazing story, which give you over 60 hours of story fun. Developers upgrade their content a lot, so the game doesn&apos;t feel static at all. If you like progressive and challenging PvE content, this game is definitely what you are searching for.

While it is true that the story is much improved over the original FFXIV:ARR story arc, such praise needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The original story contained plot holes that were big enough to cause a well intentioned reader to look at the story as a thing in need of fixing rather than something immersive. The current story is not only free of derailing plot holes, but is actually pretty good. Character&apos;s develop naturally through the story, and you can see their personal growth as they experience the events the story is composed of. There is a genuine sense of loss and triumph at multiple points throughout the game.
<br>
<br>The storytelling benefits extend to a great portion of the side quests as well, making them feel more meaningful then typical fetch and kill chores. If only all of them could be said to be so improved, as I found myself grinding my teeth in the churning mists helping less than capable NPCs for several hours. A mixed bag, to be sure, but no less improved.
<br>
<br>But enough about the story. What about the game that lies beneath it? Little has changed from FFXIV:ARR, and that becomes more apparent the closer one gets to the end game. MMORPGs are games played for long stretches at a time, but the dungeons are little more than static corridors with better than average loot. It encourages players to romp their way through them repeatedly, but, much like watching the same video on repeat, it gets old quickly. The dungeons are by all means beautiful, well rendered, and have their own unique music scores to help with their ambience. It&apos;s unfortunate that the development team hasn&apos;t come up with a way to keep them fresh for more than a few play throughs.
<br>
<br>The problems with dungeons make raising secondary jobs incredibly painful in comparison to the first play through, which explains the over the top ratings from many reviewers. Other activities are presented to try to even things up, but the sheer mountain of experience points and better gear offered by the dungeon corridors encourage players to put themselves through dungeon repeat hell in order to end the pain faster.
<br>
<br>FFXIV:ARR is also plagued by an inventory system that is grossly inadequate for the kind of multiple job system it is built around. Those running multiple jobs will, with time, completely fill their inventory space and be forced to purchase more retainers with real world money. The space issues are caused by the accumulation of equipment, which can be used by multiple jobs and for vanity items. The pre-heavensward equipment has heavy overlap between different classes, so unwary players may end up stowing gear beyond its expiration date in case they might want to raise another class using the same equipment. Without taking drastic measures like jettison all unused vanity items into space, trying to raise multiple jobs will lead to several retainers full of green dungeon loot with little room to spare.
<br>
<br>The current solution is less than satisfactory: Increase your monthly subscription fee and you get another retainer. The calls for an inventory system fix have been very loud at E3, being asked repeatedly on multiple occasions, and the demand will only increase with time as they continue to add even more item sets. In any case, the long running effect of the inventory system is that players will only be able to play a small handful of the jobs regularly. So even if they did find a way to freshen up dungeons and the grind, players would be unlikely to take advantage of those systems.
<br>
<br>Finally, there is the the wait times to get into content as a damage dealer. What should have signaled the death of the Tank, Healer, and Damage Dealer trinity of old continues to haunt the MMORPG world to this day. Had someone told me that these problems would persist over ten years into the future back when I was struggling to get into a group as a mage in World of Warcraft, I would have thought the person totally nuts. Yet the improbable has come to pass, and developers lazily implementing the systems of old with no care for the problems they cause has led to yet another decent game being brought lower than it should.
<br>
<br>I think far too many a professional reviewer has overlooked these important aspects of the gameplay, and have posted their reviews far too early. Until you&apos;ve played with several different waves of people, how can you honestly review a game built around an open social experience? Expect wave one reviews to give FFXIV:Heavensward a shining ovation. Those that truly wish to rate the experience over the long run, as it should be rated, will likely give it a more humble 7 or 8 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5353821">Expand</a></span>

While the initial story was intriguing, all of the build up from the previous entry was thrown out as the characters fled North after the end of the previous game. Numerous character deaths were undone and the story itself held no meaning until you got to near the end of the game, when they are finally able to kill an Ascian only to introduce the Warrior of Darkness and end on a to be continued. The game makes numerous callbacks to previous entries in the series, with the final boss having a memorable attack from Final Fantasy 7.
<br>
<br>The three new character classes do not offer anything new. The Dark Knight is just a combination of a few existing tank classes. The Machinist is just another form of a summoner. The Astrologian just replaces traditional heals with heals over time and is probably the most unique of the three classes to me.
<br>
<br>If I had to describe Heavensward in one word, I would say tedious. One of the benefits of the game is to unlock flying for your chocobo, which can only be done by exploring the entire map. The problem is that the map is designed extremely awkwardly with wide opened empty fields everywhere you look. Each map only has one major city and tiny small outposts yet it takes more than five minutes to run across the map by chocobo without flying. There&apos;s even a map that&apos;s divided into level 51 on the bottom half and level 57 on the top half along with a misleading road that leads you north only for you to find nothing but dead ends. The only thing enjoyable to a degree are the dungeons, but the problem is that many of them now feature absurd puzzles and just pointless DPS checks instead of strategy while most bosses rely more on luck than anything else.
<br>
<br>Enemies in Heavensward are made tougher, but the problem is that it ultimately makes it unrewarding. Experience rewards are low and tons of quests involve obnoxious levels of exploration that uses the elevation of the game against you because your map is unable to show it. I eventually found myself back in Northern Thanalan doing FATEs at level 58 to 60 instead because it was much more rewarding.
<br>
<br>The main problems of the game still remains. Your drops are limited on a weekly basis so it is impossible to gear up a class to prepare for the next content release for more than one class. As a result, the ability to play as multiple classes do not really serve much of a function since there&apos;s no way to make more than one raid viable at any point. The end game raids still feel more luck based and have arbitrary time limits placed on them. The puzzles are interesting at first, but it quickly becomes whether or not you can finish the raid before you repeat the same pattern for the third time. Whether you fail a dungeon or not can depend on whether you get either a tank or a healer pulled out from the battle or the two DPS characters are sent to die on their own as they are split. Go too long and everyone dies from damage stacking by the enemies.
<br>
<br>There are better choices for paid MMOs out there and FFXIV is one that I highly recommend that you skip over, especially if this is all an expansion is offering a year after its release. At $14 a month and incredibly slow updates, there&apos;s much better games to play. All they have to support them is the promise of a better game, one that they have failed to deliver and instead have begun to repeat the mistakes of the past.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=6426184">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you like expansive areas, you&apos;ll be in for a treat. Every new area makes the ARR areas look small by comparison. Certain quests also require flight to complete, adding to the exploration experience.
<br>
<br>I can happily say that, in terms of difficulty, SE did not go overboard in making overworld monsters more challenging. They take longer to do away with and require more active skill but they are by no means cheap or unforgiving as far as mechanics go. Striking this balance could not have been easy for SE developers so they deserve a great deal of credit for giving players a challenge without scaring off players who might not be as advanced.
<br>
<br>Overall, SE has masterfully achieved an expansion that builds upon FFXIV in ways that makes us anticipate the next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5341957">Expand</a></span>

As with all launches that is to be expected. The Story continues from ARR with a darker tone, that has held my interest the entire time. The classes and abilities have added a lot of new ways to expand on the current battle system. Looking forward to how they incorporate this into the Alexander Raid. FC house workshop has a lot of potential to bring crafters together. In my FC it already has. Very excited to see what else 3.0 will build upon with all the new foundations paved down at launch. I will say that the difficulty of the mobs out in the open world are a little underwhelming. It is true that they are just increased with an HP Pool. I feel like the AOE telegraphs might be a little quicker,(definitely in dungeons) but they are still easy to dodge. I don&apos;t feel that threatened soloing the quest objectives. As a WHM I can take on 4+ mobs no problem. I&apos;m sure it is more difficult without sleep and heals, but I get the general idea that people aren&apos;t getting held up against a pack of mobs. I personally only read and pay attention to the story quests, as the side quests generally are fill fetch quests, that become redundant. There&apos;s so much to this game and the community is the best I&apos;ve been a part of, since the Vanilla days of WoW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5350175">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However it would not be a review if I don&apos;t state some things myself.
<br>Little background I have played WoW for nearly 10 years. I joined FF14 Reborn when it came out and I enjoyed the game greatly even back then.
<br>Unfortunately the launch collided pretty much with the SoO patch of WoW and because I was still in a raiding guild the game fell to the background.
<br>I never stopped paying a sub for it, kept an eye on it and logged in short periods of time to do the holiday events etc.
<br>Then Warlord of Draenor came out, played a little I stopped raiding (simply could not stomach the raid) saw my guild collapse a couple of months in.
<br>Simply stayed around for sentiment and then I heard of Heavensward being released, decided that if I wanted to start up again the Free company was simply a must for me.
<br>I found one and I simply got sucked right in to the game.
<br>My first thought after playing a week was &#x201C;Why the hell didn&apos;t I made the jump earlier&#x201D; I am actually enjoying myself again.
<br>
<br>Now that Heavensward has been released my impressions of the game.
<br>-Story- (10/10)
<br>The story is simply superb like others have stated it does start slow pre level 30 but I was already around level 40 when I picked it back up and the pre 30 story never really bothered me.
<br>Some tears were shed already and the expansion is just starting.
<br>
<br>-Classes- (9,5/10)
<br>The new classed are looking promising haven&apos;t really tried them out yet besides unlocking them. I am simply to preoccupied by playing my main class atm.
<br>and that brings me to point 3 content.
<br>
<br>-Content- (10/10)
<br>Holy smokes so much to do! And most important content I actually find drawn too and is fun to do.
<br>I actually have to make a decision for myself when I log on what I am going to do else I get simply overwhelmed or distracted.
<br>I guess if you&apos;re really only in for raiding then content might be more sparse. But if you like gathering, crafting, playing games (gold saucer),
<br>levelling additional classes etc then there is enough to do you can level all classes and crafting/gathering on 1 character!
<br>Example yesterday I decided to pick up my relic quest again (its basically outdated but I like the weapon it gives).
<br>For people familiar with WoW this is basicly a legendary quest chain and it involves some serious grinding.
<br>I am on the part I had to get items from Fates (basicly little events that spawn all over the map for all people).
<br>Brilliant part is the quest actually also makes you to go back to lower level areas as well instead of making everything max level only also it also incorporate Crafting and the primal trials and quests al over the world. Instead of WoW&apos;s Raid only approach.
<br>So there I was fully decked out running through low level zones doing fates, btw you get scaled down in level when you join one. Another brilliant way to keep things relevant.
<br>I saw so many green sprouts(new players) running around the world just felt alive.
<br>That brings me to point 4 this game is very friendly for new players because of the scaling system you get synced to the level of the dungeons, fates etc.
<br>So a high lv player can always help a low lv player out and it also helps if you have a friend that wants to start the game as well.
<br>Plus the FF team pumps out content patches every 3 months that keeps things flowing.
<br>Since release we already had 2 mini patches (first raid unlocked and savage mode unlock, new pvp zone, new gear mounts recipes etc) And if I understand correctly the first big patch is slated for August/September.
<br>
<br>-Content part 2-
<br>Different part is most of the contents is intertwined with the story. don&apos;t expect to roll a class grind fates till max level and then queue for a raid.
<br>Dungeons are unlocked by the story, primal trials as well and the raids have a quest chain to unlock them some more elaborate than others.
<br>Also hard mode dungeons exist make no mistake this is not the same as WoW Heroic dungeons. Hardmode dungeons are usually continuations of stories related to the normal modes
<br>They have a different path and different bosses in them (sometimes you can see the old paths collapsed or barricaded and you&apos;re being led into a new part of the dungeon.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5387366">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is a testament to just how passionate Naoki Yoshida and his team are about this game, and how willing they were to make things right after the original Final Fantasy XIV MMO launch turned out to be a catastrophe. This appears to be reflected in the player base too, with ARR being one of square Enix&#x2019;s highest grossing titles. I have dabbled in many MMOs over the years, but Final Fantasy XIV still remains my favourite, and the new world of Heavensward takes everything that has made the title so good over the past two years and dials it up to eleven.
<br>
<br>If you are prepared to invest a lot of hours into a game that continually rewards you, I can&#x2019;t think of anything else out there right now better deserving of your time.

Flying in around in the new areas is amazing. Atmosphere, details, graphics over all are great.

<br>
<br>Good things first. The main story is way more interesting and well told than ARR&#x2019;s original storyline, which was quite awful. The voice acting has improved and the music, of course, is wonderful. The new zones look great and flying is fun.
<br>
<br>Not so good things. The zones, while great looking, are still just quest grind hubs filled with generic and mind-numbingly easy to kill monsters that exist solely to be killed to complete fetch quests. You don&apos;t even need to kill them for loot, as your retainer, the npc that you store and sell items through, can be sent out to retrieve items for you while you do other things. Square-Enix stated the monsters would be harder this time around, but all they did was increase their HP pool. It is nearly impossible to die from these enemies unless you disconnect or pull several at a time and just sit there and let them wallop you. They all have very easy to dodge telegraphs, and other than that they just basically auto-attack you. And, of course, you can always just run 10 feet away to leash the monsters should you somehow not be able to kill them before they kill you.
<br>
<br>Nearly every single non-dungeon quest involves killing these boring enemies or clicking on objects on the ground. They really went for quantity over quality. Despite the vastness of the zones, I never felt like I was on an adventure. All you do is tedious busywork. You&#x2019;ll end up doing the same quests with a different script a hundred or more times. There are no dangerous open world areas at all. You can even attack an enemy that is engaging in conversation with another enemy and the other enemy just sits there doing its talking animation while you bludgeon his friend 10 feet away from him.
<br>
<br>The blandness of the enemies is a big problem with both the original game and the expansion. All enemies feel the same. They all either have one or all of the following: a cone/line AoE, a point blank AoE around them, or a targeted circular AoE. None of them feel unique. They&#x2019;re basically all the same monster just with a different model. These telegraphs are incredibly easy to doge. And if you&#x2019;re a healing class especially you can just stand in all of them and easily live.
<br>
<br>This is in stark contrast to SE&#x2019;s previous MMORPG, FFXI, where each monster had different strengths and unique abilities.  When you attack an enemy in FFXIV, you do not take in consideration what the enemy is at all, because it doesn&#x2019;t matter.
<br>
<br>Even dungeon enemies suffer from this blandness. Aside from bosses, all enemies in dungeons are boring trash enemies that are pretty much impossible to die to unless the tank chooses to pull too many packs at once.
<br>
<br>Some of the bosses are fun, albeit quite easy, but, again, you have to wade through trash enemies to get to them. The dungeons are also all linear corridors, just as they were in the original.
<br>
<br>The awful FATE (FFXVI&apos;s uninspired version of public quests) system is back, but now FATEs give less exp than ever before, despite the enemies having giant health pools.  As a result, I see very few people doing FATEs in the new expansion zones outside of the first ones you get dumped into for story missions.  People quickly learn they are pointless to do.
<br>
<br>They also decided to bring over the Hunt system into the new zones. The Hunt involves an enemy spawning every x hours that is either a rank A or S (B rank enemies respawn immediately and offer no reward unless you have a quest to kill it). When these enemies are found, people either post the location in their hunt linkshell chat or shout the position in the chat. After some people show up, the enemy is then obliterated within seconds. This is how you currently upgrade your gear. You spam a handful of easy dungeons hundreds of times for token and then zerg easy monsters mindlessly. Basically, it&#x2019;s the exact same gear treadmill as ARR. Equipment still just boring +base stats. No unique or interesting special effects to be found on the gear in this game.
<br>
<br>Players complained about both FATEs and Hunts being boring and terrible, yet SE decided to implement them again without any changes.
<br>
<br>The new classes look quite cool, but all the classes in the game are quite homogenized and whenever a class is able to stand out in some trivial way it  gets the nerf bat.  White Mages, for example, were able to speed up trash pulls in dungeons by spamming their high MP cost spell, Holy.  SE nerfed this because it was apparent &quot;unfair&quot; that they were better than the other healers at killing garbage monsters.
<br>
<br>So despite how little effort was seemingly put into the quests, enemies and basically everything outside of the music, storyline and zone-design, creating the expansion was apparently so difficult for the FFXIV developers that Yoshi-P promised in an interview that they would never make an expansion this big again, which I find worrying and bizarre when the expansion isn&#x2019;t anything amazing. It&#x2019;s very average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5346992">Expand</a></span>

The only thing this game really lacks is in pvp but for anyone that is pure pve and dungeon raiding this game is for you!  The 3 new jobs this expansion pack added are pretty fun too and very complicated unlike wow and its sad rotations in raids. The only  unfortunate part is if your new to the game you need to get to 50 and completely finish the story line up to this expansion then you can use the new jobs, which will start you off back at level 30.  But in reality you shouldnt be touching them till you get used to the game anyways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5389924">Expand</a></span>

The 2nd primal takes a bit of work, but for most people will still be a one-kill. The crafting system was destroyed in the expansion, as they made it infinitely more grindy while making it less rewarding, and there&apos;s simply very little in the game to do other than farm old content. Classes were also greatly homogenized. I feel like whatever uniqueness FFXIV had in the MMO market has been destroyed in the expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5513351">Expand</a></span>

The new areas are really really large and they make you work to be able to fly, it is a bit of a pain at first but as soon as you are allowed to fly, Oh, man you will LOVE it! the story is amazing again and all of the new adjustments are very very good in general.

<br>
<br>He said it will be tougher areas &gt; They just increased the HP pool of enemies, no new mechanics or real sense of danger, this only make the battles a chore.
<br>
<br>New leves, more difficult and rewarding &gt; Not difficult at all and very expensive to sign on them. It&apos;s just better to grind dungeons to gain more EXP or equipment.
<br>
<br>Crafting will be more open and reward players that stick on a single disciple &gt; You still have to level up all crafting classes to make a single item for your class. The amount of materials of other classes that you need to make a single (and useless) item of your own is silly and frustrating. And, beside of that, crafting equipment are useless compared to the ones you get on raids, tomes and, the worst, even dungeons. You, basically, do crafting only to completion purposes there are not utility behind it.
<br>
<br>For the rest of the game, special currency grinding to get better equipment is becoming a major flaw of the game. Generally speaking, all grinding aspects of this game are maddening but the ones who revolves around acquiring tomes are just infuriating.
<br>
<br>Old content is getting obsolete and a new player who wants to make old raids depends to find a good FC that want to make old content just for fun because the queues to enter with party finder seem infinite.
<br>
<br>Fighting classes are overbalanced. They just feel and play the same. They have added a healer that plays like a mixture of the other two healer classes, a tank that plays somehow like the Warrior and a DPS that is nearly a carbon copy of the Bard. All the traits that made old classes unique are diluting. Right now, there is no reason (more than completionism) to switch between jobs of the same type.
<br>
<br>The worst thing of all, is that all this things are making what it was a good community into an enraged, unpolite and selfish one.
<br>
<br>History is as great as the main game left and, sincerely, is the only thing that would make me come back. That, and the fantastic atmosphere that Nobuaki Komoto have created.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5587991">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For new or returning players, good luck to you for doing the hundreds of useless and uninteresting fetch quests in between &quot;real&quot; main missions.
<br>
<br>Other than that, Heavensward is A Realm Reborn all the same, a beautiful and empty game, destroyed by the laziness of the dev team.
<br>
<br>Story : it is a bit more well-written than in ARR but we are once again swimming in clich&#xE9;s and predictable cliffhangers, with forgettable characters and, for the most part, forgettable story. It has nothing to do with the story of a real FF, it is just a story that wants to be like a FF story, and fails, miserably.
<br>
<br>Quests : even more fetch quests, terribly done and lazy work but you should do them for some free HQ pieces of equipment and unlocking aether currents for flying. Prepare to cross the map back and forth several times for two lines of dialogue.
<br>
<br>FATEs : most of the people hated them in 2.0 but hey, they&apos;re back and they&apos;re the same, but give less exp proportionally.
<br>
<br>Monsters : ironically, the new monsters look terrible except for those directly stolen from other FF (mainly FFXI). Yoshida said that they were going to be hard, well hard only means &quot;HP bags&quot; and hit a bit harder, no new mechanics, all the mobs are the same with different skins, you won&apos;t die if you think and play well.
<br>
<br>Dungeons : corridors, nothing new to expect from these, trash &gt; boss &gt; trash &gt; boss &gt; trash &gt; final boss. Again, no new mechanics, no paths to be chosen, nothing.
<br>
<br>Zones : the new zones are indeed quite big, somehow good-looking but bland and useless since there is no open world content except FATEs, hunts, sightseeing log... Even more useless since you can fly.
<br>
<br>Primals : nothing new, same mechanics as ARR. Oh, and Ravana, the &quot;primal created exclusively for FFXIV&quot; looks awfully close to Narakas in FFXI, again lazy work.
<br>
<br>System : no new retainers and no increase in inventory space, Yoshida said the servers couldn&apos;t handle it. But you can buy even more retainers now if you wish.
<br>The animations and effects look and sound terrible, flashes everywhere, but it&apos;s a nice way to hide the lacking animations, most of the people just disable effects.
<br>
<br>Jobs : the new jobs have no identity and essence, just like all the others jobs, they&apos;re pretty much all the same with different skills.
<br>
<br>Exploration : you don&apos;t explore the way you like, you are forced to explore to be able to fly after unlocking all the aether currents in a zone. Play like the devs want you to.
<br>
<br>All in all, Heavensward is aimed at easy-to-please people, who like to follow an easy story with no subtlety and easy content that looks like it is incredibly hard. If you like chocobos, moogles and whatever FF references put here and there with no thinking and without making any sense, this is your game. If you love and respect FF, you will quickly see that this game is a joke that takes its players for stupid people.
<br>If not, come and pay your sub, buy stuff in the cash shop, buy monthly retainers, buy a lazy extension every year (the next one won&apos;t be that &quot;huge&quot; !) and make Yoshida happy, he hasn&apos;t been sleeping and eating for so long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward/user-reviews?user_review_id=5342012">Expand</a></span>

<br>Flying in Heavensward is so fluid and fun to do, along with the new theme when on certain mounts feels like a sense of adventure!
<br>
<br>If I am going to review this game, I am going to do it knowing what the core of this game is founded on ( It&apos;s story) and I give very few games a 10/10 but man this game surely gave me all the feels that I thought the train would never end!

<br>&#x2665; Lots of customization abilities.
<br>&#x2665; Cross platforms (Players on Playstation can play online with PC players).
<br>&#x2665; Play with a game pad or use mouse &amp; keyboard.
<br>
<br>&#x25C4; NEGATIVES &#x25BA;
<br>&#x25CF; Confusing map system. You don&apos;t know where to go.
<br>&#x25CF; Sometimes there is no music.
<br>&#x25CF; Some times there are voice over to the cut scenes, some times there isn&apos;t.
