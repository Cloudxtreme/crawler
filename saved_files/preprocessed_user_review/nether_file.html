I loved the idea of having an entire city in which to run around and try to survive.  Unfortunately this game has become a showcase of poor design decisions and a dev team that apparently refuses to respond to community concerns and wishes.
<br>
<br>I tried to love the mixture of PVE and PVP game play but ultimately it just isn&apos;t fun. Sadly the idea that you can spend hours and hours gathering gear, surviving the mutant hordes only to be randomly picked off by a sniper that you never even saw, only to have to start again afresh, seems to attract the most blaqtant griefers from all corners of the net. Spawn camping, tea-bagging and general griefing are all strong in Nether.
<br>
<br>If the dev team had opted for either a PVE or PVP mode, i.e. a SP game OR an MP game, I could see this being a success, despite the legions of bugs that infest the current build. Unfortunately there really isn&apos;t any long-term goal to the gameplay other than spawn-collect gear-die-start again. That captured my interest for about a week.
<br>
<br>I really can&apos;t recommend this game to anyone. If you like PVP games then ther&apos;s COD, Battlefield, Unreal Tournament etc. etc. If you enjoy PVE with a survival bent then I&apos;d heavily recommend the STALKER games. Nether is a bizarre attempt to mix both game types and is one which sadly fails at the conceptual level, never mind the currently bug filled execution. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4366577">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game feels like an Alpha, run like and Alpha and didn&apos;t change too much in 9 months.
<br>
<br>- key mapping is not complete (just some keys can be changed, to know what the rest of the keys do, you have to search in the forum for clues)
<br>
<br>- To change settings (controlls, video, audio) you have to connect to a server !!!!!  I&apos;m serious
<br>
<br>- Server browser don&apos;t show the servers ping or location (lag, desync, ecc ecc) and sometimes freeze the entire game.
<br>
<br>- This is a huge pvp map, the Npc creatures are done well but the melee combact doens&apos;t feel smooth at all, the firearms action can be fun.
<br>
<br>- Character animations are the same from alpha, they need a lot of work. (other players are actually fun to watch moving around the map).
<br>
<br>- Characters costumization: almost none, some clothes and mask and they all looks terrible.
<br>
<br>- bugs, bugs and more bugs (ex: invisible walls where the map isn&apos;t finished)
<br>
<br>- Hackers, (due to the impossibility to see the server ping sometimes they are not hackers just people desynching so badly that you see them flying, passing trough walls , ecc ecc).
<br>
<br>- The atmosphere of the game at least is good, I love the big teleporting monsters called Nethers.
<br>It&apos;s a shame, this game could have been so gut but I don&apos;t see it going in other directions than a big death match map.
<br>
<br>- The new way to find stuff by always open boxes, cases, it&apos;s really done bad.
<br>
<br>edit: Good news everyone!!!!    Now they are addings keys that you can buy with real money to open box inside the game to have good loot!
<br>You can even play as a Nether, guess what? to do this you have to buy a potion on the store or buy a key to open a gold box that may have that postion... smooth!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4331622">Expand</a></span>

<br>AFTER SEEING A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF BLATANTLY FAKE REVIEWS I CHANGED MY SCORE TO ZERO TO COUNTER THEM.
<br>Warning: This game is in alpha, but devs purpsoefully removed early-access tag to sell more copies. Even the build is called alpha verison 0.x . Be aware that this ia game made by Sergey Titov, person responsible for a scam that WarZ/Infestation was.
<br>Now my review:
<br>One of the few things I like about this game is it&apos;s great artistic style depicting a city (supposedly based on Chicago) after some heavy-duty apocalypse, too bad the interiors are pretty much non-existent and there are some crappy low-res textures scattered around (omg the vending machines, they came straight from 8-bit games or what !?).
<br>It plays like faster DayZ, which some may hate other may love, basically everyone is shooting others on sight for their gear or just for fun, making this a hardcore pvp game type.
<br>When it works it&apos;s actually fun to fight with others for survival, and of course your gear and earned xp.
<br>It has some extra features such as territory wars, loot drops and courier missions but most are poorly implemented. Still a good thing there are some extra things to do.
<br>The game features skill trees and leveling which is actually pretty ballsy (I always wanted that in DayZ) and this is definitely one of the few good points.
<br>The problem is LAZY AND ASTONISHINGLY POOR CODING.
<br>Physics are non-existent, AI pathing is so bad every monster in the game has teleport ability so they can catch up. Hitboxes suck, there are a lot of colision problems (invisible obstacles).
<br>Interiors are either placeholders or a complete joke, basically large empty room with ramps **** stairs said the devs) connecting floors.
<br>It is also full of sadly P2W MICROTRANSACTIONS, like being able to buy golden keys which open additional loot containers that you can&apos;t open without them, said keys can also be sold for large amounts of in-game money. Apart from those there are mostly cosmetic items to spice up your character.
<br>The game is troubled by massive bugs and hackers are rampant, there are occasional connection problems with the server as well as crashes to desktop.
<br>There are stupid design ideas (like every time you relog your characters teleports to a random location ) that probably stem from HARDCORE LAZINESS THE DEVS PRESENT.
<br>Not only that but also devs are idiots who removed the &quot;early access&quot; and &quot;alpha&quot; tags from the game right before steam summer sale, which obviously a scumbag move to sell more copies. NOT SURPRISING JUDGING BY THE FACT THOSE DEVS MADE WARZ.
<br>
<br>Because of this hardcore laziness, scumbag marketing and generally terrible devs the game that could&apos;ve been awesome is crappy and will probably never get much better. Bad 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4413023">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hopefully Steam will prevent this company from ever selling another game to the pc community.

<br>
<br>I can&apos;t name a single good thing about this game. It&apos;s pretty much WarZ where you replace zombies with mutants.
<br>
<br>If you want any more proof that something is very, very wrong with this game just look at all those fake positive reviews posted by brand new accounts.</span>

<br>In only 25 minutes of playing after that, I found several bugs that I doubt will ever be fixed. When you can&apos;t do basic things like walk up a ladder or if there are ugly looking patches on the map where the level designers didn&apos;t bother to line up the geometry, this is more than just evidence of where the game is in development. This is evidence of how much the developers care about the game and evidence of their ability to make it.
<br>
<br>This lack of quality really demotivated me to try and figure out where the actual resource caches are. I looked all over and through abandoned buildings and only found 2 containers. One needed a key that you pay real money to open, and the other one was empty.
<br>
<br>I paid only $3 for this game on sale, and I still feel ripped off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4297078">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have been playing Nether since early December, 2013, and currently have logged more than 1200 hours in the game. Through the evolution of the beta version there was great transition and tribulation. Many players were dissuaded by the lack of support in curbing hackers from entering the game and putting regular players at a disadvantage. The outcry to curb the hacking and cheats fell on deaf ears and to this day the practice exists openly in the game with some players boasting about their hacks to the game. Many of us urged the developers to create a version where you were not killing other players, but focusing on the Nether only. The game did morph into a split version, one PVP and one PVE. There is a third game possibility called Last Man Standing which was an attempt to allow players to challenge other players in a version of &quot;Who is the better killer.&quot;
<br>
<br>Over time the development company has apparently sold the rights to the game to a third party, who in turn have failed even basic maintenance and have made no effort to enhance the game. Thus the number of players have dwindled significantly. Logging into the PVE servers is a major problem as many of us cannot connect to those servers. The Nether support is quite the joke. The web page technical support is blocked by IE 11 and Mozilla Firefox as unsafe. Forum discussions go unnoticed and basic upkeep of the game functions is lacking in almost all respects. Occasionally they will reset a server and things will work for short periods of time before dwindling into glitched Nether characters and lack of collectible assets. It is sad to see a game that was running upwards of two dozen servers to now having only a few and only a handful of diehard players, of which I consider myself one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=5223091">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As usual anything that douche is involved with, linked too or even observed looking at , this game is a completely unfinished, undeveloped unapologetic cash grab...
<br>
<br>The guy seriously needs to be banished from the gaming community. He is nefarious, untalented and devoid of class.
<br>
<br>As usual mad promises were made, the game sold early access, more promises were made, unhappy customers were silenced, the forums and steam groups locked and censored to keep people from warning others about this sad piece of **** Same old song and dance that we have all become accustomed to whenever this **** &quot;Sirgay Rippov&quot; is involved.
<br>
<br>A word of advice outside of not buying this trashy pathetic excuse for entertainment... anytime a new game sounds too good to be true... do a little research... if **** Sirgay&apos;s name ever comes up, immediately stop looking and move on to a real title.
<br>
<br>If after seeing his name you are still considering buying his **** game, then burn 50 bucks in an ashtray, eat the ashes while standing in front of a mirror and call yourself stupid  while you ram a combat boot up your own ass. It will be a better a more enjoyable experience then playing anything this scumbag is associated with.
<br>
<br>If you have had the misfortune of buying games made by this scamming piece of **** consider getting together and filing a class action lawsuit against him, his companies and associates, and also contact the better business bureau, federal trade commission  and try to press charges against this **** for the many, many, many counts of fraud he has perpetrated against you, your fellow gamers and gaming community as a whole. Seriously.

As of right now when I typed this if you join a server, you will either 1 get an error that says you need to update the gold currency please try again later 2 not be able to join or get re routed back to the main menu 3 no servers in the server list or 4 if you can get a server and join you spawn with 999 max of everything, player kills, health, ammo, etc.. but remain still, can&apos;t move or exit, you need to either shift tab or kill the program to exit.
<br>The devs made it worse by saying they turned over the game to another team in early July, and saying they, phosphor games, will have nothing to do with the game at this point, and all updates are to be don&apos;t by another group.
<br>The last nail in the coffin was when they made their signature game currency, nether gold, available to all products, not just limited to buying only cosmetics and taunts, and upping the price of in game items through the roof. They even removed their previous statement set awhile back about only being able to buy cosmetics and taunts with in game nether gold. This is not nether anymore, just a pay 2 win train wreck scam full of bugs, broken hopes and dreams. On the upside no more hackers, considering they can&apos;t even use the game as well.
<br>Don&apos;t buy the game, at this point I would recommend going for other games such as Day Z, Rust, TF2, or other fps/survival games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4425127">Expand</a></span>

I met a group of players which eventually became one of the largest clans within the game, [UTO].
<br>
<br>I ended up putting just under 500 hours into the game total, the enjoyment dropped as the many games bugs remained undealt with and the developers focused on adding new buggy features against the communities wishes of fixing old content before adding more. The developers repeatedly claimed that the game had VAC enabled anti-cheat software, which turned out on multiple occasions to be untrue. Being a lack of Anti-cheat the game quickly became full of hackers. Slowly servers filled with illegitimate players, starting with just the occasional one or two. But eventually hackers we&apos;re an everyday occurrence which drove many players away, until myself and the rest of my clan could take no more and found other games to play.
<br>
<br>All in all the game had great potential, but with a development team that both lies and doesn&apos;t seem to listen or wish to act on the cries of their community, I don&apos;t see this game going anywhere fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296101">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Besides that there&apos;s really not much else to say than to give you my whole-hearted recommendation to avoid this like the plague. The developers have showed time on and on again that they not only have no idea what they&apos;re doing but they also refuse to listen to the community and one shining example of this is how everyone on their forums and the steam community hub almost all agreed on that players are capable of moving far too quickly. What do they do in Patch 6? Why, increase the base walk speed!
<br>
<br>And as you can probably see on the mindless 100/100 scores being splurted out like spoiled milk by Metacritic accounts that have no other reviews whatsoever, the developers are desperately trying to save the already ravaged public image of this flopping turd game at a daily basis while also eagerly censorshipping any and all criticism the game receives over at the Steam&apos;s community hub.
<br>
<br>Short said, MEDIOCRE game with putrid people behind it, eagerly trying to cover up all the bad parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4336309">Expand</a></span>

Dropping an item for another player, normally a sign of being nice, is here a sign that you have stuff and you will be killed instantly.
<br>
<br>The important areas are camped. I do support camping though since it is a realistic strategy (compared to no-scoping).
<br>
<br>The players I have contacted or chatted with in game are easily the most immature, childish and ignorant players I have ever met in an online community.
<br>
<br>Summary: I always wanted to like this game, and I do enjoy some exciting and fun PvP. The way the PvP plays out though... Its just tiresome and boring. The melee combat in PvP is one of the most underpowered ones I have ever seen in gaming. The survival aspects of the game are very simplified and the game focuses on &quot;gang wars&quot;, which is hard to get into if you get sniped when you spawn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4258516">Expand</a></span>

Mainly: a Nether will kill you with 1 hit despite you being full HP, or you will get stuck in any of the (poor designed) furniture around the map, or you will die from fall damage despite being flying with a glider, or you will die because you spawned near a Nether Swarm and a stupid popup dialog will come in your face blocking your UI...
<br>- If despite everything of the before mentioned you manage to survive, a hacker will always do its job and finish you the more frustrating way possible. Despite of half of rightful community offering to be watchers, asking for spectate mode, asking for anything to be done with hackers, developers are still ignoring this problem that arose in mid february. 5 months later, the problem is worse because, guess what? Hackers know the game is abandoned, and they are more frequent than ever. You will even see some bragging about it. Then you will go to the forums, post a picture and BOOM! get your thread closed because you are prosecuting someone. hahahaha.

<br>RUN FROM THE GAME! Don&apos;t buy it!! Don&apos;t buy any game from this developers, they don&apos;t know how to put together 2 lines of code to fix even the more elementary problems the game has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4406480">Expand</a></span>

<br>6. They just shoved it out the door despite its full of bugs.
<br>7. Terrain is horribly glitched I&apos;ve falling out of the map multiple times, got stuck multiple times, and hell just walked under the map, multiple times. Water is just a joke either it&apos;ll kill you insanely fast &apos;cause you get stuck or just straight up instant kill you.
<br>
<br>Do NOT buy this game, it&apos;s just a pvp mess and doesn&apos;t deserve your time what so ever. If you want a pvp game try counter strike, TF2, hell even COD would be a better choice than this. This is just scam city hell there is even rumors floating around that this is made by the same people that made WarZ (know as infestation now)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4265053">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Besides that making the observation that the game is clearly not ready for released, suffers from crooked groundwork and misguided development cycles, there&apos;s really not much else to say than to give you my whole-hearted recommendation to avoid this like the plague. The developers have showed time on and on again that they not only have no idea what they&apos;re doing but they also refuse to listen to the community and one shining example of this is how everyone on their forums and the steam community hub almost all agreed on that players are capable of moving far too quickly. What do they do in Patch 6? Why, increase the base walk speed!
<br>
<br>The case was the same regarding discussions that the Nether (PvE enemies) needs to be tuned down a bit or be implemented with a proper AI (As all they do right now is spam teleports, being impossible to run from more than 98% of the time due to nonexistant pathfinding). What&apos;d they do shortly after release? Up the &quot;difficulty&quot; in the worst way possible, ofcourse!
<br>
<br>And as you can probably see on the mindless 100/100 omg perfect gaym scores being splurted out like spoiled milk by both other users here on steam and over at Metacritic (that features accounts that have no other reviews whatsoever) the developers are desperately trying to save the already ravaged public image of this flopping turd game at a daily basis while also eagerly censorshipping any and all criticism the game receives over at the Steam&apos;s community hub.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, this is nothing but a MEDIOCRE game that&apos;s unfinished with a bunch of putrid people behind it, eagerly trying to cover up all the bad parts. Needless to say, you should save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4285667">Expand</a></span>

It encourages teamwork and is difficult enough that achieving your goals actually feels like it&apos;s worth something. Overall, the gameplay is fun and engaging, and if the devs can get their **** together and fix the major bugs it would easily be the best post-apocalyptic game I&apos;ve played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4299404">Expand</a></span>

This game exceeds expectations at its playability, and there are very little bugs other then with the dirt bike. Enemies are great and its online is just as fun as DayZ. 10/10</span>

<br>The name of the game is kill or be killed, whether that is from the various creatures scattered about the world or from the other players you share the environment with.
<br>Nether players will quickly become your main concern when you are not within one of the scattered safe zones around the world. Nether players for the most part will shoot first and ask questions later so having your wits about you is key to survival.
<br>
<br>The game world is a decent size and allows for up to 64 players connected to any given server at a time. The servers are plentiful and located by region so you can pick a server that is closest to you.
<br>There are many areas of the map greyed out at the moment presumably to be added in a a later date.
<br>You level up your character by carrying out courier missions, scavenging for  items, crafting and killing monsters. Perks are gained to add to you character as your level increases, and passive perks are gained as your account level increases. The former are lost on death and need to be reacquired so dieing is not without consequence.
<br>
<br>Equipment can be quite hard to come by but for those who wish to fast track to cosmetic glory you can pay real world cash to buy the items you want in game. But for those who enjoy getting things through game play there is nothing you can by paying you can&apos;t get through play. These cosmetic items are found in golden loot containers and opened with keys you can buy with in game currency, and provided you are wearing them or have them in your global inventory they will not be lost on death.
<br>
<br>there are some minor bugs still to be ironed out, including floating terrain features and some glitchy parts of the map that you can get stuck on. Water also appears to be very glitchy as well but i feel sure these issues will be addressed in upcoming patches.
<br>
<br>For the price of a ticket to the pictures you get a very absorbing game, I&apos;ve had over 20 hours so far and still feel like playing some more.

They could be on to something. With adding new combat animations (present animations are fairly static) and a good fleshing out of the NPC quests, weapons, and world events it has the potential to be truly a good game.
<br>
<br>The skill trees - I&apos;ve found myself enjoying the these, building characters for very different things.You can actually specialize which is a major improvement over this studios past games. Again this needs more fleshing out to be truly good and the rate at which you level needs to be toned way the hell down but it is a decent starting point.
<br>
<br>The NPC combat with the teleportation mechanic is actually interesting and outright horrifying. This is a massive step in the right direction (Case in point, if running in the subway while a surge is occurring on the surface... the horrors warped down into the subway because of the noise you make and they damn well try to kill you). The NPC&apos;s are actually pose a threat. Add a dozen + world events and another dozen monsters or so to the game, more weapons diversity (and animations) added, and it could be a very good STALKER-esque game.
<br>
<br>One of the more recent additions are the transformation potions, giving you a short (~2 minute) glimpse of how the monsters behave by letting you play as one. This has been a source of great amusement for me and terror for those on the receiving end.
<br>
<br>The Bad - The playerbase (initially) &amp; Repititon - Before clan assignment you really are just some random schlub. Your life has utterly zero meaning or value outside of a of &quot;loot pinyata.&quot; The good news is that generally clan members do not outright attack each other. There is also a problem of &quot;A lack of things to do&quot; at present. There need to be additional events added that force people to either work together to survive or that make the world more dangerous to all the survivors when they either do nothing or going for a cheap kill. - Needs more horror and more survival is the gist here.
<br>
<br>The Ugly - This is twofold, first the server load time. It is outright atrocious. It easily takes 5+ minutes for the server list to just load up. Secondly, the luggage - Sergy Titov &amp; Hammerpoint interactive the creators of the engine and the mind behind The War Z/Infestation Survivor stories - They have a history of starting projects and never finishing them, moving on well before anything is actually finished. The engine in both Nether and Infestation Survivor Stories is dated and it shows especially in the realm of combat animations. This could be addressed but it has yet to be touched.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4311495">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>the things i liked about the game is first and most of all, the new concept. you no longer fight slow zombies that are impossible to kill and impossible for them to catch you. the enemies you fight this time around are aliens. one of the reasons this is a good thing is because ITS NOT ZOMBIES. i think we all had enough of those sodding things. the aliens you battle in this game can teleport and surround you very quickly, thats why a strategic approach is always advised.
<br>
<br>killing other players can be very annoying, especially if you are new and others that have a higher level get a kick out of ruining the game. it sucks. here it has a smart way of discouraging such behaviour. the more players you kill, the more aliens will be after you. which i think is something unique ive never seen in another game and its a great implementation.
<br>
<br>unable to think of any other positive things, here come the negatives.
<br>
<br>if you dont have someone to play with, it gets boring. and the reason it got boring for me? i played for an hour and i didnt find ONE ENEMY. NO ENEMIES! it was ridiculous!
<br>
<br>there is such an annoying bug once the game has started. it freezes for 5 minutes on the server selection, no alt tab, no mouse movement, no alt f4, youre stuck. control alt delete is possible but then you are forced to terminate the game through system process.
<br>
<br>massive frame rate issues. i had everything in lowest settings and the fps was dreadful. and the most important of all? NOT ALL RESOLUTIONS SUPPORTED! if you have a monitor that is anything other than the standard resolutions you are in trouble. i have a 1050p monitor and that resolutions for this aspect ratio are not included. CLEARLY NOT A FINISHED GAME. you can change the res in the settings file but if you want to change a graphics option then you are forced to chose a resolution as well since all those options are in the same selection and not separately.
<br>
<br>the game has so much promise but it fails to deliver. although i really love the concept and the idea and the mechanics behind it, it is clearly not finished. i would not have bought it for the full price, but the 4$ i spent during steam summer sale to get it, makes me feel like i should wait until the game improves on the things it hasnt before i give it another serious shot.  i hope the game doesnt die since its a new game and there is a player base of 600 people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4315147">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>When developers reach so far as to say: What are you made &#x200B;&#x200B;it to the final stages and will be saying something in the game, it&apos;s likely people will also positively assessed this game. 10 points so far, because I see things that are not included and must progress to the point 10, because 1-2 years from now it will be 10 points of the game like the rest of the game!
<br>
<br>Ha fejleszt&#x151;k eljutnak od&#xE1;ig, hogy azt mondj&#xE1;k: tess&#xE9;k itt van eljutott a v&#xE9;gs&#x151; st&#xE1;diumhoz &#xE9;s valamire mondhat&#xF3; is lesz a j&#xE1;t&#xE9;k, akkor val&#xF3;sz&#xED;n&#x171; t&#xF6;bben fognak pozit&#xED;van is &#xE9;rt&#xE9;kelni ezt a j&#xE1;t&#xE9;kot.

I&apos;m a big fan of DayZ, so as soon as i saw yet another survival open world game i decided to buy it. This game kept me occupied for hours trying to get  gear and defeat the nightmares surrounding me. This game isn&apos;t as amazing as DayZ but it has potential! There are some problems throughout this game though. For example As soon as you spawn you either get killed by Over Powered Player or monster. Also This game is for experienced Survivalists. Because as soon as you spawn in you get killed by other players. But overall i&apos;ve enjoyed this game and i believe it has great potential!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608198">Expand</a></span>

No other game freaks me out like this one.  What matter to me replay-ability and I get that time and time again with Nether.  I f&apos;cking love this game.

But, playing the game, you would think it is still in Alpha, well it&apos;s not. Apparently this game is a full release, which is horrible because the game has an extremely high amount of glitches and bugs, as well as very stuttery jolting player movement. The game has absolutely no story behind it and simply thrusts you into this environment with only a butcher knife. Spawns are all random and do not blend with the environment. They glow and shine, which really creates an eyesore when they are among the bleak apocalyptic environment. Enemies are limited on variety and seem to be scarce until you alert one, then the entire town comes down on your head. Not only do the monsters like to rush you in huge herds, but every monster seems to teleport as well... literally, I mean they have the ability to teleport around, making combat extremely irritating. When you die, you lose everything, including your skills and level, making player advancement VERY annoying.
<br>PvP is horrid due to stuttery movements and unfair placement. It is basically a game that you have to pay to win because unless you use real money to pay for weapons, you are stuck with melee weapons and a handgun, unless you somehow manage to save up enough in game cash to buy weapons at the marketplace. There is no universal bank system to save your cash, so that means when you die, you lose it all, and good guns are incredibly expensive. Safe Zones disable your ability to attack and lose health inside the safe zone, which creates a huge player camping perimeter around each safe zone and usually leads to you getting your face blown off the moment you step foot outside of the safe zone. Food and water seem to be very scare as well and you are constantly becoming hungry and/or thirsty, so a lot of times you end up dying of hunger/thirst.
<br>This game also comes with two DLCs, which are $14.99 and $19.99. These DLC&apos;s do nothing but unlock little portions of the map that are identical to the rest, nothing special in the slightest. Now on top of all of these horrible game features, the creators of the game are built up of mostly the same people who made WarZ, which was a cash grab. Due to the quality, state, and developers of Nether, it is easy to say that Nether is simply another cash grab like WarZ. If you are debating on getting this game, don&apos;t, it is simply a waste of money that would go to the low lives that developed this game just to steal people&apos;s money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nether/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617931">Expand</a></span>
