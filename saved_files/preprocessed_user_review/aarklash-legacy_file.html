<br>
<br>The combat is genuinely interesting and challenging (make sure you play on Hard or Impossible for full effect), the directional heals are a cool idea, as are most of the skills (except for a few generic ones, but can&apos;t have any RPG without a Direct Damage Melee Skill, right?).
<br>
<br>Basically you control a party of 4, 1 Tank, 1 &quot;Healer&quot; and 2 &quot;DPS&quot;, notice I&apos;m using Healer and DPS loosely here, because some DPS classes (you get more Characters later on) are better used CCing enemies or even healing as well. The Main Healer has kind of a blood mage thing going on where he can&apos;t heal without leeching the life of allies and the Tank uses HP for his abilities  and these aren&apos;t all of the interesting mechanics.
<br>
<br>Anyway, this game has decent-enough graphics, decent-enough sound, a good story, questionable voiceover but incredible mechanics, for the price it&apos;s being sold it I can recommend it to everyone who likes gripping tactical combat that requires you to actually think for a change. Great stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3516834">Expand</a></span>

The challenges itself are quite interesting, the game looks good, but there are 2 main flaws: repetitiveness and shallow storyline You end up battling countless of very similar battles with very similar set of enemies (yes, they are challenging, but very repetitive), uniqe monsters/fights appear like 2 per act (so 6 in total). Most of the narrative cut scenes do not contribute at all to the storyline or narrative feeling of the game. For some unknown reason, the weapons/armor of your characters are not customizable (you can only customize some minor trinkets) - so everything plays itself same and looks the same. Yes, with skills progression you unlock new tactics, but not that much - at least for me that was not enough to keep me interested. A pity, as this could be much better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3931892">Expand</a></span>

The combat system is well designed and all information is transparently conveyed to the player (notably stats and skills of your enemies), so that while the battles can be challenging, they never feel unfair. Each battle is a riddle for you to analyze and solve. And boy is solving them fun and rewarding. The active skills of both your group and your advesaries are powerful and interesting, making for intense, dramatic battles where every action counts and victory is never certain.
<br>
<br>Beware that outside combat the game has very little to offer. Basic linear plot (though the setting and characters are cool), no interactive dialogs, no sidequests, no chatting to your companions, no exploration, no merchants, horribly boring randomized loot... But screw checklists. As an RPG this is a very light-weight game, focusing exclusively on the core gameplay, the tactical battles. And it pulls them off so well, that it was a constant joy to play for me.
<br>
<br>So if this sounds like your kind of thing, don&apos;t hesitate. This game succeeds at what it set out to do and is a polished, mostly bug-free experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524610">Expand</a></span>

I am not finished this game to now, and I am playnig only on medium difficulty, but I must say, that it is very chalenging. I am looking forward, when I will play this game</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">My English is bad, but I have to write something to this game, because this game deverse it.

<br>It&apos;s very nice game. I was looking for something like this kind of game for a long time. And at least this time comes. I am not finished this game to now, and I am playnig only on medium difficulty, but I must say, that it is very chalenging. I am looking forward, when I will play this game again from begin in harder difficulty with another chosen skills in my characters. Every character in game have only 4 skills, but I must say that I really like it, becuase the skills are very different and specific and a healer is not only a healer and damage dealer is not only a damage dealer. Every character have very specific skills and is only really on you how you will build it.
<br>
<br>For me pros:
<br>All things on game are very good explained and described, how it works and so. (This is very specific for kind of players like me, if we want to know all about behind functionality)
<br>Very addictive and challenging combat. (I really like planning in pause mod)
<br>Great skill system
<br>Nice graphics
<br>
<br>For me Cons:
<br>Missing pause on dialogue (when not good in English you can lose the storyline in some moments)
<br>Loot items are repetitive (after every loot you must take care if you loot something usable or not)
<br>
<br>But in every case I love this game (hope to some expansions)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3529854">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Aarklash: Legacy is one of the best RPGs I&apos;ve seen in years. The combat, UI and controls are all top notch quality, and in many ways put the big AAA studios like Bioware to shame. The only negatives are the rather shallow story and slight repetitiveness after a while. For only ~20 bucks you&apos;d be insane not give this game a try.</span>

Good atmospheric graphics, adequate sounds, and decent background melodies accompany you on your quest to...well, you&apos;ll have to play to figure that out.
<br>
<br>All lines are spoken, which is a both a valiant effort and a mixed bag in delivery.  Some of the voice acting I found to be exciting and fantastic, some of it was just OK, and a few parts seemed a bit awkward.  The story is good, but it&apos;s nothing new  however it is delivered very well.  I certainly wanted to know what was going to happen next even when I was pretty sure how the plot would turn out and I was pleased with how it was delivered.
<br>
<br>There are some puzzles that might make you pause to think, most can be completed with a little though or some trial and error.  I never got stuck, but I was able to just run through all the puzzles mindlessly  a good balance.
<br>
<br>The combat is the real hero of this game, and there&apos;s plenty of it.  The tactical action is massively fun and the game play is exemplar.  Customizing your character&apos;s skills for a tough battle or changing you party layout is elegant and fun.  There are some challenging bosses where positioning, thinking out your strategy and making good decisions are required to succeed.  Just using the same 1 skill per character or trying to rush through with auto attacks will not give you success, particularly if played on a challenging mode (I recommend setting the game to Hard for anyone who has played a tactical RPG before).
<br>
<br>The game has a good length, I felt it was just right.  It&apos;s not epic, I didn&apos;t get bored playing at any point.  A developer could have taken this style, put in hours of filler and missed the mark, or they could have made it too short making me want much more.  For the budget price, I found the value to be massively worth the money I spent.
<br>
<br>What could be better?  More itemization, additional skills, more quests, more characters, a sequel, sure.  But what you get is more than enough to have a fantastic experience.  That&apos;s the mark of a great game, it gives you a great time and makes you want more, more, more.  I really hope their is additional content or a sequel in the works.
<br>
<br>I recommend this game. 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3571984">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s the most fun and difficult tactical party combat game I&apos;ve played since DA:O. If you&apos;re in to this type of stuff, buy it immediately and play on hard.

<br>I&apos;m half way through and haven&apos;t encountered any bugs. Aarklash great way to spend 20$, especially among all the crummy RPGs we&apos;ve been getting.

This is the old school infinity engine style of combat plan and simple, same as you would see in Icewind Dale, but a bit more limited. That&apos;s actually the only thing I did not like about the game, was that they limited the player a bit to much in the area of skills and interactions. You also only control 4 characters at once, and in some fights you will be facing off vs. up to 8 enemies at the same time. Other then that though, they nailed it, with a great fluid combat system with competent ai and some interesting character choices to make as your wheel swords level up. The story is nothing to write home about, though I did really enjoy the universe that it was set in. The voice overs were also pretty bad at some points, but even the worst of them were better then some things I have seen from other games.
<br>
<br>In short, if you are looking for a good pick up and play tactical game that wont take it easy on you, then this is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3584267">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The rest isn&apos;t so good. It uses puzzles to break up the combat which are all insultingly easy and very repetitive, the same thing multiple times. Story and characters are pretty bad too.</span>

You can change your characters or group composition before every fight, making it somewhat of a puzzle game  what combination can beat this fight. With this in mind, the game relies heavily on quick save-quick load to go back and try fights again. The tactics involve various buffs, debuffs, CC and damage skills, used to take out high priority mobs (healers, CC) before others. The game tries well to put together some crazy combinations of units that are very hard to defeat. Overall, well worth 20$</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3530339">Expand</a></span>

<br>===========
<br>This game is a typical Dragon Age Origins game but whose focus is heavily on the core gameplay mechanics and is a MUST PLAY. I LOVE IT.</span>

<br>
<br>When I die in the first hour of playing a game, that always makes me happy. Well, so long as that death isn&apos;t from bad controls, bad camera angle or some other infuriating not-skill-based thing. I died purely because I sucked, didn&apos;t strategize properly or observe my enemy&apos;s moves and movements. I love that kind of death, it makes have to actually take the game seriously and play like I mean it.
<br>
<br>So with that bit of gushing out of the way, downsides.
<br>
<br>The graphics are average at best. There&apos;s some glitches, like I saved inside of a tiny cave that was a little separate from the main map and when loading that save I was just stuck. Had to restart from the last autosave.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s still a very solid game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527760">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Edit: playing through the game for the first time took me 13 hours on the third difficulty setting. There&apos;s some interesting fights towards the end of the game although I would have preferred for packs of mobs to be slightly easier and bosses a tad harder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520008">Expand</a></span>

Crank up the difficulty, and every encounter requires proper management of your group of four to succeed and enemy abilities require you to actually pay attention.
<br>
<br>Combat is designed so that you can (and must) pause regularly to give orders to the group. This is similar to the original Dragon Age, and--though it sounds strange if you&apos;ve never done it--it can be as much fun (or more) than real time combat.
<br>
<br>To keep things interesting, you can alter the members and skill trees of your group at any time. Characters have a limited set of spells, but you&apos;re expected to use most of them on a regular basis (and the game doesn&apos;t give you much time to learn them on the harder modes). Skill trees drastically alter the skills, and since those skill trees can be reset at will, there&apos;s ample opportunity to tweak the group for every fight and to experiment.
<br>
<br>Art style is similar to Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3; character movement is performed in a similar manner (point and click).
<br>
<br>The game does have flaws. A crash rendered my quicksave unusable. Fortunately an autosave allowed me to at least start at the beginning of the area.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s graphics are fine (for the art style), but they appear to need optimization. The game (on a static pause screen, no less) spikes my video card temperature worse than any game I&apos;ve played on this machine, games with much more action, larger maps, and far better graphics. For this style of game, I can live with turning down my settings, but I shouldn&apos;t need to.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is mostly good, although the editing could use some work (e.g. gaps in conversation that make it obvious the lines were pieced together).
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve found a variety of little user interface bugs/behaviors, but nothing that couldn&apos;t be fixed with a patch (or even better help text in a few places).
<br>
<br>In brief, this is a game that deserves attention. It definitely has niche appeal, but you might be surprised to find yourself part of that niche.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarklash-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3525991">Expand</a></span>
