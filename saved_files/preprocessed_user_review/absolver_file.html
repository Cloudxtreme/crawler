There are some fairly serious issues with connectivity at this point such as lag in the game world, and the occasional difficulty connecting to PvP matchmaking.
<br>
<br>While serious, those issues have a very low impact on my score because of how supportive and responsive the developers have been. The game is patched frequently, and every update brings the game close to its full potential.
<br>
<br>Depth of gameplay and world building are where this game really shines. The combat system will feel familiar to players of games like soul calibur, virtua fighter, and dark souls, but ultimately, Absolve really is unlike any combat system I&apos;ve seen before. The short version is you get to build your own combos from a large pool of available attacks that all have their own levels of speed, power, and timing, and then string them together with your two attack buttons. This means that every player can create their own unique combat style and techniques. This means you can adapt to any challenge the game world throws at you for one, but it also makes the PvP incredibly deep and satisfying.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s story mode is fairly short, but that doesn&apos;t really take anything away from what makes Absolver great. The different areas (all linked together into a seamless world) are designed with branching paths and lots of little hidden corners. While Absolver doesn&apos;t do as great a job as the Souls games at rewarding exploring, there are still a few good hidden treasures and rewards for poking around and finding all the corners. The lack of a map also gives you a feeling of initially getting lost, but then finding your way again as you become more and more familiar with the world. This obviously won&apos;t be appealing to every player, but again, that&apos;s a big selling point for the Souls games as well.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: The game has some rough edges now, and if you&apos;re primarily interested in PvP, I would wait a couple of weeks for the online stability to even out some more. However, looking at Absolver for what it is even in its current state reveals a great game with a great combat system, and a great community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7512982">Expand</a></span>

The dev team really listens to their played, the combat is tight and beautiful to watch, and the community is great for a game so new.  True, the content is limited in terms of game world, but does that really matter in a fighting game?  It&apos;s the mechanics that count, and they are stellar here.</span>

It seems like people blindly purchased the game without looking into what it aimed to achieve. This is an excellent fighting game. Period. It has a fun over-world that acts as a training ground and lobby. It has a very intricate combat system. It has a beautiful art style. All animations are hand keyed. The price of the game is only $30. Think of it more as an indie fighting game, not a triple A release trying to clone dark souls as others have claimed.
<br>
<br>One reoccurring complaint I see is the difficulty of fighting multiple enemies. Yes, in the first hour or two it is difficult, but it teaches you positioning and stamina management. Afterwards it is fun to fight two enemies.
<br>
<br>Another complaint is region locking. While I can understand this being frustrating, remember that this is a tiny dev team without the budget to do state of the art matchmaking or pay for dedicated servers across the globe.
<br>
<br>The only complaint I understand is the AI not wanting to leave their designed area. It is annoying when they run back to their spawn area if you pull them too far away. I imagine this was done to prevent frame drops and other QA problems by not allowing NPCS to be pulled too far and have too many on screen. Again, the dev team is tiny. I would hope this and other small nitpicks will be address down the road.
<br>
<br>All in all I would highly recommend this game. Just don&apos;t blindly purchase it without looking into what it offers. Why would you do that with any game though?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7486577">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Some connection issues when you are not in EU/NA (It will be fixed in an upcoming update)
<br>- Region locked (Didn&apos;t try myself)
<br>- Tutorial is not very clear
<br>
<br>Other
<br>= The Game is like Darksouls with the exploration aspect A.K.A no real map or sense of direction. Some people will like it and some will not.
<br>
<br>You will either love the game or think it is ok/bad, so go give a try and if you don&apos;t like it refund it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7491243">Expand</a></span>

<br>Nowadays companies are blinded by reviewing the same type of games year after year, if its not COD or FIFA they give a thumbs down to a game.
<br>
<br>This game is all that For Honor tried to be, and WAY better, the customization of your combos, and a stats system that really works (i hate those games that have stats and administrate them on their own way on level up, why do you make a stat system if you wont leave their players change it?) its what drew me in.
<br>
<br>It is an original game, flawless, and it gives this great sensation when you engage your combos in a harmonic way, the sound of a well placed kick in the face ending your opponent, and a great connection on the pvps i had, even on the launch day, its something very hard to archieve on a game, and this game did it.
<br>
<br>If you liked dark souls, and enjoyed For honor but wanted it well made, this is your game, you&apos;re not going to regret it, plus the complexitity of the fighting system its very solid and will make great for a competitive game.
<br>
<br>Give it a try, and dont let the &quot;money sucker reviewers&quot; confuse you with their mixed reviews, they give low scores to games that are not fifa and cod anyways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7486519">Expand</a></span>

For this to be a proper fighting game, netcode issues are a big deal and they miserably failed in this aspect.
<br>
<br>The combat system and combat deck building is good, but what use is all this when playing the game turns into a frustrating experience where rather than fighting your opponent you&apos;re fighting with network issues.
<br>
<br>People outside America have lag issues and teleporting enemies during matches, this should never have been released outside america as a full release game and it is borderline false advertising to do so. It is not ok for devs to use paying customers as test dummies for their servers and netcode especially when they advertise the game as a full release. Did I mention these issues also persist in coop pve? A friend of mine who lives &lt; 3km away from me and we still experience teleporting enemies when the other is the host; yes we tested both ways.
<br>
<br>This aspect makes the game literally, not figuratively, unplayable. Already ordered my refund, I advise everyone getting the same issue to do the same. And if you don&apos;t live in America, don&apos;t buy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7486986">Expand</a></span>

<br>For Honor Meets Dark Souls
<br>Absolver is a martial arts focused combat souls like game where you play as your created character with your own selected fighting style and set out into its world to take down all of the marked ones and open a gate&#x2026;
<br>This game can be played either offline or online where pvp is possible.. But co-op Is also possible...
<br>this game is a souls like not because of its difficulty, its fairly easy and everything can be seen in under 5 hours, it&#x2019;s a souls like because how it is delivered&#x2026;
<br>this is one open world with enemies around every corner, these enemies will respawn when you leave an area or activate a meditation post which is where you fill up your health&#x2026;
<br>there is the little fog you enter to take on the games bosses&#x2026;
<br>but this is the only dark souls part about it&#x2026;
<br>the combat here is decently fun
<br>you&#x2019;re able to do heavy attacks, light attacks, dodge and block, but there are 4 different fighting stances you can take and these stances will determine the moves you can pull off&#x2026;
<br>And you learn more moves outside of your selecting fighting style through combat with either other player or enemies within the world&#x2026;
<br>moves are leveled up as you use them, but by blocking them your character will start to learn them and eventually you&#x2019;ll be able to use them yourself&#x2026;
<br>though the blocking is probably the most annoying part about this game&#x2026;
<br>As enemies are either blockers or they aren&#x2019;t&#x2026;
<br>that&#x2019;s the only think that makes a boss &#x201C;challenging&#x201D;
<br>is they they spam the block button instead of force you to evade and time your attacks&#x2026;
<br>because of this I found the game to just be very button mashy opposed to a game like for honor where you have to read your opponent a bit
<br>Sure you can wait for them to stop blocking and attack when they do&#x2026;
<br>but you can also really just mash buttons and use your special abilities..
<br>Which are unlocked as you progress the game...
<br>Depending on the class you pick you can use an ability to gain health by striking until you take damage or the timer runs out, or stunning your enemy for some free shots...
<br>these abilities need to be filled by taking or dealing damage though, which is a fair bit of balance, running around isn&#x2019;t going to help you&#x2026;
<br>but as you&#x2019;re running around if the game doesn&#x2019;t have server issues like it started to on launch..
<br>You&#x2019;ll see other players running around or fighting and you can either step in and help, ignore them, or attack them&#x2026;
<br>I was attacked a few times, but it was never annoying when it happened... as I came out on top every time..
<br>it&#x2019;s sort of satisfying to be attacked by a player, put them in the ground and then revive them after putting them in their place&#x2026;
<br>Doing so will make the 2 of you neutral instead of hostile
<br>but you&#x2019;re able to offer them your help or request help, offer a truce and play co-op together without battling..
<br>And there is a loot system here&#x2026;
<br>there are weapons you can pick up and equip, though the break... and character can have much stronger gear for protection or lighter gear for speed and strength..
<br>so you have to be careful who you attack if you do
<br>But there is definitely some trolling potential on a certain bridge where a player Can use their push back attack on passing players.. So look out for it...
<br>Technically though the game plays pretty smoothly though I did run into some lagging before the server problems happened and part of the world disappeared once and I got stuck in a hole  forcing me to back out into the main menu
<br>I found absolver to be fun.. though once you see all there is to see, the world loses a bit of its charm
<br>There is replayability in the form of leveling your character and combat moves through player vs player 1v1 of course, but the combat isn&#x2019;t deep enough to be fun in its own dedicated competitive mode and there isn&#x2019;t a deep enough world to make this replaybility anything but artificial outside of it
<br>This is a beat in a weekend game which isn&#x2019;t a bad thing&#x2026;
<br>I give Absolver
<br>a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7485107">Expand</a></span>

<br>- even after a month after the release, still people report single player bugs, game crashes, and losing their saves.
<br>- game claims to be an online fighting game with the promise of deck and variety, however, all combat boils down to button mashing (with few favorable attack combinations) in the brief moments when you have a stable server connection --and believe me, those are brief.
<br>- single player campaign lacks any excitement, and background music doesn&apos;t help the pain of cheap boss battles. i&apos;m giving a score of 3 just because the game provides a single player campaign of 2-3 hour completion time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7667599">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>if you are looking for martial arts dark souls, your out of luck, the games story is small and more about world building then an actual fleshed out story.  Devs have said they have more PVE stuff in store, but its still not the main focus.
<br>
<br>More up front, stability issues, its had a fair bit, while I personally experience it seldomly, some players experience it a lot more.  The stability is getting a bit better every patch.
<br>
<br>1.06 patch happened, 2 days later they reverted it, and gave the most genuine response a dev company I have seen in recent years.  They full admitted to changing too much at once, and said they will use a lighter touch in the future and evaluate more.  They didn&apos;t revert everything, but they reverted the things that were breaking the game.
<br>
<br>Now lets get to the good stuff.
<br>
<br>The games pvp 1v1 combat is amazing.  It is thrilling and fluid and fun to watch as well to play.  Make no mistake, this is a fighting game in spirit despite not being a side scroller.  It has that same level of barrier to entry that many players are driven away from the fighting community.  You will get demolished with pressure if you do not learn to use your specials to get out.  If you cannot learn it, you will keep getting destroyed mercilessly.
<br>
<br>However the comeback mechanics and getting out of pressure is still easier then say...Tekken 7 currently is.
<br>
<br>This is also a thinking mans fighting game.  You have to build your characters moveset from the ground up.  A good deck is half the battle in this game, and some players struggle with learning it (i know i did) but once it clicks, you can make some amazing stuff happen.
<br>
<br>Newest patch is a strong step in the right direciotn and proof that while they listen and take feedbakc to heart, they also have there own minds and are not just simply pandering to whoever cries loudest.
<br>
<br>small team, great devs, great game, population will only grow if they keep to updates like this.
<br>
<br>near future is ways to color your gear, ranked mode, 3v3 mode, and some kind of dungeonesque PVE thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7533730">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game has it all. Engaging combat, soundtrack, visuals. If you have friends, they&apos;ll be amazed by all the ways you can hit them in the face. You can found your own school and teach those who lack discipline! Learn from every hit you take (actual game mechanic) and eventually dish out some lessons yourself.
<br>
<br>What you learn is represented by these sick cards that will remind you of old timey instructional scrolls featuring painted stances and forms; Mix and match them to create your own fighting styles including weapon styles. While the game is not entirely focused on weapon combat you could design your character in such a way that you gain access to it faster than most. Weapons in this game can be used until they are sheathed, taken by force or break off on your opponent&apos;s face.
<br>
<br>You can toggle between online, invite only and offline mode. Co-op and courtesy in online play is common but be wary of your friend&apos;s fists of fury. Luckily these rules apply to everything else in the game which makes for some interesting encounters and strategies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/absolver/user-reviews?user_review_id=7536229">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Beautiful art style
<br>+ You can play in coop
<br>
<br>- A small amount of content
<br>- A lot of grind
<br>- Some problems with the game servers on release
<br>
<br>From my point of view there are no reasons to by these game for a full price untill Absolver has a lack of content.</span>
