<br>
<br>But after you&apos;ve scratched the surface, you&apos;ll find nothing but exploitative PW cash shop (pay IRL money for respecs????) the game has been hacked to shreds and they refuse to reset not to mention the region locking.

<br>
<br>(1) Forget about customizing your character.
<br>Unlike in something like DDO.com, where even in character creation you&apos;re picking feats, skills, spells and stats, Neverwinter gives you almost no ability to customize your character. Playing up to level 10 or so, I&apos;ve not seen any serious flexibility in the abilities my character has. You can only slot about 5 different attacks, maximum, unlike in other D&amp;D games where you could have literally dozens of abilities available at any time. This makes Neverwinter seem dull even in comparison to games like DDO and NWN which were released many years ago.
<br>
<br>(2) Start caring about your twitch skills
<br>Combat in Neverwinter is very different to any other D&amp;D game I&apos;ve played. In most D&amp;D games, it is your armor, your spells, your general character build that matter. It doesn&apos;t matter if you stand in a pile of kobolds  if you have crafted yourself some armor of invulnerability, have enough armor class, or the right spells, they cannot hit you AT ALL. Other D&amp;D games reward thinking, planning, and generally knowing your stuff. Neverwinter doesn&apos;t care about any of that, all it rewards are twitch skills. Enemy mage about to fireball you? Forget having fire resistance gear. Forget ducking around a corner. Forget casting a protective spell, or trying to take him out first. In Neverwinter, a red circle appears on the ground and you run away from it. That&apos;s it. It takes all the depth out of the game, making it more about your average first person shooter&apos;s twitch skills than anything which resembles any other D&amp;D game I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>
<br>(3) Get ready to be treated like you&apos;re 8
<br>Everything in Neverwinter glows, flashes, or sometimes both at once. Yes, it looks pretty, but after awhile you start to feel like the game&apos;s designers consider you their personal lab rodent  easily distracted by anything shiny.
<br>
<br>(4) Enjoy your weak-ass characters
<br>Going back to DDO.com, in that game, I can construct a level 4-7 mage who can one-shot kill entire groups of enemies with a single spell. Yes, it takes game knowledge, crafting, etc, but it is possible. If you know your stuff you can absolutely kick ass in amazing ways. In Neverwinter, it takes a long time to kill each enemy, and AOE effects tend to be quite weak. The result is that, for my class (wizard/sorc) at least, it plays more like a slow grind fest than a game in which I&apos;m supposed to be an offensive caster.
<br>
<br>Upsides:
<br>Neverwinter does look pretty, and the ability to have player-created dungeons is great. That said, nothing can disguise the fact this game is based on the horrible 4th edition rules, which severely limit your gameplay in all the ways that actually matter. If your child wants an easy introduction to D&amp;D, give them this. If, on the other hand, you&apos;re considering trying this yourself, don&apos;t bother. Even ancient D&amp;D games like NWN, or MMOs like DDO, have far deeper immersion and more meaningful choices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3232497">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, that is the only thing this game has going for it. PvP is massively broken thanks to bots farming glory, player created content has little to no reward for doing it thanks to Craptic&apos;s policy of &quot;it&apos;s okay to farm OUR content, but don&apos;t you dare design more efficient farms than ours&quot;.
<br>The chat system is so broken and badly designed, it&apos;s not funny. Every single Craptic title has the same feature, IE: If a certain amount of people ignore you, you get a 24 hour silencing. Takes even less people using the &quot;report spam&quot; feature on you to silence you for 24.....and people are grouping together to silence others intentionally. Oh, and if the silence falls in one of their games...it hits in all of their games.
<br>
<br>Sure all content is free...except for certain races restricted to packs only....which is the exact opposite of what Craptic advertised in the beginning. They said &quot;no charging for races, classes or content.&quot; and that went the way of the dodo in the first &quot;expansion pack&quot;.
<br>
<br>Character customization is nonexistant. You will look like everyone else in the game....just different colors. Sure, you can dye your armor...but it&apos;s still the same damn armor everyone else wears.
<br>
<br>Questing is on rails.
<br>
<br>Having played a character to level 40(yes, I sunk some time into this game. I&apos;m not just going to give it ten or so hours and trash it) I can honestly say the game is NOT pay to win.....it IS, however pay to be comfortable, which is much worse, IMHO. You can&apos;t truly enjoy the game unless you lay out some cash....and then things get worse. Upgrading characters to be able to do high end content WILL cost you either money or years of time. Yes, literally years.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: Don&apos;t waste your time on this free to pay game, nor this company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4118808">Expand</a></span>

<br>The combat ist fun! But after a couple days you realize that the whole combat happens around evading enemy special attack via shift-move into a direction. In fact a Tank is totaly gimped cause he cant evade instead he blocks and gues what blocking is nonsense in this game. The higher you get the less people need a tank.
<br>Because the whole combat is NOTHING but evading special attacks a class that can control enemys is superior. That means many high end groups consists of 4 mages and a cleric..... but even the cleric isnt needed when the mages are good.
<br>As a perfect World game its a pure DPS race.... you played Star Treck online? Yes same here. No strategy.... DPS &gt; All
<br>
<br>Game can be played for free, and for quite some time.... you WILL buy a Horse eventualy (30&#x20AC; alone for that on average lol). Bigger inventory helps too. Nothing gamebreaking.... untill you get to max level. Enchanting your weapons can cost a fortune. So in the endgame you realy need so invest some Cash if you plan to compete in PVP.
<br>
<br>Overal the game is not a strategic D&amp;D game but a asian action grinder. But a GOOD one! So you like asian action grinder then you will LOVE this game! All others dont INVEST cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4415839">Expand</a></span>

There is very evident paywall between you and everything else - any upgrade for your companions, gear, and respec points. This damages the experience so much that at some point the &quot;henchman&quot; you bring along with you actually gets in the way more than it helps. This alongside with the very poor AI attached to your companions will often get you frustrated with their limited ability to act effectively . Same goes for the profesion trees. You practicaly have no use for any of them but leadership witch alow you to get some aditional astral diamonds. The game have 3 currencies. Gold (largely useless), astral diamonds (can be used for almost anything) and Zen (you can get anything with it). Zen can be obtained (at the moment) only with real money. There is astral diamond to Zen exchange but at this moment the Zen backorder is so high that it takes ages to get any and this is only logical as the only way to get one is for a player to sell it. The sad truth about it is that you have absolutely no incentive to sell Zen as you can have anything with Zen...
<br>
<br>The chracter progression is so flat that it actually doesn&apos;t matter what stats you will get... The only thing you can make is difference is the skill pick order and its really limited difference. I have played a tank based control wizard - and it have less than 20% difference in combat time... ... ... ... worthless to say the least. Just get health on any character and you win.
<br>
<br>PVP is the stupidiest idea you can have in the endgame... The only way you can win is to get items with alot of ZEN and to be pay-to-win player. I played like 2 matches at level 60 (end game level) and totaly quit the PVP.
<br>
<br>Besides all that nonsence the game have like 1200-1700-2000 miliseconds server lag that kills any idea for player risks. Don&apos;t even try to approach that game as MOBA. It will be your worst mistake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4397832">Expand</a></span>

I myself have blown over $300 just to get extra character slots and some new classes and races since it doesn&apos;t seem like they will EVER give them to you for free.  Seriously!  I had no idea that this game was going to continue down the road like this.  I understand buying a starter pack or something, but races, class, etc... should be part of the updates just like in Guild Wars 2 (who by the way make a **** load off of their cash shop, but it doesn&apos;t interfere with their amazing content updates and isn&apos;t required to play, have fun, keep playing at end game, etc...).  THIS GAME HAS NOW COST ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS BUYING SEVERAL EXPANSIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS WITH World of Warcraft!!!  If  you want to play this game then expect to eventually be willing to pay out your ass.  Otherwise you&apos;re very limited in what you can do and play.  Who wants to play a game where in order to just get a new race or class you have to shell out $35 to $75 or more!  I would have rather purchased the game and payed month subscription fees for content.  I will NEVER buy or play another game from Cryptic or Perfect World or any other game companies that continue this horrible Pay2Win concept.  (The game itself is ok.  Looks good, plays fine, I was really excited about it when it was coming out and stayed with it for a while.  I have played maybe 100 hours or so of the game and have many friends who tried it as well.  The developers are literally forcing updates that end up changing game mechanics so the few things that you could actually get in-game instead of using the cash shop are not possible anymore or are will take sooooo much time that you&apos;ll give up way before (like getting the Angel companion which I hear requires you to log-in once each day for 360 days and you get it for free.  A whole damn year!)).
<br>
<br>FYI the game Guild Wars 2 that I mentioned before is NOT a pay to win.  You just get extra cool stuff if you WANT to from the store that make your character look cool.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>I hope I prevent others from buying these type of titles.  Even one person would be worth this review.  WE need to STOP contributing to the Pay2Win game concept, so that they will stop making these horrible horrible games that only drain your bank account.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4420584">Expand</a></span>

Milking the D&amp;D brand for all its worth to fund other projects while letting this one fall to the wayside and go completely underdeveloped.  A majorly broken game (with main character powers that are broken for months if not years) with no apologies or apparent intention to actually fix the problems THEY created to rush re-used, stale, content out the door.  ALL of these problems are abundant and rampant in this game.  This very much is a PAY2win scenario game, and they keep trying to make that situation even worse with every new module. I could not recommend this game to anyone for any reason at this point.  Avoid this game.

<br>Before level 60, it&apos;s not as obvious that it&apos;s a pay to win game.  At level 60, if you pve everything is fine unless you like being kicked out of dungeons so you can&apos;t loot.
<br>
<br>If you are into PVP, expect highly unbalanced matches with whatever broken class comes into play.  Expect that you&apos;re going to see people with paid for items annihilating you and broken skills.
<br>
<br>Loyal players have stuck it through only to be given horrible customer service.  Items lost over bugs and their items not refunded.  If you buy the packs that cost over 50 dollars (there&apos;s even one that is 200 dollars) you might get better treatment...don&apos;t count on it.
<br>
<br>People getting banned for dumb reasons only to finally get unbanned weeks later.
<br>Exploiters not getting banned even though they should.
<br>
<br>If you enter the forum with concerns about how broken the game is, mods close down the threads. They do not care about their customers and it&apos;s a very toxic environment all around.
<br>
<br>In October, they raised 30,000 dollars from us players for extra life charity.  They promised we&apos;d get rewards within a couple of weeks. Still haven&apos;t obtained them.  Once again, another slap in the face.
<br>
<br>Avoid this one like the plague.

It comes off as FTP but it is tries to goad you into spending a lot of money. My character was level 16 still using a level 6 bow and yet in one dungeon run I got 8 epic lock boxes that cost real money to unlock. You have to gamble in the hopes that one of the boxes may contain a useful item. The game even spams you on what others got if they payed to open their endless supply of lock boxes as a means to goad you to do the same. To be honest I never did because it seemed so blatantly obvious. I realize a FTP game requires some form of revenue to justify the game, but there is a fine balance between nudging a player to pay and pushing them to pay. Not only do they push you they want to charge you exorbitant prices as well. It ruins the game because you realize rather quickly how dependent the game play is based upon how much you are will to spend. If you give in to temptation you will spend far, far, more than the game is worth.
<br>The mouse look feature was just ridiculous. You are in this constant mouse look where your mouse movement moves your view around and that is how you target individuals and then you have to always hit &apos;f&apos; to communicate with someone. It gets old fast. If you want to click on a radial menu you have to hit &apos;alt&apos; to get out of mouse look which then makes the whole screen go quasi-dark while the items you wish to select remain in full color. The problem is not only does it come off clunky but it looks as if you are pausing the game when you are not. Good luck trying to activate some control with your screen darkened and then hear some half-orc start pounding you.
<br>The Foundry where individual players can make their own quests to share seemed pretty good in concept until you actually play. Don&apos;t get me wrong there are some good ones but there are many that are amateurish. Case in point, I took part in a player created quest that was rated at 5 stars (very good), but I couldn&apos;t finish it because the 3 different solutions to finish the quest all required I had to have some skill or item which I didn&apos;t have and was stuck until I just exited the quest incomplete. It would have been nice if it told me ahead of time what I needed. Not only that but the player had put two males in a hotel room and asked if I wanted to participate or something and in another room there was a man with a horse on the bed. The man had a stupid grin on his face and the dialog stated &quot;I don&apos;t want to know.&quot; Neither of those two scenarios provided anything to the completion of the quest and instead just came off as amateurish. Oh, and you can only do an in-game review of a quest if you finish it so in this case I was unable to share my experience because I had to exit the quest prematurely.
<br>In another player created quest that was actually kind of good there was an element of pointless dialog.  My character kept asking the ghost in the scenario if it was going to help me fight the monsters. Each time the answer was no and yet my character kept asking. Why? What was the point? It actually got kind of annoying. Another part was the player had created some mini-background story for each boss in the dungeon. It was kind of cool because it helped to give you an immersive experience but it lost its impact when each boss had to have some cool sounding name to their history (that&apos;s why he is called Reaper of Souls, or that&apos;s why he was named Harvester of Light). Yawn, oh well. So I have mixed feelings about the Foundry. Depending on the creativity of the individual and their maturity level you may get some really good quests or you may get a lot of stupid ones.
<br>I played WOW for a number of years, I still do, and one thing that is good about wow was the ability to choose need or greed on a dungeon item. In Neverwinter you can do the same but it is done in a way that negates the concept. When loot drops it is not identified. Your character could potentially need it because it shows as green but you won&apos;t know fully unless you actually choose need to increase your chance of winning the item over those who select greed. If you therefore win it you have to use an identity scroll to see what it is. You would end up with something your character could use but not necessarily need because you already have something good in that slot. Because of the game not letting you know what you are rolling for you have to roll need every time or else you will lose out since ever one else will always roll need. The only point is to get you to use up your identity scrolls and nothing more. It is just plain stupid.
<br>Bottom line: the game is a cash cow to exploit the players. The game seems fun for the first few days but gets old quick. Like being in a new relationship the game plays upon that excitement in the hopes you will spend a lot while you are still giddy, but in the end you feel cheated because you realized you were just being used.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3865059">Expand</a></span>

To be honest I was disappointed. The potential for the combat system was immediately apparent to me but an almost criminal lack of polish or customization, and boring gameplay withhold this title from greatness.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>1. it&apos;s free (self-explanatory I hope)
<br>2. it&apos;s accessible: your character&apos;s main attacks are mapped to the mouse buttons like in Diablo III or Torchlight II. You also will not ever find half your screen occupied by different abilities and stats screens such as in WoW.
<br>3. the population is healthy: even in the starting area this far into the launch there was a large volume of players present. This at least means you won&apos;t be lonely in the land of....eh...whatever it&apos;s called.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>1. &quot;is that supposed to be lip sync?&quot; is what I wondered at every piece of cheesy dialogue. there was a full second delay between the voices of NPC&apos;s and their character model&apos;s lips moving up and down stiffly.
<br>2. graphics are atrocious: I have maxed out the settings on my beefy rig and my god does it look bad...please, if you value graphical fidelity avoid this.
<br>3. It&apos;s buggy: voices playing through each other, constant patching scripts, getting stuck in geometry... all the hallmarks of a low polish title are here.
<br>
<br>disclaimer: please note that I did not play more than 2 hours of the game. I have a large library of games at my disposal and precious little play time available. I stopped playing the game because I did not feel like it was worth my time. tastes will differ and I recommend you balance my bad review with positive ones. But in my opinion it&apos;s just really bad and not worth your time. the concept behind the battle system has so much win in it though. Hence I refuse to give this title a 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4065923">Expand</a></span>

It is not a real MMO nor a true D&amp;D game.
<br>The action combat and graphics are the game&apos;s best features. Most other well known MMOs (like WoW, Tera, Rift, Aion, AoC etc) lack in either graphics or combat (or both), since most are quite older games. But graphics are very glitchy and problematic in some areas of the game (eg Malabog&apos;s Castle, Sharandar) and overall game performance is crap even on high-end rigs. The game uses the ancient graphics engine of STO (star trek online) that simply is not made for MMOs.
<br>There is no raiding (upcoming Tiamat raid is a joke), PvP is a bad joke, and the whole game is one of the most linear games I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>NW is free-to-play but more like pay-to(NOT)-win. Since day 1 of open beta there was huge exploiting, cheating, botting, hacking and all the banes of MMOs you can imagine. Exploits have been reduced over time but not in a timely manner, there are quite a lot even now after 2 years.
<br>Account security is minimal to non-existent, people are getting hacked and robbed all the time and IF they are lucky they MIGHT get a character roll-back after a couple of weeks that might also delete some legit items and further damage their character. The company makes sure to hide such issues by not allowing discussion in official forums (lock/move/delete threads when people saying they got hacked/robbed).
<br>The biggest problem of this game is its non-existent customer support and huge lack of respect for the customer (whether a paying customer buying Zen or a free player).
<br>For at least 1 year now there have been random mass bans (probably auto bans from scripts), that remove from the game bots/gold sellers and legit players alike, without notice or explanation. Even whole guilds have been banned like this, players that did nothing wrong (after all Cryptic never bans any dungeon exploiters). You cannot post or inquire about a ban only send an email to their support department that now belongs to PWE and get ignored.
<br>Neverwinter might be a cool game for casual players and the content up to max level (60) is nice, although linear (and doing any dungeons at all is a huge waste of time till lvl 60), but after that it simply lacks the content and the appropriate systems and character progression to support long-term MMO players. Apart from a ridiculous amount of dailies farming/grind there isn&apos;t much more.
<br>It was a game with huge potential that got progressively destroyed over the course of 2 years by Cryptic and their greedy bosses, PWE/PWI. I would recommend staying away from any PWE/PWI or Cryptic games in the future or at least not spend any money at all on them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793315">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really enjoyed the game at the beginning, enough to invest into a few &quot;packs&quot; (even though pricing in this MMO is much, much higher than it other F2P games; a mount - albeit account-wide - can cost 30EUR or more!).
<br>The good points include:
<br>- active, dynamic, interesting combat (console-like low active skill limit, different class mechanics etc)
<br>- attractive graphics
<br>- rich world, though mostly thanks to rich Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore
<br>- enormous potential user-created content (could) bring; the content users provide is often exceptional, but it is not utilized to it&apos;s full potential
<br>- web-based gateway to interact with game world, including crafting, guild, auction house and ENORMOUSLY FUN dice game
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, blatant money-grabbing becomes obvious really fast and the game becomes a gear grind, with content locked behind gear score (or your CC number).
<br>While you can personalise your build, any change you&apos;d make requires payment (or enormous amount of grind to exchange in-game currency to real-money currency).
<br>Bugs are rampant, but never fixed or acknowledged.
<br>Economy is in serious trouble because of rampant hackers and botters, but these issues are rarely addressed or fixed.
<br>There is almost no support to in my opinion the greatest, most unique feature the game offers, namely user-created content (Foundry).
<br>PvP is painfully unbalanced and heavily Pay to Win, modes are limited.
<br>
<br>To make matters worse, Mod 6 (April 2015) rose lvl cap to 70 but only way offered to level up are repeatable HOURLY quests, limited to 4 at a time, in re-hashed, re-used locations.
<br>
<br>I tried to like this game. I really did enjoy levelling (up to 60, in Mod 5 so before April 2015) - again, enough to invest (substantial) amounts of real cash into it.
<br>But developers seem incompetent, ignorant or too under the heel of Sales department to produce any quality content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5177476">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s simply hundreds of INDIVIDUALS online who are simply trying to go about leveling their characters as fast as possible and to collect and auction/swindle/scam epic/rare in-game items for redonkulous amounts of Astral Diamonds/In Game Currency. No one even interacts with others. You may as well be alone in your own instance - seriously - a MMO RPG - and NO ONE is interacting with others. The main chat window is constantly spammed with useless classified ads that are full of abbreviations.
<br>
<br>Some parts of the game are truly spectacular, and it does have parts that are enjoyable.

<br>The missions are tedious, and the sort of thing you&apos;ve seen a hundred thousand times before in MMO&apos;s. The main draw to this game, the Foundry, could have been excellent but was so marred by bugs that it turned the game into an exploit-a-lot for those who weren&apos;t willing to pay the extortionate microtransaction fees.

<br>Overall, my entire experience of this game felt like some cheapskate had knocked together a generic, iPad app-style game, slapped the Dungeons &amp; Dragons logo on it, and stood there refusing to let me have any kind of tolerable experience until I passed them my credit card. If you like to just give away money, send it to me.

<br>Everything costs money even for basic features like bags, don&apos;t expect one to drop from encounters. They promote lock boxes which you have to unlock with keys that you have to buy with real cash. I opened over 20 lockboxes and most were the same item (Alchemist resource kit). Looking on the auction house there are only alchemy kits, which tells you it is not a problem specific to me. When I complained to support I got a generic comment and no attempt at resolution. Looks like my account is also prevented from posting on their forums.

Neverwinter is extremely buggy with grotesque balance for the different classes. Neverwinter handlers are notorious for making a class extremely strong in comparison to other class so people spend money on making new characters and gearing them up so they can use the overpowered class. Then, they switch the overpowered train to a different class and so people will either get destroyed by one class or have to switch to the new overpowered class and spend inordinate amount of money to gear the new overpowered class up. The game is extremely pay to win and has been recently having patches that are not in the patch notes to make it harder for people to farm for anything decent.
<br>Their refinement point system is atrocious and requires at least 600dollars to refine your item to a useable point or use a third party site or just bot the game. Hardly anyone plays the game when they log on, they all just afk farm because that is the only way to compete in the game without getting bankrupt. People log on not to play the game but to afk farm in a foundry. The games pvp is dead and the classes are too unbalanced for people to enjoy the game. If you look on their forums you will see that most of the forums are complaints about our their rogues or another class is one hitting on one rotating another class with the same level and gear. The flavor of the month classes can fight 2-3 of the best players of another class and win. Flavor of the month = the class that the devs have decided to make overpowered so people can spend money.
<br>PLEASE DO NOT FALL INTO THIS FREE 2 PLAY TRAP. This game is horrible and the money who still play it do so because of their friends and the friends they made in the game. Pvp players make rules for matches so as to limit the overpowered classes so the players for the other classes can have fun.

<br>The user created dungeons don&apos;t work if you need to reload a map within a map. You can play in a map for an hour, advancing a lovingly crafted story and then it will refuse to load another area. There are complaints about this on forums all over the place and it&apos;s inconceivable it has not been fixed.
<br>
<br>Overall - Very disappointed. This game could have been amazing with unlimited scope for user created content. Instead it has a closed feeling with even the best user content not working.
<br>When I was 11 some friends of mine bought a book called basic dungeons and dragons. We paid 5c per page to photocopy it at the local library. Adventuring in dungeons and dragons with my friends was some of the best times of my life. I still remember running out of arrows while perched on a castle wall and throwing my shoe at a troll. I rolled a 20 and killed it. So much fun. I played right through my teens,  20&apos;s and into my 30&apos;s. Family and work now gets in the way, but d&amp;d still holds a VERY special place. To get my fantasy rpg fix I play wow, elder scrolls, diablo and a few other games. D&amp;D online sucked. Neverwinter held so much promise with great graphics, mmo and most of all, unlimited user created dungeons. But they stuffed it up. It&apos;s not open world which is unforgivable for d&amp;d. You can&apos;t close in a d&amp;d world with doors. Sure, put up mountains and don&apos;t have flying mounts if you can&apos;t spare the time to flesh out the whole damned globe. But don&apos;t have linear paths and small maps that aren&apos;t linked.
<br>Please try again. You got so many things right. But you ruined the spirit of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5252479">Expand</a></span>

<br>The last release was just terrible, I mean terrible and they are doing very little to win veterans back to it. All but ignored the last preview testing and Mod 6 literally broke the game.. I mean most of the power/feats were broken for the first month and they are JUST now slowly rebuilding it. In addition if you come from say middle of the mods 2-3 , there isnt much new for you at all. They did increase difficulty settings by a factor of about ten give or take though, so its much harder then it was. Up to you if you like that or not.
<br>
<br>They have adding many time/pay and grind gates and each week , seem to take another player bonus away. They have recently hired some new people, but it seems that the company that made the game and operates it (cryptic) is in direct contrast to what the money side wants (pwe) cryptic wants a game thats fun, but PWE just wants a vehicle to make money.
<br>
<br>The best games make both happen, this one ATM doesn&apos;t, I can no longer recommended this game to people, I would suggest you look elsewhere until they fix it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5264308">Expand</a></span>

The battle dynamics have potential for great complexity, and the user interface is well-designed and responsive. It&apos;s possible to create a wide variety of character builds with regards to gear and stats.
<br>
<br>Now the bad news. Even the best feature of the game is constantly breaking. Many popular abilities have been bugged for months without any apparent fix in sight. The developers have a great deal of trouble keeping the classes balanced, so that at any given time one or two classes are OP compared to the others. And as for the variety of character builds you&apos;d expect in a D&amp;D-based game, if you want to be a viable party member, do real damage, or healz, etc., you will find your options much tighter.
<br>
<br>Now the worse news. As with all &quot;free-to-play&quot; games (emphasis on the quotes), you will eventually reach a wall which requires paying to pass. What sets this game apart from other MMOs with the same philosophy is the steepness and suddenness of this wall. It takes anywhere from a day to a week for most people to reach level 60 (out of 70) at which point a month or two of rewardless repetitive grinding is needed to reach 70. At that point it will take about a year to save up enough in-game currency for your character to be ready for the end-game content. Keep in mind that during this year you will be grinding 1 dungeon (yes ONE working lvl 60+ dungeon) and 1 skirmish (mini-game). It will not be fun. Of course, you can jump right into the end-game content for the price of roughly $300-$500, gaining access to another 4 dungeons (one of which is playable, the other you will simply exploit your way through it, and the other two you will never find anyone to run it with you because it&apos;s overpowered, unless you want to spend another $300-$400 for some truly epic gear).
<br>
<br>As of this writing there is exactly one viable way of earning in-game currency at the rate required to get end-game gear in a reasonable amount of time, and unfortunately it is extremely easy for botters to exploit. All complex quest-based and enjoyable methods of earning real rewards have been removed at this point.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - If you have $500-$1000 of expendable cash to spend on a poorly-maintained MMO with a nice combat system, go for it. Otherwise STAY AWAY.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5396017">Expand</a></span>

I recommend playing the game from 1-60, but as soon as you reach 60 and try out the new content, you will realize you have been put on an endless solo content quest grind for the next 100 hours to reach level 70, and after you reach level 70, you will be so poor and unable to do anything no one will take you to any of the dungeons to make money until you either pony up and pay real $$$ or go through months of trying to scrounge up enough astral diamonds to be average-geared 2500 item level player. After you are average-geared you won&apos;t even be able to PVP anything. You will die in 5 seconds and do less than 5% damage to a top-geared 4000 item level player. You will take 5-10 times longer to complete dungeons than a top-geared team. Really, all I feel is sadness for this game. Destroyed by greed and laziness. They don&apos;t even let you bring up issues on the forum without censoring you like the communist party in old China. I bet there is more freedom of speech in modern China than on their sad slow forum now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5867384">Expand</a></span>

People still cant queue to access game content, in chat people begging for more players to so they can make an attempt at game content, actually people begging for any group so they can have a chance doing something. If this is the state of how they handle customer issues, bugs, and massive frustration than we all need to ask if you really want to invest time and money into a game like this.
<br>
<br>The only reason I gave this game a 1 is if you just want to waste hundreds of dollars on a game with very little real content, that is constantly bugged, never class balanced because its unprofitable  for the developers, very little in common with the DnD universe other than the payoffs they give Salvatore to use the name of popular characters, a tiny world to explore, constant change in game play when the developers  develop new  ways for cash grabs, a game that is really more suited to a cash grab tablet play than intense, rewarding play on PC, than this game is for you.
<br>
<br>As a 30 year veteran of MMORPGs from the release of EQ, DaOC, Star Wars online,  Eve, Rifts, WoW, LoTR, Vanguard trust me, don&apos;t invest your time.  Looking for a new game to invest in, this probably will just frustrate and annoy you. It is definitely not a gamers game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6219430">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If this game would be described in one word, it would be &quot;bugs&quot;. If you think I&apos;m overdramatising, there is actually ingame community dedicated to specifically running content without exploits. That&apos;s right, playing the way supposed to be is actually a niche pastime in this game, similar to doing classic raids in modern WoW with XP bar locked to level 60. You are expected to use every single bug and glitch during normal play, or prepare to be kicked.
<br>
<br>Action combat is ok, but forget about being competitive in pvp if you play from EU, because PWE is too cheap to maintain EU server and ping will make you a punchbag. Monetization turned to worse recently since there is no way anymore to turn ingame currency into item store one. Overall this game works for novelty but you gotta have some nerves to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4315579">Expand</a></span>

I played Neverwinter since early Beta. I enjoyed it a lot. I spent a lot of money on it too. Then, just like that, around the release of Module 5 things started going downhill. You could feel the ever increasing demand of cash payments the game laid on you without much subtlety. Slowly but surely they began taking away our means of gathering the needed ingame resources  via actual gameplay and put all of the best rewards behind heavy RNG system effectively taking out player ability and even time spent playing for favor of ZEN purchases. This &quot;Free to Play&quot; game currently offers a VIP program, basically a sub, something they said they&apos;d never do. Personally I see it as a desperate last ditch effort for money grabbing. And to further alienate its players Cryptic also did very little to deal with the massive wave of bot users and cheaters who pretty much brought the game economy to the ground which is all too bad because we had potential here, so much potential. Great combat system, great RP value, pretty visuals..
<br>
<br>Bottom line - play at your own risk. As for me, I left Neverwinter for good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=5421891">Expand</a></span>

It is a good action-RPG that allows player-based quest creation and a fast paced PVP, although it lacks in a lot of important details including community cohesion and exploration.
<br>The good includes the price, the action packed gameplay, and the graphics, but this is coupled to an endless barrage of gold-spammers, weak community interaction, and linearity mirroring a JRPG style. Without a strong community, and tactical puzzle solving challenges, the game is a ceaseless mind-deafening mouse clicking experience. Nothing really sets this game apart from other games in the same genre; it is neither progressive, nor is it a cut above the rest, yet it is still enjoyable at level 40+ where the quests and dungeons begin to acquire some challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797591">Expand</a></span>

Gaming areas are relatively small, most content is zoned or instanced, and questing is very directive, yet Cryptic manages to avoid the corridor effect of recent F2P such as Vindictus. You encounter enough players to feel you are actually playing an MMO, but the amount of backtracking and mindless grinding is satisfyingly limited. The graphic design is surprisingly sober, yet the environments are varied and eye-pleasing with a maxed-out level of detail and drawing distance. When you factor in a fun action-oriented combat system, and a low dependance on the cash store, I thought I had a winner here.
<br>
<br>Alas, the end-game is where NW fails to shine. Almost any end-game 5-man dungeon and boss fight is based on an absurd number of adds, thus putting a disproportionate emphasis on CC and kiting. As a result, the Guardian Fighter (tank), Trickster Rogue (single target DPS) and Great Weapon Fighter (melee aoe DPS) appear superfluous, while the Control Wizard (CC  dps) is absolutely mandatory  as is the Devoted Cleric (Healer), the latter being more understandable. This fundamental unbalance in design pidgeon-holes most classes into specific builds, which is quite unnerving as respecs are  of course, this is a F2P  costly, be it in time or real money. There is absolutely nothing rewarding to do on your own once you hit max level. The foundry (user-generated quest campaigns) are a great addition during levelling as they grant a very decent amount of xp, but they&apos;re limited to very basic loot tables which become worthless in regard to other activities. As in most MMOs, PvP and it&apos;s classic battleground sysem is a CC mess, only bearable during the (short) time required to get the full PvP set. Which could be at least somewhat useful except that due to very poor loot distribution mechanisms, the in-game auction house is flooded with cheap epic gear. From there, the time required to get the marginally better BoS items increases exponentially and hardly feels worth the effort (especially if you do not benefit from a stable guild). Finally, the EVE-inspired time-based crafting system is efficient and even fun, until you realise the absurd amount of time required to max a profession out, especially as the intermediate rewards are close to totally worthless. However, these flaws are relatively superficial and could easily be adressed by moderate tweaking  thus my opinion on NW remains positive. The game has a solid foundation, a fun combat system and a casual-friendly approach. In its current state, and while it failed to suck me in on a long term basis, it was and remains very worth a shot</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3231559">Expand</a></span>

If you prefer to explore and free roam, this is not a game for you.  You follow the quests, and there is no way to get lost, since the environments are highly constrictive.  In the same vein, the classes are also highly restricted, no deviation at all in classes.  Your class are strictly confounded to a certain set of armor and weapons.  Also, you are constantly being reminded that you need to spend money if you want to really advance, the micro-transaction aspect of the game is always in your face.
<br>
<br>On a good note, the game gives you the feeling of being uber terrific tough by letting you kill hordes of enemies.  The real time targeting system is also enjoyable because it makes the game feel more than a running spreadsheet.  The Internet features, the mini game, and crafting aspects are also a nice addition to the game.
<br>
<br>Overall, though the strengths of the game cannot overcome the very restrictive environments and classes.  You really feel you are playing an arcade game, long live Golden Ax.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4193859">Expand</a></span>

My main concern is the fact all the bosses feel the same. Avoid the red circle stand in the blue circle and deal with way too many ads (adds don&apos;t despawn after the boss dies many strategies involve purposely dying after the boss to generate a despawn). Bosses are reduced to finding exploits to avoid massive add spam such as luring the boss away or finding methods to prevent add aggression. The other major concern if the fact each hour has an event attached to it, some of these events are rather pointless pre 60 and others are useless once you hit level cap of 60. Basically it felt like the only time worth playing is before and during a specific event pops which is the dungeon delve. Certain classes are required in a dungeon most noteably is the control wizard to punt things into lava etc and the healer. I played mostly as a healer and the mechanics are counter intuitive with tanks. If you had someone who tanks well and takes all aggression that is actually a bad thing. The only reliable heals are area of effect so damage needs to be spread out over several party members as your heals will be the same on a tank as it would for another dps and you do not have reliable single target heals. This renders the tank class virtually useless (in comparison to taking another control wizard or Rouge) for all but one dungeon where they can bug the final boss with their taunts. Poorly designed and rapidly feels repetitive, with a limited window of gametime that is randomly generated where your guaranteed a reward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290847">Expand</a></span>

<br>Bugs that are well documented but never get fixed for months. Broken and not working character abilities. AH dupe that destroyed the economy.  Goldsellers spam in chat like its Diablo 2. Terrible community, players that never say hi and leave without a word. Lockboxes gambling. P2W PVP with 2 maps ruined by the absence of matchmaking, constant leavers and players who have few thousand dollars worth of  enchants thanks to aforementioned AH dupe. Itemshop prices that begin from 30$.  Centered around whales: &quot;You pay me 5$? Sorry but I don&apos;t think I want your money&quot;. Incredibly dull completely instanced PVE with all zones having absolutely the same structure and progression without any chance for exploration.

I played about 900 hours of this &quot;thing&quot; from the open beta(soft launch in March 2013) to the release of Module 2.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the clowns in Cryptic and Perfect World are turning the game even more P2W with every patch. New reskinned mounts became companions and reskinned companions became mounts that cost outrageous amounts of Zen. PVP is dominated by bots, 110% mounts and players that have bought his gear with money, like the Tenebrous enchantments. Bots are dominating the market and the developers do nothing to punish this behavior. Every new patch introduce new bugs and exploits and old bugs and exploits still haunt the player community from the soft-launch in March 2013.
<br>
<br>The game has 6 classes now but you need only 3 to do the end-game content, a Divine Cleric, a Trickster Rogue and 3 Control Wizards, oh wait, the game has no end-game content too! Boring and repetitive dailies and &quot;epic&quot; dungeons full of glitches and exploits are the only thing to do after max level. And before I forget, the community are one of the worst that I have ever seen, fanboys and dumb kidos everywhere, defending the need of profit for the company that are milking them.
<br>
<br>Stay away from this thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4242939">Expand</a></span>

<br>2.)  It features a great range of items, and weapons that you can use in combat to help aid you through the game.
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s:
<br>
<br>1.) Dungeon monsters are extremely repetitive. You run into the same monster 10+ times while in the dungeon. Making only about 5 monsters altogether in a 1 hour dungeon.
<br>2.) Quests are just plain out awful. Let&apos;s be honest. The way they are set up, the way the completely hold your hand, and provide an awful story; is beyond an embarrassment to MMO&apos;s
<br>3.) Class &amp; Races. They are sort of thrown at you, they really make no sense. They don&apos;t explain what each class or what each &quot;special&quot; ability does.
<br>4.) The amount of EXP you get from a monster is RIDICULOUSLY LOW!!! I went through a level 20 dungeon at level 5, and when I came out. I only went up about 1 exp bar. THE DUNGEON LASTED AN HOUR! Maybe the reason for the low EXP was because I was such a low level. But if you get a low amount of XP for killing a monster way out of your level range. Then that&apos;s a done deal for me. I&apos;ll quit that game in a split second. It&apos;s an awful game overall.

<br>The combat is the only thing that is pretty nifty in the game. Other than that it&apos;s a grind and how you have to pay real life money to get a random bag to not even get what you want is a joke. Want that cool companion that isn&apos;t garbage that you initially get? Well for $30.00 you can get a pretty decent companion.. well what if you want to raid and only have the crappy companion that the game gives you.. good luck. I&apos;ve seen people get booted for not having the epic character companions.
<br>
<br>Want to craft things, well after waiting over 8 hours or more for your hirelings to finish (unless you pay to speed it up) it takes forever. Most crafting items later on will require items that you can only get from the AH which will be super expensive or you can pay $16.00 for random loot bags that might contain the hammer or pick or sheer tool.. all depends but I&apos;ve spent over $50.00 to get a hammer so I can progress and zero luck.
<br>
<br>Just a huge money sink to progress and I&apos;m ashamed of myself for falling into this trap of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3908761">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Actually 350-480ms is not awful at all if the game engine was designed and polished properly. 350ms in NWO feels like 550ms in DDO and 900ms in GuildWars2. That is how bad the game engine is. Due to the semi-action combat system and poor latency compensation algorithm and game design, you will most likely get a very frustrating experience if you do not have a good connection. Still playable but you will not enjoy it as much.
<br>
<br>Latency apart, this game does not feel like a D&amp;D game. It offers nearly no character customization. So if you are expecting a D&amp;D experience, this is probably not the game for you. I recommend DDO if D&amp;D experience is what you are looking for.
<br>
<br>Besides the &quot;Foundry&quot;, this is just another MMO; a visually dated MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3301516">Expand</a></span>

That is, you wan walk around, see the content, but to actually play you&apos;ll have to pay.
<br>It&apos;s not apparent during the levelling phase. In one week you&apos;ll enjoy many different realms with many different quests and stories. After one week you&apos;re lvl 60 (cap level). This is where the best thing to do is to leave. If you choose to stay, you&apos;ll face the ugly choice of paying for gear or keep your money but lose any hope of ever be on par with the environment. You&apos;re given basically free gear, but very very weak. To make it usable you&apos;ll have to farm 170 hours. Not a way of speaking, 170 actual hours. Foor one item. And you have ten items (not counting your pants and shirt), plus the items of your pet. Same goes for anything. Mounts, char stats. For this too you&apos;ll have to farm for thousands of hours, or to pay..
<br>Now for the game itself: it&apos;s terrible. It failed to avoid all the well-known issues that may exist in any MMORPG. Lag? Yes, tons of. Class balance? Nope.  ChineseFarmerDotcom spammers? Flooding any chat. Raids? There is ONE. PvP maps? There are TWO. Unfixed bugs? The number of tickets by the players is approaching 3 millions. Following DnD? Not really. In this game the Cleric is a DPS, the Warlock is a healer, the Ranger is Melee. Go figure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4856421">Expand</a></span>

This gear upgrading requires certain wards which are only available to purchase for Zen, which is available for...you guessed it...real cash. Personally, I like games that really get rolling once you hit max level. That is absolutely not the case here. Once you reach max level, there are only 7 or 8 encounters that are in any way challenging, and even those are dumbed down to the point that they are just button mashing with an occasional dodge. Also, unlike most mmorpgs I&apos;ve played, there is not much in the way of character customization. By the time you hit 70, you have most of the gear you&apos;ll use till you get bored and quit. I&apos;ll personally never play another game by this company, they make lots of promises they don&apos;t deliver on and the staff seems to be trying to run it into the ground.

Unfortunately, they decided to pretend it was in beta, well after the public release, cash shop and all.  That&apos;s a bit sleazy.  Heck, I think &quot;Neverwinter: A Bit Sleazy&quot; is a fitting name.  It&apos;s a fun game for a while, but far too repetitive, with same-looking characters running same-looking zones to kill same-looking monsters, all the while offering you the chance to ride faster, craft faster, kill faster, if you would only spend some real money.  &quot;You don&apos;t have to spend money!&quot;  I head fanbois cry, and that is true.  You don&apos;t.  But I can tell you this.  When you play for free, everything you do will be slightly slower, slightly more monotonous, or slightly more annoying, because you can&apos;t even respec your character without an item that has to be brought into the game with real money.  So play the game, by all means, but as soon as you get tempted to buy yourself a thirty dollar horse, or pay real money for a respec, consider how free the game really is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3234693">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the first day of its long waited module 1, Cryptics&apos; Neverwinter Online witnessed a huge wave of exploit which allows a precious epic item to be obtained at 1/20 of its original market cost, a bug that has been reported on its own test server 6 days prior to the launch, but received no attention from the devs. After the incident, Cryptics did not perform any rollbacks and expressed no intention of taking any sort of measures against the exploiters, neither are they willing to track down the exploited epic items.
<br>
<br>This has led many players like myself who have supported the devs/game to feel totally frustrated, furious in some cases.
<br>Months of grinding and were just told that cheating is fine:/
<br>Well save your money and your time folks as its clear that as long as PWE/Cryptic are making a  then they don&apos;t care what the players do...

<br>Game graphics are nowhere near the trailer.  They have premade heads for customization but all options are blocky and just not pretty at all. You can try to tweak it yourself but nothing helps.  I&apos;ve spent over an hour creating a character and it was just terrible.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is interesting... IF you can actually play! The game lags so much you&apos;ll find your character doing the Cha Cha (it&apos;s a dance) half the time and the other half he&apos;s just crazy jumping all over the place. I keep getting Server is not Responding at the top and no amount of complaining in their forum will get you help. Zero Customer Service. I&apos;m not even surprised to see the other guy&apos;s review saying customer service told him they can&apos;t reimburse him for his missing in game items.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3904549">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s no real narrative story, and no real sense of fun. Max Level end game is even worse, the PvE monsters just have a ridiculous amount of health and the minions just keep respawning. It&apos;s a cheap way to make it seem difficult when it&apos;s not, and it&apos;s not fun. You&apos;re literally just hitting the boss monster for 15-30 minutes waiting for it to die while trying to stay alive, seriously. There&apos;s also not much to do at end game, and what&apos;s worse is everything is geared toward trying to get you to spend money on the game at ridiculous cost vs the value you get. They also nerf the classes for stupid reasons which may break your character build, and they have traps where if you choose wrong during leveling, you have to pay money to fix it later. The whole game is designed around getting you to invest time in the game, and then trying to get you to give them money. If you are a fan of D&amp;D or the previous Neverwinter Night PC games, this Neverwinter MMO is nothing like either of those. You&apos;re better off not even trying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3305769">Expand</a></span>

<br>My advice is STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME, looks nice but is not fun and is gonna try to milk you, FTP is a lie, like the cake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3847958">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game will keep you entertained for awhile, but after you hit level 60, it goes downhill from there and quality noticeable drops.
<br>
<br>The Good
<br>
<br>Neverwinter has excellent combat and physics as well as good tactical elements that make the game fun.  The graphics are above average for an MMO and the sound effects in combat are excellent and immersive.  Controls feel solid and everything is very responsive from target specific enemies in a crowd or dodging attacks.  Players who invest in mechanical keyboard and precision mice will make good use of it in here.  Combat is fun and for those with good sound systems, this only makes it more enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The Bad.
<br>
<br>The game is very simplistic for a D&amp;D game.  One of the questionable aspects if the decision of Cryptic you make use of only 3 slots for powers, 2 slots for dailies, and 2 slots for passive skills, which in this day and age for very limiting.  You do not have multiple hot bars and in order to swap powers, you must navigate clumsily through the menu to do this. After you swap powers, dailies, or passive skills, there is a fairly long duration before you can start using them.
<br>
<br>There is also a large lack of class variations and customizations.  You have six classes when approaching level 30, can choose a paragon path which is a sort of subclass for that class.  Cryptic had a very good chance here to make things interesting but decided not two.  The are very slight differences between either affect gameplay very little and most players will see no differences at all.  In the end, everyone in the game pretty much uses the same cookie cutter template for their class.
<br>
<br>There seems to be balance issues concerning classes.  Fighters aren&apos;t generally welcomed in any group, and the game is comprised mostly of rogues, wizards, and rangers.  The reasons are fairly obvious when you play game and I won&apos;t go into details because the list of issues are large and can be found at the official forums.
<br>
<br>Other concerns
<br>The community is very elitist are very unfriendly to feedback in the forums and are just as rude in game.  Developers seem to be more concerned with bringing updates for cash items than making meaningful changes to the game and the new content dubbed Module 1 and 2 both use the same cookie cutter layout but with different map layouts and graphics.  Most quests are pretty much fetch quests or killing stuff in a general area.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>Good combat, responsive control, but poor decisions make the game unenjoyable in the long run.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866396">Expand</a></span>

<br>It looks a lovely game but beware the firm&apos;s tech support. I&apos;ve just tried to play a new character, but their server failed mid-game. I&apos;m told to report the error, but their website actively stops you from doing so due to abysmally poor design (demanding I select catergory, yet I had already done so). Going to contact them directly about this additional error, I&apos;m told &apos;Your question hasn&apos;t been submitted&apos;.
<br>
<br>So far I&apos;ve played 15 minutes, but spent 30 trying to report a server failure to them, and having to navigate their pathetic website. Sadly, as this game is online, server stability, website function, and helpful support are aspects of the gaming experience. I could log into the game, but my character couldn&apos;t be retrieved, nor could I make another one to just get playing again, and best of all, I couldn&apos;t even access their shop. So the login worked, but nothing else did!
<br>
<br>In summation: Enjoy the free game and the beautiful cinematics of Neverwinter, but be extremely cautious about giving this firm any money. I doubt you&apos;ll be able to contact them if something inevitably goes wrong. I just hope that my experience was a one off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3855210">Expand</a></span>

The amount of exploits that made it to Live even though they were reported in beta (which really wouldn&apos;t have been that big of a deal were it not for the fact that everything revolves around Astral Diamond currency, thus lacing the entire aspect of the game with a heavy dose of greed; especially in PUGS where people would roll Need on a stale cracker if they could), shady business practices including offering &quot;exclusive&quot; pre-order packs during beta and then just selling the same packs under a different name when the game goes live, high Zen store pricing compared to other real-money currency MMO&apos;s, and the shadiest forum moderation team I&apos;ve seen since when The Matrix Online first went live...all this combines to take away from the positive aspects of the game like it&apos;s combat system.
<br>
<br>Like Cryptic&apos;s other games, Star Trek Online and Champions Online, I have a feeling it&apos;ll take a year or several before the negatives of the game get addressed and/or whittled down enough to let the positives truly shine. Which is a shame because the actual game is a fun ride to the level cap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3671046">Expand</a></span>

But something holds me back from giving it a higher score.
<br>
<br>Let me elaborate. I&apos;ve been a huge fan of the Neverwinter series from the start, and when I heard it was going to be an MMO, I got excited.  Then I heard it was free.  I was ecstatic.  Then I played it.  Now it feels like something&apos;s missing on a very basic level, and I can&apos;t help but be a little disappointed.
<br>
<br>1) For starters, the controls are tight and very fluid for an MMO.  The fact that the screen moves with the mouse without holding a mouse button down is revolutionary and Cryptic did a great job getting that part right. All default mappings are close to movement keys and everything just works.  The game plays almost like a third person shooter would, complete with a reticule and everything.  The bad thing is that it&apos;s TOO simple.  There are a limited number of attacks you can employ because of the setup and the complexity of your average MMO&apos;s combat exceeds NW&apos;s because of this.
<br>
<br>2) NW remains somewhat true to the D&amp;D spirit of character creation and play.  There are a wide variety of races to choose from (although most of those you can find in a Tolkien book and I would love to see more exotic races like the Catfolk).  In fact, the choices for playable races far exceeds that of games like The Old Republic MMO and all are available for free, which is very nice.  Also, you can create a unique bio and back story for your character  which, sadly, means absolutely nothing as every character starts out in the exact same area and you are just left with your imagination as to how you got there in the first place.  Overall it&apos;s on its way to becoming truly great in terms of customization, but just misses the mark as most build options are eerily similar and your choices seem to have little  if any- weight on the story.
<br>
<br>3) Perhaps the worst pitfall is that Neverwinter follows Cryptic&apos;s predecessors, in that there is a lack of content for higher level players compared to games like WoW. Even when you aren&apos;t at a high level, each portion of the game feels sectioned off from most other players, or &quot;instanced&quot;, and the concept of a &quot;massively-multiplayer-online game&quot; becomes pretty ironic.  Other than leveling, there really isn&apos;t anything else you can do and it can be quite lonely at the top.  Now they did introduce a level creation system that is pretty neat but don&apos;t expect it to hold your interest for long as it&apos;s quite limited.  Even a neat sandbox system isn&apos;t enough to keep me playing this game.
<br>
<br>4) This game is free. That is a good thing and a bad thing.  It&apos;s bad because you know that somewhere down the line, the developers are going to need to find a way to monetize. They do this through the a shop where you pay real money to do things like respec your character, get higher level gear  you know, things you already expect of MMO&apos;s for free.  The good thing is you can play almost everything the game has to offer without any real money, but you will always feel disadvantaged compared to those that do spend   Take it for what you will.  IMHO I would rather drop $60 for a game than have to piecemeal my way through these gimmicks.  In fact, I think that overall quality suffers from a F2P model more often than not as people who have to pay expect more of the game going into it.
<br>
<br>Is Neverwinter the greatest MMO since WoW? Meh... Probably not.  Certainly not by the standards I hold the Neverwinter series up to.  Is it worth a play?  Definitely.  It has a lot going for it all things considered and with some improvement (especially regarding exploration instead of on-the-rails action) it could really be a contender against some paid MMOs.  If Cryptic/Perfect World can push out some radical updates that addresses some of these issues, then you&apos;re looking at a worthwhile experience.  Until then, it&apos;s nothing compared to other standby MMOs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3883036">Expand</a></span>

But note that every single thing in the game has a charge, and not a small one either.  For example to respec costs real money, to get anything more than a standard bag to hold items is also paid with real money. Any more than two characters, faster mounts, everything.  A bag to hold items worked out to be about 7 or 8 euros. For 1 bag.
<br>The lag spikes and rubber banding were awful in pvp and cities, and the fact they kept saying &apos;its in beta&apos;  yet happily took your money for items was a bit of a joke.
<br>Also (and this was the worst for me)   if you are grouped with a friend waiting to do pvp or an instance, you cannot quest any further than the immediate vicinity you are in. Most of the areas to quest are instanced and so if you are in a party it simply tells you that you cannot leave as you are in a party.   so you have to make a choice, sit on your ass and wait for the instance call (which can be a while 25mins at times) or leave the group with your friend and queue alone.
<br>Great design there guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247676">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I do NOT recommend this game for anybody from central and eastern Europe.</span>

4. The existance Of Zax</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Pros:

<br>3. This game is Pay For Convenience so basically pay for mount and save a month of saving which is great for real money payers
<br>4. The existance Of Zax where you can trade ingame currency farmed by F2P players for exchange of Zen (real game currency) so Zen Sellers get access to ingame currency and F2P get access to Real Money Store
<br>5. Multi Language Client
<br>Cons:
<br>1. This is MMO so grind your way out to be something in it
<br>2. Support from Devs are minimal unless a crisis happens considering cryptic got tons of projects to administrate and other game it is understandable
<br>3. Fast Content Release without further revision on test servers before the release on live servers because they are pressed by release date to wizards of the coast.
<br>4. Zen Store Items are High, so be ready to spend like $1,000 to get your characters best gear and enchants.
<br>5. BOA and BOE killed the game free economy and dungeon runs, so dungeon runs are just for the sake of fun and not profiting
<br>6. Game Consume lots of Memory and FPS get high so much in many  occasions
<br>7. Characters Cinematic portray are not like WOW and in comparison fails to give us franchise appealing characters which is major disappointment since this is a D&amp;D the mother of RPG and Lore story telling
<br>
<br>but considering it .. it is one of the very best F2P MMO games with cool graphics but minimal support</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4428258">Expand</a></span>

Without doubt Neverwinter&apos;s selling point is its combat system which is the slickest available in the current lineup of MMOs. While you&apos;re still sculling potions and awaiting cooldowns, the combat feels engaging and dynamic. The many instances are inspired and fun although boss mechanics don&apos;t vary much  they become very challenging and team-oriented around level 30. It&apos;s possible to get many hours of enjoyment out of this game without paying a single dime, though Cryptic have sneakily monetised vital aspects of the game. The first and only money I have put down after around 60 hours of play was on extra bag space, which is cripplingly tight. The world isn&apos;t massive though Foundry content greatly expands its overall size. With fresh content released almost weekly and a large player-base, give this game a shot  you&apos;re bound to like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3232694">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m happy to report thet Cryptic Studios has fulfilled my desires and then some.  By far, the strongest inclusion is the Foundry- Cryptic&apos;s tool that allows for player genertated content to manifest in the game world.  It is a truly rewarding incentive to log in each day knowing new content is waiting!  Another high point is the combat, which is action-based and restricted to a relatively small number of abilities the player chooses from a much larger pool.  I have spent considerable time joyfully agonizing over which of my many abilities to have active.  Main characters and plot lines are voiced, something I now consider an essential inclusion for storytelling in the genre.  In-game activities are always only a click away, with current events listed conveniently near the mini-map on the UI.  Crafting and the auction house can be accessed from outside of the game through the Neverwinter Gateway making it possible to stay active when away from your home PC.
<br>
<br>I would be remiss if I did not mention that although no content is locked behind a pay wall in Neverwinter, convenience and cosmetic items available in the cash shop are steeply priced- making me long for the days when you simply paid your $12-15 dollars a month and that was that (I may be in the minority on this one).
<br>
<br>While I think Neverwinter appeals to a specific audience, I believe the members of that audience will be using Cryptic&apos;s portal to the Forgotten Realms for many years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3246774">Expand</a></span>

<br>Best gear ought to make your time in the mmo easier (not saying it should be easy)- but not here and if you go back to lower lvl to help someone it actually seems harder than your first time around,
<br>money grubbing... at these prices, I should have gone to Disneyland.

<br>
<br>I enjoyed the dungeons and raids until level 30 and they became impossible to survive. So without them you are left with the player created missions which were &apos;meh&apos;
<br>
<br>Gathering resources is awful, you have to buy kits, they are horribly expensive in the beginning and add to the stress-fest.
<br>
<br>The companions is the best part of the game imo but as they all look identical, the shine wears off them too.
<br>If you are wealthy and love to splash the cash you might be able to spend your way into a better experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3261592">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game looked really promising in the tutorial, the combat was smooth, there was a very small learning curve and it built itself up to make you think it was going somewhere.
<br>After the tutorial, however, it shot itself in the foot. The world makes you feel claustrophobic, it&apos;s just a series of instances not dissimilar to the WoW dungeons, with no open world elements. The level scaling is poor, I spend the late 20s grinding off mobs to level up and unlock new quests, disrupting flow and reminding me how small the game is. There is a reason WoW has more players than most other MMORPGs despite costing money: it&apos;s open world. In WoW you could roam the fields of Durotar as a majestic man-cow. If you want a good story driven adventure to do with friends that involves levelling up and acquiring kit, buy Diablo. If you want a good MMO RPG, play WoW. This is a bad mash up of the two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=4092552">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t five real money, you&apos;ll stay with two chars, boring companions, items, etc while all around you other players get the good stuff. I really prefer &quot;pay per month&quot; MMOs, cause at least they&apos;re sincere and everyone starts on a level basis.</span>

Horribly imbalanced T2 dungeons are made even more ridiculous by how incredibly poorly this game is supported. If the game wasn&apos;t buggy, had stable servers and balanced content I would put the rating back to an 8. But there seems to be little to no chance that will happen. I recommend you avoid this game and try out some of the other wonderful MMOs in &quot;beta&quot; right now. I&apos;m still giving it a 5 because it has the possibility of not sucking at some point. But I worry I&apos;ll be long gone by then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3243734">Expand</a></span>

The PvP was fun until the 1000th time, and now I can&apos;t even continue because I&apos;m tired of that PvP map. The best part of this mmo is probably the foundry where players can make their own quests which gives the player an infinite amount of quests to do.</span>

<br>The zones are small and don&apos;t feel like a world. They are small and force you to travel along a path and due to quests being the only practical source of Xp theres no point in exploring. The novelty of mini dungeons wears off fast when it becomes so standard and predicable. Do a bread crumb quest kill dude in cave repeat 30 times till max lvl.
<br>Dont get me started on pvp, its not even really there its a poorly balanced arena forcing you to run in circles to hold points to win.
<br>I only continue to play this game due to my friends who have dumped money into and refuse to leave the sinking ship that is this game.
<br>you are better off avoiding this MMO and is not worth the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverwinter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3232012">Expand</a></span>

The biggest flaw with this game is the fact that is f2p, and carries the pay to win element to the extreme. This game would definitely be better off as a subscription based game.</span>
