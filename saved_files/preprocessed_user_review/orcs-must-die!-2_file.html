However, there are some features that leave much desired.
<br>
<br>What OMD2 does right is that its *generally* fun to play. Then again, most TD&apos;s are. The idea that both the war mage and the traps share in the killing is a great mechanic. The idea that you can customize your traps is another great mechanic. And the idea of providing a variety of different floor traps, wall traps, and ceiling traps, each with their own strategical options is fantastic.
<br>
<br>But  as you play the game, you will see that this game not only caters to Co-op, but is made for it. Forced co-op ruins games, and OMD2 is no exception. The most enjoyable levels are where you only have to defend from 1-2 points; but unfortunately these levels are few and far between. Instead, you have many, many maps where you have to defend 3-4 openings, and with 2-3 defense points. This makes single player mode extremely frustrating at times, and it just becomes too much. Is it really necessary to have 4 openings? Well, yes  if you want 2 players playing together.
<br>
<br>And the sad thing is, you dont really have any options to customize your maps. I cant disable the other openings when playing single player. The game is basically telling you, &quot;you BETTER DEFEND FOUR openings, damn you, or play multiplayer. That&apos;s it. End of story!&quot;
<br>
<br>Why cant I customize my levels? How about just do pure troll waves? Or how about a pure flyer level?
<br>
<br>The other major problem is that traps are not powerful enough. Even when fully upgraded, they only serve to slow down or cripple the approaching hordes of orcs. TD is named &quot;Tower Defense&quot; for a reason! There is something very satisfying seeing your concoction of traps slice, dice, crush, fling, burn, freeze, and zap orcs to oblivion; but their power output just isnt enough. Its up to the player to thin the hordes. Unfortunately, this just is not as fun as the strategy of your traps. TD is primarily a strategy game  after all, it spawned from Warcraft 3. Blowing up orcs with my shotgun sort of gets old. Combine this with the fact that you have multiple openings, and if you&apos;re playing single player, you will be running around like a chicken without a head!
<br>
<br>These points have been discussed not only in this review, but many OMD discussion boards.
<br>
<br>These are the sort of things that prevent a &quot;good&quot; game from becoming a &quot;great&quot; game. I&apos;m surprised, since this game is sort of considered to be an indie game, there is no toolset. There is no modding support. The modding community would jump on a game like this. New sets of both single player and multiplayer maps would be introduced in no time. This is a huge disappointment. I know there are probably some mods out there for this game, but its few and far between.
<br>
<br>Overall, OMD2 is a good game. It has the basics right. It&apos;s generally fun and polished. But there are several mechanics of the game that prevent it from becoming great. OMD2 is a great example of a game with missed opportunities.
<br>
<br>Hopefully OMD3 will support a modding toolset and more customized features. If they do  and stick to the formula  then OMD3 will become a classic.

The story mode was half the length of the original and felt rushed. This game is worth buying just for the multiplayer endless mode.</span>

It is buggy, laggy, and just feels rushed. Singleplayer is insanely boring and uninteresting this time around. Sure, it&apos;s possible to finish the game in SP, but you won&apos;t enjoy it. Each map is designed with 2 players in mind, and it ruins any flow to the game. Not a single one of the maps is memorable and makes me want to go back and try a new strategy. In fact, i found myself playing the classic levels more than the standard ones. Also, 80% of the traps and weapons in this game are reused from OMD1. Yawn. There is also the crossbow which is almost completely useless because of the totally broken headshot hitbox. On top of it all, OMD2 is poorly optimized. You will get massive framerate lag on most machines when you get near particle effects, and it&apos;s pathetic. There is no evidence of care or passion in this game at all. It&apos;s simply a cash grab. OMD1 was a great game, OMD2 is not. Multiplayer fanboys, please stay away from our singleplayer games. You&apos;ve ruined another promising franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3250455">Expand</a></span>

The game only falls short in the sense it really needs to be experienced co&#xF6;peratively; and as this functionality is limited to online only (*no split-screen or LAN), the game suffers for it.  The traps in OMD!2 serve only to &apos;soften up&apos; the hordes and the bulk of the killing needs to accomplished by the player; something that grows more and more apparent as you progress through the game.  As such, limited 2-player options do significantly hurt this game in the medium to long term.  Summation: The best TD game mechanically, but the lack of co&#xF6;p options adversely affects the game&apos;s longevity.  For SP play only, it&apos;s hard to recommend unequivocally.  For multiplayer, a must-buy for TD fans. 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2658339">Expand</a></span>

Instead of using a talent tree that costs gold per map to upgrade, there is a persistent upgrade system. You are rewarded skulls for finishing a level that you use to upgrade your traps, weapons and accessories. Being able to respec for free between maps adds a great deal of flexibility and promotes teamwork in the new co-op modes. All 3 game modes can be played co-op and the monster spawns are adjusted accordingly, leading to different strategies for SP &amp; co-op. Both this and the original are cheap and worth picking up.

I am very pleased with my purchase. This game is a tower defense combined with third person elements. You are also able to take direct effect in combat with either the sorceress or the warmage. The warmage is a tanky melee fighter who can take more hits than the sorceress. the sorceress is ranged dps  who can take less hits but has more damage. These different play styles are also reflective in the traps you can place. Some of the traps are specific to the character in the end game and the early game. Like the sorceress has the acid sprayer and the warmage has the black oil. The traps can be upgraded by the form of in game currency skulls and you can upgrade each trap 3 times, and then give them a unique passive of one of 2 abilities that trap gets. This can also be done with the weapons and their are in game skins you can buy with the in game currency. The few things that hold the game back are its relatively short story mode. how exploitative you can be in co op. That for me just holds it back more then it should but I completed the campaign in about 6-8 on normal mode. The draw to these kind of games is trying to perfect your strategy for that one room you couldn&apos;t do just right and going back and trying to get it just right. There is always endless mode and the weekly challenge if you wanna keep playing and if you wanna find that new challenge. The longevity of this game is gonna be dependent on how much wanna perfect these strategies and finding new ways to combine traps. This game was above average but not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3090733">Expand</a></span>

Being only able to coop with players on your Steam Friends list is pretty dumb, they need a coop lobby ASAP.  I cannot see it keeping longevity without that.

<br>All in all a good fun experience, that could be easily complimented by better online integration.</span>

<br>Played for days and it&apos;s a challenging and fun game. A nice combination between FPS and Tower Defense with a very good re-play value. Different mechanics from the original game and co-op mode are still unbalanced and sometimes you run desperately around the maps to hold the hordes. Also head-shots are more like criticals than kill-shots what makes it lame. They are charging the DLC&apos;s so i won&apos;t buy none, nothing special to be added to this game so far, so why bother?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2634642">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s why I pre-ordered the second one. And there starts my disappointments one after another. First of all, the game is almost the same as the first one, yes there is a new character but her weapon choices are almost identical with the original character. The new weapons in the game are very very limited, I almost feel like I&apos;m playing the old game only with multiplayer capabilities. Then there is the DLC problem. First of all I think the people who trust the developers and pre-order the game should at least get one of the DLC&apos;s as free. I hate the fact that I have to pay 10 bucks to play this game with it&apos;s new weapons and monsters, which I strongly believe is the way it should have launched in the first place. I hate the fact that Robot Entertainment came up with the DLC only 3-4 weeks after the launch, which means the DLC was already on the works or it was even ready to launch, they just want to milk the customers. No way in hell I&apos;m buying those DLC&apos;s for 10 bucks, waiting for the Steam sales....
<br>
<br>This game is still fun since you can play with your friends, and I have almost 30 hours under my belt with the second game as well, but this doesn&apos;t change the fact that Robot Entertainment lost my respect and I won&apos;t be pre-ordering or paying full price for their next game. They just lost a customer because they are trying to milk us...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2692472">Expand</a></span>

The only thing bringing this game back a little tiny bit is the lack of classes and that there are few maps. But this game is still a brilliant game, and very much worth the money.</span>

I am pleased to say, for the most part, this game does not disappoint. It streamlines the experiencing by getting rid of the &quot;Weavers&quot; (For which most people only used the same one) from the original title, and expanding the trap and weapon selection. You get Story Mode, Endless Mode, and for good measure they even toss in 10 Classic maps from the first game. For added value, Robot entertainment gives you a weekly challenge, which forces you to check out new strategies and traps, which I love. I have officially logged over 150 hours of this game, solo and co-op, and I feel I have a pretty good feel of it. I have 5 skulled (Best possible result) everything on Nightmare difficulty, and have played a good amount of Co-Op. I&apos;ve also purchased and enjoy both DLC packs which each introduced 3 new maps and new monsters. So why only an 8? I do have a few gripes, though mostly they aren&apos;t about the gameplay itself. In no particular order:
<br>
<br>1. Character Balance.   Orcs Must Die 2 allows you to play as the hero from the first game, as well as the sorceress, the villain from the first game. This is all well and good, but certain traps are only available to each character, and the Tar Trap, which is basically the best trap in the game, is not available to the Sorceress. I like having individuality, but this balance is frustrating for Sorceress players. Which leads me to #2...
<br>
<br>2. Leaderboards   I know they are meaningless, but I like Leaderboards in a game like this to gauge how well I am doing and my strategies. There are a few flaws here. Leaderboards should have been separated by what char you are using (Apprentice or Sorceress), as well as by other criteria. For example, Endless mode only sorts by score - Sorting by Wave would be good here too. This leads me to...
<br>
<br>3. Endless Mode   The &quot;Horde Mode&quot; Of Orcs Must Die 2 is a fun inclusion, however it needs some tweaking. To get 5 skulls, you need to get to Wave 40. The monsters get tougher every 10 levels. This leads to a lot of monotony. They could have increased cash per monster, and cut the wave totals in half, making 20 waves what you need. Some Endless waves take 1-2 hours (or more) to complete. This is too long. Also, because the longer you go, damage dealing objects becomes useless which means that basically you HAVE to use the non damage items (Springs, Void Walls, etc) - Which reduces variety and therefore fun. 4. DLC   While I am glad Robot put out 2 DLC packs shortly after the games launch, as other people have mentioned - The DLC packs feel a little light. $6 each for 3 maps and a new monster and weapon or two seems weak, compared to the content you get with the title itself. Also, I couldn&apos;t help notice that the 2nd DLC didn&apos;t include any of the creatures from the first DLC (Not even in the Endless Waves) - Which makes them feel disconnected as opposed to building on eachother. 5. Banter/Story - For whatever reason, the dialogue just isn&apos;t as entertaining and funny as it was in the first game, and there doesn&apos;t seem to be quite as much of it. 6. Co-Op is OK, but not as much fun as I had hoped. Limited each person to a small amount of traps can be awkward, and having to rely on eachother to play traps in certain places is weird. Similarly, Coin Drops in Co-Op mode should be split by both players.
<br>
<br>So, I&apos;ve listed several gripes here, but don&apos;t let this fool you. This are critical ideas on how to improve a game I love. I&apos;ve logged 150+ hours, and enjoy the franchise, I still think there are ways to improve.
<br>
<br>Enjoy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2706221">Expand</a></span>

Some people may complaint, that Robot Entertainment goes the easy way and just bill us for the same game twice, but for me it&apos;s exactly what I wanted. Game is incredibly rewarding, especially on nightmare level, and enjoying it with friend is just so much fun. After basic campaign, which is very short to bo honest, You have classic levels, nightmare difficulty, endless mode and DLC, so generally there is always something to do. I think it&apos;s very important to play with friend, because it&apos;s the exact spirit of this game. Another thing I love in this game is how diverse is you weapons arsenal - I was playing with 3 different friends and playing with each of them was entirely new experience. Everybody has own ways to do things in this game, what I find very enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2860429">Expand</a></span>

Amazing gameplay, amazing characters, awesome new builds and tactics. Whether you&apos;re a new player or liked OMD1, OMD2 is a must-have. You&apos;ll spend many hours with this one.

<br>The sound quality is average quality, the voice acting has that of Axton from Borderlands 2, the graphics match the atmosphere perfectly. There is a wide variety of weapons, traps, trinkets, and costumes for both characters, and the levels seem to be playtested well, allowing for a variety of strategies to win levels, but never easily. Endless is great fun and a challenge at all levels, there is 3 difficulties in the campaign and there is also endless mode, 3 dlc packs with 3 maps each, and a classic that allows you to play the 10 favorite maps of the first one. It is 20 dollars and worth 60, far more enjoyable with a friend though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3256205">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Still, there are amazing improvements: one more character, better upgrades structure, more weapons and traps and guardians and, the best, the co-op mode.
<br>
<br>Co-op was exactly the major flaw of the first &quot;Orcs Must Die&quot;, lots of people started playing &quot;Dungeon Defenders&quot; instead just to play co-op. Still, &quot;Orcs Must Die&quot; single-player manages to be (against all odds) yet more fun than &quot;Dungeon Defenders&quot; multiplayer, and now that we have co-op in &quot;Orcs Must Die 2&quot;, well, there are not many reasons to go back to &quot;Dungeon Defenders&quot;.
<br>
<br>In the end, I think &quot;Orcs Must Die 2&quot; is as good as the first one (meaning: it&apos;s amazing!) and also very cheap.

Every level is designed for two players. While one player can complete them it changes the game completely from a blend of strategy and shooter into an arcade disaster of hack&apos;n slash.  The graphics and program itself are certainly smoother and run more easily, however, there is no real improvement in the level of presentation. While the menus and advancement in the first were more simplified and this has more customization, it is significantly handicapping while developing your character. The two games are simply backwards. On its own or as the first, this game would have been a 6 or 7, generic fun, good humor, alright gameplay.
<br>
<br>As a sequel it is absolute garbage in the vein of Spaceballs&apos; Yogurt, &quot;The Quest For More Money.&quot;
<br>Might have worked as spin-off or multiplayer presentation, but it is hard to forgive a less refined game with sloppier controls as a sequel.
<br>
<br>Can only recommend this game specifically to people who have not played or seen the first and that means marketing to people not interested. Hugely disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2719854">Expand</a></span>

The biggest problem for me is that the newly introduced coop feature (2 players) has shaped the design of this second episode to the point of being very detrimental to single player.
<br>For instance, maps are balanced around the presence of 2 players (yes maps for solo and coop are one and the same...), so when you&apos;re alone, you have to run frantically around the map. Furthermore you can&apos;t rely on traps any more because they have now a bit of randomness : you can&apos;t be sure that no enemy will slip past your traps. So you have to periodically check, hence the running around the map.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: the experience is frustratingly difficult in single player and the fun&apos;s long gone.
<br>I still rate it at 5 because I didn&apos;t experience the coop part so it might be better and because the price is really low.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557744">Expand</a></span>

If you have fun with tower defense games which incorporate FPS elements, you&apos;ll enjoy this too.  Although I still have four maps to play, I have spent over 20 hours so far with the game, so I feel confident giving my assessment.  This game launched at $15 for a single copy or $25 for two.  Or, if you got it during the Steam sale, $12.50/$22.50.  That&apos;s really inexpensive for this quality of game.  I definitely recommend picking it up at these prices f you&apos;re into this game genre.  **Composite Score: 9.125/10**  **Entertainment Value: 10/10**  Solid excitement mixed with charming humor.  I really enjoyed playing solo.  Co-operative play really depends on who you&apos;re playing with and dealing with network/tech issues.  My partner had some microphone and XBOX controller issues, so we had to deal with tech problems at the start. But, after we got those sorted, we had a good time roasting, slicing, and crushing waves of orcs.  **Graphics: 9/10**  The Vision engine still delivers as good of a product as it did in OMD!.  On my SLI GTX 570 setup, I get solid graphics performance and appearance.  Anti-aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering are both great.  No artifacting at all.  Only reason this doesn&apos;t get a 10 is that the traps often don&apos;t mesh perfectly with the surroundings.  And, coins sometimes get lost behind walls.  **Sound: 9/10**  Solid sound like the first game.  Music is lively and entertaining.  The surround system works.  The orcs still tell silly lines, and now that dwarves have been added, they enhance the humor too.  I give this game a 9 instead of the standard 8, because the dialog and music enhance the experience better than most other low-budget games of this style.  **Design and Gameplay: 9/10**  Gameplay has been tweaked since OMD!.  There are more weapons, trinkets, and a new female character, the sorceress.  There are new monsters.  There are other ways to play such as ENDLESS and Co-op.  Also, the way players can upgrade traps and items is distinctly different from the first game.... somewhat more like an RPG than before.  Otherwise though, it&apos;s still build traps and use your character&apos;s powers to defeat the waves of mosters before they exit the map.  **Game Length: 9/10**  Given the game&apos;s low price and its incorporated multiplayer mode, don&apos;t think too harshly about it taking me less than three hours to complete the first half of the campaign on War Mage (normal) difficulty.  I&apos;m not done with the second half yet, but I&apos;ve spent a couple of hours doing and redoing the next few maps.  Also, I&apos;ve spent many more hours playing through ENDLESS maps, going for high-scores, and playing through the classic maps using the new trap upgrades and weapons.  Therefore, I&apos;m quite happy with the game&apos;s length.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2551467">Expand</a></span>

It, the game shows a great storyline which intrigued me a lot since the first game, so far, i&apos;ve only completed it solo, and it was brilliant, so i can&apos;t wait untill i can co-op with one of my friends. Also, i love how the game didnt remove anything, they just added and still kept the old maps from the first game and skins as well. New spells, New traps, and more orcs, this game is a must buy if you wish to have a good time with your friends or even on your own, since the humour of the game never stops with so many jokes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549437">Expand</a></span>

At its heart though, it&apos;s about killing orcs, and it does a damned fine job of doing it, and making it more fun than the first outing whilst it&apos;s at it. The addition of a second character is awesome, meaning you can play through the levels, then go back and play again with better traps, then go back again with a whole different character, giving a tonne more replayability.

<br>The sad part was when I played Orcs Must Die 2. There is much to complain about and not much to cheer for.
<br>
<br>The new location is quite uninteresting, and seems to only be there for the tacked on mine cart feature. At that, the enemies don&apos;t have the ferocity in their appearance, nor the goofiness in their speech that made the first game so enjoyable. The weapons all feel off compared to the crossbow of the original (even the crossbow in this one; since the enemies move in an awkward manner, it makes it hard to get headshots, so its more effective to just hold down the mouse button)
<br>
<br>My biggest complaint is how obvious it is of how the levels should be played. They may as well have had a sign up that said &quot;this trap goes here.&quot; There&apos;s no room for creativity (especially since every good place to put a spring trap just helps the orcs escape the mine)

However, the good things I can think of simply end up here. The level design is much worse than OMD1, and the traps are less deadly as well. The fun of watching Orcs being wiped out by the traps, while players finish off the remaining ones is long gone.
<br>
<br>The game simply become an action game with player running around to shoot the enemies weakened by the traps. At one point in game, I think I am just playing a shooter game with ability to set traps rather than a tower defense game with action element. It is just a chore in later stages of game, especially when you are playing solo, since the maps are mainly made for co-op purpose.
<br>
<br>Single player experience is of less fun, but co-op experience also suffers. There is no match making available, and player has to find a partner from their friend list in steam themselves.
<br>
<br>At last, there are tons of DLCs in this game, while the game itself has less maps than the original. All in all, this game just look like a quick cash-in for milking the hardcore fans before the franchise losing all its charm. A Disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3764903">Expand</a></span>

The addition of co-op really adds a lot more than I really expected.   It loses a point because some of the levels are a little too difficult without a second player around.</span>

<br>THE TRAPS</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game is just plain fun, period.
<br>It&apos;s pretty much the perfect combination of action and strategy - don&apos;t think of it as a mere traditional Tower Defense Game. It combines fast-paced 3rd-person shooter gameplay with the ability to create nearly any devious and viciously effective trap system you can think of, with a side of amusing one-liners, often from the orcs themselves.
<br>THE TRAPS are varied, interesting, and satisfying to see in action, and the ability to upgrade them several times each (sometimes requiring you choose one ability over another) keeps you playing to get the resources to do so. This is true of weapons and accessories as well.
<br>THE LEVELS frequently make you think and change tactics in order to win - the maps are different enough for different strategies to be needed on different maps, and that&apos;s awesome. Don&apos;t listen to the scrubs giving this game a bad score because they think it requires 2 people - it doesn&apos;t. You can 5-skull (ace) every map on Nightmare difficulty, you&apos;ll just have to be clever.
<br>THE REPLAY VALUE is definitely here too. It&apos;s a 15 dollar game...and I&apos;ve already put 100 hours into it, and I&apos;m just now getting into coop maps and Endless mode, and they recently announced they&apos;ll be posting weekly challenges - special scenarios where you must complete a particular objective, possibly with limited traps/resources/time. Most $60 titles don&apos;t offer half the content.
<br>The game also runs like a dream. Loads quickly, doesn&apos;t crash, and I have yet to see a bug. Give it a try. In an age when massive game developers try to milk you for all you;re worth with mediocre, rushed titles, this is a title that got some god-honest love from its developers, and it shows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567501">Expand</a></span>

<br>All in all, For the price, It&apos;s a solid 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549394">Expand</a></span>

Make sure your drivers are up to date and do a fresh install if all else fails.

Occasionally, through clever use of barracades, you can balance the levels for single-player; but, when you can&apos;t, it results in a lot of running back and forth between where you are and where you non-existent partner should be, which can be frustrating at times. If you loved the first one, though, this one is well worth the price, especially if you&apos;ve worn out the maps on the original (which, if you owned it, are available here as well).

<br>The new character is well done and her charm spell can prove indispensible at times.

Fans of the original will find game play to be largely unchanged (though this is by no means a bad thing). The handful of new traps provides additional entertainment and the new maps are very welcome. Difficulty on the whole has been tweaked to provide a slightly more challenging experience and the addition of a new sorceress character (previously the unseen villain of the piece) provides options for a slightly different play style.
<br>
<br>The true value however lies in the excellent cooperative multiplayer mode which allows 2 players to tackle the entirety of the campaign (and standalone play levels) side by side.
<br>
<br>The game provides ample fun at a very reasonable price regardless but to truly experience this gem, a partner is a must.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2573138">Expand</a></span>

The game basically follows the same gameplay concept as the first one. Where you control a war mage who can cast spells and place traps in hopes of repelling the orc invasion. How this game differs from the first is that there are now 2 characters you can choose. Both with unique spells stats and the like. The mechanics of leveling up your spells also changed. Now it is possible to level up every trap and other magic gear you have or buy everything if you&apos;re that rich. As a true sequel the story was quite interesting and humor is still present much like the 1st game. There is coop present which basically makes the game a whole lot of fun. But what got me disappointed was that the game has no lobby system to connect different players from who knows where. Instead it allows you to connect with a friend who already owns the game. It would have been quite enjoyable to connect with other people who have the game but you hardly even know. Still the game is quite fun and the voice chat in the game works like a charm. There are loads to do and if you&apos;re bored from other games there is always this to keep you company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631934">Expand</a></span>

The only issues with it are its limited lifespan and the fact that so much of the game is paid DLC. That said, definitely worth serious consideration for fans of co-op action, defense games and of course, those who like frantic adventuring.</span>

A bit ugly graphics, and often only be used for our people, because if you trap, you might as well get into the place because of our effective against ogres. I played this game for a long time, only the last act stuck. But no matter, it is a good game.</span>

This game is great, spamable crossbow, hack-and-slash, quick magic spells, orcs torn to pieces, sliced orcs, impailed orcs, burnt orcs, electrocuted orcs, orcs swimming in acid and lava pits, flying orcs, orcs flying into one another because of your catapults. This game is awesome and you can be too if you buy it. The only downside: not enough orcs.</span>

<br>
<br>Most of the gameplay is very much similar. You still have a plethora of traps to use, and lots of orcs in each stage. There are fewer overall stages in the main campaign than there were in the first game, but the game offers some new stuff to make up for it. It now has 2 playable characters. Their starting weapons and starting traps are different. Like for example the Apprentice uses a blunderbuss as the main weapon, whereas the sorceress uses a sceptre to shoot small projectiles from. The presence of two playable characters also means the game can be played in co-op.
<br>
<br>In addition to this, some stages also have an endless mode, where you can keep fighting hordes of orcs till you lose all the rift points, and the game also lets you play some of the classic stages from the first game.
<br>
<br>The upgrade mechanic has been improved from the first game. Though the simplicity of it in the first game was nice, it&apos;s also great to have a bigger variety of upgrades that this game offers. Now each trap has more than 1 upgrade, and in addition to upgrading your existing traps, you can also buy new traps, weapons, and trinkets for all sorts of benefits, depending on how you prefer to play. Now this also means that it&apos;s easier to earn skulls, which are used as upgrade points. You can now gain them in more ways. In the first game you could only get them as a rating for each mission, but now you can also get them as bonuses and random drops, and as rewards for surviving a certain amount of waves in the endless stages.
<br>
<br>Just as with new traps, you also meet some new enemies. We now have some earth elementals which split into two smaller units upon death, some tall, lanky trolls which can take a lot of punishment, and even the regular grunts now have light, medium, and heavy armour varieties.
<br>
<br>There are only a couple of minor things I didn&apos;t like. The first one is that I was unable to find an easy way to switch between characters when in the campaign menu. I first played through the whole campaign as the Apprentice, and when I wanted to try out the Sorceress, I couldn&apos;t simply pick a stage I&apos;ve beaten already and to do it with her. Instead I had to create a new character profile with no upgrades or unlocks and to start the campaign all over from the start, which isn&apos;t all that great.
<br>
<br>Another thing I didn&apos;t like was how the barricades have become virtually useless now. It&apos;s possible that maybe I was just unlucky, but on many occasions I noticed that the orcs now seem to prefer to rather smash their way through the barricades rather take an alternate path, even if the alternate path is within their vision. The only time this didn&apos;t happen was when I played the classic levels from the first game.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this is a great 3rd person tower defence game and lives up to the quality of the first one. If you&apos;ve enjoyed the first one, get this one too. If you&apos;ve enjoyed this one, get the first one too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5837891">Expand</a></span>

<br>The mine environment is boring and dull, and there is way less space to put traps on so you get no room for creativity. Most of your kills will be done by your basic attack and spell but very few by your traps. So you will end up clicking like crazy, which is not very interesting gameplay wise. On top of that your basic weapon feels off compare to the original crossbow.
<br>The orcs doesnt look as good as in the original.
<br>There is not a single feature which feels like an improvement... I didn&apos;t try coop though. But I already can&apos;t be bothered playing this game anymore. I give it a 5 for the fair price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866954">Expand</a></span>

You have to stop the invading Orcs from reaching a certain point on the map. I think they call this a tower defense game. And it literally is. You defend your castle against the multitude of monsters by placing a selection of traps and troops at critical points and supporting them with your avatar who can be equipped with various weapon and items..
<br>Interesting is that OMD2 is not a top down game, but rather a 3 third person game. I
<br>In OMD 2 there are  two playable characters: the War Mage, the male protagonist  from OMD and  the Sorceress, his female adversary from the same game.  Each has unique capabilities, the first is more tuned in to fighting, the second more capable of using magic.
<br>The  War Mage is somewhat easier to play as he can use a trap that is cheap ,is always on and affects all the types of orcs. It slows down them down allowing your other traps and troops to deal with them more easier.  The Sorceress only has traps that works at intervals thus making it harder to deal with the mobs.
<br>There are various modes and levels of difficulty. There is a story mode that takes through various maps and gradually introduces you to new types of orcs and weapons, items, traps and troops. Improvements for these are unlocked by collecting Skulls.
<br>You can also spend skulls on outfits..if you are bored with your  default appearance. The new outfits have no other effect than changing your looks.
<br>
<br>Visual OMD 2 has a comic book like quality. The male avatar is portrayed as a all round cool guy who thinks the world of himself..the female character has a snappy attitude and wears sexy outfits, of course.
<br>There banter between the two characters is pretty funny and kept as part of this game although now they are competitors working for the same side(or more like, against the orcs in the style: your enemies enemy is my ally) instead of adversaries.
<br>
<br>I find the game fun to play. It combines smooth combat, funny banter, nice graphics and challenging situations. It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.
<br>
<br>I decided on a 8.5 overall and hesitantly round it down to eight. Judged as a tower defense game it might be a nine. Judged as an overall game.. I decide that it was an eight, basically because of the following considerations: it lacks a gripping story, it becomes repetitive after a while, you can&apos;t play the orcs(which would be funny), you can&apos;t program what the ai can use against you(why not have sliders with: more trolls, more flyers?)and a character can&apos;t select the unique capabilities of the other character.
<br>
<br>A nice game if you can pick it up cheaply.

The co-op focus is too much to fully praise the game (it would benefit from a more reasonable single-player experience), but even for a solo-player, the game is quite fun.  I hope to see refinement in the next installment, to fully include all play-styles.  Still, highly recommended!</span>

The number of maps and traps makes for a very deep game, and you&apos;ll find yourself playing them over and over to try and get all 5 skulls (the max rating you can get per map). Multiplayer option is a welcome addition allowing you to partner up with a friend, but the matchmaking is lousy -- there is no pickup games -- you have to have a friend on your Steam list to play with them, making it a clumsy system.
<br>
<br>New to OMD2 is Endless mode, where you try can literally play forever. This also feels a bit rushed -- there are certainly some balance issues with this. The devs would have been better off making it just 50 or 100 levels. &quot;Endless&quot; mode is never satisfying.
<br>
<br>As a single player game OMD2 excels, but as a multiplayer it feels a underwhelming and the Endless mode, while fun for some, is a tedious experience -- both of which prevents me from giving it a higher score.
<br>
<br>Still, OMD2 is a great experience and with the add-ons it makes for an extremely satisfying game. This game is certainly worth the price of purchase, but I recommend avoiding the Are We There Yeti expansion - it&apos;s incredibly difficult and unbalanced -- punishing and unfun in fact.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5970910">Expand</a></span>

It is a huge improvement over what was already a great first game, and the cooperative play is a great addition. Having played Unchained prior to this title, I can say they should take a few more elements from this entry.</span>

The first thing I noticed was how the graphics and overall cosmetic design resembles of World of Warcraft (cartoonish style, creatures with a touch of humor). At the beginning of each mission, you choose from a wide selection of traps and set them to stop the flow of enemies such as orcs, gnolls, trolls etc. You also have your own weapon, making Orcs Must Die basically a tower defense &#x2013; FPS hybrid. Traps, hazards and weapons are funny, interesting and useful enough to encourage you to try different selections.
<br>
<br>Not having a partial refund of traps option was a design choice from developers that I have found a bit annoying. Instead of being able to refund some skill points you have distributed to specific traps, the game forces you to refund everything and start from scratch which slows down the pace, especially since you are most likely playing this co-op with a friend.
<br>
<br>I would definitely suggest playing this in &#x201C;nightmare&#x201D; difficulty, since normal difficulty is too easy and thus, does not require building any strategy. On the other hand, you need to complete the normal difficulty first in order to unlock &#x201C;nightmare&#x201D;.  This, in my case, meant a lot of wasted hours because I wouldn&#x2019;t have played the scenario twice otherwise.
<br>
<br>Orcs Must Die! 2 is a great choice for anyone looking for an online co-op game. Remember to try the harder difficulty before you judge it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7812119">Expand</a></span>
