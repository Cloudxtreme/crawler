There&apos;s 123 new cards, between neutral, class and non-collectible (spare parts for exemple). And there&apos;s 36 cards with some random in it. This makes so many matches being decided in a random event.
<br>
<br>And one more problem in hearthstone is, it&apos;s a free to play game, but if you start now you&apos;ll have to play daily for months, to have a good base of cards to construct your deck and play in ladder. you take almost 3 months to get enough gold to buy 40 packs. It&apos;s just to slow, if you want to get your collection fast, you&apos;ll end up using more money than you would in wow, unless you do really well in arenas (another random stuff).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-goblins-vs-gnomes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893791">Expand</a></span>

Which is fine, but games like TF2 solved the F2P model without giving other players an unfair advantage.</span>

Especially if those cards are armies of annoying robots and hordes of crazy goblins throwing dynamite everywhere. The problem I have with GvG is that it seems to be infecting the core of Hearthstone pretty significantly, the fact that everyone is using it is ok, that&apos;s everybodys choice, but GvG is even forcing it&apos;s way to Arena for example, as of now, the only type of pack you can win in Arena is GvG which I don&apos;t want, and as the entrance is paid, it made the entire Arena useless for me and I have to buy normal packs, which is not fun at all. I also don&apos;t like the atmosphere of those cards, I see Hearthstone as a good fantasy, and all those mechs and robots doesn&apos;t suit that at all. So many cards are either annoying or their effect totally random, which even more increases the element of luck rather than skill. There are still couple of cool cards here and there and in this type of game, more is always good, but I just really really don&apos;t like the theme of this pack, hopefully it was the worst for the start and from now on all new expansions will be only better. 3/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-goblins-vs-gnomes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938921">Expand</a></span>

It is also a very addictive game, to say the least. I still wish they would put more time into balancing the cards and the heroes. This game will still be here 10 years from now, mark my word.</span>

Competitive play requires either unfathomable grinding (thousands of hours to be competitive) or pay-to-win purchases (of several hundred dollars).  This free-to-play game is incredibly expensive....and all you get is digital (non-material) cards that are not even really rare like real, printed cards whose production can be limited (anyone can get any digital card if you pay enough...supply and demand is a hoax in this type of game).  This is a predatory game that preys on the addictive nature of certain activities to certain people.  In the end, you&apos;ll remember the game negatively, and forget it entirely soon after.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-goblins-vs-gnomes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4928136">Expand</a></span>
