<br>
<br>RIME is the kind of game that plays on your nostalgia; it includes elements from most of the following (there&apos;s a reason I&apos;m taking the time to list these):
<br>
<br>- first and foremost, TeamIco&apos;s first game, &quot;ICO,&quot; from the PlayStation age
<br>- then, in no particular order, games like The Legend of Zelda, Oceanhorn, Submerged, Journey, Never Alone, Lost in Shadow, The Unfinished Swan, and Papo &amp; Yo
<br>- finally, if you are a fan of the soundtracks of both Journey and Princess Mononoke, you will recognize a few homages to the respective composers of the two; however, I do not believe this was purposeful
<br>
<br>On to the actual game and why I gave it a 7.
<br>
<br>Without spoilers, I&apos;ll lay it out. Remember those games I just mentioned? RIME does them all... just okay. It wishes to be so much of all those things, that it does not know what it wants to be.
<br>
<br>There are beautiful moments in which the music matches an opening in a wall, a bright light, much like &quot;Journey;&quot; then there are moments where the music doesn&apos;t do much or becomes repetitive, despite your just having achieved something in-game.
<br>
<br>There are moments where the game makes a puzzle unnecessarily difficult, and just when you think, &quot;Oh! Awesome puzzle, like the ones in Zelda,&quot; it totally lets you down when you realize all you have to do is press a button (I played with gamepad).
<br>
<br>There are moments when you think, &quot;Wow! This game moves like ICO, but upgraded to the 21st century!&quot; And then the damn kid gets stuck on a piece of wood that has supposedly been destroyed, at a crucial moment (if you played, you know what I mean), and the ICO frustrations resurface.
<br>
<br>Finally, because I don&apos;t want to keep going, the music is pretty; very, very pretty. But that&apos;s about it. It doesn&apos;t grab you the way Journey&apos;s music does; it also doesn&apos;t do Joe Hisaishi&apos;s (Ghibli) simplicity well - the composer simply does not know how to use certain chords (I&apos;m a musician, that&apos;s why I notice).
<br>
<br>Should everyone with an itch for good indie games play this? Yes. Should you wait for the price to drop? Yes, because the FPS sure are having no trouble dropping. If you have a PS4, should you buy PC version? Only if PC version drops to $9.99, otherwise, play it on PS4; I hear it does better there.
<br>
<br>All in all, a decent game, though just as disappointing - in the end - as last year&apos;s The Last Guardian and Bound, which fall under the same genre and have similar issues. The formula is starting to stink, and is being weighed down by porting issues, development process (they all take too long), and mechanics issues... not to mention, low sales. Maybe it&apos;s time to give these games a rest and wait for another Shadow of the Colossus, whose issue&apos;s could be easily overlooked because everything else was great?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rime/user-reviews?user_review_id=7338482">Expand</a></span>

<br>the mood this game put you in is what i want from a game, the music is amazing
<br>the discovery that i was playing with a kid that already died at the end almost made me cry
<br>this game was worth the time i spent it onto it</span>

It is a game about exploration, adventure, platforming (Tomb Raider style), and puzzles. The puzzles are not too hard and the story is well told. This game gives you a peaceful and relaxing feeling especially with its classical soundtrack. Not having to read anything is also a plus for me. The game is short but not too short by today&apos;s standards. I finished it in three days with a few hours each day. Lots of secrets of which I only found about 50%. The controls don&apos;t suffer from the usual consolitis. Good PC port.
<br>
<br>The only negative thing I have to say about this is that there is a bug in Win 10 where the taskbar will not go away. It remains there even in full screen and it can be a pain because as you move the camera, the invisible cursor is still there and sometimes clicking ends up clicking one of the task bar items getting you out of the experience. Hopefully this will be fixed since it is listed as a know issue on the official site.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rime/user-reviews?user_review_id=7348136">Expand</a></span>

Graphically, it looks amazing running in 2160p at 60 fps.  I&apos;m running it on a 980 ti.  If you max out the settings on the game it&apos;s going to run very slowly.  The Unreal Engine 4 requires a powerful GPU, that&apos;s the just the reality of it.  Even the PS4 Pro version is only running in 1080p at 30 fps.  The best thing to do is turn the shadows to low, that will give you a HUGE frame rate boost, and turn resolution scaling to 75%.  Using the resolution scaling the game looked better and had a better frame rate than when I was running it in 1800p.  There are stilling going to be frame rate drops in big open areas on high settings unless you&apos;re running on a 1080ti, but that happens in all games with big areas and long draw distances--just look at The Last Guardian.  After beating the game I did mess around with the settings a bit and found that by turning screen space reflections to low(not even sure what that does, I didn&apos;t notice a difference), setting anistropic filtering to x2, AA to FXAA, turning off depth of field, using my video card to force fast vsync, and setting the resolution to 1917p at 75% scaling I was able to get an almost solid 60 fps.  I probably would have played it with those settings if I had known that would work.
<br>
<br>The game can be beaten in 6 hours, although if you take time to explore it thoroughly and get all the items it could take 10-12 hours.  Getting the optional items will unlock the true ending.  Priced at $30 it&apos;s a good deal, especially considering how beautiful the game looks graphically.  Exploring will also give you subtle hints to what is actually happening in the world, otherwise the big secret revealed in the last level may seem to come kind of out of nowhere.
<br>
<br>The game borrows from games like Ico and Journey.  Gameplay wise it feels quite similar to Ico.  Honestly, after the somewhat disappointing The Last Guardian, this is a nice Ico-style game.  I thought the puzzles where the right difficulty.  I don&apos;t particularly care for puzzle games that require you to resort to a walkthrough 20 times to beat it.  I only had to use a walkthrough twice, although some puzzles did take a while for me to figure out.  Also, a lot of the game is just about wandering around and admiring the beautiful environments, while you listen to the game&apos;s amazing soundtrack.  The puzzles don&apos;t get in the way of this.
<br>
<br>All and all, it&apos;s an amazing game and well worth a purchase.  This is also one of the best looking games out there in 4k, despite the frame rate drops in open areas.  The heartbreaking story, superb soundtrack, and gorgeous environments all make for a memorable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rime/user-reviews?user_review_id=7334803">Expand</a></span>

This combined with the awesome music and atmosphere makes it enjoyable to just walk around looking at stuff. This is truly a work of art.
<br>
<br>The game is fairly linear but you can go off the path to find hidden objects, which in themselves are fairly pointless. When looking for these objects, however, you will come across some really amazing views and places which truly adds to the visual experience.
<br>
<br>I do agree that the gameplay is pretty standard and nothing new really. However, the developers themselves have said that the game is more of a &quot;visual experience&quot;, but the puzzles could have been slightly harder as most of them are fairly simplistic.
<br>
<br>Also the game isn&apos;t that long and can be completed in around 6 hours, possibly more if you run around looking for the hidden objects while at the same time admiring the amazing graphics.
<br>
<br>The game has some serious performance issues however. Even the most powerful hardware struggles with this game for no apparent reason. I&apos;m playing version 1.03 of the game with an i7 7700k @ 4,2Ghz, 32Gb DDR4 @ 3200Mhz and a GeForce GTX 1080 and there is severe stuttering and dips down to 30 fps ever now and then. This forces me to lower the score from 9 to 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rime/user-reviews?user_review_id=7387734">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It took me around 9 hours to finish the game and I found a bit more than half of the secrets... so there are some more hours in it for me.
<br>
<br>Rime manages to stay interesting and never puts you in situations that feel tedious or unmanagable. And you are gently guided by your little fox companion, if you ever get a bit lost.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is also great and reminded me a bit of Journey. (In a good way)
<br>Combined with the optical style of the game it never gets old to look at the scenery.
<br>
<br>And the story... is unexpected, sweet and... the rest would be a spoiler. ;P
<br>
<br>Tl;dr
<br>It&apos;s a very beautiful game in every aspect. It&apos;s very polished and a great and emotional journey.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rime/user-reviews?user_review_id=7396799">Expand</a></span>

<br>The art style is like a blend of Ico and Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The puzzles rarely hold you up for long, but they&apos;re really nicely designed: genuinely new ideas (or at least, ideas I&apos;d never seen before).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rime/user-reviews?user_review_id=7547647">Expand</a></span>
