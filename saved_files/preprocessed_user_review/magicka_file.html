I dont think I&apos;ve ever panicked so much whilst playing a game, nor had as much fun. And the opportunities for friendly fire in co-op are pretty much unbeatable I reckon. Love it. And it&apos;s cheap as chips! Great value for money.</span>

I bought the game when it was first released and it had a lot of glitches and bugs (crashes, black screens, etc).  But after a year, they&apos;ve REALLY fleshed out the game and fixed the bugs.  I love the references to media culture.  It makes the game a laugh a minute.  The game isn&apos;t about button mashing, so people who couldn&apos;t get into the game because of that need to learn to actually play a game.  The game gives you a lot of different combinations of spells that drastically affect how the spell works and what it does.  Mixing in the fact that you can have 4 people playing together AND their spells can combine to make different outcomes with higher levels of destruction make the game very replayable.  That brings me to the reason why people probably won&apos;t like the game as much when playing co-op, it requires TEAM WORK.  Friendly fire is on (which is good, because otherwise the game would allow you spam spells and not worry about hurting your team mate...meaning you could walk through the game).  But thanks to the addition to different robes, you can form strategies between your team mates that make you need to think about what you&apos;re doing (which means no button mashing noobs).  The game is solid and the plot is silly but fun.  Play this game and keep your eyes peeled for easter eggs and references to everything from star trek to monty python.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=2288387">Expand</a></span>

Magicka is a great game to paly with friends as well, weather you are pvping, doing the campaign or doing the survival modes. The amount of crappy DLC that was released for it at a high price was pretty damn disappointing unless you bought it all on sale (good chance you would have seen it was on sale a lot). Overall Magicka is a great game definately worth buying at this time, it was just a shame that some of its reputation was ruined due to the buggy launch and overpriced dlc with little free content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338890">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not so much the gameplay or characters that makes me like this game (although they DO have some pretty sweet robes) it&apos;s the fact that they take themselves with a grain of salt and can make fun of that fact too. Some patches have been released to fix all the previous bugs, I can play with my friends online easily and it is one of the few games that has made me laugh out loud more than once. Definitely  a must buy, and definitely  in my top ten games of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490680">Expand</a></span>

You may think a game where the main objective is &quot;accidentally blow yourself, your friends, and 20 bad guys 3 stories into the air&quot; would be boring, but you&apos;d be wrong. The game originally shipped with tons and tons of bugs and glitches, but those were fixed less than a day after it was available, so I guess no harm done there.  The one complaint I can think of for this game is that magic combinations are in no way balanced. A QFQFAAS spell will do infinitely more damage than a rock spell. A rock spell also takes ~5 seconds to charge to full strength, while a beam spell will instantly deal greater damage than a rock spell. To make matters worse, a beam spell continually increases damage output the longer you leave a beam on an enemy. At the end of the day, two fully charged rock spells deal like 1/100 of the damage of a ten second long beam of energy. And that isn&apos;t even factoring in the potential for beams to be merged; that&apos;s just a single persons beam. Even with this grievous lack of game balance, this game will definitely give you many hours of playtime for a low cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1526667">Expand</a></span>

Magicka is a game about teamwork and hilarious jokes. I bought this game with one of my friends and as of now have beat it twice. I recommend this game for any 2-4 people with microphones to chat with.</span>

The magic system is groundbreaking and brilliant, completely changing how magic casting will be done in future games no doubt. Having to use some of your own personal skill in creating the combos means it&apos;s less button spam and more personal skill and coordination. The spells are creative, entertaining, and quite powerful. You really do feel like a magic-slinging bad-a$$. There are some flaws, unfortunately: No save! You have to use the awful checkpoint system! An archaic throwback reminiscent of console ports. Also the way the enemies can stunlock you at time, making it impossible to cast any spells as you keep getting knocked down over and over. But one of the best things: No silly &quot;mana&quot; to keep track of! If I want to blast a spell, I can blast the darn spell! And keep blasting it as much as I like. This is the way it should be, no mana management or being able to not cast a spell cause you&apos;re out of mana. MAna is a horrible idea that wormed its way into games 10+ years ago and never went away. Its time has come, and Magicka has shown us the joy of being an uber-powerful wizard without mana deficiencies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570569">Expand</a></span>

You can play 2 on the same computer and with your friends over the internet.<br>What I like the most about this game is that you need to use your head and this game is hard. You will get used to die, a lot. But everyone also have a revive spell that you can use at all times. The spell casting system is new and innovative since you don&apos;t have any mana like almost all other games where you wield spells. You also got 8 elements and you can combine up to 5 elements at once. Almost every spell have it&apos;s own effect and will change the dynamic of the spells you cast. The only problem with this game was at the start of launch where you had a lot of crashes and bugs. But most of the problems are fixed since the game has had several updates since release. I have had a great time playing this game and it is well worth 10 euros. Playing this game solo is a little bit more difficult but you can do it if you use your head. I still don&apos;t understand how some people review this game as a bad game because it is hard. Personally I love that Magicka is a very unforgiving game where the game doesn&apos;t hold your freaking hand all the time like in Call of Duty and other games. Magicka doesn&apos;t follow the so called defaults that you have in other games, for example you can use all elements at the start but you can find spell books scattered around the world of Magicka, you can also pick up cool weapons and staffs that are either hidden or from fallen enemies. You can remap all the keys in the game but you have to be in the main menu which is a little bad I know. But still Magicka is well worth the money and the spell system is a great and the only thing that stops you is the imagination. I give this game a 10 because the people who made this game took a bit of a risk and did something that is new and innovative with a lot of fun video game humour and references inside that made you laugh like a little girl and it brought back some sweet memories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551148">Expand</a></span>

The humour is great, with lots of nerdy pop culture references. The jibberish the characters speak is especially funny if you speak a Norse language, because then you can really notice how stupid it all sounds. As for the gameplay, it works really well. The combining of elements to create magic is an innovative system, which makes mana obsolete. The only limit you have is how fast you can press the keys, and also some spells need to be unlocked. I&apos;ve only played this game singelplayer so far, and have yet to beat it. It would probably be easier with a friend... If he was a good player who doesn&apos;t friendly fire at you, that is. Because there are LOTS of opportunities and possibilities to get enemies, allies and yourself killed. Often in hilarious ways. Oh, and I got the game at 50% of on Steam, so that&apos;s pretty much a steal. AS FOR BUGS, the team has obviously been working really hard to fix them, because I&apos;ve experienced none. Oh, and they added a spell called &quot;Crash to desktop&quot; together with the bug fixes...

Firstly, I ran through the game with three other friends and it was a lot of fun, although a slow start because upon its release the menus were lagging and riddled with CTDs for us. Me and my friends loved figuring out spell combinations, boss strategies and also knocking each other off the map. I found with the four of us it was difficult to coordinate and would more often then not ruin the fun for each other.<br><br>I recommend playing the game co-op, just 2 people, it is easier to co-ordinate and execute strats. One of us would shoot a freezing energy beam and the other a water energy beam blowing enemies up into ice crystal then we would combine electrical attacks to destroy the frozen enemies. It worked wonders and we progressed smoothly through the game. Magicka had a lot of solid mechanics and special spells that it felt there was always new attacks to discover and mess with. For the price, length and multi-player mayhem this game is magical.

Normally, when I try out a new game, it takes some time for me to really enjoy it, but I was overcome with joy from the first moment of playing Magicka.<br><br>In this game, you combine spells from 8 different elements. Some elements empower others, for instance lightning becomes more powerful if you already cast steam or water on your opponent. You can do both aoe, single target and selftarget with the same spell, changing how it works. There are also premade spells that you can learn from books, like thunderstorm or teleport, and they works in the same way as all other spells; by combining the elements in a specific order.<br><br>The campaign is hillarious. You get to hear references from tons of movies and games in a very fun tone while bashing monsters with all the tricks you have picked up from killing your teammates by accident.<br><br>Another fun gamemode is the arena. This is different from the campaign, as the only objective here is to survive waves of incoming attacks from monsters. This is very hard to complete alone, as you will need teamwork for some of the waves. Everything in this game is more fun if you play it with up to three friends.<br><br>The downside of this game is lack of content. I played the game for about 4 hours, and then the campaign was complete, then another 1-2 hours for both arenas to be complete. And then there were nothing left to do, and I haven&apos;t played the game since.<br><br>In short, the game is brilliant and alot of fun, but it lacks content, and you don&apos;t get many hours of fun before you have to do the same content over again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1640869">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think I never laughed so much playing a game (probably only Monkey Island made me laugh harder, but that was single player), so this is the funniest game to play with your friends !!! This is the funniest game where you can KILL your friends.... and laugh about it. Frozen in an ice cube, incinerated, electrocuted, crushed by giant stones, exploded by the electric ice wall of death... yes that&apos;s an actual magic combo you can create.
<br>This game offer so much possibilities you will not advance a single chapter in the story until you have killed your friends (or yourself ) at least 30 times, you&apos;ll enjoy hours of experimenting with magic combinations, trying to find the deadliest spell or the safest shield.
<br>The game is also full of easter eggs and references, I can assure you there are a LOT of them, from Star Wars to The Lord of The rings, from Castelvania to Tomb Raider, from Reservoir Dogs to Zelda, just play it and find them !
<br>
<br>Magicka is one of the funniest, brilliant and enjoyable games you will ever play, the Swedish-english gibberish of dialogues will make you laugh for hours.
<br>
<br>The only cons about this game is that it&apos;s often buggy and the graphics should, and could, have been done better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943748">Expand</a></span>

From the derpaderp speech of the characters, to the level and enemy design, to the just brilliant spell system. As soon as you get outside the tutorial, you run into a woman with a big gold exclamation mark over her head in good old RPG fashion, asking you to kill rats in her basement or something like that. You know you&apos;re on a winner when she gets attacked by goblins and the quest marker falls off onto the ground and you get down to some good old blowin&apos; stuff up instead.<br><br>Best things about Magicka? No mana. Limited inventory (you can pick up a staff and carry a &apos;melee&apos; item). No quests apart from killing the next thing in front of you. GREAT spell system, where you have 8 different elementals, each bound to a key, and you can combine them in any way you want to create spells, some of which just combine effects, some of which form unique Magicks.<br><br>Worst thing about Magicka is that the engine doesn&apos;t always perform as well as it could. That&apos;s all there is. It&apos;s a very hard game in places, but people, there&apos;s absolute simplicity in the rest of the game so you can focus on STRATEGY. Everything is quite straightforward once you figure out what the enemy&apos;s weaknesses are, and that&apos;s half the fun. (The other half of the fun is blowing up goblins in new and exciting ways.)<br><br>Summary: buy this game.

However, developers seem to be conscientious about fixing their mistakes, so if bugs are an issue, just wait a few weeks. Once you get over that hump, I think we have a sleeping classic. Single player is wonderful, and is perhaps the only combat game where I feel not just clever, but creative. Exploration of spells is a joy, and every new discovery feels like a game changer, yet it still manages remarkable balance. Multiplayer is a wonderfully chaotic affair chalk full of mistaken explosions, accidental earth-shattering combos, and general mischief and mayhem surround a deceptively deep game. In all the insanity, dying a gruesome death can actually be MORE entertaining then the killing. Getting used to the controls takes a little effort, but once you are, you get a real sense of concocting spells, as opposed to merely pressing a button. Tie this together with a thin story with just enough to keep the action moving, and some light humor elements, and you have one of the best 10 bucks you have ever spent. The only other complaint I could possibly have is that it needs to be longer, but I have yet to jump into the challenge mode. Long and the short of it? Buy this game now so you can say you did before it became a classic, must-have title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1477668">Expand</a></span>

I think an important thing to keep in mind is that many of the reviews here, both critic and user, were written when the game was released with glaring launch bugs and issues. And while that&apos;s hardly something they can be blamed for judging the game by, these issues have long since been ironed out at this point in time. What does this leave us with? It leaves us with an indie game whose main gameplay feature of combining various spell elements is highly innovative and whose multiplayer is absolutely hilarious. However, let it be noted that it is very much a multiplayer-centric title; while singleplayer is available, you quickly learn that death comes easily in this game, and you soon find yourself spamming the same 2-3 spell combinations throughout the vast majority of the game in order to simply survive. In a recent patch they have attempted to alleviate this problem somewhat with the introduction of the Fairy, which will revive you once, should you fall, and is recharged at every checkpoint, however the core of the issue still remains; the game is balanced for multiplayer. The campaign itself is somewhat short and linear, but compensates for it with plenty of humour and numerous easter eggs to be discovered. If you have 1-3 friends with an interest in a game like this, it&apos;s a blast and easily worth the full price. If you&apos;re going for the singleplayer experience, you might want to wait for a sale before purchasing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1947960">Expand</a></span>

<br>Phenomenal mechanics and more than a thousand combinations of spells.

<br>And don&apos;t look on bugs, they are not so critical, many of them may be avoided. Developers works hard and release updates every week.</span>

I would recommend this game to anyone, after all the price is just $10. If you&apos;re not sure whether this game is for you or not just download the demo available for free and try it out.</span>

Magicka 2 is brilliant in its simplicity and humour. The endless combination of spells can create so many fun situations, both beneficial as well as harmful. However, there are bugs in the game. Sometimes, the game crashes in multiplayer sessions, which means that the level will need to be played from scratch. This can be very annoying. There are also some other inconveniences that you will likely run into. Here&apos;s hoping that a decent patch will be released soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1566562">Expand</a></span>

In co-op, every time you start getting warmed up there&apos;s another unskippable cutscene breaking the action apart -- there&apos;s no sign of the long continuous Diablo-style creature crawl that the magic system really deserves.  And the hard sections are &quot;annoying hard&quot;: the game takes control away from you by killing you or getting you grappled, such that some of the co-op players will spend large amounts of time either helplessly hammering the space bar or going &quot;rez plx&quot; rather than actually playing.

It is a little buggy at times but if you have a great computer with a great processor and video card it prevents a lot of problems.  Gameplay is a top down.  The coolest thing about the game is mixing spell types to create powerful combinations to devastate enemies... or yourself and friends if you happen to hit friendlies.  The game has a helpful tutorial in the beginning that leaves you learning more and more spells throughout the entire game.  It is also incredibly funny with lots of references to Star Wars in the text of dialogue.  I believe my first hard laugh came when playing the tutorial and my friend who had chosen a strange army character (not very wizardly at all) accidently tossed a grenade at my feet and killed me.  I thought I was out forever until we learned a revive spell to bring me back.  This game should be played co-op for the most fun as long as you cooperate with team members otherwise it could get frustrating.  So, if you&apos;ve got an awesome computer and ten bucks I&apos;d recommend this game for some exciting and funny entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716346">Expand</a></span>

I bought this game at a later date, and therefore i wasn&apos;t victim to so many bugs, aside from airships freezing in midair and several crashes. The dialogue and humor in this game give you a lot of motivation to continue with the story, and it is filled with countless references to other games, movies, and even some memes. I love how the wizard characters look, and the varying costumes give different ways of playing the game. Combining spells is hilarious, especially when you use your friends as test subjects. Many of the magicks in the game will result in either your death or your friends death, so be warned. This game is simple entertainment, whether it&apos;s creating a vortex to destroy hordes of enemies, or blowing up your friends with a lightning bolt, this unique game will keep you playing.

The controls and combat are slow at first to ease you into it then by the 3rd chapter the difficulty gets notably more difficult without making it frustrating because it usually makes you blame yourself for dying and not the game. (Although I became quite annoyed in the volcano section of chapter 11.) I&apos;ve almost finished the game and I love most of the characters like Vlad (who is so not a vampire) and the giant dragon Fafnir and Ygg and finally Jormungdar the giant acid spitting snake. I got this while it was on special for $2.50 but would of been happy now to spend the original price of $20 on this small practically indie game that I&apos;ve spent more time on than Portal 1 and 2! I&apos;m hitting my 20 hour mark now and am still going! Plus it&apos;s amazing fun exploring each level trying to find all the secret areas (and all the dead moose, yes you heard right dead moose) and especially finding probably the best secret of the game the Sword of Masters which fires a sword beam at full health and of course the reviver for single player a fairy that says hey list&apos;n. This is a must have game for anyone who is into pop culture or fantasy or creativity or even games in general!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144275">Expand</a></span>

I absolutely love the music, the scenery, the gameplay, the humor, (which has a lot of... &quot;reference&quot; jokes) and action.

It&apos;s the only game I have ever come across that can be described as a &apos;glorious failure&apos;.  It&apos;s awesomely fun and amazingly broken.  It seems so silly to be critical of a game that gives you so much for ten measly dollars.  I had more fun with this game in a few minutes than I did with something like Dragon Age in 20 hours and at four times the price. The great news about this game is that it&apos;s innovate, creative, and there is nothing else out there like it on the PC.  The sad news about this game is that it doesn&apos;t actually have an identity.  It&apos;s best described as what happened when someone mixed an RPG fantasy setting with platform mechanics.  Yes, the game remains horribly broken from a technical point of view.  But the real problem with the game is that it doesn&apos;t mix the single player mode and the multi-player mode well, at all.  It simply lacks any type of game play balance.  It&apos;s either super duper easy or preposterously hard.  Balance is always a challenge in any type of RPG MMO.  And I cannot help but think that one of the reasons this game is so broken is because the developers bit off more than they could chew.  If they had just focused on making a single player game this game might have been hailed as revolutionary.  The same way if they had made what was essentially a multi-player game only. But as it stands it&apos;s just a mess. The thing is though that it remains a hilarious, fun, and enticing mess. I struggle on how to rate this game because a 3 (execution), a 6 (design), and a 10 (value) all seem reasonable depending on how one looks at it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1539891">Expand</a></span>

I loved the tutorial, where we had to use right elements to solve the puzzles... but we never saw anything like that in the game itself. This game could be perfect, but ended up being too hack-and-slash&apos;y, linear, and way too short. Its still a good game, but it could be so much better.</span>

The lack of an inventory means you just pick up new things all the time, and removes any interest you would have in customizing the character.<br><br>Dying takes 10 seconds every time, as you wait for the slow faded word &quot;defeated&quot; to fade up on the screen, which is unskippable. The best part? Being frozen makes this process take LONGER. You have to wait longer to respawn if you died while frozen, as the whole game slows down.<br><br>Overall, mixing spells is an incredibly cool idea, but wait until Diablo III comes out, where you&apos;ll get that on top of an actually playable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478798">Expand</a></span>

However, that&apos;s not to say that it is good either.  The controls are terrible, and the number of bugs makes me want to vomit.  This game could have been great, and I hope people who make games can learn from this one, but alas, with all my hope and openness, it just didn&apos;t work out.</span>

That said i give this game still rather low rating because it is hard, very hard. I have only played it single player and it appears as the game is made for co-op. A difficulty setting that would make single player easier, specially that bosses cant one shot the player and i would give this game a 9.</span>

Mostly forgetting those permutations in my experimentations, but rediscovery is just as fun as the initial go.<br>Multiplayer produces hilarious spectacle when you&apos;re trying to rez a buddy, but end up blowing up your 3rd friend instead. Permanent friendly-fire was perhaps the best design choice by far. Just don&apos;t take yourself too seriously. And be prepared for a lot of nerd media references. Shameless references. Face-reddening puns. You&apos;ll see them coming, you&apos;ll laugh, you&apos;ll feel bad for laughing-- all in the best possible way.<br>In for a laugh? Talked a buddy into it? There are FAR worse things you could drop $10 on.

<br>While these were annoying, they were completely overshadowed by the sheer volume of fun and hilarity the game offers. Playing co-op with a friend, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve laughed that hard in ages. The innovative game-play, funny dialog and outrageous in-game antics made for a heck of a fun evening.
<br>

You have to hold down shift to do any kind of attack other than basic magic so it makes my hand hurt to play this game for a long period of time.  You have to repeatedly tap the ASDFQWER keys with your left hand to cast your magic spells with up to 8 keypresses and possibly a shift key hold needed to be pressed to cast one spell.  It requires at least three times as many button presses to play this game as any other game.
<br>
<br>If you try to play with joystick it is much easier to do basic attacks, blocking, and so on but all except the most simple magic is ridiculous to cast with the stick.  You sometimes have to move the right stick to 20 consecutive positions (no joke!) to cast a single spell.  There is no way to customize the controls so that you can use both joystick and keyboard at the same time so that you could tap out on the keyboard to do the more complex spells.
<br>
<br>Much of the difficulty of the game is a result of the ridiculous control structure.  You will end up killing yourself and your party members plenty of times because of accidental attacks caused by trying to navigate the controls.  That&apos;s not all though, there is also a tendency to have things that can just instantly kill you that can be quite frustrating if you are playing solo.  You&apos;ll be fighting a guy and he launches you off a cliff killing you or you&apos;ll have to run up a narrow stairway in midair and if you make a joystick error you fall off and die.  You will get trapped in a corner and be unable to move resulting in you dying.  If you play multiplayer online this is not a problem since your teammate will just revive you, but solo you may have to repeat a long battle many times to survive and you&apos;ll need to reach the end of the level not just the next checkpoint to save your progress between sessions.  If you have difficulty a level may take over an hour as you repeat a battle over and over.
<br>
<br>Oh and one more thing... all the text is in English making this appear as an English game but the voice work in the game appears to be in a foreign language (German or Swedish maybe?) or something like that with English subtitles.
<br>
<br>The game is buggy.  When I hosted multiplayer a few times when I started the game the music started but the screen stayed totally black and I had to shut down the game.  When I tried to modify the joystick controls the game crashed at least 7 times before I finally got it to work.  Ultimately I was able to play though and it was enjoyable though clunky to control.  There is a good deal of humor in the game.   Some is related to references to games, movies, etc that younger audiences might not recognize, but it does add charm to the game.
<br>
<br>I bought the game on sale for $3 and its certainly worth that for a few hours of unique entertainment, but don&apos;t expect the greatest game you have ever played.  Its not here.  I&apos;d recommend other games action RPGs like Titan&apos;s Quest, Diablo II, Torchlight, or Dungeon Siege before this one, but this one can still be enjoyable for awhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1691271">Expand</a></span>

This game is so much fun!<br><br>The way you create your magic is awesome, the battles are challenging, the humour is great and the amount and quality of spells you have is actually quite impressive.<br><br>Even if you only have a slight interest in this, I would definitely recommend getting the complete pack.<br>I was sitting on the fence about it and wondering if I would like the game. I am very glad I went ahead and bought it.

And is now implemented in a realistic strategy like game where you have to combine elements in order to cast your spell. This offers space to experiment, but sadly causes frustration when you&apos;re in a tight spot or suddenly die. For $10 dollars you get an overall decent game, but not something you would play for hours on end.</span>

If you&apos;re buying this it&apos;s basically a gamble if it will run properly on your system. You might try the demo, but often demos are not technically exactly like the game, so I don&apos;t know if the demo running ok would guarantee the game running alright. Personally I just upgraded my system, have an i5 2500K with 8 GB ram freshly installed windows 7 with all newest drivers and with a 5770 videocard. Framerates at native 1920x1200 started out at 40, then tried to lower the res to 1680x1050, framerate went down to 30?! (all in the same starting classroom where nothing happens)... restarted the game, still at 30, go back to 1920x1200, now the framerate hops up and down between 40 and 12 (the game forces vsync on which is why the framerates are so exact). Before I upgraded my system I tried this game and had similar problems but I did get it to be somewhat stable at 30-40 fps, which should be playable although I would still resent the game for giving me suboptimal framerates on a fast system while it&apos;s really not doing anything taxing graphics wise, not even close, but despite framerates staying ok the game would stutter randomly. Now, maybe for some people they can look past this, or maybe other people just don&apos;t have these problems, but for me it just kills any enjoyment which is a shame because the start of the game at least promises a challenging and very funny experience (although that speech from Vlad gets REALLY boring after hearing it 20 times, that&apos;s right, you can&apos;t save within a level and if you try to change graphics settings while in game it just goes to hell so you have to restart every time and listen to the intro EVERY TIME you want to check if your changes fixed anything... ARGH!!). I&apos;m just going to let this game lay in my steam list for half a year or so and then come back and see if they fixed it yet. Since the game has been out for like half a year already though, I&apos;m not holding my breath. Oh, and no, switching to windowed does nothing for me, it stays crap despite having pretty damn awesome hardware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1722504">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are definitely not the best, or the better ones, for this era, but the game play is unique and innovative. You&apos;ll need to use your left hand (only the left) to come up with spell combination, and your right to cast, move around or to poke the monsters with whatever weapon you are holding on to. It feels like the time when you&apos;ve first learnt how to type, trying to go as fast and as furious as you can with your fingers. Simply put, you&apos;ll think that it&apos;s cool. However, after 5 hours of gameplay, you&apos;ll think otherwise. Ever heard of the nintendo thumbs? This is much worse than that. 5 hours of left-hand-spell-spamming, your hand will ache so muc h that you won&apos;t be able to play your piano or guitar for one whole week. Worse still, it&apos;s the same thing from the start to the end. All you really need is a few spells and you can clear all 12 chapters within 3 to 4 hours solo. It&apos;s repetitive, and worse still, its buggy. For 10 bucks, it seems fine, but definitely not a contender for something that&apos;s worth more than a day of your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka/user-reviews?user_review_id=1685649">Expand</a></span>
