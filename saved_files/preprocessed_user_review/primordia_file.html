<br>I was tempted to write a super long-winded and poetic review for this game, but I&apos;d rather just go play it again (for me that&apos;s the sign of adventure greats).  For the third time.
<br>
<br>Commentary is well worth activating on the second playthrough, it offers a lot of insight into what they were aiming for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816441">Expand</a></span>

I felt all the soul put by developers into the game. Also I loved the references to my both all-time favorite games - Fallout (the whole post-apocalyptic setting and Easter Eggs about water chip and G.E.C.K.) and Planescape Torment (Horatio and Crispin are like the Nameless One and Morte, besides Horatio is mentioned to have a number of previous &quot;lives&quot; and some NPCs remember him - just like the Nameless One). The puzzles are mostly logical (some I felt illogical - probably I&apos;m just an average quest-gamer: I&apos;ve only played a couple of quests long ago).  So thanks to Wormwood Studios for this game!

You have this rusting and decaying world in the colours of rusting metals and flickering lights here and there. Exactly what I expected from the teaser images I saw before purchasing the game. The purposefully crude graphics are wonderful and I fell in love with them even though I usually prefer HD graphics in games. I also liked the voice acting (except the acting on one minor character) and how the actor&apos;s voices fit the visual presentations of the characters.
<br>The puzzles were of satisfactory difficulty. Some were plain easy while others made me stuck for an hour or so. The usual method of trying every item you possess on every object on every screen works in most cases. I was surprised to also find quite a few puzzles that didn&apos;t rely on items in the game but on the player&apos;s knowledge and attention to the displayed events and texts. The point-and-click method of controlling the game worked well. I didn&apos;t spot any glitches or bugs.
<br>I saw a review stating that the story isn&apos;t fully told in this game but I disagree with this. The backgrounds for all the major players are clarified and told as are the events that have transpired and will transpire in the future. Finding out these stories is in most cases optional or depends on succeeding on puzzles in which you are given a few tries only (you can always save+load though so it&apos;s in the players hands if he wants to play to the end even after failing in an optional puzzle).
<br>I bought the game for five euros so considering that I spent about fifteen hours playing it the deal was good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188761">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of the best adventure games in recent memory! The gameplay is akin to classic adventure games and as such is nothing you haven&apos;t seen (gather items/try them on everything that you see), however the atmosphere is also akin to classic adventure games and that&apos;s something I&apos;ve been missing dearly as of late. Please note that the game is not entirely linear and there are a few instances in the game that could be solved in different ways. There are also quite a few possible ending depending on where the player would wish to stand on the subject discussed in the game. There are also achievements rewarded for finding clever solutions to some of the puzzle (which as I mentioned could sometimes be solved in more than one way).
<br>
<br>Although the game has an entirely different setting (and a darker overtone) I would like to compare it to  the Monkey Island 1 and 2 in terms of how consistent and captivating its overall theme. atmosphere and dialog is. Hooray for the classic adventure genre not being dead! (I&apos;m sick of hidden object and mass production detective pseudo-games)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2852064">Expand</a></span>

The tale follows robot Horatio and his floating companion Crispin as they try to retrieve a power core stolen from them by a boxy robot with lasers in a post-apocalyptic style world  however, the story is much more than this basic premise. One of the central questions the player wants answered is what exactly happened to the humans who presumably once inhabited this Earth and created the robots left behind. Added to this is a tapestry of moral and philosopical themes such as the meaning and existence of free will, individuality, progress, and what constitutes the &apos;greater good&apos;. These sometimes rather heavy themes are pulled off through excellent writing, and are offset by a quirky humour that runs through the whole game. This off-beat humour and occasional breaking of the fourth wall are reminiscent of some of my favourite, genuinely old-school games such as Simon the Sorcerer, and I think anyone who was playing this kind of thing in the early 90&apos;s will appreciate it. The worldbuilding and background detail is fantastic  my one gripe is that the game just doesn&apos;t go far enough. There are hints of exciting other locations that we don&apos;t get to visit, and the larger philosophical themes are never fully explored. As this is a game and not just a visual novel, I should probably mention a bit about the gameplay  it&apos;s pretty much standard of point  click games, and uses the traditional inventory system. Nothing stood out as unique, but equally nothing was inconvenient or jarring. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, and there&apos;s plenty of hints on hand from Crispin if one chooses to press him for them (it&apos;s also pretty fun to hear him getting annoyed and snarky when you try and use him too many times). I prefer simpler puzzles so the flow of the story doesn&apos;t stall, but others might find this game too easy. In terms of visuals, the pixel art is gorgeous, and the colour palette of browns, rusts and muted golds perfectly realizes the dusty, disued world. The audio content is also great, from the music to the voice acting. Even minor characters are voiced, and the robot voice effects are pretty cool.
<br>
<br>Overall an 8/10 for this game. The presentation is beautiful both visually and aurally, and beneath this is a solid story rooted in a world that feels like it really could be our future. Horatio and Crispin are likeable and memorable characters to journey through this tale with, and their easy banter creates the emotional anchor to this crumbling planet. Points are lost for the sense that the game could have been bigger both in terms of the number of locations, and the philosophical ideas that never seem to be explored quite as far as you hope. Regardless, &apos;Primordia&apos; is highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2978614">Expand</a></span>

The story is solid, the dialogues are both intelligent and witty and never feel enforced. Horatio and Crispin are the best voiced 2D adventure couple since Sam and Max hit the road and there are plenty of lines of dialogue to enjoy. But all the characters look and sound great, and so do the surroundings. There is no need for high resolution as long as one takes great care in details and animation, and this is the case with Primordia. This game feels like the 90&apos;s and to me that is a good thing.
<br>Its only weaknes is its rather short length, it&apos;s easily solved under 6 hours. The puzzles are fun but don&apos;t require extreme amounts of intelligence. Most of them just make sense and are easily figured out. Personally I don&apos;t mind that that much to be honest. Primordia has been a great experience to me, and I&apos;ll be playing it again in a while to check out the other endings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3259495">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has all the nostalgia of going back to the Lucasarts and Sierra golden age. (but the game it reminded me of most is actually an immensely obscure Atari ST point-and-click game called &quot;The Grail&quot;, due to both games having a combination of a religious protagonist and irreverent sidekick in an alternative fantasy setting)... it&apos;s basically the game that the games that The Secret of Monkey Island was making fun of were trying to be... arriving twenty years too late, after everyone has grown up and had kids.
<br>
<br>The story is tightly written and lovingly realised, it sticks to the simple idea of a robot worshipping humans in a world where all the humans have probably died out, and embellishes it to the nth degree, with great success. Other recent games have also told this story, but not quite so well.
<br>
<br>The highlight of the game is the voice-acting by a robot called &quot;Ever-Faithful Leobuilt&quot;. He only says about ten lines but they will make you sit up and listen. The actor deserves an award for it.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are also very tight  as with all old-school point and clicks there are a couple that are just too &apos;lateral&apos; for probably anyone to work out without looking up the answers, and one that involved two crucial items being hidden in a five-pixel-by-five-pixel box on a screen you&apos;d never have any reason to backtrack to... but the overall logic and difficulty of them is like &quot;Machinarium&quot; (another game it has a lot in common with). The items you carry round in the inventory are genuinely useful  which helps give it realism  and none of the item combinations are surreal.
<br>
<br>Most of the combinations produce some sort of reaction or quip from the main character or the sidekick, which keeps it entertaining  this is a huge achievement to pull off in a game like this, writing something and acting it for nearly every possible thing a blowtorch could be used on.
<br>
<br>The story is a tad predictable  but only because other games have told it less neatly. There is a ton of stuff that gets mentioned in passing but which the main character never sees because it is only tangentially relevant to him.
<br>
<br>The story is also a bit short and there are only about 10-20 locations in the game  but it really only needs that many, and any more would have been unnecessary padding.
<br>
<br>This is a delicately crafted work of art  and only a handful of these games ever reached this quality  and you can&apos;t see that by reading a review, so go buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465824">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the world turned wasteland thing is played out more than zombie clones; yet this title manages
<br>to make you *care* about the characters, something I can&apos;t seem to do with games like Walking Dead and
<br>Star Wars No.70000 for example.  It&apos;s more than  just the interaction of the protagonist and sidekick. It is the deadpan humor with perfect timing when you try out new solutions to a puzzle.    But I give it a nine overall for the lack of attention spent on the graphics customization. Even with the setup.exe  set to max out all features it manages to look worse than 320 by 400 resolution. And would it have killed them to give you these options in game via the options menu?    It is rare that a game comes along that can keep my attention and imagination  for as Primordia has.
<br>Buy it if you like games like these, but don&apos;t if you think Modern Warfare is the best thing since sliced bread.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2820840">Expand</a></span>

Beautifully crafted game, with gorgeous artwork and good puzzles (a couple are really hard!), great atmosphere and soundtrack. Above all, the main characters made this game really worth playing. Fans of Fallout and Planescape: Torment will find some thematic similarities.

<br>
<br>The story revolves around Horatio and Crispin, two robots who live in a wrecked ship. Horatio is a believer in Humanism, that humans are the creators, which is a frowned upon idea in the world the live in. They live far away from the city, isolated, until their power supply is stolen and they are forced to go to Metropol. As they search they discover the corrupt system that the city is operating under and Horatio&apos;s past.
<br>
<br>The characters themselves were enough to keep me playing. I enjoyed each one&apos;s own personality, their dialog, their story, it was all well done. The art style very well sets the tone for Primordia and was pleasing to look at while playing. The story was actually surprisingly well done and with multiple endings it just increases the replay value as well as my interests. It was challenging enough to where I felt incredibly accomplished once I finished it, but easy enough to where I didn&apos;t rage quite and ignore it for days. I was easily absorbed into Primordia&apos;s world and it&apos;s certainly a game I will replay more than once (and already have).
<br>
<br>Overall, worth the money and the time if you enjoy this genre. A must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3891892">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t tell you everything, but will let you figure out things about the world yourself. I&apos;ve read other reviews stating that the story in never told which is nothing but nonsense. This game will tell you a story about a series of well defined characters but will leave large parts of the world unexplained but with enough hints to give you a good ground to figure the rest out your self. This is not a weakness but a strength. Leaving mysteries makes a world grow and leaves place for the player&apos;s imagination.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=5276167">Expand</a></span>

You can solve some puzzles in more than one way and some choices will effect the rest of the game. Not every choice that gets you further is the best choice. Then there&apos;s the great atmosphere and the wonderful music! After all Primordia is one of my top three adventures back in 2012.</span>

He can be a faithful warrior that defeats the evil progressive mind and unites the robots, or he can fail. In the game, the robots live under a totalitarian secularist regime, where the belief that the machines were created by a mysterious being called Man is forbidden. His faith in Man keeps the protagonist alive. It is a very interesting twist for the cyberpunk genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=5615295">Expand</a></span>

They managed to create an interesting world supported by a solid story and great cast, if you&apos;re into old-school point&amp;click adventure games, this one is definitely worth your time! The length isn&apos;t that bad either, it took me a little over 8 hours to finish it according to steam.</span>

Primordia takes place in scifi world where humans have vanished and left robots to live and build their own future. I wasn&apos;t fan of Wadjet eyes earlier games but for some reason I played through Primordia in two days. Puzzles can be reasoned and the plot proceeds quickly enough. The game is pretty &quot;short&quot; as it took only ~9 hours to complete but there&apos;s (in Steam version) achievements that might give this game some extra hours if that&apos;s your cup of tea. I give Primordia 8 out of 10 because even though it&apos;s a good little game it doesn&apos;t do anything new or better than other good point-&amp;-clicks. I also didn&apos;t like that I was unable to alter the options besides volume sliders and subtitles. Recommended for friends of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3194970">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t consistent, e.g. most exits are identified my mousing over, but some only if you move the character to the edge of the screen. E.g. there is a system of storing info useful for solving puzzles but some of the info stored is irrelevant and some vital info is not stored. E.g. to combine items in inventory you pick up A and mouse it over B - message telling you that&apos;s a dumb idea, but it turns out you need to pick up B and mouse it over A.

The game has an intriguing storyline, good characterizations, solid voice acting, excellent game play and puzzles that are challenging without being obtuse. The problem is that all of this leads up to an ending(s) that not only feels abrupt but is a limp as a soggy noodle. Honestly, when I was done I felt robbed not of my attention but of my time. This is especially so because the most obvious ending choice (simply refusing) leads to the lamest ending. When I was done I looked at a walkthrough and discovered there are seven(!) different possible endings. The game would have been far better off if it had just regulated itself to the one or two endings that were actually cool.
<br>
<br>There are other issues. The hint system doesn&apos;t work as well as one might hope, as it always seems to be two steps ahead or behind where the players activity is actually at. None of the choices in the game actually impact the outcome at all, rending the way your progress through the game moot..The graphics are, as is typical from this publisher, subpar.
<br>
<br>It is really unfortunate because I feel that this game is only a few steps away from greatness. Most of the game is well-done and engaging enough that I actually finished it. But when the player spends hours working through the game to be left with a pile of mush in their hands the disappointment lingers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primordia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3784617">Expand</a></span>
