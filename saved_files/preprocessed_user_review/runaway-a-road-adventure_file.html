<br>I don&apos;t understand why this game has so many maxed out reviews. The storyline is most average, characters annoying and shallow, gameplay is tedious and the puzzles illogical or plain stupid.
<br>I love point&amp;click games and that&apos;s why I gave it 5/10 but compared to, let&apos;s say, Syberia, it looks like a stream of bat&apos;s piss next to Niagara waterfall.
<br>Most appaling thing that just kicks you in the face is the lack of properly developed characters. It&apos;s just too quick - you move from foreplay straight to orgasm without any intercourse. For example: Halfway through the game the main character (I can&apos;t even remember his name) thinks his companion Gina is dead. And there is a WTF cutscene where he recalls all his memories about her. The problem is, those memories are from the last few days and not much really happened, while the cutscene blows it out of proportions trying to make it look like a great true love that will last forever in a sort of Titanic movie style. He barely knew her, there wasn&apos;t anything between them - she was actually treating him like a lawn mower while flashing her huge &apos;bewbs&apos; in front of his nerdy glasses. Why did he bother in the first place?
<br>Also the change from a book-lusting physicist to a coolest guy in the world is so one dimensional, so obvious, so unoriginal. The first symptom (obviously) of becoming a cool guy is loosing your glasses. That&apos;s right boys and girls, glasses make you look and act like a nerd.
<br>One strange thing - maybe it&apos;s just me but the game tries to be sexy. It&apos;s all about nice looking bodies, muscles, etc. It&apos;s nothing wrong but totally doesn&apos;t fit this kind of game. Or maybe just this game.
<br>The puzzles require you to pick up everything from the map (sometimes it is just one pixel to grab a thing and you can hardly see anything worth noticing) and combining a few things in the inventory. Sometimes you have to just guess what the author wanted to do (basketball and the dancing tranny), sometimes you have to cringe in your chair as you make bullets out of lipsticks...
<br>Eh...
<br>Buy this game if you must.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/runaway-a-road-adventure/user-reviews?user_review_id=4671592">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-The characters are uninteresting and the relationship between the two main characters is unrealistic. Basically in the beginning of the game your guy runs over a lady who is being hunted by the mafia and you must help her on her journey. What really bothers me is she always pulls the &quot;oh, so you&apos;re just going to leave me? Some guy you are&quot; routine and he should yell &quot;LADY, I DON&apos;T EVEN KNOW YOU!!&quot; but he never does. Why? Boobs. She has nice boobs. And sultry voice. Sultry yet annoying. Like a lady obviously trying to use the power of boobs to get what she wants. I hate her for being this type of person and I hate him for being stupid enough to go along with it. -Gameplay... is annoying. Being that this is a point and click adventure you have to pick up lots of things off the ground. However it&apos;s extremely hard to distinguish what is an option to picked up and what is merely the background. This makes you have to finely go over every screen with your mouse. I&apos;ve done this and still got stuck and had to refer to a walk-through. It turns out I missed an item I was supposed to pick up. This happens all the time! The logic to most of the puzzles....is sometimes far-fetched. Something I could get over if everything else didn&apos;t suck so much.
<br>-The lip syncing is terrible but that doesn&apos;t really bother me so much.
<br>
<br>Positives:
<br>-I&apos;ve heard people say they liked the soundtrack. I guess. Sure.
<br>-The graphic style is ok.
<br>-All the &quot;ethnic&quot; people are just stereotypes. Which is hilarious. For awhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/runaway-a-road-adventure/user-reviews?user_review_id=2889720">Expand</a></span>

It is a fun point-and-click game but with the recent &quot;advancements&quot; from the scene such as hotspot-highlight. I missed a lot of objects due to the lack of this feature and had to revert to a walkthrough. It doesn&apos;t run in windowed mode nor could I change the resolution (my monitor doesn&apos;t like 1024x768).</span>
