You can move your units before battle, but you need to get a skill to do it. Had the reviewers who argue this isn&apos;t possible played beyond the tutorial they would have learned this.<br>2. I do not have any graphical glitches whatsoever. It may be a driver issue for some, I&apos;m running a Radeon 6970 so it might be an nVidia issue or something who knows.<br><br>Okay so I really love this game. I think the graphics could be better and I think it&apos;s tough for the developers because so many people just want them to remake HOMM3. So for myself the really only issue I have with the game is no random maps and I&apos;d like to see an option for even higher quality graphics.<br><br>The new things they&apos;ve brought in are quite welcome. I&apos;m a huge fan of the massive skill tree. The previous option left you with random choices when you leveled up and you couldn&apos;t build the character you wanted. The tutorial shows you how to do just about everything so there&apos;s no need for confusion. The voice acting and music is good, and I also like the combat. So all in all a good game. I&apos;m really excited to try out the multiplayer. And just a friendly reminder to all the whiners giving this a 0: you can place your troops, but it&apos;s a skill that you get when you level up. Play more of the game before you review it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793429">Expand</a></span>

Plays like any other HOMM turn based game, dont let other people fool you by saying there is no strategy as the strategy is the exact same as the past HOMM games.

Graphics, animations story and combat are all optimal, UI &amp; level design are fine and there is a good balance between new stuff and legacy aspects of the MMH series.

How can you praise Dragon Age II that is clearly an insult to Bioware, and smear H6 in the same post? H6 has room for improvement - the GUI and especially the town screens obviously come to mind - but this game is true to the soul of the Heroes series, remarkable for its overall quality, and most of its innovations will probably become &quot;legacy&quot; features. I&apos;m giving it a 10 to balance the undeserved zeroes, but it certainly deserves between 8 and 9</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1792751">Expand</a></span>

Seriously I don&apos;t get it...<br><br>I have played Heroes VI for a couple of days now and I felt at first that there were no BIG changes but little by little I noticed subtle but smart moves from previous Heroes such as a new ability system, advanced classes, boss fights, persistent items from map to map, the Conflux online thing. The graphics and animations look really amazing but the game has still some bugs but It&apos;s usually the kind of game that gets patches. The story is actually pretty cool, the only downpart is the town screen, it&apos;s missing the visuals for all buildings... ahh yes, I&apos;m playing on hard mode and AI is making it a nice challenge. Anyway for any Heroes lovers and those who want to play the best turn-based strategy around, you can go for this one blindfolded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793227">Expand</a></span>

No choices between creatures, nothing new in adventure set of heroes abilities, lots of simplifications overall, pure might is useless as usual and so on.

Just 4 resources to manage and then Gold counts as a resource as well. I can&apos;t understand how people would give this game that compares a lot to Heroes V such a high score. Thinking hard of reinstalling Heroes 3 again. Another big disappointment is the battle screen. Made out of squares instead of hexes. That would have been the first thing to change from heroes five to six but they chose to just &apos;copy paste&apos; the battle field routine instead. The heroes skills I find very uninteresting, and no town screen made the game even go into a deeper negative score. I had much more fun with Disciples 3 then this clone of Heroes V.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1796548">Expand</a></span>

This is from someone who LOVED all other Heroes games. They also promised to fix many of these things from the beta but it still unplayable.

This is deceptive marketing and a shady business practice.</span>

<br>1) town count is too low for the sixth game of the series, it should be growing, not decreasing, to me 6+2 was the best option till now, but I would be happy for 8 towns on the original game, as well :D
<br>2) No racial abilities. I mean, what the hell? that is what basically made each town special aside from units!
<br>3) NO MAGIC GUILDS! WHYYYY? Could have just expanded the magic guilds so that more spells could be obtained, but now you have to lose an ability point to learn a spell. Does not make sence to me.
<br>4) A lot of small things that keep on bugging me through the game, like almost all units having magic defence. How can a simple squire have some sort of magic defence??? How can a  dragon have less speed than  simple melee units??? Why the hell you cant look around your town???
<br>5) ONLY FOUR RESOURCES!!!! an so on and so on. BUT:
<br>1) graphics are great, story is interesting, campaign is captivating,
<br>2) the huge skill tree is awesome  no randomness anymore),
<br>3) no bugs for me surprisingly, so I dont get what is the big fuzz about that one.
<br>4)great job creating Sanctuary, but still can be improved!!!
<br>5) The music is ok, does not bother me, keeps the mood, but could be improved.
<br>
<br>Overall, you can adapt to all the little minuses, and  just try to forget about what you dont like, because nothing is perfect and just enjoy the great Campaign and Multiplayer games!!!! Hopingly they will make a fusion of the HOMM5 and 6 taking the best from both games and making one with many cities to chose, many spells to be learnd at the Magic Guilds, great graphics, RACIAL ABILITIES, huger skill tree, more structural buildings to build, more heroes for each race, MORE towns and races, not less, MORE, and MOVING town screens and unit screens, and finally fix all the little bugs we have been complaining for a decade :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=3529234">Expand</a></span>

As many I didn&apos;t like the fact that the towns owned are presented as static pictures but aparantly that changed with the latest DLC.</span>

But be warned. This game is not for the faint of heart. I know what your thinking, &quot;A seven but the game is great?&quot; Well, even though the combat is fun, the interface works just fine, and the approach is decent, there are a few things that are wrong. First off anyone that gives this game a 10, your wrong. Right off the bat the story sucks, plane and simple. I dont care if this game is not about the story (I dont know what makes you think that its not, it is..) but its just not there. Bad voice acting, (even the bird sucks) and its all over the place. That being said, the heart of the game is in the strat. So most people dont flock to this game for the story, and its only cause they know there is not one.. People come to this game for the strategy, but! If you like to build up resources and troops this game is not for you! AS YOU TAKE YOUR TIME! THEY GROW AND GET STRONGER! So if your the, build up your base and troops kind of guy you will only hurt yourself and find out that doing so demands restarting. So! Graphics are pretty good. No complaint there. So.. Now the big debate.. THE DIFFICULTY!. I had trouble in the start... and middle... and end, but hey! You might be much better than me, but to tell the truth, I consider my self quite a strategist. I have played games like this all my life and and my first job (US Army Special Intelligence Operations) required me to go to schools where we did the same thing (seriously, like you have this many, he has that many, here is what your troops have and can do, now take turns on this map). So not only do I consider my self good at it, but im certified. Now it was not impossible, just more challanging than fun at certian points. You probably have experianced games where they are so challanging that the fun seems to excape it (N Gidan or how ever you spell it). So if your someone who does not like playing games on easy, but does not like being beat down on normal this is not the game for you, but like I said, its all about strategy and you might be a far greater player than me, so maybe a demo or watching some of the harder fights on youtube is in order. So all in all its a game that needs some tweeking, or maybe different settings. The lack of a good story makes the game feel more like, &quot;ON TO THE NEXT FIGHT FOR A REASON I COULD CARE LESS FOR SKIP SKIP SKIP SKIP&quot; when lets be honest.. Story should be the easy part of the game. How many writers are there on this planet looking for work? The game seems to have a really tough curve (this is diff for everyone). Pro&apos;s: Hard game (pro / con) Great turn base strategy, Good graphics, Cool units, Great design. Con: Hard game (pro / con) Story sucks, DRM (who thought this was a good idea???) And pretty much it. But impacts the game greatly. Could out wiegh the pros for a lot of players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=2316198">Expand</a></span>

<br>The first thing one can see, is the new visual style, that is more than welcome, having in memory a terrible, wowish HoMM5 I always quit after few hours because of. I mean, ghouls from 6 compared to zombies from 5? What sane person would choose Nival&apos;s abominaiton over that tasty piece of art design Heroes VI offers?
<br>Heroes VI is absolutely beautiful, with an every single element drawn/rendered into perfection that comes together with everything else, creating the stunning game world you don&apos;t really want to leave. Every single thing has its own unique character and in addition to a tasty soundtrack (that borrows from classic HoMM titles) and sounds assets there&apos;s really nothing to criticise.
<br>
<br>The core gameplay is fine, too. I know some people criticise ditching most of the resources. I was concerned about it too, but it&apos;s not a game breaking change. The resources are there to manage and force players to think strategically (what do I need to build, in what order and what should I conquer to make it all work) and since in Heroes VI you will almost never encounter having virtually endless resources (unless you play on the easiest settings of course, but that&apos;s how it works in previous games as well), it&apos;s tolerable. The resources serve their purpose. Same with the heroes progression. Yeah, HoMM 4&apos;s progression is still supreme, but VI&apos;s ain&apos;t bad as well. Your heroes still will vary a lot depending on what kind of character you want to have.
<br>Same with tactical combat which is way, way, way better than 5&apos;s. I think that tactical combat in VI&apos;s is th best in the whole series. To play against your friend is pure fun (the AI is - still - pretty bad).
<br>
<br>The campaigns are hit&apos;n&apos;miss with a terrible design choice of forcing player into rushing them through, since bosses tend to grow their armies into infinity. The campaign is simply not possible to finish on hard difficulty if you even try to waste one turn on secondary objective.
<br>
<br>But then you hit Conflux. Jesus. It makes you want to quit and kill yourself. It&apos;s so bad, it mostly kills all the joy from the game, with a terrible mechanic of your &quot;dynasty&quot;, dynasty weapons, heroes and treats. Jesus Christ, it&apos;s impossible to accurately describe the horror Conflux is.
<br>
<br>If they try to implement it in Heroes VII it really can kill the series definitely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=5273868">Expand</a></span>

I actually managed to kill Kirins with my Chakram Dancer in melee attack. When you achieve such thing in this type of game, well, it makes you quit. Why? Because there is no fun in it. I played Heroes for having the thrill of killing a mighty dragon with my hero and his army. Now, the only thing I have to do, is amass huge numbers of core creatures and its done. Lame. No story, no fantasy, no beauty of being a hero and saving your kingdom. If I wanted to play something like this, I would go for Age of Empires, they aim for that, and they do it good.

<br>This game might have scored a 9, if it weren&apos;t for a couple of issues.  I&apos;ve owned this game for about a week now, and this is the second night in a week that I&apos;ve been unable to connect to the Conflux servers (which give access to more content than is generally available).  While I can still play custom games, I can&apos;t continue on in my campaign--the only option I have is to start a separate, presumably offline-mode one.
<br>
<br>I understand that companies are interested in protecting their properties via online requirements--but if they should decide to do so, at the very least they should have their servers up on a regular basis so that you can -actually play the game-.
<br>
<br>Besides that, the game is fine.  I was skeptical at most of the changes, but I&apos;ve found some of my fears to be unfounded.  For instance, dropping down to four resources hasn&apos;t really bothered me as much as I thought it might...and having to take over forts/cities in order to control mines just changes the dynamic so that you&apos;ve got to focus on said properties--basically, it&apos;s harder to change ownership, but once you get it, it&apos;s harder to lose ownership as well.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m missing some of the vast variety of buildings, plus the ability to have heroes learn spells by visiting some of those buildings and cities as well.  I miss running heroes around and getting them uber-powerful.
<br>
<br>The storyline is old-hat fantasy stuff, with orcs that don&apos;t use connecting words, heroes that all have British accents and the like.  There&apos;s a handy little &quot;skip&quot; button that I like to use for the cut scenes, but unfortunately there&apos;s no way to automatically skip the little animation that plays when one of your stacks gets a critical hit.  Seeing it two or three times is fine--the fortieth time gets a little bit weary.

<br>On the positive side, the graphics are light-years beyond anything that they&apos;ve been before, the maps are huge, the sound is atmospheric, and beyond the ridiculous Conflux issues, I would argue that this is a suitable advancement of a series that has devoured as many hours of my life as any other.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=3906583">Expand</a></span>

The game offers good gameplay, UI, graphics and soundtrack. However, it makes the mistake of being overly focused on the campaign at the expense of custom games. Heroes 6 introduces a vast and completely unnecessary Dynasty system with tons of unlockable content, probably in an attempt to justify the terrible DRM. Unlockable content simply does not belong in a 4X strategy game. This is not CoD. Instead the developers should have focused on creating more custom maps, and perhaps a random map generator. Enemy AI is also quite poor and needs improvement. In conclusion I&apos;d like to add that the bugs have been mostly sorted out, and uplay, despite the bad rep, has gotten to the point where it&apos;s usable (I still hate it). Oh, and yes, they&apos;ve added castle view. If you&apos;re a fan of the series, or the genre, you will probably enjoy this latest entry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=2898301">Expand</a></span>

When you play and say &quot;just one more turn&quot;, that&apos;s remind me a good memories! That&apos;s what I need (for a heroes fun)!
<br>GRAPHICS 96/100 (in this genre)
<br>Graphics it&apos;s amazing, especially the adventure maps (of course in high setting). Some reviewer talking about graphics issue (zoom in, and not looks like Crysis - dude this is not FPS - different technology -and you don&apos;t play strategy in fps mode), or glitches (graphic driver problem or lowend PC settings)? I don&apos;t understand why. They have bad luck about hardware or driver (or system spam) I think. (UBI referred about bug fix - some people have black screen, or laptop issue - they will fixing). But this is not about game, these are technical problems, what they can fix (Look at Rage - what they got from PC users - on consoles no problem, no tantrums). From that view is not objective the critics. When you can play the game in long time, then you able to discover lot of fun-factor (20 hour not so long to discover every aspect of the game!), and beauty visual.
<br>Units and map visual are closer to the H3, and leave H5 cartoonish style. This create more serious feeling, and more familiar to the adult audience. (Don&apos;t forget H1 released 1995 - that children are parents now.)
<br>- When your hero walk over the bridge, and you see cascade seem to fall into the depths.
<br>- You move into the swamp and feels like in sleep hollow movie.
<br>- You don&apos;t wanna leave the dungeon because of beauty.
<br>What can I say :)
<br>In this game have lot of different battle area. Some very memorable and some just decent. Effects are nice, but some are very common. I wanted to see some (like in FinalFantasy) huge facedropper effect, or more creative stuff for magic. User interface is ok,  very clever and transparent. Icons are nice. BUT I miss the magic book! Scrolling! Of course TOWN SCREEN - what happened, and why? I want full screen town, with lot of detail - come on 2011! (There have rumor about townscreen fix in the future patch - I hope so)
<br>ANIMATIONS 99/100 (in this genre)
<br>I like the units animations. Very detailed, and full of life. There have new animation (which was not previously): defense, or critical hit.
<br>There have humor too. When your troop waiting so long, then start fun animation. :))
<br>On the adventure maps need some critter - create more life!
<br>CUTSCENES 80/100 (ingame - PC games)
<br>Compare to the other AAA hyped title, for example Deus Ex, it&apos;s much more decent and polished (especial lipsync). There are lot of them, and not the same at all. Nice touch to story telling, but not every aspect. (-20)
<br>MUSIC 100/100
<br>In the 25th anniversary we hear lot of familiar tunes from Might and Magic series. This make me chill, goose-skin, and brake up good memories :) Nice touch.
<br>VOICE AND SOUND (80/100)
<br>Voice acting (in this industry) are very decent. Some a bit over/under played, but the average are good. Sound nothing special, just fine. Maybe some missing (example: ship movement have no sound)
<br>GAMEPLAY 90/100
<br>Area control, new (not random) skill system, dynasty ability, new race are fresh and exciting. AI fast and sometimes more challenge. (This AI more complex than before.) Hard mode sometimes insane (Be careful: AI in this mode cheating with more resource and units!)
<br>Town upgrade, and unique buildings are fine (new game tactics for online). Market very clever and easy to use. (Full Townscreen usage more fun.)
<br>There have hotseat and online mode for living AI :) Duel is fun, just need more level, and opportunity to create unique army.
<br>TECHNICAL (85/100)
<br>In my machine this game are stable. Graphics smooth. I would like antialising. Save is very fast.
<br>Loading or closing the game sometimes a bit long (somthing online issue I think)
<br>Some dude show about incompetency:
<br>UNIT PLACING BEFORE BATTLE - Is it POSSIBLE, if you have a special skill for that!
<br>THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO VIEW YOUR NEW UNITS
<br>- Dude where are your eyes? On the Unit window there have a button to show your unit in close, and you can rotate. (OMG)
<br>THE CURSOR IS STILL FLICKERING FOR NO GOOD REASON
<br>- That&apos;s just on some configuration, how I saw on some forum. Of course this fix coming, as soon as possible, if you read UBI forum. BIG IMBALANCES IN THE GAME
<br>- That judge in a few hour play? Oh, and what Heroes was balanced in release? I remember H3 needed 3 addon/patch (year after year)  and still not so balanced.    I take 10 score, because some &quot;kid&quot; playing as troll and crash the normal count. These dude need to live in middle Africa or Afghanistan for a couple of year - or just playing enough to know the depth of the game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1795591">Expand</a></span>

I loved 3rd and 5th installment of this game, and I actually played the 4th game quite a bit as well. Mostly I&apos;ve been playing these in Hot Seat mode with friends. At first glance I wasn&apos;t too impressed with this 6th installment, but after spending a little more than 20 hours with the game I&apos;m starting to enjoy it more and more.
<br>
<br>There are some gameplay changes, most notably just one rare resource (Blood Crystal) and zones for resource control. But it all makes gameplay more smooth and in the end just makes the game more enjoyable. The visuals are very appealing and the game seems to be pretty well balanced between the different factions. I like the freedom of choice with the leveling system since it gives you more control over skills and spells, and this is actually one of the main reasons why I like the 6th installment so much.
<br>
<br>I would have wished for Sylvan or Academy (present in the 5th installment) instead of the Sanctuary faction - but I think it&apos;s great that they are trying out some new ideas. And hopefully there will be two add-ons wich will bring some old beloved faction back into the 6th installment.
<br>
<br>The game suffers from some bugs, but nothing that can&apos;t be fixed and nothing too severe to put me off playing it. I&apos;ve experienced some crashes due to Conflux (the online Ubisoft profile), the server seems not to be all too stable and I have some troubles with my firewall since the game seems to run on different ports than the game itself (solution was to turn the firewall off). I do like the idea of unlocking game extras through the Conflux though.
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s a great game, and Hot Seat have been working flawlessly for me and my friend. If you liked the previous games you&apos;ll love this one!
<br>
<br>Pros: + Lots of fun + Choosing your own skills and spells when leveling + Gameplay changes help speed up the game
<br>
<br>Cons: - Connection problems with Conflux - Camera control occasionally bugs me</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1801169">Expand</a></span>

The music is pretty good and the campaigns are fun, they can be difficult but they are still fun. You can customize your own character in online mode, the ability tree is much better then the last games, you can choose what you want to select instead of getting 4 random spells to learn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=2262152">Expand</a></span>

HoMM VI has only few factions and only one creature choice against 5&apos;s two upgrade choices, cityview is bad even though improved after initial release, game demands a lot from your computer and I don&apos;t think the minimum specs are correct (I had recommended specs and there was awful lot of stuttering even with minimum graphical quality), HoMM 6 uses Uplay(or Udon&apos;t) which is the biggest demon alive, only added in order to control piracy and fails in that too. If you&apos;re a old HoMM fan coming back to the series, skip this title and buy 5 or play the good old ones. If you&apos;re new to the series, this leaves a foul taste in your mouth. Problem isn&apos;t that this game should&apos;ve been a remake of Homm 3, the problem is that this game just doesn&apos;t do justice for the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=3230883">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyways, what I don&apos;t understand is all the complaints on the town screen... okay, you can&apos;t play with sunbeams like in HoMM V (and I&apos;m sure almost every single one of us here did that at least a few times :D) but apart from that, you got an awesome interface to manage your troops and your castle/fortress/whatever. The bonus strategical options - like the territories, outposts, different handling of mines - made it more like a strategy game than an RPG - which was my main pain in HoMM V. :) So after ONLY playing the demo, I still loved it much more than the prequel, haters should play Strongold 3, I&apos;ll buy the full version in the very moment I&apos;ll have enough money for it :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1794478">Expand</a></span>

Many generations after us will hail this title as the crown of turn-based strategy gaming dethroning the infamous and undeserved monopolist Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 3 basically over night. Starting with the trimming of fat like unprecedented level of detail and interactivity contained within the town screens of its predecessors - which usually promoted nothing but unwarranted levels of immersion - going to the removal of the obscenely random Random Map Generators and the time-saving components as simultaneous turns in multiplayer responsible for the rush mentality in the turn-based strategy gaming community of today alongside useless chaff like faction diversity it is without doubt that what the user is being graced with is a cornerstone in game design and the new reference product for the Might and Magic series. One may only look in awe at the stunning and thrilling dialogue sequences packed into compact dialogue windows of unseen beauty or just be shaken with emotions as the protagonist characters invite the player into an epic story emblazoned with wooden yet heart-rending narration. While you band together with your friends online to go together or against each-other you will learn the virtues of patience as the game bestows upon you first-class, seamless and fluid-as-molasses hotseat play experience no matter the game mode you have signed up for. After you have witnessed first-hand the devotion and dedication poured into this game while enjoying the heart-pounding experience of the well-balanced and cleverly revised battle system turning every unit into a melee one then you know you are in for a deal of the most awesome kind. Bristling with innovations while retaining long-loved features such as the chasing of unshackled enemies all over the map this game has surely has tons of replay potential left yet to be unearthed. Finally tearing to shreds any kind of nostalgia felt towards in-franchise competitors nearing over a decade in age this leaves only one loving verdict: Ten points!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1794268">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fresh and great, balance i really dont know and dont really care too much(of course abit but not like in starcraft or something), the changes they have made have taken away any depth from the game. Sound... i wuuuuuve it. alot. I wuold recommend this game to many poeple and i am enjoying it thouraghlyand hope you do too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1796445">Expand</a></span>

No doubt they had their differences and some I enjoyed more than others but they were all enjoyable in their time. Having followed the development of H6 from the very beginning I was excited yet cautiously optimistic. Having seen the game evolve over 4 beta patches and the continuous improvements, most of which being fan suggestions I can say I am fairly optimistic about the course of the game. And having played the final release I am absolutely loving it! I will not refute the fact that the release was problematic and there were some serious issues such as the laptop black screen or flickering cursor along with plenty of ubi support mishaps. But I&apos;m rating the game and not ubi am I now? Thanfully I never did encounter any serious issues and having said that I have only enjoyed the game. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a game that much and seen that all the serious issues present in the beta were no longer present. In fact I only encountered 2 notable bugs with the rest being too minor for me to give them a second thought.<br><br>The game itself is smooth, fun and addictive. The missions are fairly long, with more content and dynamic objectives. The graphics are so beautiful and the music that accompanies them give this wonderful feeling of exploration that is utterly immersive. The new features are smoothly integrated into gameplay and eliminate micromanagement and pointless chores.  The AI is decent and keeps you on your toes. The storyline is intriguing and has some nice twists, it&apos;s no Shakespear but hey it&apos;s good for a game and I like the new focus on more personal stories. Combat is deeper than ever and there are plenty of unit / ability combinations with possibilities of synergy. And better yet units no longer fall like flies, that can only allow for more strategic battles that are not decided in a matter of few turns as was the case in H5.<br><br>Of course there are some bad parts too. The game could use some more balancing for one, there are still a number of bugs most of which minor, the skill system could use some faction-unique abilities for class differentiation, the town screens were windowed and I am not sure that reducing the amount of rare resources was the best of ideas. Also simultaneous turns and random map generator are missing but which heroes game started with them anyway? On the plus side both will be coming soon and quite possibly in a patch or asa free gift for the community. The screens will also return as a patch and pretty soon too. All in all it&apos;s not so bad as some people make it out to be.<br><br>As a conclusion I would say that the game is well worth trying, after all most of its issues are to be fixed. The map editor and a decent core game should keep it going strong until then. Of course it is entirely possible that you hate some of its features, it is hard to objectively rate such a game with so divided a fanbase. But I believe it is a worthy successor of the series and one that has the potential to surpass the rest sometime down in the future. Or at the very worst be the proud champion of its generation, I can live with that :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800755">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Factions are noticeably imbalanced
<br>- Game centers around stacking a massive number of creatures on one hero and &quot;Zerging&quot; around the map.
<br>- Game is repetitive and predictable, with minimal strategic and tactical though necessary. You spend most of the game running around killing neutral creep camps, and then teleporting back to a base to quickly destroy the enemy hero, and then resume killing neutral camps.
<br>- The AI is laughable.
<br>- &quot;Role-playing aspects&quot; are poorly implemented, though the concept was promising. Several hero abilities (e.g. Reinforcements) are absolutely necessary regardless of your build, most hero abilities are more or less negligible in impact, and basically &quot;useless&quot;
<br>- Game centers around ensuring that you take 0 losses per battle. There are multiple different version of the &quot;heal&quot; spell, all of which do the same thing - minimize losses. Again, this makes the game repetitive, predictable, boring, and ultimately, frustrating to play.
<br>
<br>Bugs:
<br>- Imperial griffon dive ability has no effect
<br>- Luck / Critical hits don&apos;t actually augment damage.
<br>- Dynasty weapons disappear
<br>- Loading a game makes it impossible to scroll your map using the mouse
<br>- Creature growth can become negative after the &quot;Week of the Plague&quot;. It becomes impossible to add to your army after this point. If you lack a saved game, you must restart the entire level.
<br>- I&apos;m a long time fan of the HMM franchise, and a game industry professional. This game should not have been released in this state - in fact, looking at the state of the game alone, this game could have, *should have* stayed in development for another 6 months to a year. The number of non-Sev 1 Pri 1-type bugs is staggering (Severity 1, Priority 1, any bug that is a &quot;showstopper&quot;). Sure, Ubisoft&apos;s dev house has likely cleared up their most glaring bugs, but the number of severely noticeable extraneous bugs makes it impossible to enjoy this game in more than the manner in which people watch a trainwreck as it occurs.
<br>
<br>However, I&apos;m a resilient person, a die hard fan of the series, and someone whose true passion in life is gaming. I could live with some of these bugs. The hero skills that don&apos;t work, the creature abilities that do nothing, being unable to scroll the map using the mouse after loading, even the campaign map triggers that fire improperly and make the entire level impossible to complete. But this Conflux connectivity requirement is the most poorly implemented online-single play functionality I&apos;ve seen. Look at Starcraft 2 as an example, in the future, of how you should design your PC campaigns to work with online functionality. All saved games should still be accessable without a net connection - especially if your own cloud servers are unreliable. This alone makes it clear to me, seeing as how Ubisoft only bothered to push Black Hole to do the minimum amount of work necesary to push this game out onto market, that this publisher really only cares about getting as much return from their investment as possible, even if they have to essentially scam their customers into buying a ****-poor excuse of a half-finished game. Rather than doing the honorable thing of taking at least a few months to polish up your product to please your customer base, you&apos;ve alienated long-time fans of this series.
<br>
<br>As things stand, I am never going to purchase another Ubisoft title again. I know people make threats like this and fail to follow through, but I promise that you will never see me buying another title with an Ubisoft logo anywhere near it. Furthermore, I am going to encourage my close friends and acquaintances to avoid purchasing Ubisoft products. Lastly, I am going to do my part to make sure that the Metacritic Score for this title truly reflects the quality and overall experience of this game. A score of 7/10 is simply too high.
<br>
<br>UBISOFT: Hopefully, you will learn from your mistakes. Hopefully, you will learn to treat legacy franchises like HMM with the same sense of devotion and respect that your customers hold for them. Your customers deserve nothing less than developers and publishers who have a passion for each and every title they release. And, in the event that such passion and devotion is lacking, you should learn to opt out. You have no business working to release a title where your only interest is to take a respected name, to sully it, to release a poor mockery of what it should be, and then jump ship with as money as you can grab before the boat sinks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1845392">Expand</a></span>

In the aspect of game play and strategy nothing has changed since HOMM V. It comes out to be a boring routine: You eliminate all of the neutral armies on the map, defend against the AI heroes who come along now and then and from time to time conquer an opponent town. Sound like many other round based strategy games, but:<br><br>1) there are hundreds of neutral armies on the map and instead of making the game more interesting it gets more boring because all the battles are the same and repeating. So its more &quot;working off the map&quot; instead.<br>2) the ai is absolutely predictable and non-challenging<br>3) the role-playing part has been implemented very poor. No matter if you choose &quot;blood&quot; or &quot;tears&quot; u still can choose the same skills<br>4) at the end you will always choose the same spells, because battling comes down to one goal: minimize losses (if at all). So you choose healing spells, spells that raise your armies (reinforcements or summon spells) and spells that will paralyze your foes (so u can heal)<br>5) not even the story line is very deep nor interesting. It looks like some small stories were tried to be hammered together to one big story. Also the german voices are sometimes a little bit childish.<br><br>Very annoying is the fact, that when you accelerate the battle, the sound is accelerated as well: at maximum speed you hear only beeping and cheeping. I read it in a review and i thought  &quot;well, it will not be so annoying&quot; but after playing some hours it does!<br><br>I am absolutely disappointed by this game and i regret having it bought! I have no clue, why it got so many good reviews by professional magazines and e-zines, i cannot recommend it at all!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1855320">Expand</a></span>

But for a heroes player it is full of innovation while keeping the good old heroes formula that has made the whole series one of the best in the genre. I would&apos;ve given it 10 if they had made a proper town screen, but apart from that, it almost feels like Heroes III.</span>

I am not an avid follower of the series as many here are. But, if you are like me and enjoy turn based games too, then I recommend this title because it is a decent game and you don&apos;t have to have played the previous ones to enjoy it. I am a testament to that.</span>

The enemy heroes are very computing and coward, but this is common in heroes games. The interface is a bit chaotic, but the square in combat mode are very disgusting? Why couldn&apos;t they make something nicer?</span>

Then I realized I could customize the difficulty and how much gold you start with. And then I started to notice a lot of things different to Heroes 5 and how I didn&apos;t miss any of them. It feels like a game made by fans of the game who have brainstormed a tonne of improvements and have put in the hard work to deliver a polished experience, with tonnes of customization, and well thought out balanced game play. Maybe not the best Heroes game for its time, but definitely an improvement and an evolution over the previous games. Really good job, Black Hole, keep making em like this, I don&apos;t know how anyone can not like this, big ups for a really good game!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=2237160">Expand</a></span>

While I&apos;ve also played them I&apos;d like to make a critic for someone who doesn&apos;t know what all of this is about and hasn&apos;t played the previous versions. Generally speaking this is a fantasy turn by turn strategy game where your goal is to build an army of different fantasy creatures/soldiers led by a powerful hero that increases your armys capacities and/or casts spells to improve your army&apos;s capacities or simply destroy your oponnent&apos;s creatures.<br>In order to build your army you must have a castle (you usually start with one) where you build the creature&apos;s dwellings. Of course to build the dwellings you need ressources, wood, ore, crystals and of course, gold. These ressources are gained by exloring the map with your hero and his army, defeating the armies that protect sawmills, ore and crystal mines. Improving your ressources income allowis you to make dwellings for more powerful creatures to beat more powerful armies, etc... Sometimes you can also find items to equip your heroes or places which give you different bonuses for the next fight or for the week.<br><br>Your hero can be customized by choosing different skills and reputation between blood(aggressive) or tears (defensive), you gain reputation by using according skills with your hero and by choices you can make on the map.<br><br>The music is  good, and the graphics are great. The game can be played in multiplayer either online on the same computer (hotseat), cooperatively or competitively. So far there is only 10 multiplayer maps but once the editor comes out (and it will) you can get an unlimited amount of maps to play with your friends or by yourself.<br><br>The game is young and has a few technical problems that should be solved very soon.<br><br>There are many tips and a big community that will be happy to help if you don&apos;t know what to do (you just have to look for it via your favourite search engine). There is also a fan manual you can find the same way and that gives absolutely all details about the mechanics of the game. So I think that the game is beginner friendly. Finally there&apos;s a demo than you can play to get a feel of the game.<br>All that beeing said:  I love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1801494">Expand</a></span>

And contrary to what many people said you can still continue to play even without internet connection, but you won&apos;t be able to level you account when doing so.<br><br>The other things weren&apos;t as bad as I though they would be. I do miss the townscreens. They added a lot of atmosphere I sincerely hope they bring them back with a future patch. But in the grand scheme of things they&apos;re not that big of an issue.<br><br>The Talent system actually turned out to be an excellent addition, as does the reintroduced seperation into might and magic heroes. The system is compelling, because it lets me choose the spells and skills I want and tailor my hero to suit my needs.<br>No more &quot;Navigation...again?!&quot;<br>They do need to tweak the balance however. Some talents are vastly superior to others. 25% Experience is a massive boost, whilst a defense bonus if a unit gets attacked three times in a row is more than underwhelming.<br><br>The same goes for the factions. Inferno and Necropolis are insanely powerful currently and Ubisoft/Black Hole need to tweak their racials so the supply of units stops at some point.<br><br>Balance in general is quite an issue currently, but I&apos;m quite sure those will get fixed. As long as that isn&apos;t the case however you may substract one or two points from my score.<br><br>All in all this is a good game. It&apos;s no heroes III, but it&apos;s entertaining and as soon as you made some training rounds to get into the new changes like the reduction of resources, you&apos;ll find a lot of fun.<br><br>Oh: To the one who said that Squares offer less tactical approaches than Hexagons: A Hexagon has 6 sides and squares offer 8, because you can also attack diagonally.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1801502">Expand</a></span>

Up to the current version of the game (1.2.1) and after almost 3 months since release, there are loads of bugs which shouldn&apos;t make it into a game that is published. Since Blackhole is busy fixing bugs, there is no hope for them working on balancing between factions. Also there is no balance between skills, which leads to &quot;perfect recipes&quot; that make the game boring. On top of this, the multiplayer part is almost non-existent at this stage because of several reasons: there is no possibility for playing user-made maps in multi, there is no random map generator, there are no simultaneous turns and the fans have been split on regional servers making impossible for members of multiplayer communities to play among each other if they are from different regions.<br><br>However there are some good points. Contrary to what other fans are saying I find the reduced resource system to be better from a multiplayer point of view. I also find the approach with shared creature pool among a player&apos;s castles to be beneficial since it&apos;s removing a great deal of the menial chaining of heroes.  The 3 tier creature system (core, elite, champion) also seems to make sense. The unit composition of the different races is very good compared to its predecessors. All in all, the cons are more important than the pros and thus until now I find the game too buggy and, sadly, too boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=2116825">Expand</a></span>

Graphically, performance, UI, customization I love it a little sad about the city screen but it will be there in a few patches. I would recommend this game for sure. Good Job Ubisoft!</span>

<br>
<br>For anyone who enjoys Heroes of Might and Magic type of games, I would recommend this to you. It&apos;s not revolutionary but it&apos;s a fun game. I also like the fact they force you to conquer forts to take over mines and lumbermills etc, makes it much less tedious than previous Heroes games when you had to constantly send your armies to take back all the mines and lumbermills that the AI stole from you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1795044">Expand</a></span>

<br>The bad stuff :
<br>- Lap top issues (got fixed within days by Ubisoft)
<br>- Only 5 factions, Cant say its slightly disappointing that there are only 5 but Ubisoft did a good job on creating a different experience for each one of the five....
<br>- Town screens, the biggest let down of the game, Ubisoft promised they will be changed within one of the patches
<br>- Map editor, people claim it is user friendly, not going to lie, I indeed havent spent more than 20 minutes on it, but the reason is because it didnt look that friendly to me....
<br>- Poor choice of creatures, as many have complained, it does look like they went a bit too far in order to make the game different than the previous versions, we all loved some of the mythical creatures and its a shame they were omitted, hopefully some of them will reappear in the expansions...
<br>- Somewhat lack of creativity with monsters as there are quite a few that look way too similar.
<br>- Bugs within the game, we got used to it in every new game but it still bugs us, Ubisoft is providing fast patches though which is a good thing.
<br>
<br>The good stuff :
<br>- Diversity between factions, each faction allows you to dig in while searching for the best suitable strategy, one must actually learn the skills and how to use them.
<br>- Graphics, when compared to the previous versions it is obviously improved and I am happy to see that monsters dont look cartoonish anymore.
<br>- Music is pretty damn good.
<br>- AI, seems to be improved as opposed to the previous ones, the game is indeed harder hence more enjoyable
<br>- End turn, As opposed to heroes 5 you no longer have the time to watch a movie while waiting for the AI to finish its move, huge relief for me personally.
<br>- New skill system, gives complete control over the hero wou wish to build
<br>- Tears/blood interesting addition, adds to the depth of the game
<br>- Boss fights, always good to have those
<br>- Objectives within combat (prevent your enemy from killing all of your goblins), nice touch.
<br>- Story, from what I have seen thus far even though it might seem a bit cliched it is a nice story after all.
<br>- Replayability, thus far seems good.
<br>- Achievements kept in your profile online, nice feat, you get to build your own profile and stash there your heroes and many other nice things I rather not spoil.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is a true gem for any strategy lover out there, it introduces new stuff while also keeping some of the old stuff which made Heroes series what it really is. If you are a fan of the serie, it&apos;s a must have, if you are newer to the game jump right into it and give it a try, if you dont like it then you wont like it but in case you do, you will be addicted for life.
<br>The game offers best of both worlds, you can either enjoy campaigns (5 of them, aprox 60-100 hours of gameplay depending on the difficulty and your skills of course), single maps or play with your friends at home (hotseats) or online.
<br>Is it better than heroes 3 ? Not thus far, but after all the expansions, patches and mods, sky is the limit, one thing is sure, it is already better than heroes 5 and quite enjoyable, I suggest you give it a try and be the judge yourselves....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1801075">Expand</a></span>

And it has nothing to do with the fact I loved Heroes 3 as most of the fans of this series. It&apos;s all about the bugs.<br><br>There are some gameplay changes that revolutionize the series - some of them seem like a great idea but still need some balancing work (skills tree and ability to build your character as you see fit), some of them were probably introduced by the developers to make their life easier (resource count decreased to 4 which will probably help with map design), some of them are plain brilliant (new Sanctuary faction).<br><br>The graphics are beautiful PROVIDED you get to turn on anti-aliasing which is not available without external mods/applications (you can get an unofficial patch for nVidia cards or override default settings or use Radeon card tools). Sound and music are OK although previous games offered more diverse tracks. Some of the music was copied but that may actually be an advantage - new Heroes sound Heroesy.<br><br>And now we come to the most annoying thing about this game (the second most annoying thing is aggressive DRM with limited access to the game features in single player campaign for offline players) - THE BUGS!!!<br><br>The game is so broken it doesn&apos;t work on some systems. There are game-breaking bugs like luck is not working at all, some units are not using their abilities properly, some quests cannot be completed, some items are disappearing. For the full list check the official game forum where the bugs thread has 60 pages or so.<br><br>The game publisher fails to communicate with the customers, there is no timescale for patch release therefore my final opinion on this game is largely affected by the fact that the game was released in early beta stage and the publisher tricked me to buying it.<br><br>The game has potential, when fixed it can be the greatest Heroes yet, however I strongly advise you to wait with purchasing it till the patch comes out or the game hits &quot;on sale&quot; shelves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1955216">Expand</a></span>

I was actually enjoying the storylines of the preceding HMM games, but in HMM6, while listening to these awfuly voiced and extremely stupid dialogues, all i can feel is embarassment.<br>Also, the game itself is very buggy yet, i believe they will fix all major bugs shortly, but prepare to reboot your PC often (i get consistent video driver crashes, despite having the latest one). Some bugs are kinda game-breaking and not related to technical issues (some triggers go off and you cannot launch them again, but they don&apos;t start game events that they should start) so you better save your game very often.<br>Uplay with it&apos;s absurdly long syncing times just adds insult to injury.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1797364">Expand</a></span>

The game takes a very bold step in attempting to innovate and reinvent the game. For most parts of it, they&apos;ve managed to get it right. Here are some of the things I liked and disliked about the game.
<br>
<br>+ Decent graphics that won&apos;t run circles around less established and Video Cards
<br>+ The Hero Skill Tree now allows users to customize their Heroes in so many different ways
<br>+ Ubisoft actually re-uses and re-masters some music tracks from the previous incarnations of HOMM (as old as HOMM 2). Nostalgic HOMM music fans will be in for a pleasant treat.
<br>+ In-game dialogue is generally well done. Some conversations are actually rather funny
<br>+ There&apos;s only now 4 resources - Gold, Wood, Ore and Crystal. This saves you the trouble of mindlessly hunting for the resources you desperately need while stocking up on the &quot;useless&quot; ones.
<br>+ Compelling storyline
<br>+ The CONFLUX allows players from all around the world to interact with each other by leaving tips and advice for each other at certain points of the game.
<br>
<br>- No town screen! That&apos;s right. It&apos;s kinda like a &quot;town window&quot; now.
<br>- If you start a game while connected to the CONFLUX, you won&apos;t be able to load its subsequent save games UNLESS you are logged in.
<br>- Disconnecting from the CONFLUX while in-game will automatically drag you (kicking and screaming) back to the main menu, regardless of what you&apos;re doing. So if you&apos;re on the battlefield and on verge of a very hard fought victory, and your internet connection drops, you are going to get. so. mad.
<br>- No Dungeon faction T_T
<br>
<br>That&apos;s my two-cents&apos; worth in a nutshell. To summarize: If you&apos;re an avid Heroes fan like myself, you won&apos;t do yourself wrong by buying this game. If you&apos;re new to the HOMM world and are looking for a decent TBS game to play, you might wanna wait it out for half a year for the price to drop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1798245">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Also if you played any Kings bounty in the past i would also recommend it due to its gorgeous graphics and gameplay a true heroes of might and magic game set your nostalgia away as heroes 3 will never come back but it lives on in this sequel i was very sceptical at first after the failure of homam 4 and 5...but after the beta and demo i was convinced this is the homam for the years to come and also most of its succes is to its hungarian studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800430">Expand</a></span>

Think of it as a scotch that needs to sit for 12 years. This game has the potential but needs a lot of work. Luckily with Skyrim, Batman, and SWToR out and soon to be out, I can wait out the game and not ruin my first time through experience. I like to play on hard, which is enhances my game play, was ruined by the imbalanced, repetitive builds, neutral battles and the AI is atrocious. The only folks that like this game is a small group of folks that probably have time invested in Beta and like doing the same thing over and over again.<br><br>I do hope that this game gets fixed. I believe they released an early beta version because the beta version right before release had less bugs. Its been over a month since release and not one word from Publisher speaks volumes. Are they working on the game? I dunno... i think they got their money and cut bait with a skeleton crew to fix a few bugs and string us a long. This is how I few a long with many other folks on the forums which is loaded with hate and discontent with a smattering of catering reviews. I just can see how someone can look a friend in the face and tell them to plop down $60 for a beta copy of this game. I would tell anyone listening that this game has potential... give it a few months when it will only cost $20 if not less, and read the forums. If they havent fixed the tech issues or loads of bugs, dont buy it unless your a long time fan of the series.<br><br>Very very disappointing that this prestigious title has been ravaged by shoddy work. The title, and more importantly the customers, deserve better treatment. If you dont think you can do the job, dont take it on. I find one aspect very telling... only one month after release, the first page of the forum is already showing signs of not turning over. Bad sign. I honestly cant wait to play the game when it is patched and maybe after an expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1939654">Expand</a></span>

Instead of developing a robust AI, they just have it cheat. Not just cheat, but cheat on a grand scale. Even on easy you get out-classed by the AI so fast it leaves only one strategy as a viable option. One viable strategy does not a strategy game make. Secondly, they tied a lot of the games better features to being able to connect to ubi online. Then they failed to have sufficient redundancy in their servers. Three times now in the first week of the games availability I have been unable to connect to Ubi&apos;s servers. The first time I did not know this hobbled the game and had to re-do the first two necro missions as as result. Also we seem to be heading backwards. The 3D rotatable camera is gone, the town screens are static and unimaginative, and having to waste skills gained by leveling up on spells is just plain wrong! We are down to one rare resource from four and then they have weeks with bonuses to resources that aren&apos;t there. As to this being more like HOMM III, if I want to play HOMM III I will play HOMM III. I do not want to shell out $50+ for a game I already have. New versions should be improvements on the last, not rehashes of whats been done already. And very poor re-hashes at that.<br><br>There is at least one area where Ubi has been consistent, and that is the utter lack of proper documentation. Given the fact the games release was delayed so MANY times the fact that the game is still this unfinished is inexcusable. If I thought for a second I could get my money back for this steaming pile of S**T I would. As i won&apos;t be able to the only thing I can do is not buy any Ubisoft games anymore. They have utterly ruined this fine series and the only thing we can hope for at this point is that this game falls so flat on its face that they sell it to another developer who will hopefully put it back on track!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1817267">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion they made some good steps that make it even better then the previous games. And i dont understand people who always says that heroes 3 were good and all orther games not any more. Just have fun. I give 10. Sorry for my bad English.</span>

I officially consider Heroes dead.<br><br>This game has changed everything great about the series, and has done nothing right. Even if we ignore the number of bugs that should, quite frankly, not even be present in the BETA of any game, the gameplay and design choices made here are dreadful.<br><br>The beloved town screens are gone. There are an unveliavable 5 races to choose from, the lowest number in the history of the series. The skill tree for the hero is nice, but giving every hero the same skills? That just leads to every hero always having the same ones, and others never being chosen.<br><br>The game punishes exploration and patience, and only one play-style will get you through against the cheating AI: Rushing. For those that play that way, that&apos;s great. Personally, I prefer to take it easy, build up my armies, and make sure I&apos;ve uncovered the land properly. my playstyle has always worked, getting me through every campaign and map I&apos;ve played since Heroes 3.<br><br>Somehow, the balance is completely off. You never have enough resources, building in your towns about half the time from the very first day, and then unable to recruit everything even in the second week.

It plays like an alpha stage game. The animations are choppy/blocky, the amount of bugs is ridiculous. The voice acting and cutscenes are awful, and the storyline un-engaging. The camera control is also horrendous. I have a hard time understanding how some people claim this game is more like the original classics Heroes II and III, as in my opinion it is far from them.<br><br>If all the problems were fixed, this would be an ok game with nice visuals but a poor campaign, fans of the original heroes series should be dissapointed with the new races as they are not keeping with the originals at all however.<br><br>As it is now, this game is a CHORE to play, the bugs, bad animation, poor acting/cutscenes make it thoroughly unenjoyable. What a dissapointment, and shame on UBI, who is perfectly capable of backing some great games and this should have been no exception.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085495">Expand</a></span>

It is not fair to compare the October-release versions (1.0/1.1/1.1.1) of Heroes 6 with advanced versions of Heroes 3 and 5 -- which benefited from years of patching &amp; expansion. As fans, we must have faith that the Black Hole Entertainment developers are working intense overtime hours to patch this game and to creatively make it evolve. For example, Town Screens will eventually replace the miniature Town Windows, and Simultaneous Turns will eventually be implemented -- if the fans have the patience &amp; zeal to support the Game.

I still remember when they launched the first game of the Heroes spin-off. So I think I know a little about this game to rate it, as it follows. Many people look to HOMM3 as being the masterpiece of the spin-off in such a way that nothing after that was worth. Well, it is partially true, but now we have a game that contests that conservative vision. When Ubisoft published HOMM4, I don&apos;t think it had assimilated the spirit of the game, so what we saw was a huge implementation of graphical aspects, in detriment to the gameplay the fans expected. But Ubisoft honored its tradition of being so attentive to detail and bought us HOMM5, that wasnt as good as HOMM3, but it was a improvement over HOMM4. And now, two versions later, a much experienced and respectful Ubisoft delivered this game, that mix both the gameplay of HOMM3 and gorgeous graphics, adding new features that actually contributes to the fun of the game. Everything is this game is meant to be big and it does deliver this sensation. I&apos;m in love. 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1802773">Expand</a></span>

It comes with surprisingly good campaign and some great skirmish maps. A random map generator will probably follow in the future so there is enough to keep one entertained for a long time.<br>It has some bugs atm, nothing game breaking (at least not for me personally) and some creatures,skills that needs to be balanced better in my opinion. Also a real town screen is missing atm but the devs have promised to add it in near future.<br>Cannot wait for the addons (with even more factions hopefully) that probably will come!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1802981">Expand</a></span>

The good:  The skill trees aren&apos;t random anymore! There&apos;s a LOT of options, lots of room for diversity.  Feels familiar to the other Heroes games, but basically all the main castles are reworked.  A lot of the races have ways to bring back fallen creatures with buildings in your towns.  The dynasty weapons are fun and useful.  It really grows on you as you play, are the plot and characters are well acted and carried out.  I particularly liked how the campaigns meshed together.  While I don&apos;t feel like the game has a ton of replay value, it will suck up quite a bit of time just going through the campaigns (70+ hours easy).<br><br>The Bad: The skill trees are so diverse it&apos;s hard to know where to go with them at first, and they don&apos;t really give you any ideas either.  Since you don&apos;t need more then 2 heroes, it&apos;s hard to justify playing very different throughout the different campaigns once you figure out what works and what doesn&apos;t.  The races that can&apos;t bring back their creatures with buildings are going to be seriously gimped in any multi player setting.  The leveling up of your profile is kinda interesting, though it gets &quot;really&quot; slow to level up after awhile, and the starting bonuses just doesn&apos;t seem to make that big of a difference until the super high levels which you won&apos;t ever reach even after beating all the campaigns.  I really miss having to worry about my back cities instead of being able to town portal whenever you need to go. I also miss having to mesh foreign troops and the penalties associated with doing so, of course you don&apos;t &quot;have&quot; to convert the cities, but why not, when the option to do so is there?  So, while I enjoyed the game, there were a lot of things they changed I just wasn&apos;t thrilled about</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=1839295">Expand</a></span>
