So I was quite looking forward to the release of New Vegas, and I must say that I wasn&apos;t disappointed. OK, there are quite a few bugs. This can cause major frustration at times; especially when the game decides to completely crash. Bugs aside, I really enjoyed this game. The Mojave wastes seem huge compared to the Capital wastes, with an abundance of familiar settings and a huge array of side quests. I was a little disappointed with the New Vegas Strip; I felt it could have been bigger with a lot more to see and do. A big plus is the companion wheel; this makes managing your companions much easier.<br><br>In summary, If you loved Fallout 3 then you&apos;ll love this game. I you didn&apos;t play Fallout 3 but are willing to work through this game&apos;s bugs, then I am sure that you&apos;ll learn to love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1456580">Expand</a></span>

Fallout 3 is a very different game from new vegas, except for the lovley pip boy and the VATS targeting system. In fallout 3, it is a broken ruin of a once superpower. Brought down by greed. Edging for survival. In new vegas, its far more oriented towards the rebirth of society. 2 hundred years after the bombs fell. People emerging, forming new empires. And they clash and cause chaos. I will admit that the bugs are a miserable thing to live with. (On the first few days of release) after the patches, its fine. Ive got a 9800 Nvidia GT. graphics card, and an amd anthlon 64 3500+ processor, with 3.5 gigabytes of DDR ONE ram, with 200 mghz speed. Windows 7, I get 45 FPS. (Horrible spec&apos;s, but if I can get that, you can too!) Anyway, the game is lovingly funny, just a drab landscape. Gameplay is relatively fun. The kiting just got on my nerves. Dozens of hours worth of playtime, I played fallout 3 for 300 hours, with all DLC. very fun. New vegas however, being a little smaller but with better gameplay mechanics balances out everything that fallout3 had flaws with. Except perhaps the drab environment. (What more can you expect? ITS A NUCLEAR WASTELAND) if you are one for RPG with a bit of time on your hands, I would reccomend this over fallout 3. Dont get me wrong, fallout 3 is also an amazing game, they are both very worth the money. The only thing that pisses me off is the invisible game walls!!!!!!! THEY BLOCK OFF HALF THE MAP. Oh well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1446032">Expand</a></span>

Upon first inspection, New Vegas appears to be a reskin of Fallout 3 set near the west coast.  However, Obsidian brings to the table the character, design elements, and moral ambiguity of the original two Fallout games to New Vegas, overhauling the game&apos;s mechanics to fall more in line with what we traditionally associate with Fallout:  You are imperfect, and you must use your personalized assets as best as you can to make it through.  Whereas Fallout 3 afforded you a &quot;Perk&quot; every level, New Vegas cuts that down to once every two levels, and generally gives you fewer opportunities to morph your character into an all-in-one death-god.  Also new to the game is the concept of &quot;Damage Threshold&quot; for armor, introducing a game mechanic which would require that you use heavier weapons for armored targets or face the risk of wasting rapid-fire ammo and meeting your death.
<br>
<br>Obsidian also included a &quot;Hardcore&quot; mode which seems more like the intended way of playing, rather than the optional feature that it&apos;s hyped up to be.  Much like your radiation meter, in Hardcore you now have Hunger, Thirst, and Sleep meters which slowly creep up while you quest through the Mojave Wasteland, necessitating that you sleep, eat, and drink at semi-regular intervals.  Crippled limbs are also much more of a hindrance in Hardcore mode, as they can only be healed by one of three routes: By paying a doctor, using a Doctor&apos;s Bag, or using &quot;Hydra&quot;, a drug that regenerates your limbs.
<br>
<br>Game mechanics aside, New Vegas is to Fallout 3 what Fallout 2 was to Fallout 1.  It builds and improves upon every aspect of it&apos;s predecessor, at the cost of building a game as large and intricate as a house of cards.  Because there are so many different questlines, so many different ways you can do things, it&apos;s likely that at some point, you will break the game.  The greatest criticism right now with New Vegas is that it has bugs.  Anyone who&apos;s played Fallout since the 90s knows, however, that bugs crawling out from under the series&apos; ambition has always plagued Fallout games.  Fallout 1 and 2 have had unofficial patches from the community, fixing bugs and adding content that was originally planned; Obsidian and Bethesda are obligated to patch the game after release, as bugs are found, but if they treat this game the way they did Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, you can expect to see a community patch in the future as well.
<br>
<br>However, despite release-day bugs, the game is solid, it&apos;s epic, and it will move you.  I&apos;m convinced that those who have rated this game below a 6 or 7 on the basis of &quot;bugs&quot; are harboring greater, older prejudices, and are looking for some justification to smear this game on the account of it not being a &quot;true sequel&quot; to the original two Fallout games. (ie, produced by Black Isle in the 2d isometric turn-based style)
<br>
<br>The soundtrack consists of sweeping ambient melodies as those found in Fallout 3, and also a brand new setlist of 50s era music, with a decidedly more &quot;western&quot; or &quot;Vegas&quot; feel (Sinatra, songs about cowboys, etc).  The graphics engine is still running on a modified GameBryo engine (the same that powered Oblivion and Fallout 3) but Obsidian has manipulated the engine to great effect in order to make the world more &quot;alive&quot;.  In the opening town, Goodsprings, you&apos;ll find tumbleweeds floating around and sand twisting in the wind.  As you travel from place to place, you find that atmosphere is much more diverse than Fallout 3&apos;s bleak rubble.
<br>
<br>The storyline is also much less contrived for you, allowing you to decide your allegiances just as you like, without feeling penned into a Good vs Evil storyline that mired Fallout 3.  No single faction is purely good; Expect to make some hard choices if you want to play morally.  Altogether, I&apos;m giving this game a 9, because it&apos;ll suck you in, keep you involved, and even when you beat it, you&apos;re going to want to start one new character after another to try every route that you couldn&apos;t take in your previous playthrough.  The only downsides are the bugs and the outdated graphics engine, but neither of those get noticeably in the way of the overall gameplay or storyline, which are the two big draws for this title.  If the game was properly polished (which is unimaginable for QA testers considering the overall breadth and depth of the game) it would deserve a perfect 10.
<br>
<br>As for New Vegas, the game is as much a sequel as it is a spinoff, but I think I&apos;m in love.  Ain&apos;t that a kick in the head?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1396385">Expand</a></span>

But literally a new mod is released by the hour since they only have to be ported over. Im already using over 10 mods just as longer days, smaller ui, centered raised camera, perk every level etc. Oh and if you get stuttering get the d3d9 file, and if you have ati get the alternative d3d9 file so you can still use transparency mutisampling. If it wasn&apos;t for the mods i would have to take off a point or 2.

However, if you&apos;re looking to play this game, then you&apos;ve probably played Fallout 3. If this is the case, the glitches with the game engine have not changed. Graphics look identical to Fallout 3 / Oblivion. The most agravating issue was the quicksave disappearing. I didn&apos;t realise it was an issue until, I got home from work to find that my first 2 hours (or more) were gone. Now I&apos;m so paranoid that I still do a full (esc, save, pick a slot, confirm to overwrite, OK) save before I quit a session. Quicksave seems OK while playing though. As for performance, I find it identical to Fallout 3 on a Phenom II 965 / 6 Gb DDR 3 / ATI 4890. I played FO 3 on Phenom 9950 / 4 Gb DDR 2 / Same video card. I suspect that my recent upgrade has no impact on the performance of this game. If it does, I&apos;ll edit this review when my son gets his copy, as he has inherited my old machine. (Well, the major guts of it anyway.)
<br>
<br>The gameplay is pretty much the same as FO 3 and I&apos;m sure that you&apos;ve read enough by now to know about the factions, and the companion aspects that have been introduced. So I won&apos;t bore you with that. I do find New Vegas to be a wee bit harder than FO 3. In one situation I had to restart a battle with some Legionaires about 6 times, before I came up with a way to get out of the location alive. (I hate to admit this, but I killed them and then ran away like a total wuss until I could fast travel to a safe spot. Just like the kid giving his playground bullies the finger from the safety of Mom&apos;s car.) I love the sound effect when a new quest becomes available, and the few side quests I&apos;ve completed are enjoyable. Now, that I&apos;m no longer worried about losing my game progress, I enjoy playing this game as much as FO3. I does sort of play like an expansion, but from what I see so far, there is alot to do here. If you liked Fallout 3 on the PC, then I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to pick up New Vegas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1395149">Expand</a></span>

<br>Positives: Obsidian does a MUCH better job of writing story lines and quests than Bethesda did. Good voice acting. New environment and (slight) movement forward in terms of the Fallout canon. Negatives: Its still Oblivion (LOLblivion) with guns. As others have posted, you think they would&apos;ve improved the game engine and graphics by now! The VATS system makes the game laughably easy and you can kite any enemy in the game. If you play the game without VATS, the NPCs dodge and weave like a weasel on crack all while maintaining pinpoint accuracy. Although the stories for each quest is better, the execution is still murky at best as one wrong dialogue choice cuts off entire quests. Certain quests are only offered under poorly designed circumstances with NPCs not reacting to successful completions or acting as if you DIDN&quot;T just save their whole city from bad guys. Final analysis: Rushed out to market before true completion in a manner typical of Bethesda. This is essentially DLC for Fallout 3 that they tried (and failed) to pass off as a stand alone game. Although the fan boys, &quot;independent reviewers&quot; and paid Bethesda employees will seek to skew these rating sites, the proof is in the lackluster sales and general negative, poor opinion of Bethesda.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394572">Expand</a></span>

Over 2 years ago, Fallout 3 was successful and profitable game. With Fallout: New Vegas, Bethesda decided to squeeze every last dollar out of the franchise by creating a game that should have been an expansion pack or downloadable content. The storyline is nearly identical to the previous game. The mechanics, combat, and interface have not changed. Even the graphics engine is the same one as Fallout 3. Bethesda did not even bother adding modern graphical effects with DirectX 10 or 11. The bugs are so incredibly obvious on the PC that anyone who was testing the game would have a list pages long after a couple hours of gameplay. This game should have been $19.99 as a downloadable expansion for Fallout 3. The PC version is clearly an afterthought, and it shows. New Vegas was written for a console, probably as a minor release, but at some point it was decided to make it a major, full priced release.
<br>
<br>But is it fun to play? Well, if you can get past the bugs, and perhaps after a few patches, then yes the game is enjoyable. If you liked Fallout 3, you&apos;ll like this game. But wait until it hits the bargain bin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394167">Expand</a></span>

I played the game completely through once; I completed the ending two different ways from one save point; I had added over two dozen mods when I finished playing. Total time playing: +100 hours. Total time getting my mods to work: +10 hours. Second,  the above should indicate that I have pushed the game to the breaking point - I ruined several save games - but kept coming back for more. Why? The game is that good. Playing with the amazing mods available for this game made it very engaging and compelling far beyond what the vanilla did. And the vanilla game was superb. Third, the game ran fine for me till I got over the dozen mod mark. In fact, most of my frustration with the mods came from one particular mod (New Vegas Bounties) that eventually corrupted save games after a certain objective had been accomplished. When it was me and the original game (first 40 hrs), I think the game crashed once. Once! That is a fairly stable game to me. Now I know that many people have had significant problems with the bugs in this game. I think Bethseda has smoothed those out for the most part. Bottom line: great game play, solid graphics, good plot, and a ton of replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1545295">Expand</a></span>

IMO the performance is subpar compared to other games with better graphics like the Crysis 2. You see slowdowns to 40fps and you do not know what causes it. Sometimes the terrain loading into memory is buggy. Overall doesn`t look very good, just ok.==============Gameplay is largely the same as in F3, but in F:NV has been enriched plenty. The crafting got a big boost. You can now make anything given if you have the right skills and ingredients. You can make many food, ammo, weapon,explosives, armor options. There has been a lot of weapons added, lots of them are very cool, with many available upgrades which actually change how they feel and play. Iron sight has been added, so the game crosshair is not needed anymore.There is so much of the stuff to gather that it is hard to grasp. The weapon and armor balance has been reworked, so now you can dispatch a heavily armored  opponent with AP ammo fairly easily, while HP ammo is to be used on animals. There are up to four variants of ammo for almost every weapon available which is very impressive and enriches the gameplay tenfold.=============STORY. It is cool, not much better from F3 but ok I guess. You can now choose a fraction to ally with, but you can go on with yourself freely if you choose to do so. It is up to you. You have a few of important story variants. The quests are mostly interesting, not only kill or talk. Ther are many interesting locations, with interesting logs to hear and read. IMO the mood of the game is still succesfully postnuclear. Summing it up, playing doesn`t get boring , there is much incentive to keep going, exploring. The combat system in this game is still shallow to be honest.============DLCs are well worth the price and time spent. It gets stale at times, but the story of each dlc progresses at the right moment to keep being interesting. IMO the Honest Hearts dlc is by far the worst one but still ok.===========MUSIC is the same as in Fallout 2 wih some new tunes. To be honest I liked the idea because people added old F2 tunes to the game by themselves anyway.The melodies never get old and pose a great addition to the story. However, the radio from Pipboy is inferior to this from F3. ======OVERALL verdict - upgraded Fallout 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2204088">Expand</a></span>

Why is FNV so good? It&apos;s because of Chris Avelone. Why is the writing in FNV engaging and unpretentious, yet able to achieve pathos? Chis Avelone. The team at Obsidian. Why do other recent Bethesda games have insultingly bad writing? Emil Pagliarulo, a man who thinks he&apos;s writing for a kids&apos; cartoon. I thought I would point that out to all those who keep lumping all these games in one bag just because of the Bethesda logo.
<br>
<br>As for FNV, I&apos;ll mention a few things. This game makes exquisite use of loot. Unlike some modern titles,  you really need your loot to keep your guns working and your armor in good shape. The result forces the player to keep trying out a variety of different weapons and strategies.
<br>
<br>There are a few downsides. First of all, never play any of the DLC on the first run. The DLC levels your character through the stratosphere and makes the rest of the game disappointingly easy. Like practically all open world games, FNV suffers from a difficulty &quot;hill&quot;. Once the hill has been passed almost everything is easy to the point of absurdity. The DLC will get you to that point faster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5756258">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ya well i&apos;d rather play an awesome game that is so involved it had a few bugs then a mediocr game that ran great.
<br>People say &quot; It more of Fallout 3&quot; like thats a bad thing.. ya it plays closely the same but the depth of the quests / land/ NPC&apos;s  you name it is all done really well.
If you liked 3  your gonna love this.

<br>Hats off to creators I&apos;ve been gaming since 82 and played the entire Fallout series and grown/changed with it and loved its progression all the way.  10/10 in my book.  But5 i dont whine and moan over a few patches being needed for a monster size game that has such a massive way for each player to progress through..  you could not have possibly Beta tested this and caught it all.  where i work we have a CND  &quot;cannot duplicate&quot; code for things we had never seen and could not repeat but other people could..  big deal..  you guys support your work and make corrections what the hell else are you suppose to do.   Thanks for making this KA game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600380">Expand</a></span>

A larger map, better combat and more weapons, and a huge array of quests and factions await you in Fallout: New Vegas. Anyone who enjoyed Fallout 3 should pick this game up now. The engine is starting to show its age though, which is the only thing keeping me from giving this a higher score.</span>

However I had far too much immersion fun and memorable moments to let the crashes and glitches affect my play. Some people ditch a game when it locks up on them a few times. They have every right to have that stance, however that&apos;s the price you pay. And it&apos;s a price that reduces the score from 10/10 to 9/10. So not that much of a price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2138007">Expand</a></span>

Given what engine they worked with they did great job. SPECIAL and perk system rebalanced, moral choices are no longer just black&amp;white but rather different shades of grey, writing is on higher level...etc. Many features I played first two games for are included as well as introducing some new, and unlike Fallout 3&apos;s added features they are not dumbing down the game. Game is still somehow limited given the engine and the fact that it&apos;s multiplatform.  Fallout New Vegas is something Fallout 3 should be.

The user interface is exactly the same and the basic features are still there, but the similarities end here. In this game you lose a bit of the post-apocalyptic feel and instead embark on a western scenario with a bit of old-world touch to it. Several new features are added, like the several craftable items, ammo types, companion interaction (which is a big part of this game), mini-games and faction system. There&apos;s the new Hardcore Mode too, on which you will feel a more realistic scenario, being subjected to thirst, starvation and sleep deprivation and some other changes making you more of a survivor and less of a killing machine.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the game is pretty straightforward, with no possibility to continue after the last battle, coupled with the lack of memorable landmarks, makes New Vegas a bit subpar for Fallout 3 fans. The plot could be a bit more ambitious too, with more emphasis on morally subjective quests and choices.
<br>
<br>PS: The DLCs are a must. Each one has a particular theme and new possibilities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2489169">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>New Vegas just feels like what &apos;Fallout 3&apos; was supposed to be, story and gameplay-wise.  The team that worked on it had developers that worked on the original series and the cancelled sequel code named &apos;Van Buren&apos; and contains story elements from it and the continuity of Fallout 2.  The story is set out in front of you, and it&apos;s entirely up to you how you want to carry it forward.  The gameplay mechanics from F3 carry over with some small and large tweaks, and some of them are made obsolete by new systems.
<br>
<br>After the &apos;vanilla&apos; game is starting to get stale, there are countless modifications players have made to make gameplay or visual changes or completely overhaul the game to make a &apos;call of duty&apos; style shooter, or a RTS style field commander game, or even a fully loaded casino simulator.  If you are a shooter or rpg fan make sure you pick this up, you can find it on steam for as low as $5, so keep an eye out.
<br>
<br>To recap, it&apos;s not perfect, but it is a lot of fun.  Do yourself a favor and get lost in the wasteland.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4557329">Expand</a></span>

Even though it suffered from a rushed development cycle, aged assets taken from it&apos;s predecessor Fallout 3, and the usual flurry of bugs/glitches on release; it has aged into an amazing game with proper, interesting DLC. The story is wonderfully gray and open to match this large, open world. You don&apos;t feel like a black and white hero/villain simply following a bread crumb trail. As much as I loved Fallout 3, this is what the original Fallout creators wanted to see happen to the IP.
<br>
<br>PS: Even though this game is still bringing money into Bethesda&apos;s pockets 5 years later, Obsidian was denied a bonus because of the initial review scores posted on this website. They needed to score an 85 on here and scored an 84. If every reviewer did an ultimate edition review it would almost certainly break 85 or even 90 metascore. Obsidian developers, and those laid off after the project, should get compensation. If this industry wasn&apos;t so ass backwards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5195211">Expand</a></span>

The story may have been a bit bumpy, but the game play, soundtrack, and atmosphere make up for that big time. This is currently not only my favorite game of the previous generation, but second favorite of all time.</span>

If/when they patch it properly probably a true score would be 9.  Anyway, what can I say? more Fallout 3 but improved with Hardcore mode (the only way to play) and a Western theme.  Despite my frustrations inside, love it.  Also wish creatures would not respawn all the time (even mods didn&apos;t seem to stop it).  Oh and get the RACE mod and the song packs - Bethesda&apos;s radio was a cute idea (again) but they need the 1-200 extra songs modders put in for them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1467470">Expand</a></span>

Fallout: New Vegas is essentially more of the same, so those flaws I previous overlooked are now more glaring.  The main annoyance I encounter is with the in-game companions who seem to get stuck on the most minor map obstacles and chase the enemy even when you ask them to stay put.  If you never tried Fallout 3, then get this one, if you did not like Fallout 3, you will likely not like this game.  On the pro side, there is a great story, expansive and open areas to explore, new settings and life forms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1442386">Expand</a></span>

The new lands to explore (And conquer for some of us) are a fresh start, though the mostly vault-less land feels a little different than your usual Fallout romp. Still crossing the wastes of Nevada and fighting everything from Powder Gangers to Giant Rad Scorpions to Deathclaws is a blast. The story you follow of the errand boy of Nevada gone wrong is intriguing and leads you through some interesting areas to learn of what happened, and exact revenge on someone who wronged you.  The DLC that has come out for the game has been pretty fun. I have the GOTY edition from Steam with all the DLC packs and I&apos;ve gotta say Old World Blues was a helluva good time. The writing in that DLC pack more than makes up for any frustrating pieces. I love the Fallout Universe and it&apos;s always fun to go back and pick it up again and play things out in a different way or order than you did before. Great fun :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2243574">Expand</a></span>

<br>I strongly recommend buying this one... especially at the low steam price. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5207995">Expand</a></span>

The plot is great, the lore is deep and interesting, the characters are a lot of fun, the atmosphere is incredible, the sheer amount of possible endings is mind boggling, it doesn&apos;t take itself TOO seriously, and it features the voice acting talents of Dave Foley in a major role. All in all, it&apos;s a great game that I&apos;d put in a Best of All Time list for sure, and I think it&apos;d be just about perfect if they would fix the bugs I encountered. Just make sure you have a lot of time you can spend on this one, it took me nearly 72 hours to get through it, and I didn&apos;t even 100% it.

I&apos;ve spent many hours of my life paying this game (lol), but for those who haven&apos;t played it yet I&apos;ll do my best to introduce it in a concise manner. Before you play it though, I strongly recommend playing through Fallout 3 first. There is a learning curve to F:NV even after playing Fallout 3 and its DLCs in their entirety. New Vegas adds many new gameplay elements, such as the Companion Wheel (makes it easier to interact with Followers), &quot;iron sights&quot; for aiming weapons, more organized factions and the Reputation system (represents the player&apos;s relationship with factions in the game), reloading benches (for crafting ammo), a **** of new weapons, a reorganization of Skill types (Big Guns skill is dropped, Survival skill, which affects food and clothing recipes and their benefits, is introduced), and Skill level requirements for weapons. Like the post-apocalypse Washington D.C. area in Fallout 3, there are real-world locations in the Nevada/Mojave region. My overall suggestion for this game: Play it, but make sure you&apos;ve played through Fallout 3 first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2286256">Expand</a></span>

And I know that Fallout New Vegas was really hardcore and realistic but this game is meant for serious players and Fallout 3 is meant for normal and casual gamers, this game&apos;s variety of factions, quests, wars, battles, maps, weapons, armour and companions just made this game perfect except for one thing, hardcore mode. The reason I can&apos;t rate this game 10 is because of hardore mode, sure you don&apos;t have to play it in hardcore mode (yet there is a achievement or trophy for beating the game on it) but playing hardcore mode is ridiculous where dehydration and starving is a problem yet almost everything will give you radiation poisoning, ammo counts as weight which is stupid, armor and weapons break down faster which is a recreation of Dead Island, etc. But this game is definitly a top 10 in my list for being a very cool realistic game where if you&apos;re bored with funny games, put this game in your pc or xbox or ps3 and get ready to actually die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2317458">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve never really bought other RPG games for PC but this completely wowed me. This game is so fun and you will just lose track of time in the real world. The only real problem i have is the bugs in the game which really take away from the whole experience.</span>

<br>Lots of atmosphere.
<br>It is has a better crafting system then fallout 3 and is darker.
<br>There are no real good guys.
<br>Because war, war never changes.
<br>Great writing although some of the dialogue has to much exposition.</span>

You step into the shoes of a courier, who was making a delivery to a mysterious figure in Las Vegas before being robbed and shot in the head by a man named Benny. You, luckily, are saved by a robot who is under the control of the head of Las Vegas (Now known as New Vegas). He brings you to a small town were he lives, and has the doctor there patch you up. After assigning S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points and picking tagged skills/traits, you are then thrust into the wasteland once again with a weapon pertaining to your highest combat skill. Now, what you do is up to you. Will you be a hero of the wastes, or the devil in disguise?
<br>Fallout: New Vegas is expanded upon immensely compared to the other games. Aiming is improved, skills are organized better, and the AI is just awesome. For Example:
<br>Starting: S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points are very important to your character. They improve Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck, or worsen them, based on point assignment. Also, instead of Fallout 3&apos;s baby book that gives you a guess on what they improve, the game directly states what skills each improves. Also, the skills were organized much better. A missile launcher is now an explosive weapon (the explosives skill isn&apos;t just grenades/landmines anymore). The big guns skill was entirely removed, with each weapon being categorized based on ammunition type. Traits are new, which give both benefits and drawbacks based on what you choose. Finally, instead of Fallout 3&apos;s &quot;thrust into the world a god&quot; type game play (it really isn&apos;t hard to kill anything in that game), you have a very simple weapon and very little ammo if it is a gun. It makes the game MUCH harder from the start, though the couriers stash gives you more to start.
<br>Factions: The Mojave is filled with many different factions, from the humble NCR to the beautiful, vice-filled streets of New Vegas. You also can gain a reputation, good or bad, with factions, which causes it&apos;s members to react differently. Sometimes, if your reputation is high enough, the faction will give you gifts, or you can even recruit new followers from them. If it&apos;s low enough, people may berate you, or even try to kill you on sight. Factions like the NCR and Caesars Legion will send assassins after you if your reputation with them is low enough.
<br>Combat: Many more guns to choose from, WEAPON MODS, improved AI, etc. The list goes on.
<br>Infiltration: Need to go to a major faction area, but your reputation is too low? Just get a disguise! Yes, you can disguise yourself as a member of a major faction. People from the faction will not try to kill you, even if your reputation is low. However, be alert, as guards and guard dogs often roam around, and they can see through your disguise. Also, enemies of that faction will immediately become hostile to you, no matter what your reputation with them was previously.
<br>Endings: There are multiple endings in Fallout: New Vegas, depending on who you want to help.
<br>DLC: There is plenty of DLC to choose from for Fallout New Vegas. From Old World Blues&apos; backstory reviling, to Lonesome Road&apos;s immense difficulty and bringing to a final fight with the courier who was supposed to take your place for delivering the platinum chip to Mr.House.
<br>Game play Mechanics: At the start, you can choose to initiate Hardcore mode, which means that you have to eat, drink, sleep, and healing items always work overtime. Also, in New Vegas, you can gamble all of your caps away! That, or just get kicked out of every casino on the strip by winning too much for an achievement. Also, you can now buy and install implants. And, as with all four other fallout games, there is, of course, karma. It doesn&apos;t affect much, though it changes the ending you get for completing the game, and even allows you to obtain certain perks, while disabling others. Finally, weapons now have skill and strength requirements. If not met, the weapon will do less damage/be less accurate.
<br>Minor Changes: Minor changes include: Luck increasing your chances of winning gambling games, new drugs, more, better locations, more, better side quests, etc.
<br>
<br>Overall, Fallout: New Vegas is a great game. If you liked Fallout 3, you&apos;ll LOVE this. The reason I&apos;m not giving it a ten is because there ARE some game-breaking bugs, and some areas could&apos;ve been expanded upon. But, other then that, 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5380405">Expand</a></span>

<br>The weapons anda armor are super cool  and the well done and interesting quests

Taking a broader step in to the first person arena, and bringing us back to the west makes this game stand head and shoulders above it&apos;s predecessor, and nearly shoulder to shoulder with Fallout 2. With current patches the bugs have been more or less squashed and stability improved to even better than Fallout 3 with current patches. So lets get on to the game it self. Like any self respecting Fallout title your character, the Courier in this case, starts with a fairly simple main task. This time the main task is getting revenge. From there the story expands and if you play your cards right you might just save the world.
<br>
<br>The good: The tweaks Obsidian gave the Gamebryo engine make this game look far more polished than Fallout 3 and makes things feel a bit more real. The characters in this game are much more colorful than 3&apos;s were and rival the characters of Fallout and Fallout 2. This game was worked on by a lot of old hands from Black Isle who developed the first two games, as a result the humor is back, in a very big way if you pick the Wild Wasteland trait. The game recaptures that desolate desert feeling of the originals and the open feeling they gave you. The music, especially on the radio is fantastic and really shapes up the atmosphere. Though I failed to mention it in my Fallout 3 review Fallout 3 does have that same feeling. On the subject of sound the voice talent is again top notch like all Fallout games. Ron Perlman returns yet again a s our Narrator, Michael Dorn returns as the Super Mutant Marcus, Wayne Newton graces our radios as Mr. New Vegas. Not to mention other huge stars and great voice actors who lend their voices in this game. With the most current patches the game feels solid and tight. Along with the Main game the DLC adds hours of fun to the game. Again having the PC version is paramount due to the mod-friendliness of the game, and again we get the GECK to make our own mods when the creativity bug bites. The mods are doubly important as they can extend the games life several times past the main play throughs of the game. Also like Fallout 3 this game rewards exploration, and if you can see it in the distance, chances are you can go there. The best part in my opinion is the return of the Super Mutants and Nightkin from the Miraposa Military Base/Masters Army. It&apos;s nice to have some intelligent Super Mutants wandering around rather than the dumb as dirt ones from Fallout 3. Possibly the best part is that this game more fully embraces the Lore of Fallout and adds back in a lot of the sleaze factor that made the originals so desolately charming. There are also some nods to the originals, though Fallout 3 had them there were fewer there than here, and they felt less sincere than this time. One last thing here, if you pick energy weapons as a tag skill to start, you get an energy weapon to start with, finally we&apos;re not punished for liking laser guns!
<br>
<br>The bad: Still no usable vehicles or mounts... Still that matters a lot less than it did in Fallout 3 due to better spacing of towns and outposts in which to resupply. We still didn&apos;t get back the vault doors of the originals which is somewhat disappointing. Some bugs still crop up with the newest patches, but I&apos;ve yet to run into any game breakers. The path feels a bit linear compared to previous titles even the third instalment, still there are plenty of reasons to back track which makes it all worth while. The lack of intelligent Deathclaws and those nasty Wanamingos from Fallout 2 feel like a sorely missed opportunity.
<br>That damned companion limit of 2. Really please bring back the Charisma based companion limit. The final note on the bad: This game was made by Obsidian, and it feels like it. By that I mean it feels like there&apos;s a little bit missing, this is because there is a little bit missing. As with almost every Obsidian game a few things that really leave a gap when cut, were cut. This is almost always due to deadlines with Obsidian, and not for artistic reasons like exhibited by Black Isle. This is also why the game need as many patches as it received.
<br>
<br>Other thoughts: V.A.T.S. still feels useless in a real time game, but it&apos;s still very entertaining to kill enemies with it. Obsidian contains a lot of old hands from Black Isle Studio who made the original games.
<br>
<br>Final thoughts: This really does seem like the game Fallout 3 should have been. It stands shoulder to shoulder with Fallout and Fallout 2 and a bit taller than 3. It captures the feeling and spirit of the originals, while elevating that to the first person arena. Proving that some games can make the leap to 3D. It&apos;s an excellent addition to the Fallout universe, an excellent RPG, and an excellent game that all RPG, FPS, and Fallout fans should have in their library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5095866">Expand</a></span>

The refined gameplay and improved content give it an advantage over previous Fallout games. Unfortunately, it fails to capture that post-war Fallout feeling, instead favouring a more Mad Max, wild west style.</span>

I am the biggest fallout fan that I know and I bow down to Bethesda and Interplay for creating a fantastic series. I&apos;ve played all of the fallout games,even Brotherhood of Steel on PS2. So I mean it when I say that Fallout: New Vegas is, in ranking, the 4th worst and the 4th best. Don&apos;t get me wrong it&apos;s still a very good game but it has issues.
<br>
<br>Gameplay in New Vegas is a bit similar to Fallout 3&apos;s gameplay but with a few added features. You can play from either a 3rd or 1st person perspective and explore this huge open world that is the Mojave Wasteland. You will find tons of stuff to do in the wasteland and it&apos;s probably the 2nd biggest Fallout game, considering content (behind Fallout 2.) It adds a hardcore mode which turns the game into a survival game where you need to drink, eat, limbs don&apos;t heal automatically but instead heal over time, doctor&apos;s bags are the only things that can heal limbs. I really like the addition of the hardcore mode and I find it a shame that they cut it out of fallout 4. So aside from that change the gameplay is the same as Fallout 3 however it crashed more than Fallout did and it has more glitches than Fallout 3 did and this happened on a regular basis around once an hour which is probably my biggest complaint about the game. Bethesda please patch this.
<br>
<br>The story in New Vegas is that you&apos;re a courier who was delivering a package only for a guy to come over, shoot you in the head and leave you for dead. But, you&apos;re patched up by a doctor of a local settlement and you then set out to find the guy who shot you and take back your package. Yes, this story has been done quite a few times but the story changes partway through and feels like one of the most epic stuff I&apos;ve ever done. I&apos;m not going to spoil anything though, all I&apos;m going to say is it changes about 5 quests in. So the opening plot isn&apos;t good but the second plot is amazing. Also, like other Fallout games, you can meander off and do side quests but I tend to not do that as I prefer to get the main quest out of the way so there&apos;s nothing to get in my way.
<br>
<br>Graphics are good but could easily be better. It definitely looks like a wasteland and everything looks like what it&apos;s meant to be but all I&apos;m going to say is thank god the modders stepped in. Sound is amazing. If you&apos;re wandering around the wasteland in the evening, you can hear crickets and wildlife and in the morning you can hear crows, people socialising and all sorts.
<br>
<br>There isn&apos;t much need for replay value as you won&apos;t be able to start again due to you still being busy discovering new things in the wasteland. For example, this game has been out since 2010 and I just discovered 3 weeks ago, a deathclaw camp which I never knew about before and was on for a solid 40 minutes fighting them with my 2 followers (Boone and ED-E.) You will easily sink over 200 hours into this (I played this on PS3 before that&apos;s why there isn&apos;t as much hours on my account)
<br>
<br>I highly recommend Fallout New Vegas even if you&apos;ve touched a video game. It&apos;s a great western, a great open world game and a great RPG and an OK survival game (in hardcore mode.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6144727">Expand</a></span>

The colorful characters, intriguing quests and a killer story make for hours of time spent playing the game. The diversity of decisions you can make are a great example of how much thought Obsidian put into this game. Fallout: New Vegas kicks Fallout 4&apos;s ass. Obsidian took everything we know and love about Fallout 3, built upon it and delivered a game so amazingly orgasmic I am having trouble understanding how it did not win Game of the Year in 2010. The DLC adds an entire other story that actually manages to tie in with the main story beautifully. The Ultimate Edition completes the game but it&apos;s still extremely enjoyable without DLCs. Fallout: New Vegas throws away the clunky and buggy gameplay from Falloout 3. A problem in which many of us **** it, this is game is so good I don&apos;t care that i have to reload a save from two hours ago. Goodbye friends and family, I will be playing Fallout 3 for the rest of my life.&quot; OK maybe not quite like that, but the point here is that Fallout: New Vegas brings that feeling back. In case you still don&apos;t understand what makes this game great, Fallout: New Vegas is phenomenal because of the diversity of choices and the effect your choices have on the Wasteland. That is the game&apos;s key feature. Sorry if you prefer a mindless, linear and dry COD storyline, but this game KICKS ASS. The replayability and attention to detail, as well as a few nods to Fallout 1 and 2, make me have to declare this game a 10/10. For god&apos;s sake buy the game and play it. For those of you **** and crying about this game and Fallout 3 crashing... THERE IS A FIX!!! I repeat there is a fix do not give up hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6237110">Expand</a></span>

First of all, New Vegas in NOT made my Bethesda, but was developed by Obsidian. From a FI perspective the game isn&apos;t much to write home about; the gameplay is virtually unchanged save for new weapons and iron sight aiming and the quests are as fun as ever. The most significant difference is the reputation system which dictates how different factions and settlements will react to you. For example, doing favours for someone will increase your reputation with that settlement or doing vice versa will degrade your reputation. The system does produce interesting scenarios from a role-playing perspective but it means little to me as I&apos;m more interested in the world and the quests. The game has a more distinct vibe to it than Fallout 3 despite the main story being uninteresting in comparison, the colourful Vegas looks quite spectacular from a distance. So from a first-impressions viewpoint, I like New Vegas. It still has plenty of interesting quests and I&apos;ll no doubt enjoy what the reputation system can offer but for some reason I can&apos;t get that interested in the setting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570311">Expand</a></span>

Fallout: New Vegas has that.... Bethesda feel. You know, the same little details that are in most Bethesda games. Big, open world, tons of quests and side quests, a large selection of weapons, mods (if you own it on PC), and a whole lot more.
<br>
<br>However, as it is a very big game, it has lots of bugs and glitches. Some of them may crash your game, or cause some weird graphical errors, but that&apos;s fine. It&apos;s the game breaking bugs that you gotta worry about. These usually happen when you don&apos;t install a mod right, and can seriously break your game where you can&apos;t play it. Like, you REALLY can&apos;t play it. Uninstalling it won&apos;t work (in most cases) and sometimes you may even spend hundreds of dollars just re-buying the game.
<br>
<br>Game breaking bugs aside, Fallout: New Vegas is definitely worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4394814">Expand</a></span>

To me &apos;Fallout 3&apos; felt very unbalanced in terms of combat, and maybe I was just terrible at it, but enemies were way too difficult to kill at the beginning of the campaign, and it kept me from putting more than a few hours into it my first time around. On the other hand, playing &apos;New Vegas&apos; for the first time felt much more inviting in terms of the overall pace of the story, and I ended up putting almost thirty hours into it. Take that however you&apos;d like, but my experience with &apos;New Vegas&apos; was much more enjoyable than my time spent with &apos;Fallout 3&apos;.
<br>
<br>Now my overall feelings towards both of these games may be slightly biased as &apos;New Vegas&apos; happened to be the first open world first person shooter that I sunk a significant amount of time into, but it just feels like a more polished, better game. This may also have something to do with the fantastic soundtrack that accompanies you along the way of the &apos;New Vegas&apos; campaign. There&apos;s just something oddly entertaining about destroying robots while listening to songs from Dean Martin and the rest of the &apos;Rat Pack&apos; that really puts me at ease.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, if you&#x2019;re looking for a game that you can spend almost thirty hours on before completing then look no further than &apos;Fallout: New Vegas&apos;. Everyone knows that the Fallout games are amazing and this installation of the series is no different. The environment is fascinating, the characters are interesting, and the missions never get stale. Easily one of the best open world shooters to date, you&apos;re a damn fool if you don&apos;t pick this one up as soon as possible to sink your metaphorical teeth into as well. Well, what are you still doing here?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5036777">Expand</a></span>

Although there are a few bugs in the game, I still found more in Fallout 3 so people saying the bugs ruined it is pretty false in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6480203">Expand</a></span>

Thanks Modders! After more than 150 hours playing, I have to say, if you like post-apocalyptic open-world RPGs, it doesn&apos;t get any better than this.

I thought that game was boring like a McDonald&apos;s pancake without the syrup and butter. So I decided to try this game one more time. I&apos;ve been playing it and have to say this game has so much content and I haven&apos;t been bored yet. Just when you think you have seen everything you stumble into another &quot;deep&quot; side mission. I don&apos;t want go in detail about missions but you have to try it. In my opinion the main story isn&apos;t as strong as Fallout 3. Even though I have read the original Fallout games were more mature and better than Fallout 3. There&apos;s these giant mutated bees called Cazadores.  They will **** your **** up if ain&apos;t at a high level or prepared your character with enough anti-venom. There&apos;s Three main factions N.C.R, The Legion, and The Khans. There other factions you can join because I joined The White Glove Society. Wearing certain armor from a different faction can cause npc to treat you different.
<br>The landscape and wasteland has more of a rundown apocalyptic feel than Fallout 3. I liked the choice of songs in Fallout 3 radio station a little more than this selection but it&apos;s still good. My character is a level 25 with high speech, unarmed, and melee skills. My character just survived being decimated by Boomer artillery as she tried to get into their base. There&apos;s also different companions I have found three. I have a robot companion. It&apos;s a good game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4495846">Expand</a></span>

Beeing able to skip great parts of the main storya nd then stuble accross the person you were looking for in a casino. Muiltiple ways of solving a problem, often with non-violent solutions, too. Also vast improvements in terms of gunplay (iron sights!) and the re-introduction of ammo types (armoured target? AP round then. No armour? Take 75% more damage with my HP roudn then) and a rather simplistic yet still interesting weaponm odding system. Oh, and huge ammounts of weapons. And all that makes NV a great RPG with lots of replayability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6499145">Expand</a></span>

<br>A great big massive open world to explore that feels alive with seemingly endless quests.
<br>Gripping story that keeps you playing.
<br>Interesting and varied NPC&apos;s.
<br>Choices to make that can be very hard to decide, especially since you aren&apos;t sure of the outcome, will make you wonder, should I have made that choice??
<br>
<br>Very customisable, can play the way you want. I love being a sneaky kleptomaniac sniper that picks off enemies from afar and steals everything.
<br>
<br>Enjoy having companions, my fave being the eyebot who plays battle/victory music.
<br>
<br>The only things I dislike is that getting bad karma when stealing doesn&apos;t seem to do anything.
<br>I&apos;ve sneakily stolen everything I can, but did quests to help out the towns and still end up idolised. I guess my good deeds outweigh my bad.
<br>
<br>Weapons and armour deteriorate too fast, making me think that ppl in Mojave don&apos;t know how to make quality weapons, but at least I can make my own weapon repair kits, so not too much of a problem.
<br>
<br>Game suffers from occasional crashing, freezing and game not loading on first try and area not loading after fast travel.
<br>
<br>This is a must play game and I strongly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4710176">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story in this game is the equivalent of the first two Fallout games while the gameplay matches up to that of Fallout 3. This game is simply amazing. Fallout: New Vegas is a game where you play as a courier on a quest for revenge after he is shot in the head (and somehow saved). This game is fun to play with interesting characters, great atmosphere, an amazing storyline and fun gameplay. It was smart of Bethesda to let Obsidian create this game as they still had people who worked on the first two, meaning that the story was great and it had no plot holes (I&apos;m looking at you, Fallout 3).
<br>
<br>Fallout: New Vegas takes place in a post-apocalyptic Nevada. On October 22 - October 23, 2077, a nuclear war named The Great War happened between the U.S and China which caused catastrophic damage to both countries. In 2281, Fallout: New Vegas follows you, a courier who was shot in the head by a man named Benny. Why were you shot? Beacuse he wanted to take the item you were delievering, a platinum chip. After you are saved by a robot and a doctor in a local town named Goodsprings, you begin your quest to find the man who killed you, which eventually leads you to the big city: New Vegas, The Strip. While you are on this quest, you will find interesting people along your journey which will make you do tasks for them in return for information, rewards or them becoming your companion. The lore in this game is extensive and is not too little or too overdone.
<br>
<br>On your journey, you get caught into something much bigger. You begin to find out that two factions are fighting for control of the wasteland, more importantly The Hoover Dam. The two factions are named NCR and Caesar&apos;s Legion. The NCR wants civilisation and law and order to be restored to the wasteland while Caesar&apos;s Legion wants civilisation but through enslaving people. You can choose to either take control of New Vegas yourself, help the NCR or help The Legion which makes for interesting decision making. The factions in this game are great and they all feel very unique. The best factions consist of: The NCR, Caesar&apos;s Legion, Yes-Man (Your own) and the Brotherhood of Steel. This game also has an interesting reputation system as everytime you commit a crime to one of these factions, your reputation will lower and if it is too low, they begin to attack you on sight. For example, if you are helping the NCR and they tell you to eliminate a camp of Legion soldiers, after you kill them you will be shunned by Caesar&apos;s Legion and they will shoot you on sight. If you help one of the factions, your reputation will increase and they will constantly give you rewards and be more helpful to you.
<br>
<br>The gunplay in this game is great. The guns feel good to shoot, even though some of them feel weird with weird sounds and animations. While the gunplay is good, it can even be further improved through using mods. Mods will make this game SO MUCH better! They offer a greater challenge and great gameplay improvements that should have been there from the start. Examples of great mods are Project Nevada, Nevada Skies, Realistic Headshots and many others. Project Nevada adds in more immersion, helmet HUDs and much more which really immerses you into the game. Some mods also alter the graphics of the game to match it up to today&apos;s graphics while still keeping the initial charm of the original ones.
<br>
<br>The world that Obsidian has created is incredible. It&apos;s interesting, the atmosphere is creepy and desolate and it really feels alive (Even though it is a dead world). When in cities, you really feel that they put effort into them as there are many missions, most of the buildings have details and they look great. The roads are destroyed, mutated animals and raiders roam the wastelands in hope of food and survival and merchants and traders go across hoping to find someone to trade with for bottle caps. Once you reach Freeside, the town in which you find access to The Strip, you think you have reached civilisation but you quickly find that the wasteland has still corrupted it as thugs roam around and gangs still fight for control.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this game is one, if not the best Fallout game ever made. It was a MAJOR improvement of Fallout 3 and the story matches up to the first two games as some developers in Obsidian worked on the original ones. The game has great gameplay (even more with mods), an interesting story, a good reputation system and factions that are all unique. If you are an avid fan of Fallout or any post-apocalyptic games, buy this game on PC and get mods. You will not regret it!

The story however, is slightly inferior than that of Fallout 3&apos;s story, with less emotion and lack of explanations. You&apos;re pretty much killed then &apos;revived&apos; and you go on a rampaging killing-spree in search of your killer for revenge! Just like Fallout 3 (without Broken Steel), you cannot play after the final mission which is extremely disappointing and underwhelming. The DLC&apos;s definitely improve and are far better than Fallout 3&apos;s notoriously short and linear DLC&apos;s.
<br>
<br>TL;DR if you prefer a more advanced game with more content than its predecessor that has a superior storyline, you will certainly enjoy this game. If you prefer having more reasoning and explanation and overall better plot, you will prefer Fallout 3 to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938563">Expand</a></span>
