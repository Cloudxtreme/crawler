For everyone that is absolutely sh&amp;^%ng themselves over what a disappointing game this is for the wait, I have to say I&apos;m a little baffled. It&apos;s really no better or worse than these other &quot;Triple A&quot; titles getting churned out in less than a year coming out the gate lately. In an industry filled with disappointing redundant sequel after disappointing lack of improvement sequel, it&apos;s kind of nice to have this blast from the past finally get released.<br><br>In my time playing the game I encountered only one glitch, which by my count is frankly surprising. Considering what a train wreck this game must have been to work on once 3DRealms was out of the picture I expected to encounter a lot more hiccups than I did. The graphics look and feel a lot like they do in Prey. Dated by today&apos;s standards, but still passable. The real tragedy here was the lack of consistency in development and if, god forbid, Gearbox had had more time to work on it this could have been an even better game.<br><br>There are certainly glimmers of the game that could have been sprinkled throughout the experience, and to be honest that&apos;s not such a bad thing. I&apos;m glad some of the old Duke charm actually made it into the final product instead of none at all. Hopefully when work starts on the sequel they can focus their efforts on improving the gameplay instead of having to clean up a mess first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1672697">Expand</a></span>

It is far from a perfect game, but most games are far from perfect.  Overall, I enjoyed the time I played this game.<br><br>My personal complaints against the game are that it tries too hard to have the both of both old first person shooter play and modern play.  I wanted to carry multiple guns, I wanted to actually have to worry about health, and I wanted levels that I could run around in circles doing things on.  Instead, its the standard 2 weapons, regenerating health, and rather linear levels.  Just like most of the shooters I have played in the last couple of years.  Those are just my main complaints.<br><br>There are multiple types of enemies, and while you will find the standard grunts and the pigcops to be the most numerous, there is more variety here than most modern shooters.  Of course, having aliens to fight as opposed to humans helps with that aspect.<br><br>The weapons are quite varied, and while most were taken from Duke Nukem 3D, the AT Laser, AT Captains Laser, Railgun, Enforcer Gun are all new, and the Freeze Gun has been modified quite a bit.  Every gun is unique, there aren&apos;t any that are essentially interchangeable.<br><br>While the levels are very linear, for the most part they are fairly unique and fun.  Sadly, even the big levels are broken up into smaller parts.  I would have like more secrets and Easter eggs .  It was nice to hear the &quot;one dead space marine&quot; line though.  I feel they put in a decent amount of interactivity in most of the levels, it just starts to feel a little sparse towards the end.  Its nice that they put in Frisbee&apos;s and paper airplanes to throw around.  Three of the more interactive objects feel a bit off, but they aren&apos;t impossible.<br><br>The graphics aren&apos;t bad.  They aren&apos;t spectacular, and the humans seem to be animated fairly stiffly.  But that isn&apos;t a big deal because most of the humans don&apos;t last too long anyway.  I don&apos;t think anyone should be ashamed of these graphics, but it shows that the game is a little older than its release date would indicate.<br><br>As to people who are offended by this game, or don&apos;t find it funny?  It isn&apos;t too offensive as far as I can see, but people are allowed their own opinions.  I was laughing quite a bit during this game.  Maybe I just have a sicker sense of humor, but most of the jokes and one liners were funny to me.<br><br>Is Duke Nukem Forever an amazing game we have waited over a decade for?  No, its not.  Neither is it the bad game many of the professional reviewers make it out to be.  It may not be worth a buy, but its certainly worth a rent.  I myself, am glad that I bought it.  I was thoroughly entertained.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1679068">Expand</a></span>

It is not meant to be a groundbreaking AAA title, but rather mostly just fan-service. DN3D was a very well-known game back in the 90&apos;s for it&apos;s over-the-top violence, sophomoric humor, excessive nudity, and constant one-liners from the Duke himself and Duke Nukem Forever only tries to be the same. But that is also one of its downfalls.<br><br>This game doesn&apos;t strive to be more. It tries to be very much like its predecessor but while doing so, takes away from the game&apos;s creativity. Consumers these days are starving for something new and intuitive in a world of constant, mono-tone FPS&apos;s. It looked promising enough with the bringing back of the childish humor (although some people don&apos;t like that type of humor) and 90&apos;s-type gameplay, and its super interactivity, but it&apos;s ultimate downfall was trying to catch up to modern times by excluding some key assets that made DN3D so fun. For example, you can only carry 2 weapons at a time; something that most fans gawk at. Then they make the &quot;Mighty Foot&quot; execution-only. It&apos;s the little things like that that put not only newcomers off, but fans as well and for a Duke Nukem game, that&apos;s not something you want to do.<br><br>The gameplay is good for a little burst of fun here and there, but it ultimately suffers from trying to combine 90&apos;s style with the modern era. It isn&apos;t horrible, but the mechanics just aren&apos;t solidified. Some of the bosses, however, are actually pretty fun.<br><br>The graphics, while they may not be up to par with many of today&apos;s top titles, aren&apos;t too bad although they could have at least had a bigger color palette. Everything does seem relatively low-poly and the character models are nothing to brag about. Overall, the graphics are acceptable, but not very likeable.<br><br>The very hyped up &quot;interactivity&quot; that they promised turned out to be less than they made it out to be. Sure you can microwave a rat, play some pinball, or even knock a punching bag, but most of that stuff is very obvious. There are no real &quot;secret&quot; things that you can do (as far as I&apos;ve seen). Most of the time, there will be something in the room that you look at and think &quot;I can probably play with this&quot; but nothing is really shocking. Not to mention that they spoiled all of the &quot;surprising&quot; interactive things (like the turd) in order for more marketing. I&apos;ve seen games with way more interactivity than this game. They just told us empty promises.<br><br>The levels are very linear with TONS of Half-Life rip-off &quot;physics&quot; puzzles that seem more like scripted events rather than real physics.<br><br>Sound design is OK. Not too much variety and they all seem very monotonous. Duke&apos;s grunt from every jump is very unnecessary.<br><br>Overall, fans of Duke might enjoy this game for the nostalgia factor, but that&apos;s really all this game is is fan service. It&apos;s almost like Gearbox just got the rights for it, and then said, &quot;Alright, this game has been in development hell for years so let&apos;s just get this done and get it out there. Fans will love it regardless.&quot; The game suffers from trying to catch up with modern times while still trying to be the same. The graphics are OK, the gameplay is fun at times, the puzzles are a joke, and the famed &quot;interactivity&quot; is nothing really to be excited about. The game is alright.

You can also disregard the reviews that say this game is perfect in every way - it definitely is not. There are mildly amusing parts, some good shooting action.....and some puzzles that were ok (most were just tedious). In short, a simply OK game.</span>

I&apos;m personally dumbfounded by the terrible reviews it has been receiving as the game as a lot of variety, cool weapons, likable enemies and allies and Duke Nukem humor to top it off. If you don&apos;t take this game too seriously it can be a lot of fun.</span>

Duke Nukem...Duke Nukem...and Duke Nukem. Many of the reviews I have read simply don&apos;t seem to understand Duke Nukem or the intentions of this game. This game was everything it was supposed to be. Do not expect candy and flowers. Expect Duke Nukem to be Duke Nukem with bad jokes, harsh language, and plenty of explosions. This game follows along the same lines of game play as 3D did. It is pretty linear, another outrageous storyline, plenty of fun gunfights and bossfights that are classic Duke. However, that being said. This is not 3D. This is not the groundbreaking game 3D was. Has its flaws like all new games but that doesn&apos;t make it the awful crap most people here are trying to make it seem. If you can take maturity and classic politically incorrect humor than you will like this game. So in summary, if you do not have &quot;Balls Of Steel&quot;, you will not like this game as it was not created for an audience like you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662831">Expand</a></span>

This is my mini-review of Duke Nukem Forever.<br><br>First off, this is NOT meant to be &quot;old-school&quot; Duke Nukem. It&apos;s a squeal, a continuation of the series, more than just a &quot;reboot&quot;. I was there in line waiting on my copy of Duke Nukem 3D when it hit the shelves. I still own that original copy I purchased back then. I own and have played every incarnation of Duke Nukem ever released on every platform it was ever released on. Duke Nukem Forever is not any of it. It is its own game, and this is a very good thing. It is what I was personally hoping it would be. I mean come on, this is 2011, I don&apos;t want that 90&apos;s gaming experience, as much as I may have loved it back then. I wanted a more modern game and that&apos;s what I get with DNF.<br><br>Story and content wise, it&apos;s Duke Nukem to the core, no doubt. This game really pushes that &quot;Rated M&quot; to the limit. It is the same story with the same &quot;adult&quot; content I remember from the Duke. The game has not been reduced, edited for content, or otherwise censored. Thank god for that. The gameplay is nice as well. Very easy to control and there is a lot of stuff in the world to interact with. I have played through the game a full two times now and not one time did I have any issues related to actually playing the game. You get some of the &quot;little Duke&quot; action as you run around while all shrunk down trying to complete a task. You get to battle the classic monsters as well as some new ones and bosses. The classic weapon set is there with a few fun ones thrown in as well. Blow off limbs and &quot;interact&quot; with objects in the game to unlock a fun list of 50 Steam achievements. Don&apos;t forget about the ladies, they are the reason you are in the battle, remember? Not to mention the &quot;Mighty Foot&quot;. From a technology standpoint, the game is nothing special. If I am not mistaken the game runs on a highly modified Unreal Engine 2.5, and they did a great job of utilizing the engine to the best of it&apos;s abilities. It&apos;s not ground breaking by any means, but it&apos;s not supposed to be. This game has been in development for so long and across so many different engines that I am surprised it came out as good as it did. It&apos;s not going to push the limits of any half was decent gaming PC that&apos;s for sure. One noteworthy fact about DNF, it is NOT a console port. The single player campaign was created for PC from the ground up and it was then later ported TO console after it was completed. The reverse of what we often see these days. The graphics are great. Nothing Earth shattering like I said above, but you can tell they pushed the limit of the engine and used it very well. If you want ground breaking graphics, you just have to wait for BF3 like the rest of us. For Duke Nukem, these graphics serve him, and the game, quite well across all platforms. The sounds in the game are also well done. The topper being the fact that Jon St.John reprises his role as the voice of Duke Nukem. Not only do you get many of the classic phrases we have loved for so many years, but literally dozens more that just make the overall game experience so much more enjoyable.<br><br>Overall I give the game high marks. I got what I expected out of Duke Nukem Forever, a fun and entertaining adult game that does justice to the name without taking me back to the 90&apos;s, except for the fact I had just as much fun playing DNF as I did Duke Nukem 3D. I did not place the game on such a high pedestal that makes it nearly impossible to meet, something far too many people do these days. It is reminiscent of what used to be fun about playing Duke Nukem 3D, but for a modern time, I think they did a great job bringing Duke back and I look forward to seeing where he goes next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1664376">Expand</a></span>

It reminds me a bit of Team Fortress 2 in the cartoonish, fast and fun action.

Freeze rays, rocket launchers, lasers, shotgun, shrink ray, pistol, rail gun, etc.  Although I haven&apos;t seen any &apos;speed&apos; changers...you run as fast no matter the weapon.  If you are worried about the older nature of the tech as it has to do with a controller, the 360 controller for pc works no problem.  So no worries there.<br><br>You might need to sign in through the friends sign in thingy on steam if the multiplayer is greyed out, and make sure the steam community is enabled.<br><br>The running around small can be a plus, as it can allow you into places you normally can&apos;t get to.  Sometimes to hide, other times for powerups.  It does make them harder to shoot and they can still shoot back but it appears it&apos;s weaker for them?  Freeze ray will freeze them for a time, and of course if you get killed before finishing them off, they will unfreeze and be fine.   There are lifts, that will launch you, sort of like Halo (but not all the way across the map).  As hinted, the levels can have multiple stories.  Just like most modern shooters, your health will regenerate if you run away and hide.  You can duck and jump, but no double jump or crawl.  The unlock gear is unlocked pretty easily.  It is whacky. For instance I now have a pumpkin with one thing, and another unlock gives me no eyes.   Pretty cool, and while there are only 3-4 things you can change about duke, there are many different things any of those 3-4 things are, so there are many whacky It&apos;s a bit simplistic, but again it is fast and furious, multiple ways to get from point a to b, and is just plain fun.  Level design is pretty cool, it is varied, and the levels aren&apos;t all the same color.  If you want a non-military style online shooter experience, this can satisfy that need.    I can&apos;t speak for single player as I&apos;m not focusing on that in this review or score.  The graphics are a bit dated, but with the cartoon feel it doesn&apos;t exactly matter.  Again team fortress 2 style graphics ain&apos;t bad either, just don&apos;t expect dx11 motion blur.  It installs dx9.0c so, it&apos;s just a few years standard stuff. The online multiplayer can vary quite a bit depending on how the game is setup.  One match had basically shotgun, others had all the weapons.   C4 type explosives with detonator, as well as trip mine type.  Beer (damage dampener), Steroids (makes you bunch harder), and other stuff, like double weapon damage....someone said UT3 sort of stuff is also about right...but implemented with duke&apos;s style.<br><br>I haven&apos;t seen all the maps, nor used the jetpack, but I&apos;m sure that would make it even more varied.  Two hours played went by fast.  dm, tdm, king of the hill, and capture the babe (flag) is what I&apos;ve noticed.  They have a button for dlc, so who knows what they add in the future.<br><br>Overall when you consider it isn&apos;t CoD, and tries to be what it is, it&apos;s satisfying and simple, yet varied.    For multiplayer I give it an 8.  (I rarely give 10&apos;s unless it&apos;s skyrim [assumed] good).  So 8 for multiplayer is good.  Some might see the lack of kill streak bonuses like getting an airstrike and such and give it lower, but if you know going in what it is, and notice the subtle differences it has with such and thought put into the level design there are some zany times to be had that differentiates it from most other shooters and provides a refreshing take from the great but similar military style multiplayer shooters. You can make up your own mind on whether or not it&apos;s worth full price, but there is little excuse to not pick it up when you see it on discount going forward.  At $45 on steam pre-order I&apos;m satisfied with the purchase.  It should be compared more against the Team Fortress 2 types, then CoD/Battlefield/Resistance/Killzone/Halo types.  There was room in the genre for one of these, and it fits that niche nicely.  I wasn&apos;t one who waited for it, so i&apos;m not a fanboi of this game. I might of played the original back in the day in high school, but don&apos;t really remember it.  So I didn&apos;t come in with any past expectations nor loyalty to the brand.  If you can get past that it doesn&apos;t use dx11(or 10) style graphics, and put it in its proper place, and don&apos;t judge it off one server&apos;s variation of the game, it&apos;s a fun game.  Enjoy.  Remember 13 years in development is a skewed number, they redid the game a couple of times, and bought it off the scrap heap a ~couple of years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1661867">Expand</a></span>

One downside to this game is that you could only hold &quot;Two weapons&quot; which you would decide on which weapon you would like to keep.

Finally it&apos;s here...but is it worth it? Yes, yes it is. It feels like a modernized Duke3D in terms of humor and interactivity, but I believe 3D Realms made some poor decisions towards the end of development: you can only hold two weapons at once, you have regenerating health instead of picking up medkits, and the levels are linear without many secrets. Other than that the game is awesome. The multiplayer is fun as well, and there&apos;s an entire set of Duke one-liners that can only be heard while playing online. As you level up you unlock customization options (hats, t-shirts, glasses, etc.) There is also a feature called &quot;My Digs&quot; which is basically a giant apartment where you can unlock features seen in the single player, such as gym equipment, a pool table, air hockey, pinball, and various pieces of Duke memorabilia. You can then go around the apartment interacting with all that stuff. As a Duke fan I give the game an 8.5, but the game might be less appealing to players who have no prior history with the character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662956">Expand</a></span>

And though it has a regenerating health system it is much more challenging than i.e. Halo. All in all a great game packed with some dated graphics.</span>

This game will be fun for any old school type guy or fan of the series in general. It is by no means perfect and my true score would be closer to 7.5 - 8 . Regardless, this game is loads of goofy fun and it will bring back memories. Enjoy the game for what it is folks. If you are overly feminist, easily offended, or too sensitive, dont waste your time on this. This game is not for emo cry babies. I could continue to ramble but. &quot;It&apos;s time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I&apos;m all outta gum.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1663068">Expand</a></span>

So far, I&apos;m at the casino, the aliens are fun to fight, shooting is solid</span>

Anybody who says this game is bad is whining because it doesn&apos;t look like your fabled CoD series. Well news to these **** WE DON&apos;T WANT GAMES TO LOOK LIKE COD. CoD is just fast paced, no logic, brain stimulation. Duke Nukem requires you to think a little, unlike CoD where the object of the game is to kill everything that isn&apos;t marked green. Games like DNF are games that will go down in history as a badly reviewed game, but a fan loved game. I recommend this game to TRUE GAMERS. Any regular CoD players should let this one by, you will find this game far too hard for your brain capacity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662561">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The 12 hour SP campaign is unusually compelling, has some great moments and the interactive ego boosters you find are rewarding. The story and character is essentially over the top satire and a lot of the humor references other games and pop culture. The puzzles are great, supplying a pacing one finds in past Valve titles and are all very engaging. Most levels feel unique and a few provide interesting twists to gameplay. Many of the scripted sequences lack polish and a few areas appear downright bare when nothing happens. The FBA animations are world class and create cinematic events to immerse you in a rather zany action hero.
<br>
<br>The weapons are a smart mix of conventional, alien and fun. A limited carry capacity for primary guns stresses environmental interaction and map domination. The separately mapped explosives and powerups make for clever tactics. Boss fights provide unique challenges and end in amusing fatalities in keeping with the series. Duke&apos;s ego, itself a parody of regenerating health systems, provides some respite from the occasionally punishing combat and brutal enemy characters.
<br>
<br>Graphics are a mixed bag as Vegas looks like a dull attempt at realism and many outdoors areas in general don&apos;t have the vibrancy of most indoor levels, which are rendered well. Post-processing effects often tend to miss the mark and some explosions and weapon effects don&apos;t always look too good while other effects and dynamic soft shadows look very nice. The level geometry is mostly for the low end and while static meshes are detailed, this is a game that&apos;s meant to run better than it looks.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a remarkably fun, un-PC game and despite the lack of polish in many areas, makes for a uniquely hand-crafted experience that stays with you. I&apos;d recommend this to fans of the Half-life series who don&apos;t mind a varied pace. But those interested in graphics or more polished titles with tighter, combat to combat scripting like the Call of Duty series might want to wait till this one is on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1661986">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are really decent and much better then on xbox360. Im enjoying every minut of it. Black Ops and Crysis 2 kids will probably disagree with me but odlschool fans will appreciate DNF.</span>

It&apos;s a fun shooter, with it&apos;s flaws, sure, but it&apos;s still a game with its own characteristics. Don&apos;t go and compare DNF with CoD or Halo, they are almost different genres. Duke has personality, have his lines, his sense of humor. The others? Just silent protagonists. Hail to the king, baby!</span>

If you want a trip down memory lane with an old friend, you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed. Maybe if this game does half decent, they can have the means needed to produce a &quot;better&quot; product or whatever these idiots seem to think the game doesn&apos;t have. The demo doesn&apos;t do the game any justice, if you still aren&apos;t for sure to get it or not, wait til there is a sale on steam and pick it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662279">Expand</a></span>

And really that&apos;s my only complaint about it.<br><br>It&apos;s a fun game.  Period.  Do I dislike the bits of all the other modern cover based shooters that snuck into it?  Sure.

That&apos;s like going into a comedy movie and expecting to see oscar performances. Drop your expectations back down, remember, it&apos;s still just a game. Look at the lead character. he&apos;s a campy, one liner from a time of better movies, and silent protagonists. The gameplay gets switched up alot, and while no single mechanic really stands out, they are all still solid and they work well. The star of the show is what you bought this game for, and the Duke shines, he is raunchy, sexist, and above all.. it&apos;s hilarious.<br><br>If you want an award winning game, go somewhere else.

Well this game feels like the rag bag of development that it is. Some levels are ok, not great, but ok. Most levels are terrible. The graphics are very dated - but it isn&apos;t just the graphics, the whole feel of the game.is clunky. The level design is boring and extremely linear. The one liners are funny for the most part but they can&apos;t rescue this slow, ploddy game. Long boring driving sections - I love driving sections in most games but this just doesn&apos;t work. The vehicles feel like they are slowing you down more than helping. Out of fuel again? What&apos;s that - three times? It plods and it plods.<br><br>Really annoying are the many times when a game character blocks your path by standing in the middle of a wide corridor. Look, I could drive a bus through that gap but Duke has his nose against the invisible wall and the game is not letting me past until I&apos;ve watched a tedious video on a TV or listened to some dialogue. I want to scream &quot;You&apos;re Duke - shove that guy out of your way.&quot; It isn&apos;t happening. This feels really pointlessly irritating when you find a kid sitting on your throne who refuses to move unless you take his photo. Yep that&apos;s right - Duke has to run around after some kid before being allowed to proceed. If that doesn&apos;t ruin the immersion nothing will. Bad, bad, bad idea - but it&apos;s just one example. I had plenty to choose from.<br><br>I have waited for this for years. I played, and loved Duke 3D all those years ago. I wanted this to be great but I&apos;m not letting that blind me to a truly horrible gaming experience. This is my opinion of course - but I have stated clear reasons above why this game is bad. And it really is bad. Oh God it&apos;s bad. How ever much of a fan you are stop and think. Or at least stop and wait until this hits the bargain bin - you won&apos;t have to wait long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1665448">Expand</a></span>

The design is a bit dated but if you weren&apos;t expecting that, I don&apos;t know what to say other than this game was in development for 12 years, it&apos;s going to show it&apos;s age. The beginning levels were kinda of boring but every review I have seen suck focuses on those levels and the toilet humor. Makes me wonder if they played the game from beginning to end. I saw IGN&apos;s gameplay commentary video and the guy was very early in the game already complaining about it, didn&apos;t seem like it was going to get a fair chance after seeing that. Now this game is no 10/10 but it certainly deserves better than what the reviews are saying. I&apos;m giving a 10/10 because I know that is going to get downvoted pretty bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662157">Expand</a></span>

When you think about it, something that has been worked on, on and off for 13 years. You don&apos;t expect it to be a game that has been in continuous development and polishing for 13 years, I think many people get this wrong. Its been started, ended, restarted, changes graphic engine at least 3 times, been through financial hell and back and to hell again. This is a game that should have come out around 2001-2003.<br><br>Now, enough defending its production cycle and the obvious reason for why the game is as oldschool as it is. If you are able to let your mind wander back 10 years when you play it, you will understand everything about how the game plays. And then you will have fun.. that is if you like Duke Nukem and not just what you think you like because you have read somewhere that Duke was fun but you never played it because you where to young or never bothered recently because the graphics are so bad..<br><br>The game is quite good, at least that is what i think. There is a lot of variety, diving stages, turret stages, strip club, tons of mini games and hidden fun. Especially the tinyDuke levels are pretty well designed. Bosses are fun, and the guns are good too. And i didn&apos;t even experience a single bug on my playthrough. That&apos;s got to be a first right? Still not without it flaws, its a nostaligafest of the rare, and i know most people wanted a UnrealHalf-LifeHaloUnchartedSeriousSam game.. But all you get is Duke Nukem, and that is all I wanted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1661988">Expand</a></span>

I guess it helped that I had rather low (realistic?) expectations on what to expect from this. If it had the old weapon system from Duke Nukem 3D, I would rate this game a 9.</span>

Seriously, the only reason to play it is just to see for yourself the abomination that it is. This is a nearly heart-breaking Duke Nukem catastrophe, I wish I could go back in time 14 years and tell myself to not wait for DNF and not waste attention on it because it&apos;s going to blow to the fullest possible extent. The only problem with that, though, is that I&apos;d never believe my future self, as I had so much confidence in 3dR... and how could I not? Considering they made Duke3d, as well as releasing dozens of fantastic smaller games prior? How the mighty have fallen, and how greatly sad it is<br><br>Be warned, there is absolutely nothing old school about this game, not in the least, and especially nothing resembling Doom or Duke3d style shooting. This game is the exact opposite of Old School. DNF is slow moving, with slow movement speed, limited sprint ability, few enemies with combat that is spaced far apart, 2-weapon carry-limit with universal ammo crates, regenerating health, quicktime events, and wtih completely linear &amp; boring level design.<br><br>Anybody who dares try to trick you into buying this game by suggesting it is old school in even the slightest manner is lying to you through their teeth or simply has convinced themselves of a lie to rationalize the 14 years they&apos;ve wasted waiting for this game. DNF is no more old-school than it is a space-pony training RPG that takes place on Mt Olympus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1676711">Expand</a></span>

It has a similar kind of charm as a throwback action movie. A mix of campy humour, sex, and a ton of violence. Alot of effort was made to bring back the old Duke feel and I think the development team(s) did a good job. Probably one of DNF&apos;s biggest strengths. Level design was interesting at times and dull at others, about what you&apos;d expect from all but the very best FPS&apos;s. Gameplay is comprised of not just killing hoards of aliens but also puzzles, vehicles, and mini games (reminds me of Deus Ex). The graphics are on par with Halo 3, polished but dated by todays standards. All in all I had fun kicking @$$ with the Duke after all these years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662030">Expand</a></span>

<br>3: Gameplay is linear/boring/uninteresting.
<br>4: Art design is very very lacking.
<br>5: Humour &amp; game content are in places quite offensive this is not a game for children/teens as it contains sexist &amp; pornographic humour I do not feel belongs in a computer game at all.
<br>
<br>This game feels to me like a highly cynical cash grab to recover some of the lengthy development budget wasted (boy was it wasted here!). After so long you would reasonably expect something which at least matches Duke Nukem 3D/Manhattan Project well this manages to be vastly inferior to both of them &amp; you have to wonder why this is considered to be a full price game when it would have looked &amp; played poorly 10 years ago!
<br>
<br>Gamer beware this truly is one of the worse games ever made &amp; without the Duke Nukem name would be a budget price at launch &amp; is quite rightly getting a lot of negative reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1662650">Expand</a></span>

Lots of meta humor and fanservice, but not so much that&apos;s it&apos;s annoying.  Design is on par with every other rail-ish FPS game (Call of Duty, Halo,Resistance,etc), but the detailed environments and sense of parody/satire make it Duke.  Reading these other reviews I&apos;m not sure how many people actually played Duke 3D...it was a polished Doom clone with a sense of humor.

The casino was greatly detailed, there were quite a few maps of it, the stripclub, and the remote truck as well as other neat stuff. Didn&apos;t like the drawnout stretch of shrink as often as it was but every part of the game was thought through and given detail. The smoothness of the game was great, the difficulty had artificial intelligence built-in to govern gameplay dynamics, which gave respect to the control system of the original game, FPS. I&apos;m giving it a 10 for a game that expands upon previous steps up in fps gameplay, The **** looked real. The faces were right-on for a game, great detail with smoothness. The faces were obviously not meant to look real, doll-like really, but I imagine giving one much detail would lead to not only an artist costs, but higher model expectations as well. It was great to reminisce on, I unlocked all maps in about 3 days of hardcore play on next up from easy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1720713">Expand</a></span>

Most younger players will not understand this game and have underated it, so much hype for so many years caused many to be dissapointed, but if you know how games were back in the day and liked the original one, you are surely going to enjoy this one. I already finished it and I loved it, the humor is there, the babes are there and the irreverent duke we all love and miss. Yes, sometimes the game has some slow paced moments and a couple of the puzzles are not that fun, but the rest is great specially the boss encounters. So what do you expect from a game that is coming back from the 90s? a 90s like style game! if you are ok with that you are gonna like this one , no matter what people say. Way to go DN I can&apos;t wait for a sequel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749816">Expand</a></span>

I knew 3Drealms had no chance competing with the other softwarehouses and their inability to finish the game made that very clear. I didn&apos;t care though. Duke nukem is a game for simple action and fun, let other developers worry about stuff like superior graphics, realism and storylines.<br><br>Still, even with my simple (not to be mistaken with low) expectations, the game didn&apos;t really deliver. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there were fun parts and even a few original elements, but it just felt thrown together. Even though I know it was actually thrown together in the end, still, after 12 years I expected at least some things to be really polished, but nothing was. Even the music and voice acting was bad, and those things could have been perfected ages ago. The only thing that stood out was the huge amount of pop-reference and sex jokes they&apos;ve managed to put in the game. It&apos;s almost impossible not to find at least one or two jokes that are a little funny.<br><br>I could fill a page with con&apos;s, but I&apos;ll just mention the biggest one. Some levels were very boring. I liked the driving/racing element and also the &quot;mini&quot; levels, but they were repetitive, not really challenging and just didn&apos;t seem to end. Some &quot;live cutscenes&quot; had the same effect. There were some really nice levels with challenging fights that weren&apos;t half as complex as those boring parts, so it would&apos;ve been nice if they just added a few more of those. What I really liked was that the puzzles were slightly more challenging than those of most modern shooters.<br><br>I&apos;m giving it a 6 because in the end it was entertaining, even though I never got to use a jetpack in single player :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1690568">Expand</a></span>

I dove into the abyss of what I thought was going to be a dissapointment but no. I thought it would be a terrible game. I was wrong.  The music is average, the levels are average, the graphics is 2008. Many things lack seriously in detail, especially the women models. The bossfights are cool. Not that I love anything about them, but they are fun and not too easy or hard. Every one of them is different and none is bad, well maybe the thing underwater. Classic boss fights. The weapons are cool, well balanced, have nice animations and fun to dispatch enemies. The enemies are well varied, have good AI and get dismembered nicely. I did not like some of the levels, very boring, sometimes tedious and annoying. Often I did not know where to go or what to do. The levels where you play a small Dookie are interesting (esp. the kitchen fights). There are multiple spots where you stand in a field and surpress waves of incoming foes - that is poorly made. The interaction with facilities are ok, though I didn`t find the games too engaging. You also get killed many times because the game has weird scripting. With all that said, I had some fun, I could not get bored to the extent I`d quit playing.  Overall the game is easy and simple to play. A standard FPS I`d say.<br>Worth the money when you get a 30% discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1735804">Expand</a></span>

Little humor thrown in, between some fun guns.  The overpowering guns of the past seem to be gone as more artificial limitations are placed (i.e. you can only hold 2 weapons at a time, presumably to keep it simple for the console releases).  Dukes one-liners seem to be misused, but there are some fun ones in there.  The open worlds were replaced by linear corridors.  And the fun was replaced by trying to explain itself.  Rewrite the game with a name other than Duke and it would get better reviews.  Put the Duke in, and it just cant live up to its own artificial expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1722706">Expand</a></span>

<br>Duke Nukem: Forever is what it is supposed to be : A bad ass american who saves the earth with unrealistic ways and a lot of muscles, like all those games from the late 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s. Why should we critisize that ? it has his own style and the game is made  for the old gamers who enjoyed Duke Nukem like me.
<br>
<br>The game suceed in his humor, it can be very funny sometimes. It is not and have never been consider as a &apos;&apos;serious&apos;&apos; game.
<br>
<br>Altough for the time the developpers took to make the video game, we should have name it &apos;&apos; Game of the Year&apos;&apos;.  The only problems with this game are the Physics, wich are almost scripted like the old games and the Ai is a problem.
<br>
<br>But the game features a lot of guns, type of monsters, funny animations, jokes and will get you a lot of fun. But it is for  Gamers that enjoyed those old-style games, if you do, be sure to grab your copy of Duke Nukem:Forever before they retire it from the market

Duke Nukem is all about over the top comments during a brutal shoot&apos;em up. This is indeed the game i was waiting for, having played DN1, 2 &amp; 3D as a kid. If you want CoD, go and play that, and get off my lawn! The Duke is for people wanting to kick ass, and possibly chew bubblegum. Period.</span>

<br>Full of annoying fillers where we yawn bored as **** The game doesn&apos;t start immediately as it should and before we get to the actual shooting we waste - like - about 2 hours walking around and throwing statues that kill in one hit due to the broken physics?
<br>Levels are closed, there&apos;re no real pick-ups, health is regenerating, we&apos;re often being closed in a small area and told to wait here for 5 or more minutes killing trash by a peek-a-boo tactic.
<br>You can carry 2 weapons max. 2. I mean - what the actual F?
<br>The game has its moments, some boss fights are pretty good and weapons do feel nice.
<br>
<br>But it misses what Duke Nukem was about entirely. This game has identity problems, since it&apos;s half-way a call of turd game, with occasional old-school features on a top.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4459561">Expand</a></span>

This is a satire on life. As far as I&apos;m concerned, DNF has delivered a fun, humerous, and entertaining experience. All you roody-poo fan-boys giving this game anything &lt; 7 should&apos;ve been beaten more by your parents; you whine and expect to get everything you want. You&apos;re whats wrong with America.

Well this game has a good gameplay with some okay graphics but what really enjoyed in this game is the interracion that we have and also the catch phrases. The one thing i didnt like was the huge lag in the multiplayer, its was more like break dance than a multiplayer, but overall a 9 is what it gets from me.

The fact that my friend told me I can pick up poop in a bathroom stall in the first map was the giveaway.

Story was good, gameplay was somewhat unique in a good way. Run and gun + occasional hide behind cover. The game got a lot of hate, it did NOT deserve any of it. I had more fun with this game than any call of duty I have played. Multiplayer is there, but almost dead. Though the game should be bought for single player. Bosses were epic, especially the final boss. All in all, still a great game.

Its overly long and the actual minutes are not as gripping as they should be. Duke seems to have not seen many movies this side of the millennium, which makes it hard to keep it fresh. However it is a dirty secret that it&apos;s quite fun just being a 12 year old again, and this game does that in spades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=2330798">Expand</a></span>

People just had too high of expectations considering how long it took for the game to come out. Thus, their judgement for the game&apos;s quality was already distorted in advance. The guns in this game are all varied, interesting, and useful in differing situations. People don&apos;t understand what the point of a single player FPS is. When you&apos;re killing the pig cops, aliens, etc. the game is by no means trying to say that that substitutes for hardcore competitive multiplayer or something... The point is that you&apos;re going to be fighting a lot of enemies, and Duke is better than each one of them individually. The challenge comes in where you have to fight a lot of them. The regenerating health, 2 weapon limit, etc. aren&apos;t necessarily bad things. I think people just looked at it and said, &quot;uh oh, that&apos;s in Call of Duty, obviously it must be a bad thing!&quot; which is funny because most people don&apos;t even know why they dislike Call of Duty and only do it because they&apos;re told to. But I digress. Anyway, if you take this game for what it is, and know why you&apos;re playing it as opposed to other FPS games, it&apos;s actually pretty solid. The reason I&apos;m giving it a 7/10 is because I&apos;m just not really that in to FPS. It doesn&apos;t have much lasting appeal for me. I don&apos;t see myself replaying this one very many times in the future. If you are in to FPS and you judge the game taking it for what it is though, and not just blindly hating it because everyone else does, you will probably like it even  more than I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=2015844">Expand</a></span>

<br>The worst part of the game is that the levels are rather confined with little give in how you approach a target or the end of the level. Other then this it follows the fps formula well &amp; tries to be decent.
<br>It&apos;s a much better game then several of the other recent fps games released. The humor, the bad humor &amp; even if lacking in it the advanced game mechanics do make this enjoyable.
<br>Story is predictable but it does it in a way consistent with the game history &amp; knows it&apos;s being predictable. That&apos;s alright.
<br>The nudity is actually a welcome addition as it&apos;s well rendered &amp; it&apos;s nice to see a developer not chickening out in fears the censors might frown a little. Most people scream about it &amp; say it&apos;s not appropriate. That&apos;s wrong... in battlefield 3 it would be in appropriate. In this game it fits... that is it actually makes sense based on the &quot;aliens trying to take over the planet &amp; adapt&quot;. True... a race so advanced would have better ways to steal our dna but I&apos;d rather see the nudity vs a poor science montage.
<br>I&apos;d rather play this then that waste of hdd space Homefront which I also just reviewed. Guess which one got uninstalled to make way for older games?

Its not a bad game, I liked it way better than Modern Warfare 2, but it could have been better on so many levels. That is why this game is getting such horrible reviews, everyone was expecting so much more from a game that was in some sort of development for 14 years. This game has one thing that most other games do not you can interact with almost everything, pool tables, tvs, phones, games, slot machines light switches the list goes on these are some things I would like to see in other games instead of just running from point a to point b killing everything in site on your way through the game. I would give this game a 10 but I don&apos;t think that would be fair to The Duke because 3d Realms and Gearbox have failed us all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1673832">Expand</a></span>

Steam threw it on sale for $9.99 and I figured it was worth the risk to see what the complaints were all about. In short, it&apos;s a great game. If you don&apos;t know what Duke Nukem is about, you are in for a surprise. This is an ADULT game for sure, and no one under 18 should even get near it. Or those with aversions to dirty humor. Too many people took DNF way too serious because I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t know the history of the original game. Honestly, I really like this game. I&apos;m running it on an NVidia GTX560 card on full resolution and it doesn&apos;t look bad at all.  Although for $59 dollars I would expect better quality graphics, but it&apos;s not bad at all. Check out a few screen shots I took. http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/644/dukeforever201110130206.jpg<br>http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/6488/dukeforever201110130240.jpg<br>http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/8143/dukeforever201110130253.jpg<br><br>The playability is great with smooth movement and good feeling movement. Basic first person shooter feel and controls. There are tons of fun and silly things to do and find along the way with rewards if you do them. I honestly think had this game been priced lower around $20-$30 bucks, it would have gotten much better reviews. I think the majority of bad reviews are from people who don&apos;t know Duke Nukem and what the game and character is about. This is NOT a game to be taken seriously. Enjoy it for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793879">Expand</a></span>

People don&apos;t understand what the game went through to be released, as it was trapped in &quot;development hell&quot; for a great deal of time. During the time between 1996-2011 at its release the game went through numerous developers, with the resulting developers being a collaboration of 3D Realms, Triptych Games, Gearbox Software and Piranha Games. Why so many? I&apos;ll tell you why: The development began with 3D Realms with the announce of the game in April of 1997. By 2009, after years of statements saying the game would be released when it was ready, 3D Realms was substantially downsized due to financial issues, and as was the development team for DNF. After a lawsuit was filed by the games publishing rights holder, Take-Two Interactive, and a large amount of political issues struck, it was announced that 14 years after the games announce, Gearbox Software took development, and would be released in 2011. During the development the project was scraped, and redone several times from the arrival of the Unreal Engine, the transferring to different teams, and nearly any development being done during the fiasco of the lawsuits. Pressure on Gearbox is what made the game what it became, as they were practically given an empty plate to work with, and had a brief period of time to create one of the most highly anticipated, and classic video game characters in the next generation of games. Now with the history lesson over I can move on to the review. Duke Nukem Forever is by no means a bad game as it is being rated. Essentially the game was created to give new breath to the extremely old franchise, and bring back the classic game play of old school shooters. The game was not made to be new and revolutionary once it was given to Gearbox Software, contrary to 3D Realms&apos; claims. The game play of the game is nearly identical to a classic &quot;run &apos;n gun&quot; style, with basic puzzles and platforming to break up the constant action. As well as this there are sequences during the game that truly showcase the personality, and feel of Duke Nukem, being the beginning of the game, and during a level at a strip club. As for critics of the graphics, they clearly were not playing the game the way it was meant to be played. The game was created to run on the PC, and that is the only way to experience The Duke properly. On a decent gaming PC I found the graphics to be on par with most others, and did not experience any lacking of texture detail unlike the ported Xbox 360 version, which I also played to compare. In terms of graphics, they were better then I expected, and I expected nothing less then amazing. Every character model, while evolved much from their original design (to be expected being 15 years since the last FPS Duke Nukem), bring nostalgia of the good old days of The King. The sounds of the game are good, nothing amazing, but the voice of Duke Nukem is where this game shines. As with the way everyone expects a Duke Nukem game to be, there is a non-stop barrage of wise-cracking, very adult, one-liners that make Duke the character he is. Truly the best part of the game, and one of the most memorable parts of the game.<br>The multiplayer to the game is rather bland, and nothing too addictive, but if you love Duke Nukem, you&apos;ll enjoy the multiplayer. Duke Nukem Forever is by no means a bad game, but by no means is it a must buy at full price. Being a fan of the original Duke Nukem games I wish I could allow bias love for the character to impact my review, but to be honest, and truthful I can&apos;t. If your a Duke Nukem fan this game is far above a 6 for you, and you&apos;ll end up playing the game several times like me. If you are not familiar with The Duke and looking for a game to jump into the franchise (well either your of age, and you were living under a rock for 25 years, or your too young to know of Duke Nukem 3D and shouldn&apos;t be paying an M-rated game) DNF is not the best game to jump into the franchise, and warrants a worse rating then a 6. The crude, and rude humour of DNF is what gives the game it&apos;s feel so the sensitive individuals should not play this game either. Overall a prime example of Duke Nukem on the modern console. A great throwback to the old days alongside Doom, and Quake. As a huge Nukem fan I can&apos;t wait for the next one. Hail to the King, baby! Step on up, and get some!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085529">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s streamlined to hell like most other console FPS shooters these days and i pretty much just moved forward and pressed fire the whole game to win it....But thats how most of these new shiny wrapper no content games are now....why pick on Duke lol, the rest are just as bad. I can&apos;t play FPS games much anymore its like my brain starts to devolve back to a primal state they are so dumbed down and simple, atleast Duke has breasts to keep my attention...and well another complaint the game was too short, another casualty of the new age of bimbo games, the original had 3 chapters all larger than the whole single player campaign it its entirety.
<br>But like i said it deserves better than 54...thats just trololol. Same for Mass Effect3 it got destroyed by the fans for some minor faults...tbh i just think some people are NEVER satisfied or impartial.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=2645133">Expand</a></span>

I finished it on Hard and played with NVIDIA 3D and I had a great time.  There is some really nice puzzle aspects and platform aspects that are missing from most modern shooters that harken back to an age where games tried to kick your ass and didn&apos;t hold your hand.
<br>The games biggest fault is a lack of consistency to the quality which is likely the result of so many hands in the development.  I picked it up on the cheap, so that certainly factors in to the expectations, but I think people who previously enjoyed Duke games will enjoy Duke Nuken Forever and new players will certainly have a fun time. Props to everyone involved that got this to market.  I look forward to more adventure with Duke as long as I don&apos;t have to wait more than another decade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524964">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics are basic but they will play on a low end system.
<br>gameplay is basic but could be fun if your new to FPS shooters.
<br>
<br>My main gripes are,
<br>Load times every few minutes. Most FPS games at least allow you to finish a level before the load screen.
<br>
<br>&quot;2 weapon limit, makes the freeze gun and shrink ray pointless since you have to keep hold of weapons that are reliable.
<br>
<br>I love t1ts as much as the next man but this game is supposed to be an 18 not a 12 cert for wanking prepubesants. Is this what Duke has been lowered to: searching for **** and f***ng pocorn. ffs
<br>
<br>no story
<br>
<br>boring
<br>
<br>I couldn&apos;t wait to get Bioshock 2 loaded back up which , thankfully, I had put on hold to play DNF. At least I had a good proper fps game to look forward to.
<br>
<br>As i mentioned at the start, Duke3d got huge play time, DNF will never be played again and I can;&apos;t even sell the sh1t on because of steam account.
<br>
<br>If I read one more post of someone saying &quot; ooh arn&apos;t Gearbox so ace for taking up the mantle and actually getting Duke out here&quot; I think i&apos;ll scream. No they are not great they are a bunch of greedy barstewards who saw a quick buck from a huge character that millions of devoted fans have been awaiting for years and years, **** ot not they were always going to make a shed load.
<br>
<br>Reminds me of the Sex Pistols....&quot;ever felt you&apos;ve been had&quot;.

Maybe this game isn&apos;t top notch quality, but much worse games are getting better scores (dragon age 2 *rollseyes*) and considering that scale this game definitely  deserves better treatment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1728471">Expand</a></span>

I remember when Duke Nukem 3D shareware came out, and ever since the shareware came out, I wanted to play Duke Nukem 3D. I was totally amazed by the game. Eventually I started hearing about Duke Nukem Forever. I was excited for the new game, but I kept hearing that the game would be delayed for further notice. So, over the years I started to forget about the game and felt like it would never come out. However, I was wrong. When Duke Nukem Forever demo came out, I was excited but disappointed. However, I only thought to myself this is only a demo and not the full game. When the full game out, I played a little on the PS3. I loved it, but I didn&apos;t like the controls for it, but when I got it for the PC, I was very happy with the game. This game totally takes me back to the 1990s. This game does remind me of Duke Nukem 3D, but however it is missing something. The multiplayer was a disappointment because I remember Duke Nukem 3D had more levels to play with when playing online. I do miss the space levels from Duke Nukem 3D, and I wish they were on the 4th one. I can only think the Hive was a replacement of space levels, but who knows? Other than that, I love the gameplay of this game because you can interact with your environment, such as playing slots or air hockey with someone. The parodies are funny, but not as funny as the 3rd one. All and all, this is a good old fashion game with some new things to bring to the table for Duke Nukem. That is why I give this game a 9 on a 1 to 10 scale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1682432">Expand</a></span>

Duke Nukem has given me some obnoxiously fun gaming that I haven&apos;t had in quite some time (except maybe insurance fraud in Saints Row 2). I was laughing throughout the entire campaign. It&apos;s a non-stop parody of greatness. It&apos;s hard to describe how many games and movies were spoofed on, but the obvious one is Half-Life 2. There&apos;s pieces of Alien and Matrix, plus Schwarzenegger movies. The one-liners are delivered to perfection--creative, witty, and absolutely vulgar in every way. This game must have annoyed the hell out of the early reviewers because a 30 metascore out of the gate is just unwarranted. Now it&apos;s up to 54...better, but give me a break. No where near as bad as those vaginas make it out to be. Seriously, this game must have been reviewed by feminists, homosexuals, or just plain **** that can&apos;t handle some **** in their face. And yes--lots of boobie action to be had here. An epic knockout. Duke Nukem Forever delivers. Highly enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=1989267">Expand</a></span>

<br>This sequel features decent-to-good level design, and a nice set of enemies to fight.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is more modern since you cannot carry all weapons and your health refills along time.
<br>
<br>One disappointing thing comes with the relative low efficiency of some weapons you imagined more potent (relative to the ego of the character), namely the revolver and the shotgun. So you end up gunning down aliens mostly with the triple cannon machinegun.
<br>
<br>The story is purely decorative and the characters flat as a carpet. Half of the time the soldiers are coward and stupid, but that does not make Duke intelligent or brave.
<br>
<br>It could have been a decent shooter but the game is blatantly sexist. Of course it comes with the character, but as far as I remember, all the female characters are either : horny at the mere sight of the Duke, blowjob providers, incapable of saving themselves, sex workers, alien surrogate mothers begging you to shoot them. I don&apos;t recall any female soldiers, scientists or civilians worth noticing. The developers pushed the envelope up to the following point : aliens are only abducting women, so you have to save them!
<br>
<br>Is there an irony here? Maybe aliens are in fact abducting women to protect from the Duke? That would have been a hell of a twist!
<br>
<br>So if you&apos;re confortable with that level of sexism, Duke Nukem Forever deserved a 6/7 as a shooter. Otherwise it&apos;s preferable to ignore it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-forever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4954828">Expand</a></span>
