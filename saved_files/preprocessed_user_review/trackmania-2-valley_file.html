<br>
<br>From high speed platform tracks to slow rally tracks, the Valley environment does it all. Compared to other environments, only Stadium can compare in terms of versatility and driveability, and the track editor is even better than the other titles with the addition of freely placeable blocks and cleaner block design with less clutter to get in your way. It is the most popular Trackmania environment for a reason.
<br>
<br>The main drawback... it&apos;s 20 bucks for one environment and one car. This is how Nadeo rolls, but Valley is their most expensive environment. It is worth it though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=3344399">Expand</a></span>

<br>I usually have very little attention span when it comes to games and get bored real quick but not with this game. Very addicting and rewarding when you hit that perfect run.
<br>Trackmania is the only game I would preorder without a hesitation. That says a lot given the sad state that most games ship these days.
<br>
<br>10/10 Perfect.
