<br>
<br>Yet... I feel that is possibly the best Metroidvania I have ever played (and I&apos;m always desperately searching out any that is released because on average, there is only like one good one per year) and thus find that the game deserves much more praise than it gets.
<br>
<br>Why?
<br>
<br>For one thing, no other Metroidvania has ever made me observe enemy attack patterns and adjust my own THIS much. If you blindly strike at enemies, chances are you won&apos;t get very far. Which is in fact also something that people have complained about. Probably because they simply don&apos;t realize that with this game, you need to take your time in most battles. And learn to dodge. Which is probably why there is the dash move instead of a double jump (which does exist but you get only very late in the game).
<br>
<br>For another, it is gorgeous AND really well-designed. Yes, those two are separate things. By the latter I mean the way things work in the game. It&apos;s not just the combat system that has obviously been thought about a lot and that is REALLY unique (the person at Rock Paper Shotgun who wrote that review IMO has no clue what they&apos;re talking about). Also the many details and mechanics in the world, such as the many characters one can find and interact with. Also like being e.g. able to achieve piece with a faction in the game which not only affects the bosses but also the surrounding environments. Widespread change in behavior that I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen in a Metroidvania before.
<br>It is also HUGE! I&apos;ve been playing for over 25 hours now and I&apos;m still on my first playthrough! And it&apos;s not just that the world is big but there are over 100 different of those hand-animated enemies. The amount of work gone into that must&apos;ve been insane! Now... I must admit that probably because of that, the animation quality varies. Some elements were obviously drawn with less frames per second than others and thus stutter a bit. But still... for a game priced this low, it&apos;s mind-boggling and I already feel like I&apos;ve gotten my money&apos;s worth and then some.
<br>
<br>All of that said, Hollow Knight definitely has the flaws mentioned in the beginning. While I have not encountered bad performance myself (and I&apos;m running this on a 4 year old midrange graphics card), nor any bugs, I doubt that people would make this up. (While it may be up to optimization in this case, I actually feel that it&apos;s great if a 2D game has so much going on visually that it requires an at least somewhat beefy graphics card.)
<br>
<br>And I do find the map system bad and also don&apos;t appreciate the relatively infrequent save points. Once the map is uncovered and you have some abilities unlocked and you can plan a reasonable route, it&apos;s not so bad but getting there does feel annoying at times, since one can&apos;t just play the game at one&apos;s own pace but has to look for the next save point if one wants to take a break. Plus, it always seems like a cheap way of making games seem longer than they are - having you repeat areas leading up to a boss over and over. And the game world is so huge that it wouldn&apos;t be needed - so I really don&apos;t get why they decided to do this.
<br>
<br>In the end, in my opinion the many original aspects of the game make the negative aspects lose almost all importance. Of course I hope that the sequel (there simply has GOT to be a sequel. Or at least a spiritual successor) will not suffer from these issues. But I&apos;m still having one hell of a time with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7142399">Expand</a></span>

Well-crafted level design, INCREDIBLE (truly stunning) world design, a tear-jerking soundtrack, and solid, fun gameplay all combine into a game I couldn&apos;t be happier with. The story begins lighthearted and whimsical, as you play as a bug in a bug-eat-bug world, but over the course of the journey you realize the depth and grandeur of what&apos;s past and what&apos;s at stake, bringing you to one of three conclusions that earn their weight in the story. My eyes welled with tears during the final battle.
<br>
<br>If you like 2D sidescrollers, &quot;metroidvanias,&quot; and fun, soulful indie games, you&apos;d be foolish to avoid this one for the VERY reasonable price of 15 dollars on Steam. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7210294">Expand</a></span>

Make sure you persist through the initial couple of areas as the game gets more and more beautiful as you go on. The enemy and boss designs are wonderful and the amount of content is unbelievable considering the size of the development team. Can&apos;t recommend this game enough.</span>

Altho it borrows from Darks Souls a lot, I still feel they did a really wonderful game on its own. Some of the powerups feel pointless compared to others, but at least there is a lot to chose from, All in all, I have to say this is my favorite game this year so far. Highly recommended.</span>

You&apos;re going to like this game, probably a lot. If there are any criticism to be made I will say that:
<br>
<br>1) The game is a little bit of a slow starter and it wasn&apos;t until maybe 3h in that the game really clicked for me. You don&apos;t have many abilities in the beginning and at first I didn&apos;t realize how big the game was going to be or how advanced the combat and movement would become.
<br>2) The difficulty is quite high in places and there is no &quot;easy mode&quot;. This is by no means a casual game but one which will force you to learn enemy attack patterns, unlock all movement options and get all the upgrades you can find. I think a difficulty selector would have made the game accessible to more people.
<br>3) I would have welcomed the possibility to equip more &quot;charms&quot;, maybe 15 notches or so would have  been nice. It would have made my playstyle more flexible so you&apos;re not locked into &quot;either a sword or magic or health focus&quot; type build. It would also have gone some ways towards leviating the difficulty concerns for a lot of people.
<br>4) Late game traversing the game world can be a bit of a chore since fast travel is quite limited. I think they&apos;re rolling out some kind of feature to fix that now but when I was playing this wasn&apos;t available.
<br>
<br>I will also say that a game controller is highly recommended, I used an xbox controller and that worked great. And if you also have a 100hz monitor or more that&apos;s even better, this game is quite fast and has tight timings so a slow TV might not be the best option.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7422309">Expand</a></span>

A very challenging and rewarding experience and would be a great fit if you are bored with games that hold you hand too much. The music and graphics are just on point. However, the developers need to adjust some of the bosses and areas. They can be super imbalanced or poorly designed sometimes and are so frustrating that I don&apos;t enjoy it and want to quit.</span>

The graphics are superb, the combat was fun and responsive, good music and great NPC and enemy designs. I loved exploring the huge and expansive world of Hollownest. I know many didn&apos;t like the map system but I very rarely got lost and I didn&apos;t mind having to go and find the cartographer to be to see the map. The difficulty was perfectly balanced, I felt. Every time I died, I thought it was because I wasn&apos;t doing good enough and not because the game was being cheap. And I died quite a few times. It was never too easy and never too difficult. I also thought the punishment of being sent back to your last save spot after death was appropriate. I really didn&apos;t mind the punishment all that much. I know a lot of people complained of performance issues but I didn&apos;t experience any problems while playing. The only thing that I don&apos;t much care for is how cryptic and hard to understand the story is. But maybe that&apos;s a good thing. Less is more after all. I do love how intriguing and mysterious all the characters (living and dead) and environments are. After putting almost 50 hours into this game I can say it&apos;s one my new all time favorite games. When it gets released on the Switch, I&apos;m absolutely buying and playing it again. Definitely the best game of 2017.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7254306">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s certainly one of the most well-crafted Metroidvanias I&apos;ve played. The controls are super tight, making combat feel fast, impulsive, and fun, which provides an excellent contrast to the dour and hopeless tone given off by the excellent score, sound design, visual style, and world design. They really made a game fairly comparable to Dark Souls in tone and even in some of the mechanics. The combination of brutal, fast-paced combat and intriguingly depressing aesthetic and level design has kept me coming back, making me excited to revisit previously visited areas of the game upon unlocking new abilities. Luckily, this game gives you plenty of excuses to do this, and there is truly a lot to do in this game; I&apos;m only about 23 hours in and I&apos;m not even 60% of the way to completing the game. I am aware that other people have experienced technical hiccups in their playthroughs but I have only experienced one significant bug during a boss fight, but it&apos;s in no way a pervasive problem. Additionally, for the PC master race out there, this game runs at a nearly flawless 60 fps on my laptop, and I believe higher end machines have been able to play it at even higher frame rates. In every aspect, from the technical to the aesthetic to the mechanical, Hollow Knight is a gem that should not be overlooked. It deserves to stand alongside indie darlings like Braid, Limbo, and Bastion as a true testament to the capability of a small team with a coherent vision.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7287666">Expand</a></span>

<br>- fluid, addictive gameplay
<br>- Tough-but-fair difficulty level that makes it genuinely gratifying to beat a tough boss or Colosseum challenge, without becoming a chore
<br>- absolutely STUNNING art and music, possibly the best-looking 2D game I&apos;ve ever played
<br>- Big map with tons of enemy and environment variety, while maintaining signature whimsical-yet-spooky aesthetic throughout
<br>- Lots of rewards for diligent exploration and effective combat, your character constantly grows stronger and more capable
<br>- Insanely good value for the money. I bought it on sale for $10, it was easily worth 3x that much
<br>
<br>For the sake of thoroughness, a couple cons:
<br>- People like me who are not hardcore gamers should probably use a guide for the midgame, since it is not always great about nudging you where to go next and there are many, many different paths you can explore. I see many negative reviews are by people who got frustrated with all the dead ends and false starts, and I see their point. Some people like that kind of thing, but others should find a spoiler-free guide that at least points them in the right direction. The game is challenging enough without constantly being lost.
<br>- Similarly, unless you are thorough about locating stag stations and breakable walls to help you get around, all the traversing and backtracking can eventually become dull. I eventually cheated and looked at a map to find these things and I&apos;m glad I did, the game would&apos;ve dragged badly without knowing where they are (I also regret not getting the Dream Gate until very late in the game).
<br>- Although I like lots of individual story elements, I don&apos;t really like the overall story itself. Your character is basically a pawn in the conflict between the Pale King and the Radiance, both of whom are vaguely defined, sinister, and unsympathetic. The different endings all just give a sense that your character has been used, not that you did the right thing and saved the day. I get that they&apos;re going for a Dark Souls thing that&apos;s all about ambiguity and ambiance, but I don&apos;t think it really works. Ultimately a story needs a clear conflict with clear motivations or you can&apos;t get emotionally invested and there&apos;s no catharsis.
<br>
<br>Overall though it&apos;s a phenomenal game (it still blows me away that the development team is just 3 people) and highly recommended for anyone who enjoys 2D platformers and Metroidvanias.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7790945">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Almost all of the game is near perfect. From the atmosphere to the difficulty curve to the storytelling to the level/enemy design all of it does what a game like this should do and more. The amount of different systems for character upgrades is so big most other games with similar scopes to their upgrade systems would make the player feel overwhelmed but this game doesn&apos;t - almost all of which are usable in certain play styles. Some of the less taught, less mandatory systems you can go the whole game without realizing that they exist and yet not feel like you played an incomplete game. The controls feel natural and responsive. The bosses are well designed and for the most part fair (there is one minor gripe I have with one of them out of like 20 because it has a random chance issue that has a chance to screw you into taking damage before it is possible to react). To top it all of it is only 15$ (currently on sale for closer to 10) for the amazing 20-40 hr metroidvania that is Hollow knight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7377704">Expand</a></span>

<br>+One of the best soundtracks in years.
<br>+Addictive, honestly.
<br>Overall, it&apos;s one of the best games I&apos;ve played this year. You should most CERTAINLY get this game. Ignore the negative reviews down below. I feel as if the people giving the lower reviews aren&apos;t familiar with how these types of games are played. Sad, really.</span>

<br>In case the ending is awful I havent finished it but the tale is of retribution in a poisened land.

<br>Yes its familiar but it is so lovingly presented and told the cliches do not stick in the mind - the clever level design and frantic button mashing does instead.

<br>That shortcoming aside - this is a great experience, presented so well you forget you have played a similar game before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7465800">Expand</a></span>

Incredibly atmospheric, ranging from cute and charming with the bug theme (which isn&apos;t overused in the slightest), to dark and creepy. Music and art are both great, controls are very tight, and most importantly, the world design and combat are top notch. The sheer number of cool interconnections, level varieties, mix between combat and platforming, and sheer number of things to do is incredible given that its a small indie game, and it does an excellent job of being completable for those who don&apos;t want to necessarily get 100%. Takes around 20 hours to complete casually, and around 30-40 hours to 100% (and if you metroidvanias at all, or at least enough to finish this, than you&apos;ll likely want to get 100% as well). Though there are some flaws, such as most of the bosses not being very memorable or the map system not being ideal, they are extremely heavily outweighed by positives. Very well worth the money, a true modern classic in a time where metroidvanias are making a comeback from a very long dark age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7526952">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hollow Knight is a metroidvania with enough heart to be one of the best games of 2017. There is so much to cover in this indie gem, that this review would not do it justice.
<br>instead ill rate every part of this game, with as much detail as possible without any (major) spoilers.
<br>
<br>Pacing: The game starts you off with a nail for a basic attack, a basic jump and a basic heal. There is nothing else, classic to a metroidvania. You don&apos;t even own a map to begin with. As the game goes on, you acquire said map, and basic (besides the 3rd mobility item, hell yes) mobility items which unlock areas you couldn&apos;t get to before etc. Hollow Knight does an excellent job of having a reward at the end of each area, respectful of the time you put in and bosses you faced. The game is linear for the first three areas, then branches off spectacularly. Every aspect of the pacing is near perfect, it never feels too boring or like you&apos;re being forced into an area, it is very natural. The only possible complaint I could have is that the early parts are a tiny bit too slow, maybe starting off with the dash, or acquiring it in the first section, may have been a better way to jumpstart the game.
<br>Rating: 9.5/10
<br>
<br>Combat: The combat of this game is a clear focus, they did not brush over it such as in Ori and the Blind Forest, instead Hollow Knight explores a rich and rewarding combat system. Some bosses are absolutely incredible, the final boss is in my top three final bosses of all time. However as an indie team, it was impossible to flesh out each boss, so some, *cough* were not very interesting. One such boss only had a single attack and is easily cheesed, very underwhelming . The enemies in Hollow Knight had decent variety with some reproducing old enemies such as in a certain battle arena, but this is excused by the ridiculously large amount of enemies there were in a $15 game. The combat is beautifully fleshed out through these &apos;charms&apos;, with all of such being interesting and adding a new dimension to the combat. The charms are extremely polished and the idea of making some interact dynamically with others is genius.
<br>Rating: 9.3/10
<br>
<br>Controls: The controls of Hollow Knight are perfect, to a dot. I spent ages trying to think of a way to improve controls (on pc) but I could not find a single way. This is not to say that it won&apos;t take a while to get used to but when you make a mistake it is always, always your fault. The controls are tight, rigid and are a perfect compliment to combat and exploration.
<br>Rating: 10/10
<br>
<br>Exploration: When I set foot in one of the new areas, I spent a good 2 minutes sitting on a bench with another little bug ravelling in the beautiful scenery and accompanied harp and vocals. That area was such a contrast to anything I had seen thus far. If Hollow Knight can do one thing perfectly, its contrasting one area to another. Leaving the bleak forgotten crossroads and entering into a beautiful far more light area (to avoid details) was refreshing, and kept me wanting to see more of this world. Some area&apos;s require vigorous trial and error and double-checking to find every little charm or geo deposit. I can confirm after even 75 hours in this world, I still find videos of people finding new areas I had never seen. Even in a &quot;100%&quot; run, you don&apos;t find everything, there is still more to find and discover.
<br>Rating: 9.7/10
<br>
<br>Soundtrack: After listening to each track through full after purchasing the soundtrack, I had a new level on top of my already high appreciation for the superb soundtrack. It is so, damn, good. There is not a single track the feels out of place or weak in any way. Of course not to say some are not better than others, listening to the final boss fight&apos;s music gave me goosebumps; a perfect concoction of intensity, power, urgency and funereal feelings of &quot;oh my god, this is it&quot;, I have felt in a long time. For comparison, for me it is on-par with Undertale and Nier-Automata.
<br>Rating: 9.8/10
<br>
<br>Verdict (and anything else I didn&apos;t cover) I paid $15 for a $30 dollar game. Hollow Knight is an absolute must-have an a steal in every respect for anybody who likes a challenging, dark, uplifting journey of a bug on it&apos;s journey through the kingdom of Hallownest. I didn&apos;t even mention the art, which is absolutely incredible in every way, wow, but I don&apos;t have the characters for that.
<br>
<br>I hope that this review will just get ONE person, to consider playing Hollow Knight.
<br>
<br>If that person is you, you will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7563270">Expand</a></span>

Both statements are true but simultaneously grossly inadequate. Hollow Knight is so much more than the sum of its parts and trying to create a concise, yet complete description is difficult at best. It is massive, beautiful and challenging and while it isn&#x2019;t perfect it&#x2019;s few flaws are easily forgiven thanks to its sheer brilliance.
<br>
<br>From the outset Hollow Knight provides few hints on the direction forward. The game proper begins when you descend to the ruins under the town of Dirtmouth where you face your first decision &#x2013; left or right.
<br>
<br>What begins as a slightly maddening lack of direction soon becomes an exhilarating sense of freedom. While Hollow Knight has its share of rewards in items and the game&#x2019;s currency, geo, the real reward is just seeing what&#x2019;s on the other side. After 30 hours Hollow Knight was still able to surprise me in both presentation and diversity of location, characters and enemies. Make no mistake, this beautiful game.
<br>
<br>The art direction and animations are stunning, as is the soundtrack, and the NPCs  have a surprising amount of character.   Exploring this world is a pure joy and a reward unto itself. Even having finished the game I still have an incredible desire to examine every inch, to find every secret and to see every single thing the game has to offer.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s a massive world and the map system is unique and worth addressing because it can be challenging. Upon entering a new area you will not have a map until you  discover the NPC Conifer. He&#x2019;ll sell you a map but only the parts of that area you&#x2019;ve been in will display. It is then updated at check points, assuming you have purchased the quill, as you continue to explore.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s an interesting design decision and one that I really came to enjoy as I progressed. I can navigate around most of the zones in Hollow Knight better than the streets in my own suburb, because I actually need to remember the way.
<br>
<br>As you traverse the huge game world below Dirtmouth you will encounter a vast array of enemies. Your foes begin with the simplest of attacks, as do you, a simple swing of your nail. While your foes will become more difficult and combat both quick and mobile, the pacing in the early parts of the game is very slow. If you came expecting a Diablo click fest you are going to be sorely disappointed, especially early on.
<br>
<br>That being said, do not expect to stroll through Hollow Knight without breaking a sweat. &#x2026; or possibly a controller or two. The difficulty of the game ramps up significantly and there are some particularly difficult boss encounters, as well as a couple of maddeningly hard platforming sections. Boss encounters are a huge highlight of the game and a great reminder that games are meant to be challenging. If you expect to roll up to an encounter and successfully completely it within one or two attempts this game is probably not for you. It certainly doesn&#x2019;t have a Dark Souls level of difficulty, but you really do need to learn each encounter &#x2013; and then execute the combat well &#x2013; before being able to proceed. The payoff is an incredible relief and satisfaction when overcoming a particularly hard section of the game. It&#x2019;s been a long time since I&#x2019;ve experienced such a rush at victory in gaming and it&#x2019;s a welcome and highly addictive return.
<br>
<br>The difficulty of the some sections highlights, painfully, the one major issue I have with Hollow Knight, the checkpoint system. The game auto saves regularly, but you respawn at the last bench you rested on and there are generally only two or three in each area. While I&#x2019;m sure there is some rhyme or reason behind their placement I couldn&#x2019;t see it and they are occasionally frustratingly far from difficult encounters. This means spending a couple of minutes making your way back to your most recent defeat, often through a number of enemies, before engaging in an encounter that has already been kicking your ass for far longer than you would care to admit. More often than not you&#x2019;ll respawn pretty close, but it happens enough to make some deaths far more painful than they should have been.
<br>
<br>The other purpose the rest stations serve is to let you change your charms. Charms cater to the RPG element, allowing players the choice of powered up abilities, increased survivability or simple quality of life improvements. There are far more charms than slots available so some thought is required when it comes to charm selection..
<br>
<br>Hollow Knight is a triumph of the metroidvania genre. Team Cherry have created an incredible world, filled with variety, charm and wonder. It was a pure joy to explore Hallownest and incredibly satisfying to finish the game. The combat is challenging with a number of particularly memorable boss encounters and the old school difficulty is well balanced and hugely gratifying. Put simply, Hollow Knight is magnificent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7084083">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only reason I&apos;m giving it a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because the map can be confusing and I found myself getting lost and doing a lot of backtracking. I think I am below average when it comes to memorizing map layouts in general though, so take it with a pinch of salt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7098115">Expand</a></span>

The game starts off slow; it feels a bit cartoony at first but later into the game you realize that it&apos;s a pretty dark game full of rich areas and even richer characters. The game is definitely influenced by Dark Souls, and it fuses that influence in a Metrovania style game beautifully.</span>

I won&apos;t lie, Hollow Knight is a brutal game and not for a casual play through. The game starts off pretty easy but ramps up exceedingly after roughly the second boss at which point you really need to invest yourself into the game and how it&apos;s mechanics and upgrades work in order to succeed. Many a time I found my self hitting a wall, getting frustrated and having to take a break, only to come back more composed and crush said wall with such satisfaction that I&apos;ve only felt from Dark Souls and Blood Born.
<br>
<br>When I found my sweet spot I was suddenly blitzing through area after area looking for secrets and treasure being surprised and how many things are hidden. The game is a very decent length but totally doesn&apos;t feel it, by the time you&apos;re wrapping up all things in order to get the true final boss you can easily clock 30+ hours with very little of it feeling tedious.
<br>
<br>My biggest flaws with Hollow Knight are mostly to do with things like &quot;end lag&quot; on abilities and not being able to &quot;jump cancel&quot; others. With such a fluid, tight controlling game it&apos;s shame the combat doesn&apos;t go that little bit extra but these are very niche personal complaints that many people won&apos;t notice.
<br>
<br>Over all Hollow Knight represents the highest form of a challenging game play and should be treated as a such with any negatives reviews mentioning difficulty being void.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7101021">Expand</a></span>

The year just started but it is already acontender for GOTY. It is not quite as hard as the Souls games but it still feels very rewarding when you beat one of the countless bosses. it has a massive world and a lot to discover. for the asking price this game is definitely a steal. The devs are nice and working with the community to fix everything and patch in new content.

The level design is superb and there are lots of shortcuts and secret ways that make it fast and fun to traverse the locations. The combat is super tight, each enemy requires its own tactics, and you can feel every hit you make. The art and soundtrack... just watch the trailers, they are awesome.
<br>
<br>The game offers little directions, so you can only figure out where to go by exploring the world. Initially you do not even have a map for locations (you need to find the cartographer and buy it). This may put some people off, but I personally loved it.
<br>

The game isn&apos;t bad, it does make the &quot;Arcade&quot;/&quot;nu-Action Adventure&quot; genre well, but the rating we see of 8+ is seriously overvalued. Their quality assurance team/guy had a severe lack of perspective of how frustrating it can be to a beginner to the game. It throws you in an environment that explains NOTHING, and while that *CAN* be good, it is NOT done well. First of all you collect a currency that is apparently extremely important in the game. But, the game tells you zero information about it. That could be fine and well if it didn&apos;t have a mechanic that zeroes your currency without ever being informed that can be possible. Not only that, but it throws the player immediately into some of its most hard to navigate and survive levels. In general the game tries to keep a &quot;mystery&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; element, but it becomes a disaster because it overdoes it with those two elements. Games are boring when they are too easy, or when they are too hand-holded, that is true, but this has passed the threshold of excess. In no way it is excessive for all people, otherwise it wouldn&apos;t deserve even a 6, but in my opinion this game is extremely overrated due to its ability to frustrate a lot if not most people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7224788">Expand</a></span>

Get this if you are a fan of:
<br>
<br>- focus on exploration and combat. Seriously, this game&apos;s map is ridiculously large and filled with interesting things to find. It feels like you are exploring an actual world instead of a bunch of different levels. You will be rewarded with new abilities, optional bosses, equipment, NPC dialogue and other things I won&apos;t spoil
<br>
<br>- interesting characters. They&apos;re everywhere. Some of them you will find in multiple locations (in a way that is reminiscent of Dark Souls quest lines)
<br>
<br>- Beautiful art.. Probably the best looking Metroidvania style game to date
<br>
<br>- Challenging gameplay. It starts of very tame, but ramps up smoothly. Some of the optional bosses take a lot of practice
<br>
<br>- Attention to detail. Every room has its own character. There is a huge amount of background art and the enemy variety is through the roof. Keeps adding tons of new enemies until the very end
<br>
<br>- Cryptic storytelling. Again, if you&apos;ve played Dark Souls you&apos;ll feel right at home. The story is mostly told through NPC dialogue and the world itself.
<br>
<br>The only negative points I find worth mentioning are on the technical side of things. There are random framedrops here and there and the pause menu&apos;s navigation (and only that menu) navigation is slow. That&apos;s all I can come up with. On a more subjective note, if you are easily frustrating by navigating through complex maps, this game is probably not for you, as often you won&apos;t be able to rely on your map for various reasons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7077117">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The good:
<br>
<br>* The level design is great and every overworld feels expansive
<br>* Hollow Knight controls fluidly and attacks feel responsive
<br>* In terms of presentation, the game is extremely polished and well thought out.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>
<br>* The pacing of the game is very bad in the beginning. Most players will struggle to find upgrades for Hollow Knight and while some areas are clearly inaccessible due to lack of upgrades, there are simply too many instances of inaccessibility to keep track of. This is something that Metroid games do well; they give you enough cognitive load so that you can understand what you can come back for without feeling overwhelming. They do this by keeping the scope small at first and then gradually opening the game.
<br>* The game itself is very unfun. Most of the areas, while extremely polished, look exactly the same and aren&apos;t really very unique. The game really didn&apos;t keep me engaged as I would have liked from a modern sidescroller and I found myself getting bored often. The combat, while responsive, also isn&apos;t very fun. Maybe I didn&apos;t unlock enough parts of Hollow Knight, but an hour and a half in I still hadn&apos;t found any upgrades to spice things up or make it easier to kill enemies.
<br>* The enemies are mostly unoriginal. You&apos;ll find your same old walkers, sprinters, jumpers, knights, etc. Some bosses have the same types of attacks and weaknesses. I would have liked to see some more creative enemies that aren&apos;t so similar. Games like Shovel Knight do this well; enemies are extremely varied, have different properties, and bosses usually have very unique mechanics.
<br>* The sound is very hit or miss, mostly being a miss. The thwacks and the thumps of being engaged in combat aren&apos;t satisfying and a lot of creatures sound mostly the same. It&apos;s almost as if the sound designer had no idea what compression is.
<br>* You lose all of your credits when you die. This was quite possibly the most frustrating thing for me. I was on my way to grab an item in Dirtmouth when I ran into a boss while having low health and naturally, I died. It spawned me at a save station and all of that progress I had made was gone. This seems like a really outdated mechanic and I would like to see other solutions that don&apos;t involve losing all of your progress. Maybe provide a save station next to boss encounters or restart boss encounters given that your players will be fighting the boss many times... etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7182465">Expand</a></span>

It is also not an easy game; you will die a fair amount.  If you aren&apos;t up for a challenge this may not be the game for you, but if you are a masochist like me you&apos;ll love the controller spiking, curse inducing deaths that are inevitable.  There is also a TON of content; the trailer showed a massive map that I&apos;ve only just scratched the surface on and I&apos;m eight hours in!  There are over 1 hundred enemies and over 30 bosses!  We are absolutely spoiled to get this gem for $16!  If you are a fan of metroidvanias that aren&apos;t going to hold your hand, you owe it to yourself to play Hollow Knight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6993386">Expand</a></span>

It makes you want to throw your joystick at the wall. Although I like it, I always leave it with a feeling of un-satisfaction. I&apos;ve played a lot of games when the norm is to die a lot. Not the case here - as the norm is to be annoyed a lot instead.</span>

<br>This is a game about being wandering around lost in a network of gorgeous caves. But when I mean lost, I don&apos;t mean &quot;lost in thought&quot; or &quot;lost in wonder&quot;, I mean lost as in &quot;walking back and forth with no idea where you&apos;re are or where you&apos;re supposed to be going. The late game really goes off the rails, giving you destinations but no idea how to get there. How do you get to boss in the bottom of the map? Going to the far top right of the map, of course, and getting an easily-missed upgrade! I didn&apos;t check one path because I thought I had already been there, and paid for it with literally over three hours of wandering. This game can NOT be played without a guide.
<br>
<br>There is more to this game, but the vast majority is wandering around lost, so I won&apos;t get into too much detail. Combat is tight but extremely repetitive - you use your basic sword (called a Nail) for the entire game. Your &quot;special attacks&quot; amount to a magic blast up, a magic dive down, and a magic ball forward. You get all three seperately to enhance the illusion of progression and variety.
<br>
<br>There is one good thing to say, though! This game is gorgeous. There&apos;s no two ways about it! Almost the entirety of the game takes place underground, but despite this every area is distinct and the ambiance is different. The shining and ethereal Crystal Peak, the creepy Deepnest, the desolate Dirtmouth, and the barren Ancient Basin. Best of all is the City of Tears, an ancient, abandoned city where it is contantly &quot;raining&quot;.
<br>
<br>But really, this is a game to watch, not one worth playing. Get some poor sucker to play it nearby and enjoy the ambience from a distance. Otherwise you&apos;re going to be spending hours hunting that one switch in that one room that will open the path to that one ability that will let you get to that one quest spot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hollow-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7673235">Expand</a></span>

I am not an extremely good gamer either, so that also counts towards that.
<br>if you like metroidvania games and enjoy some challenge - this is a 9/10 game for you.
