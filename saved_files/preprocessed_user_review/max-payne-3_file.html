Ridiculously disappointing. The storyline didnt even come close to matching the first or the second game. The controls were also off and very annoying for me at times. Max will sometimes run at regular pace even while aiming which throws me off completely. And instead of using bullet time just about anytime you want you stick to taking cover over half the time. I have no interest in doing the time attack, new york minute, or multiplayer modes. Definitely not a game that&apos;s worth 60 bucks. I bought it because of the old max paynes and this one definitely does nothing to live up to those standards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2485176">Expand</a></span>

Boring story, boring gameplay, boring dialogue, and no graphic novels. Oh, and shaky camera. How novel! Yawn.<br><br>The first thing that comes out it you is a lengthy cinematic. It keeps going, and going, and going... eh? yes, still going. No, you can&apos;t skip it. For extra fun, you can&apos;t even quit the damn game while it&apos;s playing, either - the only button you have is to pause it (thanks for that! no, seriously, after the first 2 minutes of that intro I went and made some tea so I could have something to do while watching the rest of it).<br><br>While we&apos;re at it, the camera just drives me nuts. I understand that all the shaking and the occasional visual glitch effect is intended to convey the perma-drunken state of the player character, but WTF? I GOT IT ALREADY, NOW STOP IT, MY HEAD HURTS!<br><br>Dialogue... they tried real hard to copy the gritty wittiness of the original Max Payne, and failed just as hard. Max goes for irony in every second line he speaks, but it&apos;s all pretty stale and shallow, and gets boring very quick. The rest of his talk is mostly bitter complaining about how bad things are and how much worse they&apos;re going to be. Again, very repetitive, pointless and annoying. Practically no real essence in those lines, overall.<br><br>Whew, now that the cinematic is over, I can haz some slo-mo pistol headshots and stuff? Yup... for about one minute. Then it&apos;s another two-minute unskippable cinematic. Then another minute of action... and so it goes. What&apos;s worse yet, the whole purpose of those periods of no control seems to place Max in precisely the point where he (you!) will have the hardest time dealing with oncoming waves of enemies. Like, say, kicking the door into the room chock full of bad guys, and running to the most wimpy piece of furniture that can still be used for cover - standing in precisely such a location that enemies running in through any door will get a convenient shot should Max peek out. For extra fun, regardless of which gun you were using when the cinematic started, by the end of it Max will always be holding the pistol, even if it ends with a bunch of guns with shotguns barging into the room right ahead of him. Have fun practicing those pistol headshots, you&apos;ll have about a second before they unload...<br><br>As a result, unlike the original game, where judicious use of bullet time and careful approaches made it possible to progress through the game without being hurt at all, here you&apos;re guaranteed to soak damage - it&apos;s impossible to avoid being shot when you&apos;re stuck in &quot;cover&quot; where all you can do is peek out left or right, and there are five guys with submachine guns and shotguns all shooting at you when you do that. Hope you can get to the next batch of painkillers fast enough. Oh, but not to worry - when you reload from checkpoint, your damage is conveniently reset to zero (on &quot;average&quot; difficulty, at least). So in practice the sole purpose of painkillers is to get you from checkpoint to checkpoint - except that you don&apos;t know where the checkpoints are, since there&apos;s no indication that you&apos;re at one (though any cinematic is guaranteed to have one at the end).<br><br>Overall, given that most of the charm of the original game was in the well-executed noir graphic novel style, which seems to be mostly abandoned here (and the remaining elements, poorly done), I don&apos;t see much point - the gameplay alone is certainly not enticing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2450927">Expand</a></span>

The Good: As everyone agrees, the graphics, physics and whateverics are great. And that&apos;s about it. The Bad: Triggers! Triggers everywhere!!! You open that door - three guys SPAWN behind you. Blam, reload. You kill that last guy - congratulations! Cutscene! Reinforcements arrive, take your women, raze your village and fart in your general direction. Ok, cutscene is over - you&apos;re in the middle of the room, hidden behind the flimsiest object around. Oh, and you&apos;re holding a pistol. Enjoy the epic gunfight. Speaking of cutscenes - there&apos;s more than enough of them (unskippable, to boot) to confuse you for the entire game. &quot;Why am I doing that?!&quot;, &quot;Errr, shouldn&apos;t I be shooting him instead of staring?&quot;, &quot;Why am I not moving? Oh, cutscene over, right. Better press something.&quot;, &quot;Goodness gracious! Why did I just lock the door behind myself right after I wandered outside in plain view of six mooks?&quot;. And if you&apos;re still willing to endure all that for the sake of good plot and characters - you don&apos;t get either. The plot is largely non-existent and amounts to &quot;Where shall I kill today? Ah, right - in &quot;. The characters around you give you no reason to care about them, they are there just to give you a reason for killing more brazilians. And there&apos;s one important aesop - it&apos;s ok to heavily drink on the job. No one seems to care, least of all Max himself. You drank two bottles of whiskey? No problem, your aim is steady as always.<br>Maybe I&apos;m too hard on the game. But it would&apos;ve looked SO MUCH BETTER under the name &quot;GTA: Sao Paulo&quot; or, for lack of carjacking, &quot;Brazilian Shooter 3D&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2451783">Expand</a></span>

The game does live up to some of its promises. Graphics are excellent, supporting DX11 and runs smoothly at full settings on a year old rig. The storyline is well written, although somewhat hackneyed at times.
<br>
<br>However, the single player game is fraught with annoyances which get in the way of the journey. Short gameplay sequences are broken up with long cut scenes, which are almost entirely unskippable. The game claims the game is &apos;still loading&apos; for the nearly 10 minute scenes between levels. This is despite a save game loading in less than 10 seconds. This is not a problem on the first play through a level, but is a major problem if you are into replaying chapters for collectibles.
<br>
<br>The game frequently takes control, or slows you down just to open a door, in places that could easily have been played out in real time. To make matters worse, the game often will take control and move you through a door (while locks behind you inexplicably) before you have had time to search the level for hidden collectibles. In one sequence that comes to mind, the game makes you walk slowly though an area which has no enemies, yet there is no reason why you can&apos;t run.
<br>
<br>Often after a short cut-scene, you will be placed in a compromised position facing multiple enemies. The game also has a habit of switching your main rifle or shotgun to a sidearm at the same time to make life more awkward at the same time. Max also seems to have forgotten how to sling a shoulder weapon, as he must drop any large weapons to dual wield his sidearms. While this may be a tip to realism (nobody in Max Payne 3 can&apos;t afford a $5 sling it seems), it removes the old ability of being able to choose a weapon at will that was present in the original titles.
<br>
<br>For a game which has so many cutscenes, it often will provide a sidekick nearby which /*constantly*/ will be telling you to get a move on. Often they will run off and get killed while you search for clues or gun parts.
<br>
<br>To make matters worse, i have twice now been forced to replay sections because the game has mysteriously forgotton the progress I had made in the game. I believe this is because I &apos;continued&apos; a previous game by using &apos;chapter select&apos; to replay the chapter before the one I was on and just playing on. Be warned, if you do this the game will not unlock chapters properly. Make sure you finish the entire game before replaying any chapters.
<br>
<br>Overall, the graphics are good, and gameplay is often well done, but the game seems intent on constantly reminding you that it is in control and it will make you play the game how it wants, not how you want. Giving you more control would have made this a 7, but the game provides just too many frustrations. The Rockstar QA team must have gone on holiday for this release...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2457085">Expand</a></span>

As someone else pointed out, you can&apos;t even exit the game while a cut scene is going (which is the majority of your gameplay time). The environments are tiny and the action is highly scripted. Don&apos;t expect to be able to get creative with your tactics here - everything has to go according to script or you&apos;ll be doing it over.<br><br>The voice acting is fine, but the dialog is campy and never really sells the whole &quot;noir&quot; thing it&apos;s going for. I thought the investment they made in getting the character to consistently aim in the specified direction regardless of his position/movement doesn&apos;t really pay off. It just makes him seem a bit ridiculous as he contorts himself to keep his weapon pointed where you&apos;re aiming even though you&apos;re not firing. I hadn&apos;t played the previous Max Payne games, so I was intrigued by the bullet time concept. It works OK, but there are too many cases where you have to use it. The cover system doesn&apos;t work very well because there&apos;s no good way to move from cover to cover. The environments aren&apos;t big enough to flank your enemies anyway. The whole &quot;jump dodge&quot; thing looked cool in the previews, but seems a bit ridiculous in actual gameplay since you inevitably end up rolling around on the ground to shoot at the remaining bad guys.<br><br>Overall, I regret spending $60 on this game. Since you can really only play through it once, It might be worth $20 if you wait for it to get discounted. Personally, I&apos;ll be steering clear of the Max Payne series. I&apos;m much more interested in gameplay mechanics than in storyline. Hopefully Hit Man Absolution will be more compelling in that regard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2453272">Expand</a></span>

Due to the save point system, for the long shooting galleries you will have to start from square one if you die. And if you are playing on hard, you will die a lot. Still, the game is not really challenging, just frustrating and one-dimensional. I would give it a 6/10, but the game refused to load until an hour later of searching and trying methods from forums I fixed the problem. The exact same thing happened to me with LA Noire as well. Rockstar needs to beta-test their PC games more thoroughly and I need to stop buying new release PC Rockstar games. I would buy this on sale for $20 as a fun, quick way to spend a few hours before you get bored, but at $60 it is a shiny ripoff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2456607">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a perpetual game of &quot;just the tip,&quot; never letting me go too long on my own. The first two Max Payne games perfectly melded gameplay and storytelling, whereas this does so incredibly clunkily. I am taken totally out of the game, and can&apos;t enjoy what I think is actually pretty good gameplay. Not to mention the visual &quot;style&quot; of the cutscenes is so blatantly trying to be &quot;cool&quot; it makes me literally nauseous. The saving grace is that the multiplayer is quite robust and enjoyable (and not interrupted by cutscenes!), so I think that&apos;s where I&apos;ll be spending my $60 worth of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2454521">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m all about the single player experience.<br><br>And on that score, I&apos;m disappointed by Max Payne 3.<br>As a product, it&apos;s bloated (4 DVDs? Really?), wrapped up in far too much DRM and requirements to jump through hoops - why do I have to click through page after page of EULA? Why do I have to sign up to idiotic ideas like the &quot;social club&quot; when all I&apos;m interested in is the single player game? As for game play - Why is it so full of bugs? funny freezes/pauses, poor controls, un-skippable and over-acted cut-scenes that appear all too often and are concealing really really appalling load times do not a pleasant gaming experience make, Rockstar.<br><br>Once you look past that, you will get to experience an average shooter, that&apos;s quite nice looking and a bit too much tied to rails for my liking. There are some nice touches, like the player only being able to carry a few guns and having to drop some if you want to do things like dual-wield guns - this is both handled nicely and realistically and brings a touch of thought to how you play the game.<br><br>But... I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s actually a Max Payne game. Sure, someone&apos;s stuck the name &quot;Max Payne&quot; onto the player&apos;s character, and its clearly the Max Payne character&apos;s voice in the cut scenes, but the actual game doesn&apos;t *feel* like Max Payne to me.<br><br>I loved the first two Max Payne games so I really wanted to love this too, but I can&apos;t. If it was presented as a first person shooter in its own right instead of claiming the Max Payne heritage and getting it wrong then I might be happier to accept the game on its own terms - and for all the faults there is an average FPS with good graphics here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2449284">Expand</a></span>

Whats even worse - you can&apos;t load from the last checkpoint during this moments. So you have to sit through all of this, then get the chance to load the game.<br>The game has no straight rhythm - you will be constantly slowed down by unskippable cutscene. Sometimes you&apos;re in the berserk mode after good action, you killed all the enemies and want to kill more, you rush into another room and... cutscene. What the hell?!<br>Oh, and that stupid video effects! All this shaky camera, light flashes, double vision, words coming out on the screen - it may be appropriate in the beginning of the game, but NOT all the time! Also, I don&apos;t remember getting hit this much, or having to restart the checkpoint in original Max Payne.<br>One more thing - no grenades! Enemies has them, but you don&apos;t. And I don&apos;t see any excuse for this. Why, Rockstar, why?<br>Two years of disappointment - first Duke Nukem, and now this. I wonder how Hitman will turn out? But I&apos;m almost convinced now that it&apos;s going to be bad.

And I can even forgive the obvious console port issues. But the constant cut scenes totaly mess up the game play. The game constantly takes control away from you and forces you into a situation you would not normally jump into. For example, up ahead is a room full of guys trying to kill you, as you approach, the game goes to a cut scene, pushes you into the center of the room, and then &quot;over to you&quot;, lucky on 3 screens you notice the transition back to you, otherwise your dead before you know it and you &quot;oh was i back in control again&quot;. But seriously how many gamers run into the center of a room, and wait for people to start shooting before they start shooting back. And for good measure after every cut scene Max&apos;s weapon always goes back to the handgun, never mind if it actually has ammo or in most cases not, or if you already holding an epic auto shotgun. Once or twice I could forgive where it helps the story along, but literally every 10 to 15 minutes, bang cut scene, your not in control anymore. I so wanted to finish the game and explore the story. But I play games to enjoy them, not to feel irritated and frustrated by them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2450322">Expand</a></span>

The cheesy camera effects were really annoying and the combat system is clunky and doesnt feel right. The cover system is pretty bad - it feels a lot like the shooting from L.A Noire. Basically, theres not much variance in the gameplay AT ALL. All there is to do is shoot guys the same exact way except in a different setting with tons of cutscenes in between. There just isnt ever anything different. Its insane how many cutscenes there are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2457084">Expand</a></span>

I have 200+ steam games and many other big name games.  There are only a select few I dont beat, those titles are ussually indie games, but max payne is among them.  Max Payne 3 has Horrible characters, bad ideas, generic weapons, numerous eye flashing rave party cutscenes and a giant language barrier.  Stop flashing unimportant words all throughtout cutscenes I get it he said &quot;I&apos;ll have a drink&quot;  I dont need it shooting thru the scene.  This just screams bad designers filling space for their crappy little cutscene effect. You&apos;d think this game was made for spain or mexico, you won&apos;t enjoy a second of it if you dont speak spanish.  Even multiplayer ranks are all in spanish... this is cool why? sorry but I dont understand a $%*ing word and therfore have 0 interest in multiplayer now.  can&apos;t wait to rank up so I can google what my next rank will be.  Max payne kills THOUSANDS of innocent people and doesnt even figure out who hes killing?  He walks away from 50 gun fights killing fully body armored guys and everyone treats him like **** in the scene?  This game feels like duke nukem,  overhyped, linear, limited weapons, semi destructable objects and a D bag main character who says random quirky 1 liners over and over.  This is a console port, the gun select is AWFUL. good luck pulling out that gun you just grabbed in less than 5 seconds, heres a hint you wont be able to.  Max payne the D bag who kills everyone for fun WOO!  I was drunk I didn&apos;t know what was going on so I killed everyone.... huh?  Yea I won&apos;t be letting you finish your story Max,  You giant cry baby, I mix painkillers and alcohol, I destroy my liver!!  But my trusty sidekick says  &quot;You can always get a new one&quot;  like its not a big deal.  Trust me, it is a big deal.  If he really drank and took that many painkillers he would be dead by now.  You don&apos;t get a new liver if you drink, they take you off the donor list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2456320">Expand</a></span>

Who wants to sit through endless dialogs which are predictable and campy at best (ok, some of the campiness is expected, after all, it&apos;s Max Payne)  ... When first starting the game you might be lucky to actually start playing the da** game a half hour later, I kid you not! There is no way to skip the cut-scenes! Unacceptable in every way.<br><br>(2) FORCING USERS TO CREATE AN ONLINE ACCOUNT. This fact alone has done me in, I&apos;m sick and tired of every game publisher deciding (mostly through greed) to force purchasers of a game to create an online account. Are you kidding me? Twitter integration, and randomly forcing that down our throats at start up too? Has the game industry gone completely insane? Do you really think a game player wants all of this bs? Most people who want to play a game do it for relaxation and FUN. Hello, MCFly are you listening? Why do you think the casual game market is crushing large productions? Who the he** wants to wads through screen after screen of pure bs before even being able to play? When I want to play a game, I&apos;d like to be able to start playing it before the sun has to come back up again! (3) Doesn&apos;t support a modern computer. I have a pro mac 17&quot; top-of-line laster year laptop running bootcamp. I can play diabolo 3, Skyrim and everything else JUST FINE. This da** game, does not run in anything other than 1024x768, and then it doesn&apos;t even work. The graphics card I have is a 512meg Radeon HD 6750M I believe. All I have to say to Rock Star is ... I can&apos;t type what I want to! Ridiculous is an understatement. I&apos;m done with the pinball joke of the heavy-weight productions titles of the video game industry. Really, goodbye Rockstar, EA and you other jokes of a company who worry more about keeping yourself employed and making a profit instead of thinking about THE USER EXPERIENCE.<br><br>off to all of them!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2450653">Expand</a></span>

I went to restart and I had to watch the whole thing again. Every 5 minutes you get a new cutscene.  It is not a game, its a film.  The trouble is, if I wanted a film, id buy a film. This is not a game, therefor it cannot be reviewed as one.</span>

As others have mentioned, the cover system can be a bit annoying but it&apos;s not a big deal and it still works well. I crashed maybe 6-7 times. There is a little bit of static in the audio, which annoyed me after a while. The multiplayer is a bit generic but still fun. Overall I must say this game is fantastic, it&apos;s just a shame it gave me so many problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2451069">Expand</a></span>

It might actually be my favorite. So, I REALLY had my hopes up for this one.<br><br>Maybe this is a personal problem on my end, but I was under the impression that I bought a GAME, not a damned MOVIE. Having a cut scene after every minor firefight isn&apos;t fun, it just slows down the pace of the game. Making most of them un-skippable is just torture. This is made even worse by the fact that every out-of-game cut scene is rendered at lower quality than the game itself.<br><br>On that note, my initial impressions that I made 2 years ago when I saw the first screenshots were correct: This is not Max Payne. This is **** Man on Fire. Which would be fine, a Man on Fire game sounds fun. Except this game is not called Man on Fire. It&apos;s **** Max Payne 3. Having every cut scene look like a segment from a Tony Scott film is NOT **** noir. Also, I&apos;m not deaf, I don&apos;t need random subtitles flying at me every 10 seconds for two words of unimportant dialogue.<br><br>The controls on PC are a horrible mess, because this is an obvious console port. A **** flywheel for weapon selection? Are you serious? A flywheel that doesn&apos;t even WORK half the time? Max also changes the camera position randomly, bullet-dives into random objects far too often, goes prone for no damned reason when I press crouch... ugh. Add mouse accel into the mix, and it&apos;s just God damned unplayable.<br><br>I&apos;m taking a break and coming at it again tomorrow. I&apos;m only up the the part where Rockstar decided they wanted to try and make a Splinter Cell game, so maybe it&apos;s just that the beginning isn&apos;t that good. But my hopes have been thoroughly crushed.<br><br>Remedy, I miss you.

You will have a lot of fun and with absence of loading screens it brings a breath of fresh air to cinematic games. With about 12 hours single player and a ton of replayability as well as two arcade type modes you won&apos;t get bored on your own. If you do then you have multi-player which is amazingly fun and challenging. There is not regenerative health in the single player and it is hard so if you are expecting a call of duty, look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2445877">Expand</a></span>

When I get to play the game its good but its truely annoying when you sit watching cutscenes which never end and suddenly transition into the typical Max Payne jump, and you go oh gosh I am supposed to play now.</span>

Butr that&apos;s the end of my probelms. The game play very well indeed. The cut scenes are often but most ore not that long - but like I said at the top - this is the same as all the other MP games. This is MP3 NOT GTA Brazil. If it&apos;s standard Rockstar game mechanics you are after you might me a little dissapointed. Me?

<br>
<br>The multiplayer is so dumb because everyone starts out with ridiculously better weapons than you since they&apos;ve been playing since release or something, and the melee feature is so overpowered and annoying that&apos;s one of the main reasons the multiplayer isn&apos;t fun for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3034171">Expand</a></span>

<br>Holy **** It&apos;s far from the original and &apos;far&apos; as downwards kind of &apos;far&apos;. I don&apos;t know what Rockstar was thinking but Max has been turned into an gun-crazy GTA-style idiot. He always goes for the crazy idiot gunfight approach. The bad guy is in a police station? Charge into the police station with guns in open armpit holsters in broad daylight through the front **** door! Trying to hide from the bad police guys? Run to the bus station and shoot everyone that follows! Trying to find the gang leader? Charge into their town with guns hanging from your holsters and start shooting everyone! The bad guy is in the airport? Charge through the front door and shoot everyone! Why not just go for a sniper rifle and wait for the bad guy to be less protected? No because that is gay! It feels so Grand Theft Auto bombastic testosterone crazy! Always goes for the stupidest cover! Kick down the door into a room full of bad guys and he goes for what? The metal trash can? The corner wall? The ledge? No! He goes for the **** standing suitcase as cover! Always goes for the flimsiest cover all the time! He tries to sneak in cinematics but always gets the enemies to see him and start attacking! **** STUPID! Also no dark brooding environments! The only thing this game has that is impressive is the dialog Max Payne makes when talking to the himself! All the other characters are stupid and behave like morons! What a shameless game! If you like stupid shooters super devoid of common sense this is for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4143251">Expand</a></span>

For one thing, the surroundings look absolutely gorgeous. The character models are done really well, too. It&apos;s like you&apos;re looking at a film... and that&apos;s the game greatest weakness: it&apos;s treated like a film. It&apos;s been mentioned before, but the amount and length of cut scenes is truly bizarre. Come on, Half Life 1, which is rapidly reaching the 15 year mark, did storytelling better. But even with all those cut scenes, and with having to replay certain parts over and over, the game is remarkably short. That&apos;s the second gripe.
<br>
<br>But it doesn&apos;t end there, unfortunately. Whilst the character models are great, animation is sometimes wooden. For some things, it&apos;s obvious that motion capture has been used, which makes the non-motion capture animation stand out even more. And the facial animation is possibly worse. There doesn&apos;t really seem to be any, despite what&apos;s claimed in the credits. It&apos;s like everybody has a bad case of botox or Parkinson&apos;s disease.
<br>
<br>The game play is generally good, but there are some really obnoxious elements, especially when your health reaches 0. In that case, you use a painkiller, and you automatically go into some sort of slow-motion and aim at the one who shot you. But what if your need to reload at exactly that moment? Yup: you die, but it takes easily five seconds of slow motion where you already the outcome, and you can&apos;t skip it or restart from a checkpoint during that period.
<br>
<br>Worse: Max automatically takes the #1 slot weapon, so if you have a pistol and an assault rifle, you have to change back to your rifle every time you need to replay a certain scene. And there are quite a few of those instances. That is, if Max hasn&apos;t decided to ditch that assault rifle in between two scenes for absolutely no reason.
<br>
<br>Finally, I don&apos;t really care about Max&apos; problems. Maybe some characters like Gordon Freeman don&apos;t talk enough, but Max just won&apos;t shut up, Yes, we all know that he drinks too much and uses too many painkillers, but  does he really have to say so every second time he picks up pills? Not to mention, all the clich&#xE9;s that have been beaten to death.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s left is a game, for want of a better word, that looks absolutely fantastic, but leaves you feeling empty. You end up not caring for any of the characters, including Max, and once you strip the gloss (and those incessant cut scenes), there&apos;s very little left.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2876225">Expand</a></span>

While the first 10 interactive shooting scenes were fun, there was nothing to break up the monotony except for the endless movie cut-scenes or the hunt for the silly golden guns.   The slow-motion effects got so nauseatingly repetitious that I uninstalled the game.   Since the game is tightly woven with the story I&apos;ll forgive the single-threaded nature of the game but the boring game-play killed it for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2950791">Expand</a></span>

There are a lot of cutscenes, I mean, really... A LOT. When they say you spend most of your time watching things happen than playing, they are not kidding. But that&apos;s ok, no big deal, it&apos;s a way to tell the story... but what makes me really mad about it is that they placed some checkpoints BEFORE some cutscenes. Not long cutscenes, but when you watch the same damn thing 10 times, you get pretty upset. I mentioned the story, which was absolutely great in the first game. This one? What a joke. Max adventures in Brazil are very clich&#xE9;, and since I&apos;m actually from Brazil, it bothers me even more that it&apos;s all wrong. Galatians F. C.? What the  If you can&apos;t put the team&apos;s name for licensing issues, please come up with some name in Portuguese, not a generic american soccer team name. Gameplay is frustrating in the beginning, it took me like 2 hours to really get used to it. After you learn how to deal with the AI and the mechanics, it&apos;s not bad at all, kinda funny the bullet time, jumping slow-mo, kill cams, etc. The graphics are good (for a console port anyway). But honestly, I expected much more from this game. Oh, I almost forgot! I bought it on Steam, but to actually play it, I had to create a Rockstar Social Club account and login into it every time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3031495">Expand</a></span>

Has nothing to do with Max Payne 1 or 2, which are both way better third person shooters, with much better atmosphere and gameplay. This game however sometimes felt more like an interactive movie than an actual videogame. If I wanted to watch an action movie, I will watch one on TV. If I want to play videogames, please let me play. This &quot;game&quot; simply does not let you do that. In some situations you watch a three-minute cutscene, are handed over controls for less than two minutes, and then watch another two to three minute cutscene. Also, I found the difficulty level of this game to be totally unbalanced (ridiculously easy in some parts, very frustrating in others). Somehow not what I had expected. A decent game as it stands for itself, but no match whatsoever for the first two Max Payne games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3380063">Expand</a></span>

<br>Immensely annoying swapping weapons to your hand gun after EVERY FREAKING cutscene.

<br>Pros:  Great Graphics
<br>:  Sometimes the dialogue can be entertaining
<br>
<br>cons: Have you seen how many pros there are!
<br>: Story line was predictable and basic, it must have taken them 5min to write
<br>: mechanics were a joke!
<br>
<br>You think that when a big game company like Rock star makes a game (which is basically on rails, i.e go to this room then this room then down this corridor) they would have put more effort in on the story, and the game-play, but they never.
<br>
<br>One of the most irritating points in the game, was whenever it went to a cut-scene, (which in total must be the length of a feature length movie) it swapped my current weapon for the pistol, so while ive been collecting bullets for my assault rifle like a stupid idiot, Max decides to forget all that hard work and instead equip my basic pistol when faced with an army of bad guys! why!!!!
<br>
<br>They also added some disorientation to nearly every frame of the game which just got annoying towards the end.
<br>

<br>Plot is the worst part, even if not considering it as a part of Max Payne&apos;s story. Hollow, dumb and unmotivated narrative with bleak characters - they **** up even with Max. I pulled myself to end this game, because I started wanting to drop it after first hour - and the plot only making more blunt after it. Seriously, the one of the worst storyline in AAA-videogames ever, including Call of Duties.

The voice acting is terrible, like somebody randomly reading a script with no context. Which, in fairness, it probably was. The gameplay is dire. The one element retained from the originals is the shootdodge, which has somehow been made far worse. Enjoy hovering in the air abruptly flying in a random direction if you happen to brush something solid mid-flight. The   AI is terrible, enemies just repeatedly duck and stand up again in exactly the same place. A ridiculous number of cut scenes, frequently ending abruptly while leaving you in a stupidly exposed location. Where you will probably die, because your currently selected weapon is randomly reset, and occasionally lost for no apparent reason. The game appears to have been directed by somebody who has never seen any visual medium other than last 90s music videos. I have never played an FPS where dying gives some small sense of relief, because I hate my character so much I really subconsciously want  him to fail. Gameplay is completely linear. The plot is hackneyed and boring. There are hilarious sequences that make zero sense (my favourite being wandering through a favela interspersed with cut scenes where Max repeatedly begs locals for a phone for no reason, yet when he encounters an American who seems well established there, and would defnitely have one,  he just has a brief chat and moves on). But that&apos;s just petty, there are far, far bigger issues with every aspect of the game on every level. By far the most disappointing game I have played in the last ten years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6851878">Expand</a></span>

The noir style which i loved in the first games has disappeared ...very sad. But like i said this game is solid so BUY IT.</span>

Seriously, It&apos;s like you had Croteam advise you on how to resurrect a franchise.  I was a big fan of the original Max Payne&apos;s nail biting, &quot;did I use too many painkillers?&quot;, get the first shot game play, and that is exactly what Rockstar gave me.  This game is well optimized for the PC, and looks and feels great.  I cracked into the old MPs like a week or two before this came out, and the game play transition from playing old to new felt natural, which is a great sign.  This game might have garnered a perfect score from me were it not for minor things, like inability to control the flow of cut scenes, some excessive load times and the sometimes frustrating nature of Rockstar social club&apos;s utility.  These can all be corrected with a single patch, however, that I have seen.  Those people giving this game a 0 solely based on the cut scene annoyance really need to stop and separate their anger from reality before they review something.  Sure, it&apos;s a glaring flaw, but it&apos;s not game-breaking.  Game play is solid, story is still total Max Payne, graphics and features are tight, added multi-player is a blast....where are these scads of 3PS&apos;s that in their eyes were done better?  That is in fact Rhetoric.....because they don&apos;t exist.  We could use a patch or two, but still, great job Rockstar, and I highly recommend this game to any old fan of Max Payne, or anybody who really likes a challenging third person shooter.  (It&apos;s also one of the harder shooters to come out lately)  MAX PAYNE IS BACK!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2753907">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_2786967"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game is essentially a series of cutscenes with some player interaction in between, not the other way around. In one part for example, you leave a cutscene, walk about 20 metres very slowly with nothing happening around you and enter another cutscene. Why even bother. Why not just make the whole game a cutscene and be done with it. Too often, the cutscenes end with no real signs that you have control and you watch yourself die in various ways before thinking &quot;Oh. I had control there did I?&quot;.
<br>
<br>The combat is good, but its not Max Payne, more generic cover based 3rd person combat (think GTA4)  but with slow motion button. Shootdodge is generally suicide due to the open environments of the game. The crosshair is very small, as in the previous games. The difference is the cross hair doesnt show when you&apos;re in cover, so when you jump up to shoot, you have to wait for it to appear.
<br>
<br>The game also has a tendency to choose the wrong camera angle for the corner at hand so the enemy can see you before you see them. This can be rectified but requires going into cover at various angles to get it to change. If you activate slow motion, the enemies start shooting before you even leave cover. Literally as soon as you toggle slow motion, they start shooting. If you have an assault rifle out and enter a cutscene, you will probably leave the cutscene with that pistol you have with no ammo and you probably &quot;dropped&quot; the assault rifle somewhere as you no longer have it. If you&apos;re in good cover during a cutscene, you can be sure that Max will run out into the middle of the enemies before giving you back control and allowing you to run straight back to the cover you were just in.
<br>
<br>Moving on to the story, its just frustrating. The game makes all the important decisions for you, and in almost every case Max just does something absolutely stupid. For example, running out from good cover into the middle of a room full of enemies and hiding behind some suitcases. If you want a game where you are essentially the damage control for your characters endless stupid decisions, this is it.
<br>
<br>The game scores 5 in my opinion because when it works its good fun, but its let down far to frequently by just pure irritation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786967">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Can&apos;t even start games up these without having to sign in to some **** platform, I already have steam, is that not good enough?
<br>
<br>Also **** Ubisoft&apos;s Uplay aswell.</span>

I&apos;ve never played a more linear and stereotype game. Basically you only watch cutscenes and headshot enemies. Even the shooting and gameplay gets old quite fast. I was also extremely sick of the depressed over-emotional superhuman that Max Payne had become. No deep and meaningful thoughts or revenge to follow. Zero atmosphere, zero detective, zero immersion, only 24/7 whining over everything that happens in the game. Plus it&apos;s a brand new world, I was hoping that this game would bring up my memories from old Max Payne. Michelle, dark noir, flashbacks, the feels, the nightmares, the junkies, the story, snowing in the night. Nope, none of it. If you changed Max Payne object for some John Smith and changed 0.1% of the game, you would not even recognize it has to do something with Max Payne world.
<br>
<br>Also, I don&apos;t think the creators have played this game. After every cutscene Max switches from his whatever currently equipped to a simple beretta. Every time. Whatever you are holding, even it was the HUMAN DESTROYER MACHINE GUN 9001. And it is not even easy to switch back to the gun you held, sometimes you accidentally drop it during the switching. Not to mention many, many, many details and imperfections and annoying mechanics in this game, seriously ffs.
<br>
<br>I must say I wanted to recommend this game. For a long time I really wanted, I tried very hard. The only thing that wanted me to recommend were level design and music. Hell those things gave me genuine shivers. I got many &quot;whoa omg wow much epic&quot; moments because of it. It is the only reason why you should play it and trust me you will be stunned. However everything else perfectly balances out this epicness and I&apos;m afraid in the end you are not going to be that pleased.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944674">Expand</a></span>

<br>One could say the AI is good, no they bad. enemy running around like frightened chickens.
<br>Many opponents are triggered.
<br>And many gameplay elements are simply bad. If you are flying against an obstacle with Shootdodge  it breaks off.
<br>Last Stand...if you have no ammo  you can not use it. If you do not see your target, you can not use it.
<br>The bullets do not come out of the gun  the game pretends it only .
<br>You can hit enemys when your weapon is stuck in a wall if your aiming dot points to them. But you can not hit an opponent when the weapon is stuck in a opponent, when the Crosshair does not point to him.
<br>The annoying weapon switching after every cutscene and you  in the whole i can say that the gameplay is totally  up .
<br>
<br>Many battles after you start a cutscene. You can find yourself in the worst possible position behind a cover. Because Max is entered other rooms only in cutscenes. There is no opportunity for the player to play for an advantage.
<br>
<br>The level design is really good very detailed. But for a third person shoot dodge game the maps are too small, they just do not fit the gameplay.
<br>
<br>The game requires fast reactions and movements. But Max reacts like an old fat ass.
<br>
<br>Not to mention the story compared to the other parts of Max Payne are just horrible.
<br>
<br>Next time Rockstar, more Game and less  Entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3857385">Expand</a></span>

This game had a cut-scene after almost every room, which I enjoyed a lot.  Max Payne&apos;s narration was just incredible, and kept me interested throughout the game.  Some people complained that the cut-scenes restricted the players freedom, but I had no problem with it.  This is not an open world game either, though I thought it was since it was made by Rockstar.  As a fan of video games, I bought this game with all DLC at around $10 and don&apos;t regret it a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3750546">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is very fun. You keep a feeling of mortality the entire time and thus have to carefully plan out your moves or else be forced to replay the scene. Every room is well designed for an action-packed gunfight, even though it really leaves it entirely up to you how you will go about it.
<br>
<br>As many people have said and been outraged with, the cutscenes can be long, and it takes a bit before you can skip them. I had no problem with this, however, as the story is very good. If you expect to replay the campaign several hundred times or suffer from untreated ADHD, this might bother you. Otherwise it only contributes to the masterpiece.
<br>
<br>The graphics are absolutely stunning. Especially for the time of release, but even still. The environments are full of life in the immediate area, and the distant scenery immerses you in the setting. The environments are constantly changing, from a nightclub rooftop, to the Panama Canal, to the dark, snowy streets of Hoboken. The constant changes in scenery keep things very interesting whilst at the same time aiding the plot.
<br>
<br>The violence is pretty extreme (a plus, in my opinion) and gives you a view of bullets entering the faces of your enemies as they wince in pain. You can usually tell when you&apos;ve scored a kill, not only because the reticule changes color but also because of an awesome spurt of blood from the enemy&apos;s head/face.
<br>
<br>The entire way through, Max also mutters hundreds of cynical and sometimes hilarious comments about whatever is happening. It&apos;s easy to become attached to the main characters with all of the depth and detail that Rockstar provided. With the added subtleties and implications in the story, I think this could easily make a great film
<br>
<br>It&apos;s disappointing to see so many unsatisfied players and bad reviews. This game instantly made its way to my all-time favorites. I would recommend it to anyone.
<br>
<br>... But make sure you play it on hard difficulty!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3865481">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Max Payne 3 es uno de los juegos mas sobrevalorados que eh visto en mi vida. Tiene tantos problemas... Tiene tanto que deja deseando....
<br>
<br>Yo jugu&#xE9; a los 2 primeros Max Payne, el primero estubo... Bien... No era de lo mejor, tenia sus problemas pero entretenia. Luego llego Max Payne 2 y fue la ostia. Es un gran juego, tiene una historia interesante, con sus momentos comicos y oscuros, la ambientaci&#xF3;n oscura junto con un buen catalogo de amras y una banda sonora increible. El theme de Max Payne es uno de mis favoritos. Y me pregunto que paso...? !!&#xBF;QUE PASO EN ESTA SECUELA?!!
<br>Voy a comparar este titulo con los anteriores, especialmente MP2, por lo que va a sufrir. As&#xED; que empecemos.
<br>
<br>Hablemos de lo bueno del titulo para ver lo poco que tiene a su favor. Los gr&#xE1;ficos y el detalle de interiores, son muy buenos. Eh visto a gente por todas partes aclamandolos, puedes destruir m&#xFA;ltiples objetos, ves las heridas de bala en todos los personajes, los personajes est&#xE1;n detallados, y tienen detalles de cosas peque&#xF1;as como libros, computadores, letreros, sillas, etc. Sin embargo, llega lo malo... No puedes apreciar los interiores por que este juego es una org&#xED;a de balas y muerte.  Siempre ah&#xED; alguien disparando, explotando algo, o tu estas mirando las CINEM&#xC1;TICA ETERNAS. Las cinem&#xE1;tica ocultan los tiempos de carga... Y este juego tiene mucho tiempo de carga. Hay veces en las que casi termina la cinem&#xE1;tica y me deja saltarmela por que ya termino de cargar despues de que la cinem&#xE1;tica casi terminara, aparte de que duran mucho, algunas son in&#xFA;tiles. Un ejemplo de cinem&#xE1;tica in&#xFA;til son cuando te tiran una granadas de humo, si, el juego tiene que parar para admirar como te tiran una pta granada de humo... Y ni hablar de los momentos prefabricados que abundan.
<br>
<br>Y que tal si hablamos de la jugabilidad? Empecemos por la I.A. Es decente... Usara cobertura normalmente, pero aveces van corriendo hac&#xED;a ti como suicidas. Y ni hablar de la dificultad, se pasan con ella. Jugu&#xE9; en modo normal y aun as&#xED; la dificultad llega a ser ligeramente superior que en el modo de dificultad inicial de MP2. Y la jugabilidad no a mejorado en nada. Es mas bien una refinaci&#xF3;n moderna y nada mas. No ah&#xED; sigilo, a pesar que el juego tiene algunas zonas donde la historia dice que ah&#xED; que ser sigiloso... No tiene el inventario de MP2, donde antes pod&#xED;as llevar un arma de cada tipo aqu&#xED; te limitas a 3, 2 si usas 2 pistolas a la ves, por que Max no tiene un im&#xE1;n en la espalda como Lara Croft. En lo que mas evoluciona este juego es en que ahora si saltas es por tiempo infinito hasta que caigas, antes solo era por un instante, ahora es cuando tocas tierra, y a&#xF1;ade una forma para evitar la muerte, que si tienes un frasco de pastillas puedes usarlo si matas al ultimo tipo que te disparo, una forma de quitar algo de frustraci&#xF3;n. Sin embargo, tambi&#xE9;n la cagn con eso, casi siempre tu mirada estar&#xE1; en un &#xE1;ngulo imposible de darle, por lo que no podr&#xE1;s dispararle por que todo te esta tapando la vista.
<br>
<br>Y ni mencionar lo que quitan de entregas pasadas, como el inventario infinito, el modo bullet time r&#xE1;pido que te permit&#xED;a recibir menos da&#xF1;o y recargar super r&#xE1;pido de MP2, y la posibilidad de usar granadas, NO PUEDES USAR GRANADAS pero los enemigos si pueden...
<br>
<br>Hablemos de la historia... Como empieza? Pues empezamos sin contexto matando a un tipo en un aeropuerto, y de ah&#xED; vamos al pasado, vemos que Max ahora es guardaespaldas y empieza un tiroteo, de ah&#xED; vamos 2 niveles mas y pasamos al pasado. La historia no tiene un enfoque, nos mandan al futuro en el inicio, despu&#xE9;s al pasado cuando Max es guardaespaldas, de ah&#xED; vamos a America donde antes estaba Max, volvemos al futuro, nos narran todo como si fueramos idiotas y no pudi&#xE9;ramos seguir la historia, no tiene enfoque y mas parece una excusa para matar gente. No sientes que haces nada en la trama, eres el que mira a Max por horas en las cinem&#xE1;tica y cuando ah&#xED; que matar tomas el control... En MP2 tambi&#xE9;n matabas y ya, pero ah&#xED; las cinem&#xE1;tica duraban a lo mucho 2 minutos, por lo que al menos no sent&#xED;as que tu tenias que hace algo en la historia, en especial por que las cinem&#xE1;tica eran comics y distingu&#xED;as la acci&#xF3;n de la historia, aqu&#xED; duran de 2 a 14, sin mencionar que son constantes ya que si pasas una viene otra sin parar. Y ya no son comics, ahora son cinem&#xE1;tica modernas con el motor del juego.
<br>
<br>Hablemos un poco mas de lo bueno... Siempre estas fuera de numero, eres tu contra unos 100 por mision. Dir&#xE1;n que es malo por que es frustrante... Pues si, es de doble filo, pero si usas el bullet time y tienes un lugar amplio no esta tan duro... Los corredores son lo malo...
<br>
<br>De echo este juego tiene todo lo malo que puede tener un juego... Tiene corredores lineales, cinem&#xE1;tica sin parar, no tiene formas de hacer al jugador interactuar con el mundo, hordas frustrantes con una dificultad fuera de mundo, una historia que no es interesante ni tiene un final decente, sus mec&#xE1;nicas no innovan en nada ni al menos ser nuevas en la franquicia, momentos prefabricados sin parar, alejar a la franquicia de su carril original, personajes sin desarrollar que vienen y van...
<br>
<br>NO ES UN MAL JUEGO. NO LO ES. Pero tiene tantos cambios para mal, que no innovan, que te hacen esperar como si esto fuera el cine... Este juego no es un digno sucesor de MP2 y creo que esta tan sobrevalorado por que es similar a CoD. No eh jugado a CoD en mucho tiempo, ni en PC. Pero CoD son explosiones, hordas de enemigos, muchas cinem&#xE1;tica, historia poco interesante y frustraci&#xF3;n por el MP. Como la frustraci&#xF3;n de la campa&#xF1;a normal... Puede que me equivoque en la comparaci&#xF3;n de CoD con MP3, pero aun as&#xED; no es un buen juego. Es uno promedio... No es ni malo ni bueno... Es muy mediocre... Divertido aveces... Y decepcionante... Yo quer&#xED;a un nuevo capitulo de la historia gris de Max Payne, aqu&#xED; apenas tiene mejoras, han removido cosas... Este juego tiene MP, seguro que es bueno, pero no tiene servidores dedicados este juego. No tiene servidores dedicados... Este juego lo recomendar&#xED;a por 3 dolares, no mas. De hecho, si tienes para elegir entre MP3 o MP2 elige el 2. Max Payne 2 es un juego mejor, no estara tan actualizado, pero al final es mejor. Este juego...
<br>
<br>Rockstar lo podr&#xED;a haber hecho mucho mejor... Pero es lo que es... Le doy un 05/10, es dolorosamente promedio, si llegas a jugar MP seguro mejora y llega a un 06/10, pero sin servidores dedicados ni muchos amigos con este juego no lo puedo jugar ni contar. Si tienes 3 dolares vale la pena, pero no mas, ni en broma... Me encanto Max Payne 2 y me duele que el 3 sea tan... Es un corredor de disparos, es casi un shooter gen&#xE9;rico...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4895156">Expand</a></span>

In Max Payne 3 continues the story of Detective Max Payne city New York City. Max begins a new life working private security and protection specifically for a family in the San Paulo, Brazil. When you put the target on the family clans, Max has no choice but to save their lives. From what I know, the game stayed a lot of time in development, but, in my opinion, even a game came out so good that I take at least 10 hours related to PC. Animation and frameworks that have been used games give an air of film, which can sometimes feel like you&apos;re watching a movie.

But once you&apos;re about a third into the game, the flaws start to really reveal themselves.
<br>
<br>Despite the varied environments the game throws at you (nightclub, favela, dockyards) the basic gameplay just gets very repetitive very quickly. Cover, aim, shoot -- over and over again. Worse, even if you try and shake things up by shoot-dodging and running from cover to cover, the game will sometimes punish you with an instant death -- so you&apos;ll have no incentive to use the game&apos;s most interesting mechanics. Yes, there are some great occasional set-pieces (the office block siege!) but the levels are often dragged out way longer than necessary. The game&apos;s weird obsession with forcing you to use a pistol a lot of the time doesn&apos;t help.
<br>
<br>None of this would matter if the story and script were top-notch but to be honest the plot is way too convoluted and the characters so unlikeable that you never feel much emotional connection with what&apos;s going on. It all feels like a character arc from GTA V -- minus the driving and sense of humor. Fun for a bit but no classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6743395">Expand</a></span>

I just finished playing on hard difficulty level. I was just a kid when the first Max Payne came out, but I did play it again at a later time also. It was not that polished, but still an enjoyable experience. Max Payne 2 on the other hand was spectacular. The action was flawless, shooting was really fun and the story went on smoothly. I did not expect this third installment to be a masterpiece like the previous one, but I still did expect an enjoyable piece of action. Luckily, I got it from Steam sale and did not pay full price.
<br>
<br>The narration was repetitive and did not do really anything to move the plot. Cut scenes were really annoying, not only stopping any shooting action you might have had going on, but also putting you to some stupid starting position for the next fight. If you played Deus Ex: Human Revolution stealthily and were screaming during the first boss fight, that is the feeling you will be often having playing Max Payne 3.
<br>
<br>Controls were frustrating at times. The cover system is flawed as changing cover (by diving jump for example) is impossible, you always have to exit your current cover first and risk getting shot. Luck is heavily involved in most of the firefights, especially if you have to change cover (because the scripted nature of the game forces you to). I did not have problems getting head shots, but sometimes one bullet just was not enough and when there are more than five guys shooting at you, you need lots of painkillers to even try those head shots. Painkillers, or luck, or preferably both. Some scenes were incredibly frustrating and required many tries just to learn by heart from where and when the next enemy was going to appear. It happened too often that there were still one or two enemies standing, I had no ammo left, my health was almost gone and without painkillers, I had to make a run for the nearest weapon, exiting my cover. At that point, it was simply a matter of luck whether I made it or was shot. And usually it was the latter, which really was not fun after certain amount of retries. Even after succeeding, you did not get any enjoyment from an exciting firefight, you only felt you were glad it was over. The point of painkillers was simply that, given enough retries, you could make it to the next checkpoint. In the previous games, having lots of painkillers enabled one to try out some imaginative ways of dealing with the enemies, resulting in more fun; having no painkillers forced one to play it safe. Here, it is just pure luck and eventually you will run out of it, painkillers or not.
<br>
<br>The game also has good points, however. The graphics and sounds are fine, if nothing spectacular. A few scenes and even one or two cutscenes were genuinely fun. The game mechanics are simple enough that having all those weapon select wheels etc. from the console world did not distract too much. During my over ten-hour run, the game crashed just a couple of times. Still, I feel like cutting all the boring levels, dropping all the unnecessary cut-scenes and fixing a couple of frustrating firefights, the game would have been five hours at max a ride, but hugely more enjoyable. I would not recommend this, at least not with the hard difficulty level. Instead, try out Max Payne 2 if you fancy some nice shooting action.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2885302">Expand</a></span>

Instead, the slow motion is there so you can hide in cover, activate slow motion, get an easy headshot, and repeat over and over for the entire game.

I&apos;ve went through both of them many times. The action was awesome and the shooting was very satisfying, combined to a nice story and cool ambiance, I had a blast playing them. It is very different for max payne 3 as the list of irritating stuff stacks sky high.
<br>
<br>A major annoyance is that you get cutscenes all the time... and by all the time I mean ALL THE TIME. It totally destroys immersion and annihilates all chances for the game to build any pace at all. Most of the cutscenes could be removed out of the game and it wouldn&apos;t change the story at all (especially since like 50% of the cutscenes are max drinking and falling asleep. Yeah ok, we get it...)
<br>
<br>Speaking of redundant cutscenes, max payne was quite the bad ass in other games and you could sympathize with him but when they make you run around the world to save tasteless characters (the dumb blonde and all the brazilian family), you understand that it&apos;s to make up for his past but at some point you start wondering why he even gives a damn anymore...
<br>
<br>Something that started pissing me off early in game too is the fact that every time you run out of health, the game slows down so you can get a &quot;saving shot&quot; off. At first it&apos;s a cool feature but it gets annoying ultra fast as the levels get more crowded: later on, most of the time you can&apos;t even get that shot off because there is something in the way or you just can&apos;t aim at the target at all. Forget it if you&apos;re using a grenade launcher, the grenades are so slow they can&apos;t even detonate in time, making the GL way too risky to even use. Oh and what makes this even more of a pain in the ass is that when you&apos;re in slow mode and you know you&apos;re doomed, the &quot;restart at last checkpoint&quot; option in the menu is unaccessible, so you have to suffer through the entire thing before you can do anything.
<br>
<br>Another thing that ruined it for me is that it seems the AI has way too good aiming sometimes. They don&apos;t even know you&apos;re there and the next nanosecond you get headshot. I don&apos;t know how many times this happened. Not only that but it seems like when you use the UZZIs in automatic mode, you shoot all over the place but the AI seems to be able to snipe a fly a thousand yards away with them. Now the cover system is pretty good but it&apos;s often entirely negated due to the &quot;encounter&quot; pattern that is always the same: you ALWAYS end up in a big open area, a wave of baddies spawn and then you&apos;re pinned down by like 10 dudes. Not only it&apos;s about impossible to avoid getting hit a few times but the second you think &quot;yay I&apos;m safe, let&apos;s leave cover to get ammo and painkillers&quot; WRONG! As soon as you get far away enough from cover, a second wave spawns in your face. Also, sometimes you try to get cover without the cover system (by cutting angles with most enemies so you can get them into view one by one) but max payne&apos;s aiming angle is so awkward that often you get shot by targets you can&apos;t even see. Most firefights are so frustrating that it takes the fun out of shooting stuff up... That&apos;s saying a lot.
<br>
<br>Another few minor annoyances that sounded the alarm the very first seconds I opened the game for the first time: when you get in the game it says press enter to continue at the bottom of the screen... but when you press enter, it does nothing. You have to click the text... Speaking of which, have the people doing the port played a computer game in the last 10 year? Seriously, who uses enter anymore to navigate menus? Well for max payne 3 they decided to do it all the time. Also, for some reason, the mouse is ultra slow in the menus (menus only) for a reason I ignore. Minor stuff you&apos;ll tell me... Of course, but it just adds frustration on top of all the other issues.
<br>
<br>Add very bland stages with very little variation to that and a bunch of glitches all over the place (from bugged cutscenes that you can&apos;t skip so you have to ALT+F4 out to weird convulsing ragdolls)  you have a game that has disaster written all over it. I pretty much always finish the games I buy even if I find them tedious but I uninstalled this one about 75% through. I only paid 10$ for it during a steam sale and I still feel ripped off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3164302">Expand</a></span>

Action is fast paced and fun, the seamless load screen/cut scene makes it hard to put the game down, however, drag the experience down from the empty and poorly written story line that you can&apos;t skip through. This is not Max Payne either, Max was a ruthless emotionless man with nothing to lose, now he&apos;s a overly dramatic cry baby. The story and writing was so beautifully done in the first two games but unfortunately this falls well short and make you feel embarrassed for the clumsy misguided &quot;max payne&quot;. Great game with a lot going for it, just not as Max Payne.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2895840">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really don&apos;t want to focus too much into all this negative criticism but I have to say that I understand now why games like call of duty which is pretty much a copy paste year after year has become one of the most succesful, best selling games but this same gamers are the ones that give Max Payne 3 a very low score but eat the **** that EA defecates every god forsaken year.
<br>Sorry, I had to get that out of my system.
<br>I have played all of the Max Payne games and I have to say that this is the best of the franchise.
<br>The story is compelling, interesting, the one liners are sometimes cheesy but work well with the character. Max can be a bad ass at times and others a bit pathetic, and that makes it feel totally human.
<br>There has been complaining about not being able to skip cutscenes, apparently the game loads the map while playing the cutscenes, so you dont see a friggin &quot;Loading game&quot; screen ever. I rather see the story than a black screen, thank you very much Rockstar.
<br>Talking about Rockstar there is one thing that really muddles the narrative, the constant flash of the screen, and the highlight of certain words that the characters are saying, I have a hard time trying to describe this. I mean it&apos;s fine for a while but after 10 hours of gameplay, it gets old and by the time you get to the end, you hate it.
<br>The graphics aren&apos;t ground breaking but look well enough, I was amazed about the amount of details put on the scenery, specially when playing through the favelas, evidently they put a lot of work into making them look realistic. I played in a 40 inch screen at 1920x1080 and game looks very nice and plays smoothly and I dont have a high end video card.
<br>The controls are responsive most of the times, cover works fine, despite what some people might say,  although there is one flaw, going from cover to cover sucks big time.
<br>One thing I dont understand is the laser  beam on the weapons. it just doesn&apos;t work well, its more an annoyance than anything else. I dont get why should we have it when i&apos;m playing in third person and I have a **** dot on the middle of the screen. the dot beats any laser that the guns may have, that is just silly.
<br>The game mechanics are true to the series, they added some little tweaks here and there like the infamous last stand, it is all good to me in this matter.
<br>The difficulty of the game might be frustrating to some people, if you dont like to die, well you won&apos;t be happy because you die a lot, you can&apos;t just ram the whole game through your enemies, there are times where you have to think how to approach them. In hard difficulty the games offers a challenge unlike other games. I think games are too easy nowadays.
<br>In conclusion, the game is solid fun, the story is interesting, Max Payne is an interesting character and the narrative i&apos;ts well done, it&apos;s action packed, lots of guns and little secrets and rewards to collect throughout  the levels. So there is plenty of contect.
<br>The game took me about 15 to 20 hours, playing in hard.
<br>I highly recommend this game, you can get a digital copy online (google it) for as low as 20 bucks.
<br>peace out!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578950">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cutscenes and slow-mo cams killed this game. You spend about 3 minutes shooting people and once you just about got into the groove, a cut scene ensues and it breaks the pacing. Another silly thing implemented was that you would automatically slow down when going past an object relevant to the game. Case in point: At some point you will be fighting in a building and you are meant to attach some objects to the pillars. You can be running around and all of a sudden, you just slow to a crawl simply because you are going past a pillar.
<br>
<br>Slow-mo cams. The annoying part of the game is when you are just about to die, the game goes into some slow-mo mode that the devs must have thought cool, but it isn&apos;t. What&apos;s irritating about it is that you automatically do a flying lunge (often on your back) and the game slows down taking on some saturated look and you&apos;re left desperately hunting for the cross hair (which has changed position, often way off the mark because the view has switched to some awful position that often is behind a wall or such that you appear to be viewing things out of your arse) to kill the person who was causing you so much damage. Once that&apos;s accomplished, you end up remaining on the floor and in a dilemma because if you stand, you get hit and there&apos;s no option to reliably get back into cover or crouch automatically.
<br>
<br>Next, scripted actions. When you enter any room or reload, you automatically end up with a pistol. No matter if you are carrying the baddest assed gun in the game, you end up with the pistol. This is fine for the early bits, but when you are faced with enemies wearing body armour and carrying assault rifles and outnumbering you 7:1, you don&apos;t want a puny pistol that has only 8 rounds in the mag. What&apos;s worse is that the time it takes to change means that the enemies are often right on top of you because that&apos;s the way the game was scripted.
<br>
<br>Also, there&apos;s a strange bug that causes you to lose control of the keyboard and you end up defaulting into the aimed mode but you can fire or jump or anything except walk at a slow pace. This happens even in the midst of a firefight and has caused several reloads. Silly video effects like wavy cams, blue-red distortions and other necessary effects destroy all that&apos;s left of this once fun franchise (see Max Payne and Max Payne 2).
<br>
<br>In conclusion, stay away from this and other Rockstar North games until they sort their sh it out. Better yet, wait for it to come down even lower in a couple more years when it&apos;s in the bargain bin or on some sale. Rockstar needs to be taught a lesson via their income statement to stop developing half-assed movies that masquerade as a game. If I wanted a movie, I&apos;d pay for it (cheaper) and sit with my spouse in either the comfort of my home or in a theatre and eat chips and drink sodas and not frustrate myself with this movie-on-rails. That&apos;s right, you could hardly qualify this as a shooter even.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3432890">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I could mention and rage about the fact, that max payne took 100 steps away from his noir-feeling and awesome comic-strip-storytelling.
<br>I could rage about his MTV-like flickering tranistions in the unskippable chores of cutscenenes.
<br>I could hit my head against the monitor after the agonizing account-hell called &quot;Rockstar Club&quot;.
<br>(after denying my fresh created account-data it gave me some random name and let me wait for another 15 minutes. Although my steam account should be enough!?)
<br>But I will start with the one (not even that) positive thing in this &quot;Game&quot;:
<br>The Animations.
<br>Enemies move smoothly from cover to cover and dodge our bullets with well animated moves.
<br>But thats it. I can&apos;t think about one other nice thing the game contributed.
<br>
<br>The Shootouts  feel challenging but not right. Someone wrote that Max Paynes Cover IS the bullet-Time. And so it shouldn&apos;t feel so useless with forced in cover-mechanics and Insta-Deaths!
<br>The Gunfights are mostly a short coverbased casual-bore between the force-fed cutscenes.
<br>
<br>The rest of the game seems to give a shat about he player and puts a fishinghook through our nose to drag us from one flickering cutscene to the next.
<br>Rockstar seems to think we are all brainless dumbsters. Too stupid to use a mouse and shoot at things.
<br>Best and most hilarious example is the first (short) &quot;Tutorial&quot; that makes us read how we move the mouse and press the left butten.
<br>Seriously!
<br>I couldn&apos;t believe how patronizing and blatant despising this looks.
<br>WTF?! You think I am too stupid to shoot at things in a shootergame?!
<br>
<br>And why do you have to force me watching your flickering cutscenes for people with the attention-span of a hyperactive toad?! I can&apos;t even wrap my head around this anymore. This is just a proof of a failing gaming industry that chums up with the brainless crazies that swarm like zombies into a black friday shopping riot.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t know if I have to feel sorry for you or feel angry. In either way I hope you get bankrupt after the cod-kiddies that consume everybit of your &quot;interactive entertainment&quot; are bored once more and need another stimulating kick in their burnt up synapses.
<br>
<br>I regret even spending the little money on the autumn-sale on Steam for this abomination.

There are just too many problems: the combat controls are terrible (most likely due to it being a **** console port), the shoot dodge system ends up causing more deaths than it saves due to the absurdly long time it takes to get up again, the cover system has the standard sticky-glue type thing where you attach yourself to cover, except that a lot of the cover is destructible so you just end up turning into an immobile target, the game is basically a movie with small linear corridors and billions of quick time events, bullet time runs out so fast its barely enough to get a couple shots off, and I could go on and on and on about the mechanics, but whats really important, as max payne fans know, is the story. The game has always been a semi-interactive story in which the player acts out the fatalistic actions of a man who knows hes going to die. The first game was so over the top that it was memorable. Rockstar tried to capture that spirit, but just ended up with a bland story with a main character who to me just came across as an arse. If the story was good, I could of forgiven everything else, but since the story is horrificly bad, it is hardly worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2495162">Expand</a></span>

Every 1-3 minutes cutscene and this is a fu**ing joke. And a lot of cutscene endings i found myself a bad cover and the enemies shooting at me.  Every cutscene endings the game change my weapon to a pistol and it&apos;s also horrible. Looks like a console port, you can change a lot of graphics option but the gameplay and these bad things in this game because of console for ex. the cover because of noob console players who need a cover to not die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2513961">Expand</a></span>

Max Payne 3 is one of those games that make you clear one area, and after this you move on to the next. If you get killed, you have to start over again. Sometimes the &apos;areas&apos; turn out to be much larger than one would have thought and after completing a challenging part of a level, you move on, looking around (more about this in a second) only to get shot and restart something that you already did. I know there are people that like this kind of thing: if that&apos;s you, you might like the game. But that&apos;s not the only shortcoming of the game.
<br>
<br>I normally love games with a good story. Max Payne attempted to be cinematic, but it failed  miserably. The way they created his character is just cheesy. You&apos;ve got an ex-cop, who&apos;s a pill-popping alcoholic, who takes a bottle of pain killers and chases them down with a bottle of vodka or whiskey or whatever is his poison. All that Max does is complain about being a failure, monotonously. His wise-cracks are just like he is as a character: miserable and predictable. And, always banging on the same drum, ultimately boring. I know that sometimes protagonists of video games are supposed to be stereotypical, but its hard to find something less enthralling than a whining alcoholic. Other characters aren&apos;t much better. There also is a small technical plot hole. If you&apos;re bent on finding somebody, and time is of the essence, the game should encourage you to charge, or at least try to get to your goal ASAP. But it doesn&apos;t. Oh no. It does everything to discourage you, it even award you for not doing so. You have to find clues and parts of golden weapons as bonus objectives (remember when bonus objectives were a real part of games that made you do a level 5 or 6 times to get everything right?) Here its just the opposite. You have to canvas entire areas looking for something that might be a clue, or a weapon part. Which can be ludicrously hidden at times. Again, this isn&apos;t something new, and games such as Black had this.
<br>
<br>The game also has too much cliches. You have the favellas bit (Fear 3, Modern Warfare 2), escaping a burning building (EVERYTHING last year)... What it lacks is innovation. And being fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2928532">Expand</a></span>

<br>Since the reviews wont tell you what you get with this game, I will: it&apos;s a bad console port. One can&apos;t change the controls, it is 100% corridor shooter, gameplay is run &amp; gun for two minutes followed by a long cutscene, rinse and repeat.
<br>Graphics are fairly poor, gameplay is worse  the handholding is so heavy and the cutscenes so frequent it&apos;s effectively a slightly interactive movie. Oh yeah, and it REQUIRES that you register online for a &quot;social&quot; account before you can play.
<br>
<br>Possibly the most disappointing game I&apos;ve played in two years. Really sad to see how far the Max Payne franchise has fallen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3034483">Expand</a></span>

First, it&apos;s a port. The games core design was for console gamers and with this comes a whole load of issues. The biggest issue I find in this game is the mouse control. Even with the mouse acceleration turned off it still jerks around hindering my aim! Accuracy in MP3 is so bad that the sniper rifle and other precision weapons are useless. The only effective weapon is the shotgun, but even that is crap even at close range! Aiming is practically useless not only because of the lack of control, but because aiming doesn&apos;t zoom in enough or it does zoom in, but you can&apos;t move. Talking of moving, why can&apos;t Max run!? Running involves speed and yet R* can&apos;t get that right! Even the AI can run faster than Max can! I don&apos;t even know why R* put a cover system in this game. It&apos;s clunky and sticky! The cover system always restricts my movement which is the point of the game, being mobile and dodging bullets! Talking of bullets, where was all the fancy gun physics which R* showcased in their demos? Bullets don&apos;t drop at range in this game nor do they penetrate the target like they should. The amount of times I&apos;m denied a head shot because the NPC puts his hand in the way was too frequent as was the amount of times buckshot from the hip completely misses it&apos;s target at mid to close ranges. High calibre rounds should penetrate through limbs, even body armor! The loading times are basically covered up by cut-scenes and boy there are a lot of those. If there is anything that does this game justice it would be that the graphics are really good and the slow motion effects are good as well, but that&apos;s basically it. Everything else is either a half-arsed or complete crap! Which has really destroyed my expectations from R* and GTAV! To sum this game up; if your a Max Payne fan and you really can&apos;t keep hands away from MP3, get the CONSOLE version. The PC one is duff! The overall gameplay is restrictive. Much like what Capcom does with their games, R* had gone for an Arcade style shooter rather than the Bullet Simulator that was promised. MP3 is an all right game, but it&apos;s no where nearly as good as MP2 or even Max Payne for that matter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2534662">Expand</a></span>

However that is mainly due to keyboard mapping not making much sense. Game is enjoyable with game pad as well. After finishing the game on hard difficulty, I must say it is also a lengthy game. Considering it takes a whopping 26gb space with most of the dlc content, it is not shocking. Although the Max&apos;s comments are pure drunken poetry in motion, majority of the time Max plays himself, almost at every event cut scenes take over and you wait as the game throws you back into the action, sometimes right as you get shot at. I cannot tell you how many times I have died while playing hard difficulty because I am looking at an awkward direction while getting shot at after cut scenes. More over, gameplay is choppy because it often decides to switch 3rd person view from one side to another, it gets you killed during forced slow motion moments and around the corners often. Not to mention diving into the direction automatically after losing health and losing sight of the enemy which you need to kill to survive, while having 5 pain killers is pure epic fail. Similar things happen when you are out of ammo, or shot in the back and you watch Max try to turn his weapon around to shoot the enemy, as you slowly fall on the ground and die. But as you get angry at the game play, before you know it there is a long cut scene which makes you forget it ever happened.
<br>
<br>In short, you do not play Max Payne, he plays himself. You just die here and there. If Max Payne 3 was a movie (and it sort of is) It would have pwned Max Payne the movie, hands down, the story is that good. Game play however is subpar. Good thing they hyped the game up, they will need that money when Brazil namely Sao Paolo sues them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-payne-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502899">Expand</a></span>
