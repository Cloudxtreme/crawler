It&apos;s a large improvement on several points over its predecessor (Paradise Cracked) by the same company. Combat is a bit tedious as most turn-based squad games tend to be, as each unit gets a chance to do something and go somewhere while all the others wait. It can&apos;t be helped, all the good titles in the genre also suffered the same thing. (Fallout, Wasteland, UFO/Xcom etc.) At least you can double-click to have your character skip the movement animation and zip immediately to their destination. (or as close as they can get with their movement points of that turn) Character development is a little sub-par as you only need to consider the assignment of points to a handful of attributes such as strength and intelligence, but it gets the job done. The graphics are pretty advanced for a game of this genre, where the RPG aspects usually come first and eye candy a distinct second. I have to agree with most of the reviewers about the sounds, as they are repetitive and not very good. English localization (it&apos;s from a Russian development house) is markedly improved over their previous title, and is only noticeable in a few places by odd phrasings. The voice actors, while not terribly inspired, actually speak pretty good English in this title. Plotline borders on the obscure at points, next to sound it&apos;s the weakest part of the game. The missions are generally variations on destroy-all-enemies, and it&apos;s not often clear who you should talk to or when to advance the plot (or who NOT to talk to until you&apos;ve done everything else first!) and the plot is quite linear. It might be possible to delay or ignore a couple side quests but you can&apos;t transition areas freely. Odd, that, since they got it right in their previous title. Camera action is fairly smooth and clear, and a new character&apos;s-eye-view helps with the sometimes odd aiming problems that the normal isometric view can cause. Overall, I wish there were more games like this out there...but RPG gamers are a small enough niche that the big developers don&apos;t consider RPGs to be cost-effective anymore. :( For reference, I&apos;ve played about 6-8 missions through so far. I&apos;ve also played pretty much every other title in the genre that I&apos;ve found over the last 20 years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cops-2170-the-power-of-law/user-reviews?user_review_id=392125">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Yes, it is pretty frustrating in the beginning - much like I found Syndicate and Syndicate Wars. It is also pretty tough at the beginning, but give it a chance, play it a bit, and if you liked Syndicate/Syndicate Wars/X-Com, you will probably like this. The interface could be better, and the voice overs, but generally it is a good strategy title, in an arena with few new games.</span>
