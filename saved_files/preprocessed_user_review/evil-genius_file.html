Unfortunately the game does not quite work as well as the demo did because of one or two flaws that are apparant only after playing the full version over a longer period of time. The first and major flaw is the pacing of the game. Time and time again you will be forced to wait for your heat levels to go down, or wait to recruit lost minions, or wait to uncover evil deeds on the world map, or wait, or wait.....you get the idea. Especially at the beggining, the game is punctuated by short bursts of action followed by lengthy periods of waiting. It took me 15/20 minutes of real time recruit enough minions - only to have over half of them wiped out by some agents. QUE: waiting another 15-20 mins of not doing much while you recruit more staff, and this was while spending the maximum on staff recruitment. Spend less (as your often forced to unless you use the money cheat) and the waiting times can be multiplied by over 4 times that! So you spend more on staff recruting, which means you need to amass more money, which means MORE WAITING as your minions steal from around the world. No matter what you want to do in the game, it always seems to result in you being pointed towards the same situation. WAITING. Want more money for faster recruiting? - WAIT for your minions to steal. Want to commit more acts of evil on the world map? WAIT for your minions to discover them first. Completed som acts of evil? Then you will have generated some heat, too much heat and your base will be overrun with &quot;good&quot; agents. So you WAIT for your heat levels to drop again before you can do anything else. Also the minion AI is not all that good. By design they will stand around doing nothing while your overrun with enemy agents. You HAVE to tell them what to do to EACH and EVERY enemy that wonders into your base, by clicking infividually on the agent. Your minions are incapable of making any smart choices themselves, and sometimes seem incapable of doing what you instruct them to do anyway. Add all this together and the only people who will see the later (and ironically more interesting) game elements will be those with a LOT of patience!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=376812">Expand</a></span>

Everything takes forever. Want to go on a mission? Watch as the 10 guys you send out SLOWLY walk to the dispatch point, and then SLOWLY board the vehicle, before eventually arriving. Then, watch as half of them die right away, the mission is failed, and you have to wait for them to get trained back up again before another attempt at the mission. This can easily take 20 to 40 minutes. Nothing in the game happens quickly. Everything involves waiting on a minion to move into position and perform an animation. Once enemy agents show up prepare to be frustrated by their endless persistence. Every time you set up a defense they will, by design, be able to circumvent it, blow it up, or be ignored by it. I enjoyed the game for the first couple of hours. Then I got annoyed and started over, then I got annoyed and cheated, then I got annoyed and deleted that shit. Don&apos;t waste your time on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=82759">Expand</a></span>

It came out at a time when the people who made them got their jollies from making things frustrating and then mocking the users after release if they complained. And I loved it! Games these days have all sorts of conveniences for the fluoride generation that has hijacked gaming. These are the people giving EG a low score here btw. Go back to CoD you wreckers!
<br>In the decade since it was released gaming has taken an amazing nosedive, with everything being &quot;casual friendly&quot;, which is code for never frustrating anyone ever, which is code for making boring games.
<br>Anybody who wants a classic example of how PC games used to deliberately use frustration to make games fun should buy Evil Genius. It`s one of very few Dungeon Keeper derivatives released which is good, and the graphics and sound are still great after all this time. And so is the game play. Once you get the hang of base construction and learn how to use different traps, doors, cameras and guards for the best result it is amazingly addictive.
<br>As for the negatives it really is time consuming and occasionally little happens. But on the other hand you can control this yourself to a certain extent: By being active plotting and carrying out crimes on the world map you attract hordes of agents and you`ll never be bored. Of course you won`t be able to defend your base either, but finding the right balance between world map activity and base security is one of the joys of the game, although never easy.
<br>There is an exploit which is hard to resist at the end of the tutorial, when your task is to kidnap a maid. If you just don`t do this at all and instead send all your people off to plunder on the world map you can just go to bed or get drunk and you`ll have millions of gold when you wake up/come back. This neutralizes what would otherwise have been the hardest part of EG: getting enough gold while being harassed by super agents But since it`s an alternative that requires patience, which is what my enemies in the &quot;casual&quot; gaming community do not have at all, I am prepared to forgive this crutch.
<br>The only real negative is that not only is it hard and long winded, but it is almost a must to have played through the game before you can know what to do when, how much and in what order and so have a reasonable chance at finishing the campaign. If you haven`t you`ll aggro all five super agents to your island at the same time and die, place entrances, rooms and hotels in bad places, get the wrong henchmen or an endless number of other things you`re just not likely to get right the first time around.
<br>
<br>Other than that it`s great fun, and highly recommended foo anyone sick to death of &quot;casual&quot; gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913536">Expand</a></span>

It started off kind of slow but once you start really completing your objectives and unlocking things it picks up nicely. The humor is entertaining and I enjoyed the music as well. I also got sucked into this game for hours at a time and had a lot of fun for the most part. There were definitely ups and downs, but a lot of that stemmed from it being my first time with the game and probably playing too cautiously. I will certainly be playing this game again and for the $5 or $10 you&apos;ll likely find this, it&apos;s totally worth picking up. While it doesn&apos;t recapture all of the magic of the DK series, it does bottle up a good portion of it and my only regret is I didn&apos;t discover this game sooner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=742190">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t cheat yourself out of a great experience do take the time to learn the mechanics and this game will keep on giving. Also note that technically this game was ahead of its time back in 2004 and even by today standards the graphics are quite good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=411671">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s extremely addictive and the concept is interesting. The game has a humorous style a la Theme Hospital, with funny animations and voice overs. However, the pace is intolerably slow and it takes forever for even the most simple things to be accomplished. It can take 30-40 minutes to complete a single mission as the units you select to send will ever-so-slowly walk to the helicopter point, slowly be flown away, arrive at the destination five minutes later, take part in a mission that takes 5 minutes to complete, and then half of them will die and you will fail the mission anyway.<br><br>This could really have been fixed by a) a simple &apos;fast forward&apos; type of button that makes everything move faster or b) making the area in which you can build your lair much larger and giving more room types etc so that whilst you&apos;re waiting for your minions to complete their missions you can entertain yourself by building things. As it was I got bored after the first couple of hours, since I&apos;d built all the rooms available and didn&apos;t have much space left for future rooms, and I had nothing else to do except tag all the agents who came to be killed (which is extremely repetitive) and wait around. Game would be a lot more fun if it was sped up a bit and had a bit more variety. A free form mode would be great as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=1457891">Expand</a></span>

This, however, is dampened by a lot of small, niggling issues that crop up over the course of the game, and that by the end, have you wanting to dominate the world for more than one reason. Evil Genius is, in theory, the antithesis to the hordes of &apos;good pure hero&apos; stories that dominate the market. Much like Dungeon Keeper, you play the role of the evil, vengeful and hugely spiteful bad guy. It&apos;s a brilliant spin on the concept, concisely taking the piss out of James Bond, Rambo and a whole host of 80&apos;s stereotypes, allowing you to turn the tables on the pesky do-gooders and use their own patented movie-logic against them. Now, every evil genius needs minions, especially a genius as inept as you. While you play as one of three avatars with variously diabolical backgrounds and perks, they don&apos;t seem to be capable of a whole load. They stand around, give a stat-boost to nearby minions, and can prioritize the use or construction of a single object. That&apos;s it. I expected to be able to do more than that with a character who&apos;s capable of formulating a plot to bring the entire world to its knees. But no problem, right? Because you&apos;ve got a whole host of minions to do your evil bidding, like a flock of detachable hands, or something. Except you can&apos;t control them directly. I&apos;m fine with that. It&apos;s a neat little gameplay mechanic in itself. You can set objects to be built, moved, destroyed or researched. You can designate the need for minions of a certain type in the big wide world, and tag enemy agents with various treatments. None of this needs any micromanagement, as your minions are totally autonomous. They react according to the stimui you place in the environment. Their AI is, at times, atrocious. Managing flow through corridors, despite being a neat little concept that makes sense, is made frustrating by the fact that, no matter how many routes are avaliable, the minions take the shortest. No matter how congested, or dangerous. Wonder why your minions aren&apos;t training? They&apos;re all standing around, waiting for eachother, at the T-Junction at the entrance to your base. Or walking really, really slowly to where they need to be. Sometimes, tasks just WONT happen. No reason is evident. Minions are free, the path is unobstructed, but the object won&apos;t be placed, the research won&apos;t be done. The captive won&apos;t be executed, leading to their escape and destruction of half your base from the inside. Oops, sorry. Your minions were too busy playing pinball, or standing around, oogling all your tasty, tasy stolen loot. The game is seperated into two sections: your base management, which covers a small island, and a control-roomesque overview of the world, seperated into sections, inside which are Acts of Infamy to complete, both optional and mandatory. You can kidnap people to train better minions, steal money, plot to discover new Acts, steal Loot, and blow things up. Each Act is unique and funny, but you don&apos;t get to see it happening. Your view never shifts from the control room, so when your minions blow up Nevada, you get a short generic radio-broadcast clip from the attacked region of the world, some of your minion tokens fall over, and... oh, and your Heat goes up. There are two gagues of how well you&apos;re operating in the world. Notoriety, which is &apos;good&apos;, and Heat, which is &apos;bad&apos;. Notoriety goes up in small amounts, almost never down, and displays how much you&apos;re respected and feared. Heat is how much a particular government wants to murder the **** out of you, and how many troops of what type and skill they&apos;re going to send to your island. It goes down over time, sloooowly. Notoriety has little use. Aside from a few arbitrary mission goals, and the ability to recruit directly-controlable, semi-invincible Henchmen from the world at various points of progress, it serves to do pretty much arse-all that is beneficial. It does attract the world leaders version of Henchmen, Super Agents, to your island, and they&apos;re a real pain. Henchmen, while not defeatable by ordinary Agents, can be killed by the frankly overpowered Super Agents. And late in the game, because you can do little except stall them until you unlock their &apos;defeat&apos; mission, the Agents get really, really tiresome. It&apos;s a brilliant concept, with huge amounts of loving detail. Minions group together in their off-time and smoke, the graphic style is impeccable, and the reflections and shine make everything beautiful. Grapically, it&apos;s a 10/10. Conceptually, it&apos;s a 10/10. In the execution, things fall flat. There&apos;s not enough incentive or reward to complete Acts, Henchmen are mostly redundant, enemies are overpowered in the endgame. But by god, is it one of the most worthwhile games I&apos;ve ever played, if only because it&apos;s a beacon of an underplayed genre with megalitres of potential. It could have been done a LOT worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=2161043">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sadly there are only 2 levels, but with all the reasearch and the length of time missions can take this is a game you can play for hours on end with the many different traps and science devices you can strap agents too, uncluding a laser like the classic bond film, Gold Finger. One hell of a buy if you ask me :)
<br>
<br>I highly recommend altering the gaming code for more minions as 100 is very small when you start getting secret agents coming on your island and massacreing everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=3406950">Expand</a></span>

You play one of three evil geniuses, every different evil genius has different skills so choose your evil genius wisely. You may have noticed you have three basic minions and one henchman, like your evil genius your Henchman has his own specific  skills too. Your goal is to take over the world. How I hear you ask? Build an underground lair of course. Be careful with the design of your rooms once its build you cant go back.  You cant run the world with that number of staff, so you will need to build a barracks straight away to get more minions in your staff roster. At the start of the game. It will look like your building a hotel for your minions but once you have build the basic rooms (more importantly your control room.) You will have the ability to send your minions world wide to Plot, Steal and complete jobs. This is where your multitask skills would come in handy. You will find your self cycling back and forward to your lair to map view trying to juggle killing spies or capturing them and sending your guys to steal, plot or do jobs. Worth mentioning also is you will have to micromanage mostly everything especially your avatar evil genius you do not want him in any room with spies. Don&apos;t worry though you can build traps, Armoury and freezer rooms  to help you out. Oh No the electric cut off just remember to save a big room for your power plant this will get annoying once you build many rooms but I am afraid it as to be done. In the later game you will have enough minions to upgrade to scientist minions and enough money to build better new exciting rooms for all your staff. You will see a lot of the objects have upgraded like doors and traps. You will also be building a hotel to keep the spies occupied and off your tail. So there is a lot to do in this Fun packed 60s James Bond cliche game. Its to bad this game didn&apos;t get as famous but there is still devoted fans websites out there for this game. I loved it  8 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evil-genius/user-reviews?user_review_id=4400781">Expand</a></span>
