But this was just embarrassing for Telltale... cheesy lines, and poor acting made this episode unenjoyable for me and my little brother, and if you have played Telltale other games, you would know that this is not their best work. But despite of all the horrible voice acting and the lame jokes... I found that this has potential to become something great. The dialogue system is pretty good and the cinematics are worth looking at.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to give this a few more episodes to see if Telltale can redeem itself. But otherwise.. this isn&apos;t something I won&apos;t recommend to anyone, even if you are a diehard fan of minecraft. I would suggest skipping this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5545914">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve loved all of your game series to some extent, Night at the Inventory were great time sinks while making dinner with a good sense of humor, The Walking Dead and especially Tales From the Borderlands are story masterpieces in my opinion and Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones are interesting even if they do leave me feeling cold or bored from time to time...But you see, that&apos;s a pretty important distinction. The Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones had me bored or uninspired every now and then, mostly in later episodes.
<br>
<br>For Minecraft, bored and uninspired is my default. And that&apos;s not a good thing. In a point and click adventure you should NOT be waiting for something engrossing to happen. The characters (save for Ruben who&apos;s adorable) are all uninteresting, even the ones I wanted to like was more out of me liking their design and less them giving me something to love. This is especially hurtful to me as I was one of the only one of my friends that had faith in this series, as a fan of The Fallen Kingdom series of music videos of minecraft I thought there could be a chance for a good story to come out of this. Who knows, maybe the series is having a slow build up and episodes 3+ will tap into that possibility for good story that I originally saw and I would still love to be proven wrong about my current view on the series but with the way it is now I doubt it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5648883">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now lets get started.
<br>This game is the worst game I have ever played. Lets just start there. I won&apos;t talk about the graphics or music because they are just mediocre and nuff said.
<br>Now the gameplay, or should I say, the parts of the game where you actually do something. If telltale got rid of the &quot;walk around and look at stuff&quot; sequences that take up about 5% of runtime, this game could be almost played by starting it and going afk. On every choice there is an option to stay silent, but if you run out of time on the choice it automatically picks the silence option. Other than the box that says &quot;Ivor will remember this&quot; if you punch him, nothing big actually happens. And that leads to the biggest flaw of this game. How your choices don&apos;t do anything to affect the story. And if you don&apos;t believe me, just keep reading. So, I played through the game, picking all the choices that I wanted. Then, I played the game again, except this time I picked different choices for all of them. For example, I picked building a creeper on my first run, and after building they said &quot;oh this was a great idea&quot; and i thought &quot;i guess i picked right... Maybe I should build an enderman next time and see&quot; so i did that and they said &quot;oh this was a great idea&quot;. SEE!?! There was no difference whatsoever. Same thing for EVERY choice. On my first run, I didn&apos;t sour up the deal at all, which Petra liked me for. Then, on my next run, I tried to get him to go. I stayed silent for every single option. AND HE STAYED!!!! And also, if the game forces you to pick an option (like when you have to save petra or gaberille near the end), if you do nothing, it JUST KILLS YOU! The game finds some way to kill you but in reality it is just basically saying &quot;HEY don&apos;t exploit me u dumb butt just die already!&quot; THIS IS RIDICULOUS! What is the point of calling it a CHOICE &amp; CONSEQUENCE game if there IS NO CONSEQUENCE!!! Also, the voice acting is terrible and the jokes are lame. A final thing that is bad about this game is that the cutscenes are not very well meshed, so it is pretty common that a part will repeat itself or skip ahead. Also the quicktime events are overused.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5548477">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Typical TellTale fare, that&apos;s something some might like
<br>-It has one puzzle! Ok, that sounds stupid but I&apos;ve never played a TellTale game with one in awhile!
<br>-Minecraft fans will love the references.
<br>-Some of the moments in the game are kinda funny, but that&apos;s it.
<br>-Surprising amount of paths for a TellTale game.
<br>-If you liked games like The Order 1886 and the Rambo Video Game, then this is for you! All QTEs! (like other TellTale games)
<br>
<br>Nitpicks:
<br>-Voice Performance is great, but some of these voices are kinda annoying to hear.
<br>-Dialogue is definitely not for everyone.
<br>-If you made this game intended for children, why does Petra say &quot;hell&quot; twice in a single scene? Why are these characters saying snarky things, why does my character call everything stupid? The dialogue here feels way too snarky for it&apos;s own good.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Other characters aren&apos;t given substantial time to really be fleshed out
<br>-It&apos;s cute that the battle system tries to mimic Minecraft, but it **** sucks
<br>-A lot of the Minecraft elements like the previously mentioned combat and crafting feel half-hearted and shoehorned in, to say the least.
<br>-I get it that it&apos;s a Minecraft world, but who are these guys? Are they adults? Do they have jobs? Why do they build ****
<br>-TellTale games are normally kinda buggy, but holy **** this game is a buggy mess
<br>-I&apos;m OK with cheesy dialogue as long as it&apos;s done in a kind of campy way, like the Metal Gear games. This game is literally maximum cringe at times.
<br>-It&apos;s literally TWD for kids. The characters are on a bridge fending against two sides of enemies and zombies. Your character at one point will fall on the ground trying to fight away from a monster.
<br>-TellTale, did you fire your Sam &amp; Max/Monkey Island team or some **** Why is there only one puzzle?
<br>
<br>Let me say it this way: Imagine a story that takes you to a completely new world, where it wastes your time on telling some unnecessary part of the story, but you still have no reason to care for these characters. The only character I legit liked was Lukas, and that&apos;s because his archetype is the typical &quot;super nice guy&quot;.
<br>
<br>The game tries to come off with this Ghostbusters/Goonies vibe, and that&apos;s definitely there, but right now I&apos;m seeing a kid&apos;s version of TWD without the likable characters. The game&apos;s dialogue can range from sometimes funny for someone (like me) who&apos;s played Minecraft before, or absolutely cringey to even the biggest fans of the game. There was a lot of effort put into the game in terms of multiple paths, character customization, voice performance, but not enough in the departments where TellTale are known best for.
<br>
<br>This is also TellTale&apos;s buggiest game ever. I had two game-breaking bugs in Episode 1 and Episode 2 of Tales from the Borderlands; Combined. Here, numerous crashing on my PC and a lot of weird tidbits going on just kinda make this game even harder to play. I get it that TellTale releases episodic games but they need to take a break for at least one **** year and upgrade their engine, that thing is seriously outdated junk.
<br>
<br>Story Mode has serious potential though. This is the first time I&apos;ve noticed TellTale truly stepping up in having more multiple paths, but there wasn&apos;t enough of it in this episode. The voice acting is decent, but Patton Oswalt makes Jesse sound snarky and Brain Posehn makes Axel sound more of an unnecessary ****
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it the benefit of the doubt though, I&apos;m barely out of the young 12 year old demographic for this game, right? Minecraft: Story Mode really didn&apos;t needed to start this sluggish (The first 30 minutes were absolutely tiresome to play, compared to say Tales from the Borderlands or TWD), and hopefully it&apos;ll pick up. For now though, if you aren&apos;t a fan of Minecraft, then this is something you should seriously not play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5551079">Expand</a></span>

It has no elements of minecraft, mainly its about a bunch of people in a game with GRAPHICS like minecraft, but lacks what makes the original game unique. A common criticism of telltale is that their games don&apos;t have gameplay elements of other adventure games and only has QuickTime events combined with some dialog options. In a good adventure game there needs to be a good deal of puzzles and problem solving and i feel that the redstone might be the puzzle aspect that telltale desperately needed to even be considered a game but it wasn&apos;t there like i wanted it to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5650420">Expand</a></span>

<br>to add to that there are no failure states you rarely even have to react as the QTE often resolve themselfs resolting in akward situations where your supposed to see cool moment but nothing happends.

I dont hate Minecraft because I have no reason to.
<br>
<br>So after playing the game I noticed this is directed for children. But I really still liked the game because as an adult you understand really whats going when chosing answers. Since its Teltale games I played a their other games you really have to think before answering. Now for children they might think otherwise. Lets talk about Lukas. In every childs or childs show there is always a bad gang kids around. Lukas Is one of em but he&apos;s really nice compared to his friends in the gang. Now you see Lukas is trying to get friendly with you and you understand but for a childs pov he might think, &quot;Hes just a bully im still gonna hate him&quot;
<br>Well im no child expert but thats what I think.
<br>
<br>For a childs game it doesn&apos;t  have blood neither vulgar language. The adventure in the game is really nice. I can see teltale wanted to make games for children to enjoy since all their works been for Adults and teens. Minecraft is now a game pretty much everyone knows. Kids love it so teltale could gain really good money by this and thats the problem I have there. 22 euro is really a lot for a game like this. Mostly is about animation and talking you dont get to play much but the price is pretty high. But otherwise the story or the quailty of the work is pretty nice. That concludes my review.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s my first review ever I done on a game so plss be easy on me. Everygame cant be the best but since I really like Teltale games i&apos;m giving it 8/10.
<br>You might noticed my grammar fails and wrong speelings, sorry english isn&apos;t my native language.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5571847">Expand</a></span>

<br>The dumbest thing in this game is when you choose an option and next time you play it and choose a diffrent option and nothing changes. i was really shocked when you build somthing you cant build your own you must just buttonsmash and it builds it self. rly wtf. wtf dude...
<br>the only goodthing was ruben and the minecraft world design and thats it.
<br>if you wanna play a good game play minecraft not this game, this one is for 7-10 years old children who like to buttonsmash and dont understand that your doings doesnt effect something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5549616">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay focuses more around the characters and is mostly story-driven.
<br>The times where you can control your character is usually when deciding what to say in a conversation/make a quick decision, or control them around a short moving space. What you say and what you do impacts the course of the story depending on the way you play it.
<br>Unfortunately, seeing as the main focus of the game is the story, you&#x2019;d expect the creators to make a creative, original story to be remembered and explored through your actions, pushed ahead by original and uniquely designed characters. This is what would make a good story.
<br>Except the story and characters are the most unoriginal things that they cannot be taken seriously.
<br>The game opens with a legend about 4 heroes each with different strengths, one in combat, another in Redstone, another in&#x2026; explosions (what) and architecture, who defeat the Enderdragon.
<br>The main character is named Jesse, who I&#x2019;m going to refer to as male for this review. He is the typical nice guy underdog with a group of friends. The character is generic and everything you&#x2019;ve ever seen before. He has a pet pig. His other friends are a female black friend and the &#x201C;big dumb stupid&#x201D; stereotype. There are the generic bully characters who seem unable to come up with any insult other than &#x201C;loser&#x201D; (actually they used &#x201C;trashbag&#x201D; at some point which I applauded at for being original for 3 seconds), and the obligatory badass female character. The characters aren&#x2019;t interesting and the plot feels like it was written by a 12 year old.
<br>Except 12 year olds have ideas that they probably care about intensely. Even a 12 year old would put more care into making a better story, even if it is a power fantasy of themselves.
<br>In a story based game, you should care about the plot and characters and feel bad if the characters get hurt. Except you don&#x2019;t care about them because they&#x2019;re easily labelled stereotypes and wouldn&#x2019;t care if they all died in a fire, and therefore you can&#x2019;t get invested in the game. Which just makes it a boring drag. By the time everyone got to the Nether I actually missed numerous quick time events because I was busy checking my phone.
<br>I played on my trusty PS3 as I&#x2019;m sure none of the computers in the house would be able to run it very well (my laptop can hardly manage 3FPS on minimal graphical settings). It was mostly fine except the crosshair used to interact with objects or people seems ridiculously awkward and hard to control. Although assuming the game was designed for PC it is forgivable to a certain extent. The walking controls are a bit sluggish and yet again awkward and the camera angles the game throws at you can often make it even more difficult to control. Then there&#x2019;s the framerate. My goodness the framerate. It runs at a solid speed (not sure of the exact number) for most of the game but whenever there&#x2019;s a lot of blocky people on screen with lighting effects galore, I swore the framerate had dropped to 10 or maybe even 3. Couldn&#x2019;t they have removed some of the lighting for the PS3&#x2026;? It just seems poor.
<br>As much as this game is for 7 year olds, and as a 14 year old girl, it isn&#x2019;t for me. But when the plot is this lazy it doesn&#x2019;t feel like there was any passion or vision to create and tell an interactive story. It feels more like an effortless cash grab with Minecraft graphics slapped on it so it&#x2019;ll sell to the masses of children who sadly don&#x2019;t know better. They even pull the &#x201C;put random light swearing everywhere to get that PG rating&#x201D; thing and have characters say &#x201C;what the hell&#x201D; and &#x201C;damn&#x201D; repeatedly when you can give a &#x201C;what the heck&#x201D; or &#x201C;darn&#x201D; just as easily.
<br>I can&#x2019;t recommend this game to anyone but little Minecraft fans who can enjoy the game for &#x201C;it&#x2019;s minecraft&#x201D;. If you&#x2019;re a gamer above the age of 12 or with a good sense of good storytelling, then this game is not worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5681354">Expand</a></span>

Like interactive stories in Telltale&apos;s style, 2. enjoy playing Minecraft.
<br>
<br>Other people should consider the purchase, but the game may not meet your expectations.  Telltale&apos;s style is just about opposite from regular Minecraft.  Minecraft is open-world, plot-free, unguided, all about freedom while Telltale games are like interactive movies with more movie than interaction.  Also this game is very &quot;family friendly&quot; while the other Telltale games I&apos;ve played are for adults.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a fan of both styles and find this game very enjoyable and worthwhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5545438">Expand</a></span>

There was pretty fun fighting scenes and interactions but the story wasn&apos;t very intriguing. Average start here by Telltale Games here and that&apos;s not very often.

This game gives you some difficult choices which DO actually affect your story. I am definitely waiting for next four episodes.

I have not played any other TellTaleGames Games, nor do i enjoy quick-time events. Still this game really caught me with its story. It may be clearly aimed at younger people (which i am no longer counting myself towards with 18 years) but if you do like Minecraft, it is worth its money so far.
<br>
<br>The Graphics reach what all fans have created in awesome animations, but still stays mostly true to the Minecraft universe - 9.5/10
<br>
<br>The story has yet to unfold as this is part 1 of 5, but so far i am pleased - current rating: 8/10
<br>
<br>The Gameplay lacks a lot of interactivity, but that is what a visual novel or story-based game is NOT about. As mentioned before, i hate quick-time events, but these are simple and easy to understand, though i am annoyed by that fact i had to jump with E instead of Space - 7/10
<br>
<br>Including the blast i had playing it and the reaction of my friends, i come to a total score of 9/10 and i am looking forward to playing the rest of the story in a universe i learned to love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5560724">Expand</a></span>

Everybody was talking about it, was making videos about it, and even getting dressed as Minecraft&apos;s monsters or Steve. The game were awesome because of it&apos;s freedom and it&apos;s &quot;survival game&quot; potential.
<br>But, from night to day, Minecraft has fallen to oblivion. Why? Well, for me, there were no objective left at all but building senseless structures.
<br>So, let&apos;s talk about Telltale now. The first game of them that I put my hands on was The Walking Dead, a great and dramatic game that honors the series and the HQs. I have only compliments about then.
<br>Then, Minecraft: Story Mode was announced. I didn&apos;t know what to expect from it: A dramatic game like The Walking Dead or a creative, but aimless, construction game.
<br>Then, the game was released. I gave it a try, because I&apos;m a great fan of Minecraft. And the results were incredible: I fell in love with the game at the first episode.
<br>About the first twenty minutes of gameplay, the game may see horrible, pointless, and childish. But then, I saw Telltale&apos;s magic going on again: Charismatic characters, hard choices and a contextualized story on the great Minecraft&apos;s universe. It was like someone finally added a point to the game that got pointless.
<br>And no, you don&apos;t have to be a child to enjoy the game. Minecraft: Story Mode is uprooting, cheerful and has a great adventure. It&apos;s only bad if you want to see something bad in the game. By the way, if you want blood, death and dramatic, there&apos;s The Walking Dead right from Telltale. They honored Minecraft in all ways and people are complaining about this.
<br>So, don&apos;t give up on the game just for the low reviews out there. The game is impressive and, above anything, fun, and you should really give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5648714">Expand</a></span>

Considering there&apos;s no story in actual Minecraft (the player makes it up in their mind based on it&apos;s sandbox approach) this idea of a game was stretch to say the least. Telltale&apos;s MSM is as what Cars 2 is to Pixar. But I&apos;ll blame Mojang for this one.</span>

The game&apos;s story may not be particularly as hooking as TTG&apos;s other big names, but I think it perfectly adapted and dramatized the Minecraft world. I never played any Minecraft games but my sister definitely liked watching my playthrough, she seems to relate much.</span>

I know telltale games are know for their games being for more mature audiances, but this is minecraft we&apos;re talking about here!!! I mean the voice acting is laughably bad, but so are most youtube videos on minecraft, and then the animations are as blocky as the actual game is, so what if it&apos;s not a mature enough game, give it more of a chance</span>

You&apos;re also introduced to Petra and Lukas, some more allies of Jesse.
<br>Without spoiling too much of the plot, you go to endercon, witherthing breaks out, you go to nether story done! As I said before, this is just the tutorial episode, but it does a decent job of hooking people in. It is a little lackluster though, but trust me on this one. The other episodes are worth your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5952312">Expand</a></span>

Graphics is **** storyline is interesting and cause play second episode, gameplay in Episode 1 short, but good, in Second Episode longer and better.

<br>
<br>This game is so simple and the worlds worst 2015 release ever. And i will tell you why:
<br>
<br>1. Story
<br>Story is so simple that it&apos;s like a 8 year old has made it. And it&apos;s one of the worlds worst TT story out there. It&apos;s basically a person named Jesse with his pet pig named Reuben and his best friend named Olivia in a tree house. Then Axel scares them. Everyone wanted to win this competition called the &quot;Endercon Competition&quot; to see Gabriel the warrior (who defeated the ender dragon). They failed and this character gives this man named Ivor a wither skull just for a diamond (really, a diamond?). Ivor cheated out the deal and took the wither skull, put the wither skull on a shape like T (the way to make a wither) with a command block (how the heck did he get that? Those are not obtainable in survival!), and makes this thing called the wither storm, that is not in normal minecraft at all! See, simple as that and the way this person named Soren who tell the story, on the 4th Episode, of how they beaten the ender dragon to solve a puzzle. At the end Soren says that Gabriel pokes it with his sword and BOOM, IT&apos;S DEAD! *sigh* See what I mean, the story is just awful, and simple.
<br>
<br>2. Acting and animation
<br>The acting is what brings the game to a 1 because it&apos;s just horrible. Animation, well, it&apos;s good, but the mouth movement is SUPER choppy. The character animation is smooth, but the mouth movement just ruins the acting.
<br>
<br>3. Gameplay
<br>It&apos;s basically 10% gameplay, and 90% cutseens. What is the point in choosing what decision if it&apos;s not going to effect anything? Also, it&apos;s just button smashing in this game. You don&apos;t have freedom on where to go, only some decisions, yes, that&apos;s it, some. And why make them say &quot;crap&quot; like 10 times in the whole game, and &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;damn&quot; in a E10+ game? It&apos;s so easy not to have cussing in a simple game.
<br>
<br>4. Battles
<br>Combat in this game is very bad in this game. You just move left and right, push up to get close to the enemy, and click left mouse to swing your sword. That&apos;s it, nothing special here everyone.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m so disappointed in this game, it&apos;s basically a cash grab for TT. Don&apos;t believe me? On Black Friday on steam it was only 15% off and it $25.00. So it made it was $23.25 in order to buy the game. Why? Just why? The Walking Dead was almost $5.00 - $3.00 on Black Friday and that game is a masterpiece! So disappointing.... DON&apos;T BUY!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5547647">Expand</a></span>

<br>Minecraft: Story Mode may be that one Telltale game that nobody likes, but as a long-time Minecraft fan, I enjoyed this game for the most part. The story follows Jesse, a guy who hoped to win the building contest and meet Gabriel the Warrior. The animation of this game is... eh. I&apos;m playing it on the PC version, but the animation is lackluster, and compared to Minecraft animators, they could&apos;ve done a better job. The game may not be as action-packed as The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, but it&apos;s still engaging, and I was hooked when I played this game. It&apos;s only the first episode, but I bet this game will get even better as time goes on.

                                        <span>I played it,because i didnt have anything else to do and overall it wasnt that bad.I am sure this will intrigue more young audiences.The voice acting was a little worse than a typicall TT game,but the story isnt half bad.I believe it can get even more interesting with the more episodes.</span>
