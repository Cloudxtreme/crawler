The missions and story are boring and at times downright frustrating. For a game focused on your heroes acting on their own the AI is very poor to say the least. Examples being heroes constantly willing to get themselves killed in no win situation, not attacking enemies beside them, running through hordes of higher level enemies to pick up treasure, chasing a peasant halfway across the map to cast a buff when they&apos;re supposedly on a mission to protect a key building etc... There are too many to list that I&apos;ve seen and as the intelligence (or lack thereof) is the core of the game play it sucks the fun out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=84940">Expand</a></span>

I venture to say the AI in the original may have been better. It feels like a downgrade from Majesty 1:Northern Expansion in everything but graphics.</span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m a big fan of RTS games, but this game just isn&apos;t worth your money. The game is based on a proven formula, but Majesty 2 is poorly executed. Most single player games end up the same way: you frantically fight for your life before you get your first buildings built, hope nothing major is destroyed, try to get up a few key buildings as monsters swarm your town, then all of a sudden, your heroes are mopping the floor with the enemy. It swings from frustrating to boring in seconds, never hitting the right balance.
<br>
<br>The tutorial is okay but doesn&apos;t quite teach enough. Controls need a little work. Music is boring. The game does have some decent dry humor.
<br>
<br>This game just isn&apos;t worth getting. RTS fans should boot up a Blizzard game instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2750377">Expand</a></span>

Heroes are dumb as bricks, put a high reward up for a monster and watch all your rogues instantly run in and suicide. You can put heroes them together in a party but that doesn&apos;t help at all, as they don&apos;t act as a team whatsoever. One hero can be being fired upon and the others just ignore it and continue attacking a nearby building. Monsters and heroes just walk past each other all the time. WHY is the AI so much worse than the original? It&apos;s not as if the intelligence of your minions in the first game was stunning, just basic but it worked. And why are half the missions extremely similar to ones in Majesty 1? Why are the hero types and buildings available pretty much just the same as the first game? Is this a sequel or a remake? This game is just lazy game design, plain and simple. Play the original instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2245888">Expand</a></span>

This is designed for people who love RPG type game but have always wanted to be on the other side of the action, as the omnipotent quest-giver pulling the strings of the hapless heroes. It does this very well and in many ways it makes you feel more like a king than most other strategy games out there. The game is a huge graphical upgrade from the previous Magesty and it is much more atheistically pleasing than most of Paradox&apos;s other titles from the same time period. It is very satirical and full of comedic gems for the RPG fan and it is narrated by an advisor who sounds suspiciously similar to Sean Connery. The gameplay is slow but the speeding can be increased and the start of missions are very repetitive, the game picks up about halfway through each mission and revolve around you ordering your heroes to kill an extremely powerful boss. While your heroes are the most enjoyable part of the game they cannot be directly controlled, which leads to many deaths and lots coin resurrecting them. You control them by offering rewards in gold for defeating a target, guarding an area or exploring the map, and you prioritise based on the amount of coin. Once your heroes accept a quest they will not abandon it until they are dead or it is completed which can lead to an ogre destroying your town while all your heroes are off fighting a rat. You can put them into groups which will work as a team but you cannot coordinate your groups so they will tickle into the boss fight getting eliminated one by one whereas a huge frontal assault would have made it child&apos;s play. That said Majesty2 is a well rounded game and it you can perfect your heroes response time it can be very enjoyable indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2133224">Expand</a></span>

Simply put, there is far too little here to justify the price-tag. The game lacks polish, charm and depth. The graphics are bland and one-dimensional. Heroes do not feel like they have genuine personalities and there is no opportunity to form any kind of attachment to them. Unlike 1C&apos;s earlier classic Space Ranges 2, in which the NPCs feel like they have genuine motivations and personalities, these heroes are generic and interchangeable. Some reviewer comments suggest that the heroes are &apos;temperamental&apos;, although I never once saw a hero throw a tantrum, get into an argument, get drunk, proposition someone or make unreasonable demands (not that you&apos;d really notice, in any case, given how they all blend into the background). Hero comments are limited to a single, endlessly repeated generic phrase. Almost exclusively, heroes will simply mull around if you haven&apos;t given them anything to do - which feels much more like uninspired programming than anything approximating a personality. The rogue and wizard heroes are essentially useless and the rest may as well be identical for as much as you&apos;re likely to notice. In the original, maps were somewhat balanced, in that more difficult challenges were closer to base, and harder challenges further out. In this version everywhere on the map is more or less the same, making the danger flags (that discourage heroes from entering certain areas) effectively redundant. If this were a &apos;strategy&apos; title most of the above would be forgivable. Strategy, however, as far as it goes, is limited to plonking down generic buildings, clicking on &apos;research&apos; buttons and tagging monsters with bounties. There is absolutely no opportunity for outsmarting an opponent other than through brute force. Simply put, the lack of complex hero interactions or interesting hero behaviour is simply unforgivable. Somehow, in spite of the above, this uninspired grind still caught my attention long enough for me to complete the full (thoroughly dull) campaign, hence why I&apos;m rating this a 4 and not a 1. Clearly it&apos;s been a slow week.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=85250">Expand</a></span>

The improvement from the first game is immense, and the first game and it&apos;s expansion were brilliant. The patch that they&apos;ve released addresses most all of the issues that people had with it. Is the game perfect? No, but it doesn&apos;t have to be at a mere $30. Well worth the buy.</span>

It has the great idea of not controlling your own troops, but instead focusing on economy, and using your gold wisely to manage troops, economy, and bounty flags. Now of course Majesty 2 has all of those same great features, which is what got the score up to around a three, but then it also has decent graphics. They are not breathtaking, but they are pretty good, plus the physics engine at the end of the game blows all the buildings up even on my good gaming computer. All that combined brings it up to a 4. Now for the problems. Majesty 2 has a lot more &quot;rules&quot; then majesty one. The troops per guild has been reduced, and each guild needs its own special upgrades that only apply to the troops belonging to it. This means that if you have 2 ranger&apos;s guilds, you have to upgrade the same thing twice in order for all your units to get the benefit. Sure this seems like a minor annoyance, so lets just say this isn&apos;t a big deal. Next on the list are the temples. Remember the buildings which let you produce the super units and win? Well those now have to be built on a special &quot;holy&quot; spot, and there are only a few in each map. Now only having 3 temples doesn&apos;t sound bad, but each temple only lets you make 2 people belonging to it. Yes that right, 2 people. So 2 times 3 is 6, so you get a maximum of 6 good units in the game. There are maps with more temple spots, and a few other ways to get upgraded units with a new &quot;promotion&quot; system where you can promote your simple units to fancy ones, but its not at all the same. Along with that, a few buildings have been taken out, and a few put in. A decent trade up, but I miss the fairgrounds. If this was a standalone game I would think its great, it has good graphics and good AI, but its not. The reason this game is bad is because for anyone that played the original Majesty, the entire game play is different because of the rules they put in. If you have never played Majesty before, you will probably love this game; its very original. On the other hand, if you played Majesty one and have been looking forward to this it is a complete letdown and changes the game entirely. But what were we supposed to expect from a different company? You win some you lose some.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=84831">Expand</a></span>

That said, I have a pretty favorable opinion of majesty 2. The wizards dont die in 1 hit from a rat at the start, but they&apos;re still pretty easily killed, and the addition of specific building locations for trade posts and temples is another limiting factor i&apos;m a fan of.

Set in a fantasy world (with the stereotypical rangers, dwarves, wizards, dragons and the like) Majesty 2 lets you play the role the King, focusing on the major decisions of building, research and growing your economy - while the bean-counting that usually dominates RTS, is thankfully left in the capable hands of the subjects themselves. You can group your subjects into parties (of up to 4 at an inn - well-balanced parties function much more effectively than the individuals by themselves and adds a great strategic element to the game) and set general objectives for them by setting different types of &apos;flags&apos; with gold rewards as incentives (to let them where, when and what you want them to do). In the end the style of game play is a great blend of the elements of SimCity, an RTS and a party-based RPG. It doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously either with plenty of quips (and narration by a Sean Connery sound-alike) that, if not hilariously funny, at least poke fun at itself and some of the fantasy stereo-types. As a budget-priced game, with plenty of add-ons and special offers on Steam, this provides plenty of fun-for-the-money, and many of the scenarios provide a rewardingly-difficult challenge - don&apos;t expect to blast through the main campaign without having to reload or even restart some of the tougher scenarios until you get a solid strategy figured out. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=1623754">Expand</a></span>

The heroes then earn money for doing this, which they spend in your shops buying armor, weapons and potions etc. They also gain experience in order to level up, so they become more powerful over time. Good stuff really and a sort of reverse RPG experience. Graphically, it is fine and the sound is appropriately Medieval. Basically it is a polished version of the original Majesty.
<br>
<br>Now, it is jolly difficult though, and not for the impatient. On many levels you are forced to do some trial and error to discover which direction to build your town in, what build order you might need for buildings, heroes and defensive towers etc, and which, if any, monster dwellings you should destroy first to reduce the pressure on your town. Making the wrong decision at basically any point will lead to inevitable demise ten minutes later as you are swarmed by monsters. At least on certain levels.
<br>I didn`t really mind all this so much though, since it`s just one more way to make a game a bit challenging by tightening the balance more than usual.
<br>What did somewhat bother me was the poor AI and accompanying lack of options for scripting hero behavior and particularly party behavior and formation. For example, rogues are good against weak stuff, but as soon as there is a boss fight, prepare to have a stream of dead rogues to resurrect from the graveyard. They trickle in alone and suicide or attack from the front like maroons right next to the tank, which is usually where all the aoe from the boss is happening. Also, if a party (Of four heroes, grouped up at the upgraded inn.) attacks something out of its league and the tank dies, the rest of the party will just mindlessly keep attacking the same thing until everyone is dead, rather than perhaps escaping. There are quite a few other issues as well. Perhaps the most annoying one is how easily mages die at first, which wouldn`t be such a problem if they weren`t so damn expensive to resurrect. Again, if they had been programmed with some semi-intelligent evasive behavior it would have helped a lot. It all gets rather annoying at times.
<br>I`m not gonna pretend that the AI issues are game breaking though, because there`s certainly a lot of entertainment to be had with Majesty 2. It is puzzling that Paradox couldn`t have managed a more functional AI though. Or perhaps the point is that Medieval heroes are thick as planks and that we should just accept it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=4523239">Expand</a></span>

Get 20 Russian game designers so drunk they pass out; promise them their freedom if they spend 2 hours slapping some better graphics on, then hope the game sells on name recognition? Sadly, I fell for their trap by buying the thing. Don&apos;t be sucked in like I was!

One slightly annoying tweak is that your heroes seem much stupider, and refuse to do much of anything if you don&apos;t throw down reward flags.  The difficulty curve is also a bit strange, and some missions are trivial, with others being extremely hard.  This issue continues in the expansions (Kingmaker, Battles of Ardania, Monster Kingdom), where the missions are punishingly hard, and not in a &quot;fun challenge&quot; kind of way.  The challenge, in most of these maps, comes from not knowing what or where the lairs / objectives are, and getting demolished if you build your early base in the wrong order or wrong direction.  Still, this game is a fun time sink, and I mostly enjoyed plowing my way through the campaigns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2309279">Expand</a></span>

On the plus side it is the most innovative RTS I&apos;ve seen in years; far more innovative than the uninspired and disappointing Starcraft 2.  More of a hybrid game really, it combines elements of old-style RTS&apos;s like Age of Empires with doses of city builders, RPG&apos;s, and tower defense games.   The really unique thing about it is that you do not have direct control over your military forces (i.e. heroes), but rather try to influence their behavior by issuing a series of bounties (kill enemy unit, destroy building, defend something, or scout area).  Also, at the end of each mission you have the choice of promoting one hero to the house of Lords, thus enabling you to bring them in on subsequent missions.  The only trouble is, the really buffed up heroes cost a lot of gold to bring back.  Further, buffed up heroes will only do what you want if you make the bounty sufficiently lucrative.  Anyway, this game would be an easy eight or maybe even a nine if not for the fact that it is so darned difficult.  Starting with about the third or fourth mission the game gets you either coming or going, and sometimes both.  That is, either the initial base-building phase is very hard and/or the end boss fight is very hard.  In other words, Majesty 2 is geared for the hard-core gamer.  If you are more of a casual gamer like myself you may find yourself getting frustrated with it.  I would also add that the game does have seem really cool high-level heroes like the Sisters of Krypta, assuming of course that you survive long enough to recruit them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2522236">Expand</a></span>

From that moment on I bought every game was set in Ardania (the name of this magical world). Paradox created same really good games.
<br>So what is so great about this game? First of all is quite innovative. You basically have to grow a city, constructing buildings, hiring heroes and enabling upgrades for your heroes. The money returns back on taxes and thing that your heroes buy. Your heroes are not directly paid by you, but they have to explore the world finding chests, killing enemies or solving quests that you gave them. Giving quest through flags is the only way you have to interact with them. There are four types: defend an area/escort something, kill that thing/destroy that den, explore that area or don&apos;t go there (this a special one that simply keeps heroes far from a dangerous area).
<br>Said like that seems quite a simple game, but I have to say that the story is not original but really interesting, the maps have an increased level of difficulty (visible before entering the level) and I have to say even after having finished the game multiple times, the hardest missions are really hard if you are not quick enough to level your heroes and make them strong enough to achieve your final objective before you are overwhelmed by monsters coming from everywhere. Yes, there are quite a few bugs, some heroes are particularly dumb and sometimes you have to personally save their life by healing them or killing their opponent with magic that you unlock during the campaign, but in general is really absorbing and I never found problems playing with it or really annoying bugs that spoil your fun while playing.
<br>There are several expansions that add new missions, heroes, buildings and some stuff for the multiplayer mode. I&apos;m not interested in multiplayer in general, so never tried and I can&apos;t comment it, but here this mode is present.
<br>Even if now the graphic is a little outdated, I would still recommend it, in particular for a bargain price to random players who just want to have some fun, especially the first missions are quite easy even for not experts and every mission is re-playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2943159">Expand</a></span>

Have you ever wondered, what is the king doing, while you risk your life in a dark dungeon, trying to complete the quest he gave you  Well, in this game you will be the one sitting on the throne, giving quests for heroes and watching them die for your cause. Game itself is mix between strategy and RPG system. You begin with your castle, few houses and some gold in your treasury. You can build guilds, where you can hire heroes, support buildings like market and blacksmith, where your heroes can buy better equipment, potions etc. You can also build defense towers, but not walls. Hired heroes have their unique names, they level up, have inventory for potions, rings, they can buy better weapons and armor, they can loot chests they find. They have their own mind, you cant control them directly like in other strategy games, but you can give them quests with rewards, like defending a bulding, attacking a monster or lair and scouting an area. If the reward for the quests is high enough, some heroes will go and fulfil the quest. If he suceed, he gain money, return to village, buy better equipment, refill his potions and he waits for another quest. Economic itself is a nicely done game mechanic. You get money from taxes and trade (the more money heroes spend in your market, the more money you get from it). You can also build trade caravans on special places on map. As heroes level up, they can use class specific abilities (which you must first unlock by researching it). We have mages, clerics, knights, rangers, thiefs, elves, dwarfs and each of them has unique pros and cons. Each guild you build can hire up to 3 heroes of that class, so if you want more mages, you must build another wizzards guild which will cost you twice more gold then the first one, same comes with every building and towers. Every hero who die, can be revived in graveyard (in later game you can have ressurect spell), when revived he have the same inventory he had and of course the same level as he died. But the higher the level of hero, the more the ressurect costs. As a king, you can also use magic (after you research it), which costs you gold from your treasury. You can heal, destroy, revive and more. Now for the cons. Sometimes heroes lost their lives in useless fight, sometimes when you give them quest to destroy enemy wizzards towers, healers decide not to go and your 10 another heroes gets killed because of that. At least you can put heroes in groups (using tavern) which almost eliminates this.
<br>Graphics is nice, with the right fantasy look, hero will look different with basic equipment and masterwork equipment, dificulty is nicely done, sometimes the game will give you hell, but its fun, not frustrating, campaing is developing, alowing you to use more and more things as you advance, there is also place for fun, your advisor will make you smile almost everytime he says something. If you are RPG/strategy fan, this is something you must have or at least try. Seriously, I mean it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=2941067">Expand</a></span>

The improvement from the first game is immense, and the first game and it&apos;s expansion were brilliant. The patch that they&apos;ve released addresses most all of the issues that people had with it. Is the game perfect? No, but it doesn&apos;t have to be at a mere $30. Well worth the buy.</span>

Sadly, Majesty 2 messes up so many things that made the original so entertaining. Among these are a more homogenized character AI that rarely acts on its own, an annoyingly large ramp up in the difficulty (Seriously, some of the &quot;Advanced&quot; missions in the sequel could have passed for &quot;Expert&quot; in the original), and a conspicuous lack of a decent map creator. That being said, it does manage to do some things right- the 3-D graphics are beautiful, the humor is even wittier, and the royal adviser does a brilliant impression of Sean Connery. It may be disappointing for expectant fans, but new initiates can enjoy it for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894589">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is a variety of missions and quests, some of which require attacking specific places or killing a monster which requires certain strategy. Others require simultaneous construction of some temples or defending a merchant caravan.
<br>
<br>&quot;Majesty 2&quot; has nice, colorful 3D fantasy graphics and music which sets the mood really nice (with some beautifully epic pieces for final monster fights). There is a huge choice of hero classes like warriors, wizards, rogues, clerics, paladins and nice selection of monsters with their dwellings including vampire crypts, elemental portals and wolf dens.
<br>
<br>The game has a unique style merging some qualities of &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot;, some of &quot;Age of Empires&quot; and others from RPG games. Many missions are really demanding. I needed to consult strategy guides to finish some of the levels, but even after reading a strategy guide you can find your unique tactics to defeating the boss. After 25 hours of playing I have finished this really enjoyable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/majesty-2-the-fantasy-kingdom-sim/user-reviews?user_review_id=4485502">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was a fan of Majesty 1, so that one was no brainer.
<br>In the beginning I was terrified by difficulty level, but basically you just need to learn how to play, and how to synnergise your classes together.
