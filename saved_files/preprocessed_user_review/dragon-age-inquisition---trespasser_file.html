Mostly because of the chance to marry Cullen, that was so sweet! It was nice to have a wedding, it was nice to see all the old companions and catch up with their news! I&apos;m glad I also got to see Solas again as I became very fond of him from playing the main game so many times.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m pleased the developers gave us way to choose our armour/clothing styles and continue to craft stuff from the area but I did miss having access to the mirror of transformation. (But that&apos;s a small gripe) The armour we get during this dlc is quite nice too, prettier than the Hakkon and Descent armours. I would like the option to drop those ghastly metal shoulder pads though ;)
<br>
<br>All in all a nice conclusion to DAI and a wonderful addition to my games library. I&apos;m very content my inquisitor can now go off and live happily ever after with Cullen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-inquisition---trespasser/user-reviews?user_review_id=5499168">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Where the DLC falters are it&apos;s enemy encounters. The game is unrelenting in how many Qunari you have to kill and combat quickly becomes a tedious affair. While there is a new Inquisitor ability, it does little to relieve the monotony of hitting damage sponge enemies over and over again. And of course, Bioware decided to include a dragon for the sake of it. The best parts of Trespasser are the non-combat sequences, though even these aren&apos;t perfect. Some character interactions can feel overly dramatic and saccharine, though these were more the exception than the norm.
