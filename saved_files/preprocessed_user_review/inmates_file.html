The exploration is pretty interesting, with a lot of psychological and real life references. Overall I liked the game, the puzzles were pretty interesting.

Totally worth the money spent, highly recommended. This is a full 9 considering that all the work was done by 1 developer. Keep up the good work, waiting for new titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inmates/user-reviews?user_review_id=7589762">Expand</a></span>
