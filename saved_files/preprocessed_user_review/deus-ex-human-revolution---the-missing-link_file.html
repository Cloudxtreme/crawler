<br>
<br>While it is supposed to be really missed 3 days from original story, you can not import your existing hero. You have no accustomed powers. You have no explanation, why Jensen shows no wonder being freed from the chains (chair to be precise).  Same rooms, same levels for a good amount of time. Worst &quot;ship&quot; of all times. Authors have no idea that any unsecured cargo with even a little wind will became a deadly projectile so there may be no boxes laying around. The longest speeches I have ever saw having place in this DLC and it looks like they exists solely to  stretch the game time a bit. Too much of women screams repeating the same things. Not sure if recently  raped or beaten women have a bravery to attract their torturers attention... Honestly I doubt it. A lot of  holes in the story like &quot;you will have only one use on his eye&quot;. Isn&apos;t that clearly says that the second return will be through the cold Burke&apos;s body? Tons, dozens of weak walls. It&apos;s a miracle that ship and the base still exist in one piece, no really they sound like a swiss cheese - hole on the hole. Quest problems: sorry mate, you can&apos;t go up this stairs or we will mark current quest as failed one. No really? The damned 1 meter fails all the progress and leave no hope? Daaady pleeeeeaaaase may I open this door without having quest failed? Jensen vis-a-vis uses voice transformer for a first few communications but after that drops out any caution. Who cares about radio interception? Damn, guys, this is all about their (Jensen and do-not-want-to-spoil) lives!!! OMG! They uses the scorched earth tactic!!! They let the gas out. Wait what? Gas? Come on even in our 2012 nor gus, nor explosion hides nothing. Every piece of metal, plastic and tissue may and will tell a long story. Besides that they knows about augmentation that makes immune to gas and Jensen by their own words has a best augs they ever see. And their own soldiers walks without gas masks. Brilliantly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=2872022">Expand</a></span>

He is just mad that he sucks at the game, he must be a little child who can&apos;t think of any other way to play besides run and gun...he should go back to playing straight shooters or COD... newb...

I am a Customer and they need to earn money, but its over that fast, that it hurts in your wallet. Not enough Deus Ex cant reach the athmosphere of part 1 even part 2.. The immersion they told you about.. Dont exists in the Dlc and merely in the maingame.
<br>Its just a hit in the face. Design decisions made by the dev forced you to throw away your beloved goods and yes you can store them, but there are no crates, there are no boxes, or safes you can put it in.
<br>And you can see it, it looks like a playstation or an Xbox game.. They will deliver 2 markets, but a Pc-Player likes complex games. And Consolegames arent. This no Cyberpunky Rpg this is a mess.
<br>
<br>You gather and like to level, only to make sure that you soon and thats very soon have to throw away something. Or maybe to sell. But even thats senseless cuz the Vendors havent much interesting in stock.  That means to sell it makes not much sense..^^
<br>The whole game feels like gothic 3. They made all the great promises, but that things never made it in game.
<br>The story.. is like in Dragon Age.. Feels like if the devs wanna do an rpg to kick some.. You know what I mean. But soon you understand, that there is no magic in that. But thats why you liked the older Deus Ex..
<br>And believe me, the quests are terrible. You have to do hard work to go on in that okay story but its not fun, cuz the gameplay soon let you loose your fun in that. And nothing from that few, you maybe can like from the original Deus Ex you can see in the Dlc.. Its not worth your money. Dont believe that fanboys. Guess they get money to say that.^^</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=1825536">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the game but i have to admit, there were many reasons not to like it.i&apos;ll just put down some pros and cons.<br>pros 1:if you loved exploring in the first one, every nook and corner...well this has a lot to explore and secrets and achievements<br>pros 2:some people said the AI was bad. i didn think so... but then the enemies never see me coming.lots of enemies to take down using stealth strategies.<br>pro and con: for me this was a pro as it was more realistic...the boss fight in this game is more fun..and not pure brute force like the previous one..i mean after all that stealth going rambo style, was annoying to me.<br>pro and con: the story was interesting to a particular point....but after that was pretty boring<br>con 1:the open world atmosphere which i enjoyed in the previous one is absent here...you&apos;re in a closed environment(a factory and a ship to be precise) all the time...<br>con 2:another aspect i loved in HR was the conversations i had with people..each person i met on the streets, in hotels,clubs etc always had something to say...here you talk to a maximum of 3 or 4 people and that&apos;s stretching it.<br>con 3:unlike HR, you have to spend praxis points carefully as you get very little. I found out too late that some of you augment upgrades like the typhoon and social enhancer you never get to use at all...and certain other augments which i didnt even upgrade in HR were necessary here.<br>con 4:side quests are not fun. you&apos;d just be doing it to get a completionist achievement.<br>other cons: the body scan parts were annoying, and there is this prison location where people keep on whining and shouting.<br>overall game is good for one play-through, but that&apos;s it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803377">Expand</a></span>

The game is full of life, graphics are pretty good... yeah they aren&apos;t crysis 2 w/ updated graphics patch and high resolution pack, but who cares? If you bought Human Revolution you didn&apos;t buy this game to play a tech demo, you bought it for its creativity, good story, replay ability and the many many many choices you have on how you want to play the game... malau also complains about it only being fun if you got all the augs... He is just mad that he sucks at the game, he must be a little child who can&apos;t think of any other way to play besides run and gun...he should go back to playing straight shooters or COD... newb... Only complaint i have is the $14.99 price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=1805725">Expand</a></span>

All for a part of the story that appears in the middle of the original campaign, so should have probably been included in the game in the first place.  It&apos;s not even an addition to the story, it&apos;s a part they left out so they could sell it to you later, FOR MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL!  Pass on Eidos, forever.</span>

Objectively speaking, this is what The Missing Link is - It&apos;s a 5 hour segment not included in DX:HR and is almost completely stripped off its RPG elements, leaving behind just a shooter gameplay. The reason I say it was stripped off the RPG elements is because there isn&apos;t much of multiple customizations and directions as there were in DX:HR. You start from scratch, i.e. without the items you&apos;ve had and with all your augmentations reset. Throughout you get only a few praxis points, most of which are given to you in the second half of the game, causing me to continuously ask &quot;To what end am I getting these praxis points? The game is nearly finished&quot;. And on top of that, there are no new additions. You still have the shooter gameplay, with taking cover, hacking, takedowns, etc, so the game is still relatively entertaining. Players who are into stealthy gameplay would enjoy this more than the trigger-happy tanks since stealth is more encouraged in this DLC than it did in DX:HR. The storyline doesn&apos;t really bring with itself any mindblowing revelations and twists, but it does manage to be moderately interesting, especially having a cameo appearance from one of the characters from the first Deus Ex game. The game gets better and more intense closer to the end, and you are even required to make a very difficult decision, providing you with two slightly different endings. So it might be worth replaying the last half hour of the game again just to see the outcomes of both decisions. So taking all the above points into account, The Missing Link is all right, but it greatly pales compared to the DX:HR, and its original price is way too high. I got it during a Steam sale for &#xC2;&#xA3;3, which is a much more appropriate price for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=2094664">Expand</a></span>

This makes the fact that the DLC is too short even more frustrating. That&apos;s more what I thought of, when I was thinking of a Deus Ex sequel. So, it rate it nine, ten minus one, for its duration.</span>

The Missing Link doesn&apos;t have any new abilities or items however, and to be honest it&apos;s pretty short.  I completed it in 4 hours, but depending on how you clear certain areas gameplay may be lengthened (you backtrack a bit, so if guards are knocked out/dead you can just run through).  Again, I enjoyed it, but I&apos;d recommend waiting until the price drops or goes on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158098">Expand</a></span>

Also, you actually get to choose how to kill the boss, unlike in the main game. My main (probably my only) complaint with HR was that you had to blast the heck out of every single boss. There was no room for creativity or strategy, or for all those praxis you spent on stealth and silence. This DLC is fantastic -- especially if you&apos;re looking for a shorter RPG, still with a bunch of secrets and extras to make you want to do it again and again. In addition, it was longer than I expected for a DLC. Perhaps a tad overpriced, but I bought it on sale and it was worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution---the-missing-link/user-reviews?user_review_id=2160801">Expand</a></span>

It also has a bit of a &quot;to be continued...&quot; ending because of the new characters they introduced, despite taking place during the main game&apos;s plot. With around 4-6 hours of gameplay (depending on your approach), this is worth picking up if you are a fan of the original and can get it on sale.</span>

Much more basic story line of course, but still a challenge requiring great stealth and strategy. For the price you can&apos;t go wrong just to get a little more of this intriguing character.</span>

                                        <span>It was good.  I think Meta Critic has the reviews right and this is about a 7.  The mission and location was not as exciting as the original Deus.  ie. In the original you got to interact with a lot of characters and do a bunch of side quests and discover new weapons etc.   This add-on doesn&apos;t really have new weapons or anything.   It&apos;s OK.</span>
