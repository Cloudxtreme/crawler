Even the options for the game are humorous like a &quot;color blind&quot; option which you don&apos;t need for the game being black and white.
<br>With a game that has had a immense amount of care put into it i would suggest this game to anyone. A $10 price tag feels like a steal (in my opinion for this game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/west-of-loathing/user-reviews?user_review_id=7462672">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re not a Kingdom of Loathing (KoL) player (of which, this game is a spin-off), I absolutely still think this game is worth checking out. If anything, this game is MUCH more accessible than KoL, and, frankly, seems like it would be a better introduction to the Loathingverse than the original game.
<br>
<br>If you are a KoL player, then I recommend this game even more. The writing captures the same fun tone as the original game, the combat has been greatly streamlined, and the side-quest structure evokes the same feeling as playing KoL except that it doesn&apos;t seem nearly as repetitive, as many of the side-quests move quite quickly.

What I can tell you is that this made my face hurt. Why? I was laughing out loud so much my cheeks were sore the next day. What I can tell you is that my wife banned me from playing the game after she went to bed, because the roaring laughter at a new spittoon gag or crazy dialog about a cow would wake her. And what I can tell you is that I had hours and hours of fun (about 50 so far) solving all the puzzles and crazy, quirky side quests.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t 100% a lot of games but you can bet the farm I&apos;m going to get every cheevo on this one. Every piece of writing is the highly polished, subtle, droll humor you expect if you have played Kingdom of Loathing. Chock full of references not just to American pop culture and nerd-friendly media, but also deep cuts in literature and tons of gaming tropes. Everything from undergraduate D&amp;D games to Skeleton fort is represented in hilarious fashion.
<br>
<br>Polygon says that it&apos;s &quot;a genuinely deep and hilarious game&quot; and I can&apos;t overstate my agreement. It&apos;s a huge game, bigger than you think before you buy it, bigger than you think when you start playing it, and bigger than you think when you finish your first playthrough. Don&apos;t be deceived by the low price point, this is hours and hours of face-hurting levels of belly laughs and incredible fun. The systems are fun, the puzzles have a great range of difficulty, and combat is satisfying and offers a diverse selection of available approaches.
<br>
<br>If you like Kingdom of Loathing, if you like things that are funny, if you like nerdy or pop culture references, or if you just like silly walks or horrifically disgusting descriptions of spittoons, you&apos;ll love the game. If you only like games that are in all purple colors and Japanese, you probably will not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/west-of-loathing/user-reviews?user_review_id=7463900">Expand</a></span>

Text changes but combat is very unimaginative and there is little to nothing you can do to change outcome. Perks are nice and hilarious as are the stat description but they wear out very soon and the game becomes a slugfest. Also, dialogue while funny at most occasions is extremely drawn out and you will be forced to skip parts of it unless you want to read similar jokes over and over again. All in all, a fine nostalgia game which utterly lacks depth in combat mechanics (the real game part) with little to no practical options to change outcome. 6/10 for lacking depth and proper combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/west-of-loathing/user-reviews?user_review_id=7484280">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a tale of the supernatural invading a Western setting and the darker side of this concept pokes through - making you jump suitably at shadows.

<br>
<br>Intentionally or not, it reminds me of the old Deadlands RPG.  I must stop showing my age on these things.
<br>
<br>The game zips along in a fun manner - with regular rewards and punishments for tampering with the point and click environment.
<br>
<br>Combat is a fun but limited turn based affair with your pardner and conjured assistants.  Your stats limit use of the crazy items and special attacks you unlock on the way.
<br>
<br>Put together with the regular blasts of humour, it is reminscent of Stick of Truth in it&apos;s feel.
<br>
<br>I loved it and with three character classes and random side quests the replay value is high.
<br>
<br>Please note - modern gamers may find the graphics and no gamepad an automatic turn off but if a funny, creepy, cow fearing, clown punching, spitoon wrangling roleplaying game appeals try it regardless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/west-of-loathing/user-reviews?user_review_id=7469811">Expand</a></span>
