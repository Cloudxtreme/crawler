Anniversary captures that atmosphere very well with its beautiful graphics, detailed level design and excellent sound-track. The characters&apos; facial expressions during the cut-scenes are also worth mentioning as they are brilliantly done. Sadly, the combat system is very poor. It&apos;s hard to learn and particularly frustrating at the best of times. Lara has a bad habit of auto-targeting the wrong enemies at the wrong time (and sometimes she targets shootable buttons on the walls in favour of the vicious beasts that are busy tearing her up). Thankfully, this game is sparsely populated with enemies and, most of the time, you&apos;ll find yourself enjoying the exploration and puzzle-solving aspect of the game, which made the original such a winner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=705090">Expand</a></span>

Even in 2011, the graphics hold up pretty well. The puzzles are usually at a pretty good difficulty. The game really does a good job of making you feel like you&apos;re exploring places that have been untouched for years and set up by masterminds.<br><br>However, there are quite a few problems that mar the fun: the camera can be finicky in some sections; Lara doesn&apos;t always jump in the direction you tell her to go (especially during wall-run sections or when she&apos;s turning around from climbing up a ledge right as you try to jump); it&apos;s possible to get stuck on sections of terrain which require you to mash the jump button like mad or reload from your last save; enemy AI is atrocious (although hearing epic music while a gorilla runs head-first away into a wall in the wrong direction while trying to attack you is good for a laugh); movement glitches (like clipping terrain during dodges) and camera often get in the way during combat. A number of the climbing platforming sections can get tedious. Instead of making you tap E to go faster while climbing, why not just make Lara move that fast by default? Checkpoints are often spaced too far apart and you can&apos;t save at will, so you&apos;ll be redoing tedious sections of platforming just to get back to the point where the camera or awkward controls make a jump difficult and doing the same section over and over again.<br><br>The Prince of Persia series has much more fluid platforming (except for the 2008 Prince of Persia, which felt like auto-pilot) and Uncharted has done a much better job at setting up sense of place and managed to make combat more fun and less of a chore. I haven&apos;t played the later TR games except for Guardian of Light (which is EXCELLENT and I highly recommend) so for now I&apos;m not sure how much progress in those areas have been made. I&apos;ll be playing TR:Legend and Underworld eventually and reviewing them as well.<br><br>In short: I would have given this game an 8/10, but the numerous issues (i.e. dying because of camera problems and controls flaking out and making you repeat sections of the game over at no fault of your own are both incredibly frustrating) and some tedious platforming sections (once I&apos;ve proven that I know how to do it and it&apos;s not difficult nor fun to execute, don&apos;t make me do it 2 or 3 more times) bring it down to a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=1690324">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed going through the levels, finding my way through the numerous platforming puzzles, and I didn&apos;t even feel sad the many times I died because the ragdoll physics in this game are kindof hilarious, where Lara will sometimes bounce off the ground, several feet into the air. I&apos;m not big on physics but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s how it works.<br><br>The game offers very little outside of that though, there&apos;s just jumping, climbing and shooting things on occassion which is enough for me but that, along with sometimes unresponsive controls prevents me from rating it higher. Still, this game is very much worth playing and is a lot of fun, a nice change of pace from the pew pew pew FPS games I usually play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=1715135">Expand</a></span>

After playing the game for several hours it feels more like a chore than a delight. Unresponsive controls, terrible camera angles, worthless auto-aim, and awful boss fights. That pretty much sums it up. You will spend more time in loading screens then actually playing the game because you will fall to your death so often due to poor camera angles or extreme camera zoom. Often the hitting a button will result in an action delay just long enough to make you mistime your jump or grab and you will end up back at the beginning of whatever climbing puzzle you were on. The enemies often move so fast that you cannot get away and once they are on top of you the auto-aim system refuses to target them. Boss fights are overly complicated and generally one mistake will cause you to become trapped against a wall or in a corner where you will be killed. Overall this game is just frustrating. If there were no enemies and falling from a great height didn&apos;t kill you then this would be a wonderful adventure/puzzle solver, but it isn&apos;t. The game tries to do too much without giving the player any room for mistakes. Unless you enjoy frustration, save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2499662">Expand</a></span>

It would be nice to see behind me, but most of the time there&apos;s a conveniently placed ledge there. Also, if you want to do well early on, you better pay close attention to the tutorials that flash by the screen as some commands such as dodging are critical later. Although maybe it&apos;s just that this is my first Tomb Raider game.  Overall, this is a great game. The graphics are still quite nice and the gameplay is fun and challenging. I just wished some of the bugs were fixed. And there isn&apos;t much story here so don&apos;t buy this game just for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2273043">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m sure glad I did not buy it and only wasted some of my monthly bandwidth (about 250MB) to download the demo. Now, I was really looking forward to it after seeing the beautiful graphics and indeed they are, but the new player controls are simply too unintuitive and frustrating, and there is no way to make Lara behave like she did in the classics. I mean, instead of being in the character&apos;s skin (or right behind her) so to speak, you are so remote and disconnected that it is actually impossible to feel the character, much less to know how to make her move. Just like a play of mirrors, you are led to fall when you should climb, go left when you should go right, etc. And you call that &apos;intuitive&apos;? What were the designers thinking? Did they somehow come to the conclusion that it&apos;s more &apos;challenging&apos; to be disconnected rather to be immersed in the game? Ever heard of the &apos;New Coke&apos; fiasco, Mr. fancy pants game designer? Well, that&apos;s what&apos;s waiting for this game you, as you managed to turn a great idea into a disaster. Sorry, but this game doesn&apos;t cut it, and the new graphics are not worth the frustration being demoted from &apos;driving the car&apos; to using a remote, constantly struggling to figure out where left, right, to and bottom is for the character when the actor is in a totally different location. No thanks! I&apos;m glad I can still play my originals on my machine...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=745007">Expand</a></span>

The AI appears to be a little lackluster but the game isn&apos;t about gunning down bad guys, it&apos;s about exploring the intriguing environment around you. So all and all it&apos;s a very enjoyable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=705007">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It started off ok, but as the puzzles and boss fights got harder, they got more tedious, and the controls got more frustrating. After a while the puzzles feel repetitive (but this is largely a question of personal taste). 95% of the game is pure puzzle platforming (so you should only play this if you really like that sort of gameplay). My playthrough broke down to frustrating trial and error at times. I found the keyboard/mouse controls difficult and at times inconsistent and unresponsive - Maybe it plays better on a console. I got stuck on some of the platforming and boss fights, so I had to look up the solutions online. I&apos;m not a noob, but better hints and tutorials would have been helpful for me. It is also a pity there is no manual save system, and that the save checkpoints are not very forgiving - they were often far away from the part I struggled with, meaning I had to redo a lot after failing a sequence. Also, you have to manually &#x201C;save&#x201D; the checkpoint, otherwise, if you quit/reload, you lose all progress since the beginning of the game. Dare I say it, but this game may be too &#x201C;hardcore&#x201D; for me (even though I usually don&apos;t like it when games are dumbed down). While the experience was too frustrating for me, this is quite a good game within its specific genre.
<br>
<br>If you like difficult platforming and old-school boss fights, you may like this game. Otherwise, there are simply too many flaws, so I sadly cannot recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=5526105">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you don&apos;t enjoy doing the same thing over and over I would not recommend this game to you.  Otherwise, if you want an Indiana Jones like adventure (with way less action) you might want to give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2797121">Expand</a></span>

It is easily in my top ten games list, rubbing shoulders with Starcraft and Rome: Total War (I&apos;m a hardcore PC fan).
<br>
<br>Why is it so good? Several reasons. Firstly and most importantly the gameplay is top notch, with obvious polish on all gameplay elements. The platforming is smooth and intuitive; graspable handholds have specific identifiable textures, preventing you from leaping to your death, but it&#x2019;s subtle enough to make it blend in. The controls to move Lara are also very good and responsive, making it easy to manoeuvre yourself around a room. Camera look is also a god send, I tried TR2 again after finishing TR:A and the biggest difficulty I found was not having a manually moveable camera, it is essential on some of the more difficult jumping puzzles. The physics rules stay constant throughout the game, meaning you won&#x2019;t scratch your head in puzzlement as to why that jump failed when another one succeeded perfectly. The adrenaline dodge, a skill central to efficient gameplay is challenging to master, but used enough that you will get the practice you need. The enemies you will use it on are sparing and perhaps that&#x2019;s why the combat system isn&#x2019;t quite as fantastic as the platforming system, but it&#x2019;s still damn good.
<br>
<br>Then comes the puzzles, something that Tomb Raider is famous for, and I must say that each puzzle is unique and inventive while also being at exactly the right difficulty to make the solution obvious after a few minutes of observing to those who are patient and keep their wits about them. The solution is there, and in plain site oftentimes, but only those with a bit of patience and will to use their brains to work out how to exploit it will enjoy them. This is especially true of the bosses, who are some of the best bosses I&#x2019;ve ever met in gaming (admittedly, not being a console gamer, that&#x2019;s not many). The game gives you time to work out how to defeat each boss, they are not on top of you all the time, but if you don&#x2019;t get the trick they will slowly whittle you down and finish you off. The adrenaline you get when you use your last health pack and still have a few shots left to finish off this boss makes it scary and tense, but very rewarding when you counterattack for the final time and cut to the death cinematic.
<br>
<br>The game uses quick time events. I think the game uses them quite well, though I know they get a lot of stick in the gaming community. They are used sparingly, and lead to some very entertaining death scenes if you get them wrong (sorry Lara, I might have pressed the wrong button once or twice deliberately).
<br>
<br>The sound track is fantastic, and beautifully complements the game&#x2019;s setting and theme. The main theme is one of my favourite tracks ever, and I listen to it all the time. It makes you feel like a real explorer. I really love it. The graphics too are absolutely beautiful, every landscape looks stunning, even on my piece of s**t PC (a standard Vista laptop). The game also runs really well, so as far as I&#x2019;m concerned, optimisation is excellent.
<br>
<br>The tone of the game is my favourite among all the tomb raider games. The earlier games make Lara feel to me rather bland and uninteresting (apart from her upper torso), and Tomb Raider: Legend and Underworld both turn Lara into a comic book action hero rather than what she really is, a tomb raider. She&#x2019;s a highly trained but otherwise normal human female, so she shouldn&#x2019;t be gunning down legions of bad guys like she does in other instalments of the series. Also there&#x2019;s only half a dozen characters in the whole game, ensuring a sense of deserted quietness and beautiful solitude in your tombs, adding to the overall tomb raiding ambience.
<br>
<br>Overall it&#x2019;s a fantastic game and I highly recommend it to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=4376244">Expand</a></span>

Well in the remake you don&apos;t have any brain-dead chattering in your ear, giving you the feeling you are total isolated. The same feeling you had, when you played Tomb Raider I. Built on the Legend engine many levels have been revived and spiced up. There is a more indepth plot and lara&apos;s mansion is better than ever. Crystal Dynamics have done a very good job of combining the old with the new, creating the same atmosphere we felt when playing the original with new graphics and puzzles in TR:A. I can see many people picking bones with this because it&apos;s &quot;too hard&quot; and &quot;not as easy as legend&quot;, but for me, as an original Tomb Raider fan, it&apos;s brilliant!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=704882">Expand</a></span>

Even in the mid 90&apos;s they successfully created the most stunning action heroine ever...and now for all hardcore Lara fans, we&apos;re getting to see to see the things again...and it runs on the famous Legend engine that is very much system friendly...the action is hard to find...but this is what gave birth to Lara &amp; the puzzles...movements work superbly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=705086">Expand</a></span>

This game definitely builds on the immense success of Legend and solidifies faith back in the Tomb Raider franchise, after some disappoinments (read: Tomb Raider 3 to Angel of Darkness). I love it, and I highly recommend it to everyone!</span>

                                        <span> I tried this out because I really enjoyed the first Tomb Raider a decade ago. This one has a lot of graphic polish and it&apos;s neat to see some of the old levels. However, the gameplay isn&apos;t always smooth with little bugs popping up here and there. The last two levels are horribly irritating and leave the player with a bad last impression.</span>

There are 2 major headaches areas in the game, one of which is just about impossible for normal folk (but luckily can download a savegame to get past it).

The camera can be a bit of a pain but other than that I enjoyed playing the game. And to Glen T. - Tomb Raider 1 is on the PC, just not natively supported for Windows XP onwards.</span>

Combat isn&apos;t spectacular but then that isn&apos;t the focus of tomb raider. Great puzzles, great traversal through ancient places. Wonderful sense of nostalgia that brought me back to the first time I played TR:1. Love it!</span>

One factor of the game that should have been worked on more would be the music. I thought the music was rather dull and boring. Sure, there were instants where the music intensified the cut-scene, but overall, it was just all right. Moving on, one the aspects that boosted my rating was the &quot;Rewards&quot; section, which I thought were very thoughtful, especially the commentaries. Overall a great game and definitely worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=705711">Expand</a></span>

If you ever played the first tomb raider this is worth a look just to see how they improved upon it without dramatically changing any element of the game like you commonly see in other reboots. Graphics are majorly improved, platforming is much easier, combat feels the same. For under $10 on steam its definitely worth a look and perhaps if this game does well square will start rebooting other classics that it now holds the rights to. I would love to see a Deus Ex or Thief reboot</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=3365540">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a faithful re-imagining of the original Tomb Raider from 1996, while deftly tying it into the story of the other two games that take place in the present (it&apos;s still 1996 in this remake).  Anniversary is visually beautifiul and the puzzles are incredibly elaborate and complex.  Lara travels the globe to places like Peru, Greece, and Egypt, while you solve the mysteries of some of the most enormous and intricately designed tombs ever in a Tomb Raider game.
<br>
<br>The story is a rehash of the original, with Lara hired by the mysterious Natla Corporation to find an artifact.  What&apos;s good about it is the way they tied this into the back story about Lara&apos;s mother.
<br>
<br>The only knock I can give is that on the pc there is a well-known bug in one of the Egypt levels that prevents you from making a simple jump to a ledge so you can exit the level.  I had to download a cheat to let me move Lara past that point.  Then there is the infamous &quot;pyramid tower of terror&quot; segment near the end which had me smashing my mouse and keyboard in frustration.  Even watching You Tube videos and knowing exactly what to do, it still took dumb luck on one of the jump sequences to make it after about a hundred tries.  The problem is that they made grapple wall running/jumping to the next handhold very unforgiving, and you are constantly fighting the camera angles and the controls to get Lara to do what you want her to do.  It&apos;s hard enough to get enough momentum, jump from the right height and the exact right moment so you can barely reach the ledge, but then to have Lara jump back instead of to the side, or to the side instead of back, because according to the camera angle that&apos;s what the game thinks you want her to do...that can be maddening.
<br>
<br>Despite late game bugs/control issues, Anniversary is still a great game and very satisfying to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tomb-raider-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=4614533">Expand</a></span>
