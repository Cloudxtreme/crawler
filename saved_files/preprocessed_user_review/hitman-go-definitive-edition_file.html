<br>It&apos;s kind of like nine men&apos;s morris, without the nine men - maybe (If you don&apos;t know what nine men&apos;s morris is, please do look it up....essentially it&apos;s a board game and that probably is all you really need to know on that front).
<br>The music is calming, the graphics are actually pretty good, and it may not be to everyone&apos;s liking but it&apos;ll tide anyone over looking for a little bit of a fix before the 2016 Hitman proper is released (which is pretty soon I think?).
<br>It&apos;s only about six quid on Steam right now, which makes it a fairly cheap game to buy considering it&apos;s not yet another hidden object game or yet another match three game or yet another combination of the two which is even more annoying.
<br>
<br>How about the gameplay though.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s fairly simple. It&apos;s turn based, you take a turn and all the other characters in the scenario you&apos;re playing through take a turn. It&apos;s NOT as easy as you might think it sounds. Some levels are fiendishly tricky to get through, and thankfully you can actually have the game walk you through the level if you&apos;re really stuck (and there&apos;s no time limits on those). There are various objectives to achieve (usually kill all the bad guys, collect the briefcase, and sometimes complete in x number of moves or less - generally), although you only need to technically &apos;pass&apos; the level by completing it - by going to the exit point in a scenario, you will need to complete more of the objectives in order to unlock the next &apos;chapter&apos; of scenarios. Again, if you&apos;ve been stumped on any levels, you can just click on the lightbulb, click on the objective you want to complete, and it&apos;ll literally show you all the moves you need to make (whilst doing so in a monochrome setting, if you make a move it doesn&apos;t indicate throughout the walkthrough, the game goes back to full colour, and you&apos;re on your own again).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s fairly decent, it&apos;s not what you&apos;d expect from the Hitman franchise - but it&apos;s very addictive after a while.
<br>
<br>Recommended if board games are your thing, also recommended if you just want to try something different out without having to look for missing objects or matching tiles.
<br>
<br>Good effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman-go-definitive-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6133577">Expand</a></span>
