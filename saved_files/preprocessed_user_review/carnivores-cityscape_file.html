They&apos;re not wrong to do so.
<br>Cityscape was developed not by the original Carnivores team, but by Sunstorm Interactive, who developed Primal Prey. This is very apparent from the start as the style of the dinosaurs, the gameplay (right down to the &quot;decaying corpse&quot; mechanic), and the sci-fi style weapons are identical to what you&apos;d have expected from a hypothetical &quot;Primal Prey 2&quot;. There&apos;s very little connecting this game to the original Carnivores series, and whenever it tries to bring in the (very short, very simple) lore of those games it somehow manages to always get it wrong.
<br>The biggest deviation, obviously, is that this is an FPS rather than a hunting game. Taking the connection to the original games aside, this still seems like a very bad idea. Cityscape does a poor job of competing with other shooters from its time, both graphically and gameplay-wise, and makes poor use of the Serious Sam engine. The game as a whole feels very lazy, with lots of bugs, nonsensical missions, gaping seams in character models and even a level where they didn&apos;t even bother to animate the water.
<br>The game does offer the unique option to play as a dinosaur, but the concept is so horribly executed that no one in their right mind would ever want to. As a human, the game is playable, but laughably bad and very easy- big guns and thermal goggles ensure that you&apos;ll never be outmatched or caught off guard. As a stand-alone game it&apos;s mediocre, and as a Carnivores game it&apos;s even worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/carnivores-cityscape/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524790">Expand</a></span>
