<br>Steep is kinda radical sports, open world, action and multiplayer game. Quite a lot of stuff at the first glance, but this game is a sky, paraglide, snowboard and wingsuit simulator.
<br>
<br>Not much of a story here. You go there, and you do that. You will climb up the ranking for sure, but there&apos;s not much of a plot here.
<br>
<br>Graphics are incredible. You can literally stare at the landscape. Ubisoft is bad in a lot of stuff, but lately they simply make beautiful games I have to admit.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is very good. They have grasped the mood of each challenge and for a game that, at first glance, is here to pump adrenaline in someone who is sit on a chair, it can be very relaxing at some moments. I spent a lot of time in orientation challenges because they were incredibly peaceful and quiet.
<br>
<br>2 &#x2013; GAMEPLAY
<br>
<br>I started the game and I was right there in the action. First minutes were bad, since I was trying to understand the controls, but after that I admit the game is very noob friendly, and quite challenging for those who simply want to give that extra effort. Controls are very simple and precise. I choose to play the game with a controller, it was much more simple. This game is a PC port from a console game, but I have any issue with that. The trick mechanics is very solid and easy to understand, but the game is not very realistic in some aspects. You can go 100 miles per hour against a stone or a tree and there&apos;s no problem, you simply get up with a pun. And the speed... my god, the speed.
<br>
<br>Staring at the map is impressive, and that gives you the feeling of freedom of choice. OFC you will only go to the new events that you unlock when you progress, you will not explore a massive map on foot, so that is a bit useless, unless you are crazy.
<br>
<br>You have an ingame store, mostly for peacocks, where you can customize your character. I miss some customization options on default, I admit. What I do not like is the fact of the paid season pass includes new and completely different sports, rocket wings. That&apos;s massive cash grab.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure about the replay ability of this game, the game seems like it is his own replay.
<br>
<br>Reviews are all over the place about content, so I&apos;m here to save you. I do not know... for me the game was fresh and cool, I was always excited with new activities, but I admit that the game consists in going through rings and that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>Some sort of multiplayer is there. I&apos;ve found some other players and that&apos;s cool. I&apos;ve invited some to ride with me, one have accepted but the experience is not very different from playing alone.
<br>
<br>3 &#x2013; CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>I do not like this type of games. I&apos;ve notice in UPlay that it was on a free trial during the weekend so I just got it for 2 days. I was very impressed by it. I have tons of fun, and I&apos;ve considered buying it then I check the price. Without any discount 60&#x20AC; + 20&#x20AC; from the season pass. It&apos;s too much. I would wait for a sale on this one, it&apos;s a impressive game with a massive price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=7075063">Expand</a></span>

I really doubted I&apos;d have any interested in the wingman/paragliding, but even they&apos;ve blown me away.
<br>
<br>This game is truly amazing even from the complete beginners perspective. I can have just as much fun just riding down a steep mountain or casually paragliding and exploring as I can tackling the challenges to learn how to ride better.
<br>
<br>Technically there&apos;s a lot to like also. It&apos;s the first game I&apos;ve played that uses the &quot;hold button down&quot; control scheme well. Long gone are the rote actions of start, up, up, X (or whatever combinations common of these kind of sport games) to retry a run, you simply hold one button for about half a second and you&apos;re straight back to the top ready for another go. Same goes for switching to the overview map for changing location, it just works really well, very fluid.
<br>
<br>The character customisation is incredible. I was half expecting it to be real money unlocks as a questionable monetisation method, but it&apos;s incredibly fair. Nothing I&apos;ve unlocked has been very hard to do, all the gear and funds comes thick and fast just from playing the game and completing various challenges or exploring.
<br>
<br>Finally is the ambience, it&apos;s an incredibly beautiful game, but besides that it&apos;s the little details that really make it stand out. Fall off a slope instead of purposefully jumping and your character starts shouting with true dread in their voice for the outcome. The backing music is also incredibly good, not always being a random collection, some are specifically themed for the challenge being attempted (Flight of the Valkyries being the most memorable without doubt.) And at any time (besides challenges) you can adjust the visual ambience through both time of day/year and specific sun position.
<br>
<br>It runs fine on my dating i5-2500 and gtx750 graphics card which is a feat in itself given the incredible fidelity.
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s an absolutely great game I&apos;m more than happy to invest further in, I think developer support will be crucial for it&apos;s long-term viability as an all time great, but it&apos;s well on it&apos;s way for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6919212">Expand</a></span>

I came in expecting just a fraction of what is here. Reviews are insane these days. I&apos;m not really sure what people even expect in games. Apparently, being able to do 4+ sports on a gigantic mountain range where you can wingsuit your way from a hot air balloon and then ski or snowboard down an entire mountain ending up in a village by a frozen lake is not enough anymore.
<br>
<br>You also have the ability to dictate time of day and ambiance whenever you like. There is always something to guide you properly to where you need to be, and all challenges are easily accessible both on the mountain map and through menus.
<br>
<br>No other game allows this type of freedom in this genre. Hell, this genre is almost gone. It&apos;s sad that people do not want to support games like this anymore.
<br>
<br>All the while people are online with you, and you can buddy up with other players. Right now I think it&apos;s great that you can just ski down the mountain with a random person you just met. I don&apos;t get how this game is scoring below an 8 at all. And many do actually agree. At least the people playing the game seem to be enjoying it a lot. There is a decent customer base here too. I hope when the game drops in price more will pick it up.
<br>
<br>With a 1070 I am getting 1440p and solid 60FPS. I inject SMAA and the image quality is very good. The developers put in an Ultra+ setting for PC players that fixed all the LOD issues. And this was after I specifically asked for this on their forums. The devs always seem to be listening to customer feedback here.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get to the show: there is a lot to do in this game. A lot of scores to break. I think more or less people should expect this to be like a Driveclub game. It&apos;s all about getting better and better with runs. Yet there is a competent story mode and plenty of customization when it comes to characters.
<br>
<br>Once you start exploring around and getting a few golds the controls become second nature to me. After the last patch it plays like a dream mostly. Wingsuiting has never been done better. Snowboarding and skiing are entirely competent and at times an amazing experience. Especially for the ten minute runs that have you going over so much terrain. Paragliding is what you want it to be. I never though it was the greatest thing but I did sure think it was nice to have around now and then.
<br>
<br>Alaska DLC is coming as a free patch for everyone. Nevermind the fact that most games in the past like SSX3 had one mountain not even as big as the main range here. Yes, I too love SSX. But this is a slightly more realistic version of SSX with not as much flash and a lot more realism. Carving and shredding snow has never felt this good in years.
<br>
<br>Honestly, so far this is a ten for me. The game is everything I needed it to be, and more patches, optimization, and fixes will come in the future. For now the game is online only for those that care, but an offline mode will surely be patched in later. Controls are being tweaked with every patch, so in reality I find most reviews complaining about controls are already irrelevant. And that is something you really can&apos;t fix in gaming today: reviews never seem to actually respect the game past day one. And that is a huge problem. Steep is a grand experience that will only get better with time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6909254">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics look fantastic, and the environments, riders, and snow texture, are all very convincing. The animation is also very smooth and forgiving of collisions (leans arcade without being too silly).
<br>
<br>The control scheme takes a little getting used to, but after a couple hours all of the sports become fairly easy to control  and allow you to move around the map quite fluidly.
<br>
<br>As much as I enjoy leveling myself up, I&apos;m almost having more fun aimlessly cruising around the mountains taking jumps and carving powder. The movement can be deeply satisfying when you get it right, although somewhat frustrating when you get it wrong.
<br>
<br>The open world concept works wonderfully well in Steep, and I feel like Ubisoft have created plenty of compelling reasons for the game to be online only, which have been lacking from some of their previous efforts. Initially, I was dubious about them waiting to send out review copies until the title was launched, but now I see that perhaps it was a good decision. The online and social features are critical to the game, and fortunately, all work well and are reasonably intuitive.
<br>
<br>I enjoy being in the world of Steep and hope it continues to be developed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6855018">Expand</a></span>

Those looking for the next SSX, arcade-style game will be disappointed.

<br>The Mountains are Massive! A Seemingly endless wonderland.
<br>Im a Snowboard Instructor at my local playground in RL. Steep brings the feel of snowboarding to my PC perfectly. The mountains are majestic the snow is magnificent. The selection of gear, the great costumes and helmets, among many other customization options. Steep comes to life in so many ways. I dont know much about anything other than snowboarding but I love doing it all in game.
<br>
<br>The Tricks in Steep are WAY better than Iv read about from other people, so much more realistic than other games like it. I couldnt do half the tricks you can do in Steep in RL. If you wanna know what kinda stuff you can do in game, check out the Snowboard Tricks Wiki online.
<br>
<br>Steep has a lack of board brands but Im sure we could see more in the future. Right now they have Jones, Salomon, Nidecker, K2, and &quot;Steep&quot; snowboards. Id like to see them add Never Summer, Arbor, and Lib Tech just to name a few. I love snowboarding, as my job and for fun, Steep really brings me to the mountains at the comfort of my PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873611">Expand</a></span>

<br>Difficulty is good, customization is a nice adding, graphics are nice and the gameplay feels so smooth.
<br>There are some issues like the lack of grindbars or the first person view, which is very difficult to get use to and is not practical in terms of getting the gold medal in all challenges. The night day cycle is determined for every mountain so each one has their own time (night, day, noon,etc).
<br>
<br>Controls are easy to use, maybe it takes a bit more to master them, but overall are quite accurate to do the tricks and stuff. It&apos;s so much better when you play it with friends, follow your own trail and discover the alps at it&apos;s core.
<br>
<br>My experience with Steep has been great so far and I&apos;m looking forward to meet more mates on the slopes, definetely worth playing</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6885744">Expand</a></span>

The map is massive and it&apos;s only going to get bigger with the FREE Alaska map dlc. Tons of customization from wacky costumes to serious snow gear. The controls take a little bit to get used to but once you get it, there&apos;s only room for improvement. The skill cap is ridiculously high. You can Spawn at the top of a mountain, make a line and then share that line with your friends as a challenge, race, best jump, etc. It has its glitches but no game breaking ones I&apos;ve seen yet. Did I forget to mention the game is BEAUTIFUL? Everytime you do anything in this game it&apos;s screenshot worthy because of the beautiful Vistas. As someone who put 30 hours into the beta and 25 so far since release I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6856924">Expand</a></span>

There are so many hidden spots to pull a sick line or jump that are not part of any challenge, It is a huge part of the game that a lot of reviews seem to be missing.  I still have like 50 challenges to find/ do in the game as well. Plus they will be giving a free map of Alaska that is going to be about the same size.
<br>
<br>I thought the trick system was really well done. Easy to pick up, but hard to master. They game does focus more on more realistic tricks, but that doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t some nonsense spots and tricks. Ski and snowboard do handle a little different. I enjoyed playing with both.
<br>
<br>Then we have what I consider bonuses is the wing suit and para-glider. Wing suit was fun right off the bat. lots of fun places to do runs. Now the para-glider, I hated it at first, but now its one of my favorite things to do, had an hour and half run last night just exploring the map.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6858316">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s kinda boring, the controls (board movement) is weird and sometimes the character won&apos;t jump or turn. Not worth full price, not even half. 20&#x20AC; worth at it&apos;s best.</span>

<br>
<br>What we have here is a game that does about as many things wrong as it does right. For example the environments look great and the character animations look really smooth and respond appropriately, the snowboarding and skiing is well represented and easily the reason to get this game, even the wingsuit and paragliding is well done, and as you explore the game you can really get a sense that the developers just wanted you to be able to go out and explore sort of like you would in Skate and just find ideal lines to repeat or new spots.
<br>
<br>Now I have played this game a lot, pretty much unlocked most of what there is to unlock, seen what there is to be seen, and progressed through the challenges. It&apos;s satisfying for that winter games itch if you are like me and also a big fan of snowboarding games. Thing is it isn&apos;t perfect... far from in fact.
<br>
<br>To start lets talk about the snowboarding/skiing, pretty much the entire reason to buy this game. Best way to describe it is somewhere between 1080 for the N64 and Skate for the PS3/360. You sort of have that sim/arcade kind of balance that those games had and a lot of the gameplay seems to be inspired by both games. For example it has that same damage mechanic that 1080 had for landing big jumps and going over rough terrain, but here it&apos;s a bit different. What they have done here is give you what they call a &quot;G meter.&quot; Now this g meter sort of acts like the COD recovery mechanic, where when you take damage you will hear your character react and the screen will start to go black and white until your character finally gives up or recovers after a few seconds of not taking any damage.
<br>
<br>Sounds like a good idea right? Well I would have to agree... if it worked right. Problem is it is inconsistent, and inconsistency is a subject that generally rules my disappointment with this game. For example sometimes it will react appropriately, sometimes it seems like it doesn&apos;t react at all, and other times it seems hyper sensitive and goes off seemingly at random putting you on the verge of death when you feel like that shouldn&apos;t have happened. Now this is a problem that brings down my score in the end as it leads to a lot of frustration due to the ragdoll effects that happen when you exceed the g meter. When this happens you will literally just watch your character flip, flop, and flail around helplessly and without any attempts to regain composure as if they have gone completely unconscious. This would make sense if the character truly did go unconscious, but the problem is that apparently they don&apos;t. The game has an entirely different reaction for when you go unconscious, which is when you endure too much punishment for your character to get back up.
<br>
<br>This is pretty bad as you will often watch your character flop around helplessly for what can seem like over half a minute at times. It can be pretty funny or entertaining if you aren&apos;t trying to do something, but when you are trying to race or need to go somewhere and your character just keeps flopping around it works like an instant death maneuver. For me this has led to a lot of frustration due to the issues with the g meter mentioned earlier, but this isn&apos;t the end of what is wrong with the snowboarding skiing, as I still need to get into the controls.
<br>
<br>Now the controls are a real mixed bag. The scheme seems simple enough and at the best of times it is, but the problem is that feels terribly inconsistent at times to the point to where you can sometimes feel like you are merely suggesting what you want your character to do as opposed to controlling them directly. For example, take the freestyle trick controls. You use the right trigger to jump, the left analog to spin and flip, but you can only perform your spin and flip actions on the controller after you have jumped, so in other words there is no &quot;pre-load&quot; like you have in games like SSX. This can be fine, but it doesn&apos;t always seem to respond correctly. Sometimes you will perform the maneuver you desires, and other times you will watch your character just do nothing at all. That is right, for some reason, if the game decides you didn&apos;t move your analog stick in the spin or flip direction you wanted you will just watch your character stubbornly refuse to do anything. This also works for the jumping, which seems like it has a delay. So not only do you need to jump before you think you would, but the game doesn&apos;t even seem to allow you to jump at times as it will cancel out or not even register for some weird reason.
<br>
<br>Anyways I think that is enough about the snowboarding and skiing. Oh, there is also some wingsuit and paragliding stuff in this game. It&apos;s alright, but I wouldn&apos;t get the game for it. Serves best as a means for exploration.
<br>
<br>I give this game a C+, could be much better as it is</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6856496">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pro&apos;s
<br>-Beautiful open world with an enormous back country of snow, &quot;jumps&quot; (if you can figure it out) and clear blue sky
<br>-Exploration from the ground and the air. The pure joy of exploring the map is a game in it self
<br>-The weather system - There is so much diversity in day and night, visibility and the feeling of being on the mountain.
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>-Horrible handling. The first thing that struck me was the controls. It&apos;s near almost impossible to start or land a trick. I all of the beta&apos;s the feedback forum was exploding with comment&apos;s about the controls. But non of these changes made it into the final game.
<br>-UI. The interface takes up way too much of the screen and the event icons are way too big.
<br>-Lack of customization of your character. There are very few options to tweak you character and make it more personal
<br>-The soundtrack. Even though the music is mostly fine it becomes almost painful after a couple of days of gameplay. And if you have a favorite challenge it will always start with the same song... The result is that you turn of the music entirely.
<br>
<br>For what could have been a great game I end up with a very low score 3/10
<br>The fine people at Ubisoft needs to stop making big open worlds without quality gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6863784">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>No stat system and no obnoxiously Ubisoft features in the open world. Yes, there&apos;s &quot;radio towers&quot; but drop zones in a snowboarding game are entirely logical so I don&apos;t count that against it.
<br>
<br>The biggest issue with the game is simply lack of content. Map is a decent size and there&apos;s a second one coming of equivalent size to double the content as free DLC at some point after launch. Until that point, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it at full price unless you&apos;re a very big fan of the genre.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy snowboarding games, get this. God knows we aren&apos;t getting any others for years, and this is the best of the lot since SSX 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6857854">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People say its worth it because of the graphics but we all saw how graphics do not decide how good a game is with examples like Ryse: Son of Rome and Battlefront. True, Ubisoft has the graphics thing down but why they would want to destroy a sports fan base they have not even built yet by loading a game with micro transactions is beyond me.

<br>For example a new costume that only you would be seeing is priced at &#xA3;7 GBP. Who is going to buy that stuff? Bad enough to charge &#xA3;59.99 for the game but you have to bleed your customer base even more with this?
<br>
<br>That&apos;s why this game gets a 4. Good for an hour or so but chances are you will never touch it again after that and to me that just isn&apos;t worth nearly 60 quid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873452">Expand</a></span>

Yes, this game is about testing, about overcoming, about the sill. Under plain wrapper hides a hardcore game, so don&apos;t be deceived - it is easy to knock the gold here we need to break a few controllers. And, trust me, you want a gold medal. Why? Perfectionism. The music here is good. But the game would not have been as engrossing if not for the graphics. Oh yeah! Graphics are wonderful! especially the snow and it&apos;s physics.
<br>In life I&apos;m afraid to ride with such big mountains, but I would like! This game is a pleasant hiking adventure for fans of extreme sports. I can&apos;t call Steep for the big game. It&apos;s just a nice game that should cost most cheaply, as quickly bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=7073790">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game does look quite nice, the animations are fluid and life-like. The environment is large and detailed, but could be better.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is fun for a few hours, but gets old fast, your mileage may vary.
<br>
<br>The controls can be rather clunky, mainly when you are at a stand still and want to ski / board in a certain direction and the character spins in circles, or when you want to jump off a ledge to wingsuit and the character jumps in the wrong direction.
<br>
<br>The UI is not great, the map view is hard to control and the pause menu is not intuitive.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is quite weak. In all honesty this is a single player game, you race against other player&apos;s ghosts in challenges, so you should be able to play offline by yourself or with bots even, but you can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>What really hurts the experience is server connection issues preventing you from loading and playing the game. I&apos;ll be kind and assume that since I played during a free weekend the servers could not handle the stress. Late at night I didn&apos;t have any issues, but mid-day I could not connect once.
<br>
<br>Ubisoft should not have made this game online only and the game could benefit from a more structured campagin. I value this product at $20, $60 is a far stretch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steep/user-reviews?user_review_id=7071456">Expand</a></span>
