From the accuracy of the player stats to the thrill of leading your team to glory, this game will have you hooked. SI have done a great job on fixing the bugs with each and every update. The 3D match engine takes a while to get used to, but when you do it&apos;s in a league of it&apos;s own. And if you don&apos;t like the 3D, you can always swith it back to normal 2D mode. Obviously it would seem that alot of people reviewed this and gave it small scores by only playing the demo version. Well, play it again and update to the current patch. Well worth the money. As a fan of all managerial games i salute SI. Well done on producing on such a great game and by setting a landmark for other games to follow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worldwide-soccer-manager-2009/user-reviews?user_review_id=729901">Expand</a></span>

I always hope that Sports Interactive or Eidos will come close to, or surpass Championship Manager 01/02. CM 01/02&apos;s tactical grid, for positioning of players with, and without the ball, gives you a lot more precision in where you want your players to be. The individual instructions are much more precise about the players role on CM 01/02. On Football Manager 2009, all you can do is make the team less or more wider in the system they are playing. I know exactly how I want my team to play, I spend hours and hours perfecting my tactics on the grid on CM 01/02. On this game I spent 90 minutes at a time, changing everything possible, to try to get the team to play as i wanted them, but was unsucessful. The purist football managment sim gamers are still playing Championship Manager 01/02.

I do attend for the big games, and surely there wouldn&apos;t be a press conference for each game? Nonetheless, the game is truly amazing. The coach reports, the scouting, the players attitude, the training, the &quot;being able to ask a player to work on specific things&quot;. Is all fantanastic. It just adds to the game. I asked striker to try hang between defenders to wait for a ball and then run, and soon enough he is doing it. It&apos;s so nice to play and it&apos;s fantastic to see the game unfold in 3D. I was going to give this a mark of 8/10 simply because the 3D match engine isn&apos;t perfect... yet. And simply because of the annoying press and constant pregame press conferences. But I ended up giving it a 9/10 simply because there are more new features and there are more good new features than bad ones. I can only hope that the bad new ideas can be ironed out with patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worldwide-soccer-manager-2009/user-reviews?user_review_id=727345">Expand</a></span>
