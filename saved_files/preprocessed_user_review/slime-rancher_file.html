<br>
<br>&gt; Simple gameplay
<br>&gt;Clean audio
<br>&gt;Beautiful and charming graphics
<br>&gt;Periodic Updates
<br>&gt;Offline (you can play during a trip, for example)
<br>
<br>&gt;Can be repetitive after some time playing
<br>
<br>Final score: 9.7</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slime-rancher/user-reviews?user_review_id=7526012">Expand</a></span>

The art style is charming yet clean and the surprisingly low poly count allows for great performance. The games audio is similarly clean and matches the games style. Later mechanics in the game such as slime costumes really give you a sense of progression and help push you to spend just one more hour. The game isn&apos;t for everyone, if you dislike action repetition like mining in minecraft this game can be a real turn off. For me this game is a delight to play, and will likely remain as one of those games i consistantly come back to.
