I give a 10 to compensate for people who judge before a game is even out. For the HD part: they managed to up the resolution to max and also retexture a 14 year old engine, which is pretty impressive in my opinion. Regarding the framedrops: when we got the privilege to play the game before it is officially out doesn&apos;t mean they will have every bug fixed, otherwise they could just release it for everyone at that time. As soon as they heard about this problem the devs posted on multiple multimedia sites and their own site that they are working on the problem right now. The game has been out for a few minutes now while people know that the devs are doing their best to work on the issues, so please show some patience. The real addition of this however is the online. The servers for the original AOE II were pulled long ago, and now we have new servers to play this still awesome game online with friends. Oh, and did I mention steam workshop? This means that we will see a lot more mods to keep te game alive even longer. All in all, a great idea worked out great, with some bugs at the start. It&apos;s also a nice way to show that for some games it doesn&apos;t matter how old they are, it&apos;s all about the gameplay, just like how you don&apos;t care about graphics when playing a cardgame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3097484">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t in good faith give this game the 7+ rating I sincerely want to give it.
<br>
<br>What really irks me is that it&apos;s been completely stripped of LAN. AoE2 was /THE/ game to lan party it up. Anyone that played it when it was still fresh knows what I&apos;m talking about. This reeks of sacrificing the game to hit piracy. Something pretty much everyone condemns EA and their ilk for. It&apos;s not even successful, the game is still piratable and pirates can still play with eachother.
<br>
<br>I really hope the developers at Hidden Path have more in store for us than what&apos;s been presented so far. Perhaps the Steam Workshop will kick the game into overdrive? It&apos;s always been an amazing game and still is an amazing game, it&apos;s just disappointing how they had so many opportunities to fix some of the problems with AoE2 but didn&apos;t capitalize on any of them, and instead just implemented the exact same changes already done in Forgotten Empires(Unit cap increase, higher resolution support, etc etc)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123249">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First, I am disappointed on the (stated several times) textures provided to constitute as HD most of the textures such as the farms and fire do look better but they werent really needed.
<br>
<br>Second the price point for a game that is 10 years+ old is beyond disturbing, I would have probably turned a blind eye if it was 10 maybe 15 dollars but at 20 I feel that steam along with Microsoft is just capitalizing on an old product that was arguably one of their better in the Age series along with the hype brought on by the release of the fan &quot;expansion&quot; forgotten empires that brought about many changes to the game along with interest in the series.
<br>
<br>Leading to my third point the fact that Forgotten empires will most likely never come to port on steam. The expansion brought about alot of bug fixes adding of new races and units and even included some updated textures for buildings, etc. I do realize that something that was added material to the original shouldnt affect my scoring for the HD port to steam but sadly it does weigh in to my experiences with current online play.
<br>
<br>Thankfully the things I felt that steam did well into having this game added to their list is the ability for players to play online without the help of things such as Game Rangers ever since the &quot;Zone&quot; went extinct. I also like to believe that having more people buy into the franchise will eventually allow a new release that will mimic that same staying power as AoE and AoE2 etc.
<br>
<br>tl;dr
<br>If you want to re experience this old gem with online play added back in the mix and historical campaigns go for it..
<br>If you are hoping this release was going to breathe life into an old series well, at least its not teaming with Brazilians and Italians!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3313280">Expand</a></span>

It has been sold in Walmart stores until recently and there is a good reason. It&apos;&apos;s a classic! Anyone who likes strategy and matching their wits against a computer or multiple computer players should give this game a shot. The updated HD version is just that... High Definition. It is nothing less than what it claims to be. So for those who have given poor reviews to the game, I would look at the original intent that was behind releasing Age of Empires ii HD. I personally was delighted to see that there was a new version that was more compatible with current operating systems and was capable of running at a much higher resolution than the original. As a Huge added bonus Steam servers allow online game play for your multi-player games which is nice since the original games no longer had online servers for multiplayer games.
<br>Despite what some may say about no updates to the game besides better graphics, I would say look again. While staying true to the original game play for the most part, the creators of this HD version have made a few  great enhancements to the game such as being able to put farms in queue so you don&apos;t have to keep replanting your farms every five minutes. There are other slight modifications similar to that. For those who wanted to revisit a classic game this is for you. For those who want more updates I think you&apos;re really wanting a completely different game and you should probably look elsewhere.  Just another example of how awesome this game is... My wife and my sister who are not into video games at all were finally persuaded to give this game a try and after playing a couple of times they have both fallen in love with it and I have even come home from work or school to find out that my wife was playing it while the kids napped. This game has the power to convert people to it. Give it a shot!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5359059">Expand</a></span>

<br>As another user on Steam said:

<br>
<br>Even people that loves this version of the game and is playing it happily had huge problems to make it run. For example, one of them told me on one of my posts at Steam about how he downloaded the game like 5 times over 6 hours while he was troubleshooting it.
<br>
<br>To be able to change the resolution you have to change the resolution of the computer. And if you have some problem in your eyes, forget it! the Texture/image of the units is so bad that that or you have your computer on 800x600 or you will get a headache. Is that really an improvement to put the game up to date with newer systems?
<br>
<br>The &quot;start&quot; screen where you can select what to do (play, change options, etc) looks worse than the &quot;start&quot; screen of the original game. That such a basic thing hasn&apos;t improve tells you what the general state of the game is.
<br>I actually sent an email to the developers and so far the only thing I got is an email of them telling me they were told to resend all feedback to Microsoft.
<br>
<br>The only thing they put up to date with this game was their pockets. This is a franchise that has a huge fan base, they realized that if they tried to revive the game lots of people would buy it out of nostalgia and in hopes of having a gaming better experience than with the original one. And they have used the community as beta testers.
<br>It is an insult to the consumers and other Studios that make a point of releasing quality games but don&apos;t have such big fan base to profit from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3218637">Expand</a></span>

It is very well made, and I am glad that they didn&apos;t change much. It was good as it is. And now they are even giving out the &quot;Forgotten Empires&quot; expansion pack.

I can&apos;t really add to what some of the other positive reviews are saying: It&apos;s classic, endless playability, yet quickly becomes familiar and easy to improve your performance. It&apos;s an incredibly satisfying game to play, and the option of allying with other players and combining your empires, armies and tactics is so fun. The random maps are all unique and cool to explore and use geography to your advantage. The economy  military balance is extremely intriguing as well.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played the original, it is not any different except some of the graphics are smoother, the max pop cap is at 500, and there is support for online multiplayer and a thriving community both in-game and in steam workshop.
<br>
<br>Cons: There is an annoying unit selection limit, (like 30 units?) and the continuity when playing multiplayer online is dependent on everyone having a fast connection. If even one player has a slow connection or slow computer, the game will lag very badly, especially when many units are on the map. Even with adequate connection speeds, I wouldn&apos;t recommend setting the pop cap much over 300 in a 6 to 8 player game.
<br>
<br>Redeeming fact: They are working on patches and continuing support for the game. Playability and technical issues have been improved and will hopefully continue to improve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3844724">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I can understand the metacritic rating at the terrible half-assed release, but the team has fixed all those errors at this point. AoE2 has truly aged like fine wine. And with beautiful 2D graphics, a top tier soundtrack, a wonderful comfy feel, and infinite replayability: Even the HD version can&apos;t ruin the king&apos;s spot at the top of all games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4041419">Expand</a></span>

<br>AoE2 is what RTS should be and is. New RTS games are so simplistic with no real micro/macro skills required. I am ecstatic that they put this on steam to allow easy multiplayer games a reality once again.

I think this AoE II HD Edition is a great rework of that great game. Why did you (people) judged the game before it was out? I had no problems with it, I loved it. Steam Workshop, better Multiplayer (The ranking system could be better, they are working on it!), remastered textures, more beautiful water (I liked that, my favourite improvement :D), resolution support to very high (I&apos;ve seen someone who played it on 5 monitors), Steam Achievements. Others said it&apos;s full of bugs. But it isn&apos;t!!! I bought the game yesterday, no bugs or any problems at all so far (I played Singleplayer and Multiplayer, not for a single time). I think the 68 Metascore is too severe. It&apos;s much better than that. And the most important thing: THEY ARE WORKING ON IT! It&apos;s version 2.3, 2.4 is on the way, it will come out in 2-3 days. I recommend this game to anyone who played AoE 10-15 years ago!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3202184">Expand</a></span>

<br>A Franchise Refurbished, Yet a Missed Opportunity.
<br>
<br>The age of empires series is one of fame. After 13 years it can still be purchased (along with its expansion, The Conquerors) at Wal-Mart and Office Depot. This &quot;new&quot; title is an attempt at sprucing up one of the most beloved games of the franchise. It is amazingly rare to see an old property being brought back to life and updated, especially by a parent company that is only looking forward to the next big buck, and are willing to drop any title not making 500% profit (AOE Online was scrapped after a year in the wild, and much needed updates to many games still hang in limbo at EA). Only the bigwigs know what made them bring this one back, but we are glad to see some dust wiped off of our past every once in a while. Developer &quot;Hidden Path&quot; was contracted to shine up the series fav and bring it into the new age of gaming, they fixed important things and they didn&apos;t fiddle around where it wasn&apos;t needed, but they missed a couple of points that would have made it into a new age RTS diamond.
<br>
<br>First of all, I must thank hidden path for finally raising the unit cap, but why only 500? While it is a good 2.5x higher than before, our machines are 250x more powerful than the Pentium II 200mhz it was originally designed for. I can only guess that much of the core engine remains as it was, and 500 was the highest they could go without breaking it. Even though the cap has been raised, you can still only select 20 units at a time. Was it something that was overlooked? not likely. Here is another notch in the theory of a stretched engine. They just couldn&apos;t do more without overhauling the back end.
<br>
<br>While we are on the graphics, The reason it has HD in the title is the ability to hit 1920x1080, (and beyond for multi monitor rigs) whereas the original topped out at 1024x768. I agree with the general consensus in that the overhauled building and unit models are amazing, but once again the elderly engine comes through showing us no shadows, no zoom, and no visual effect updates. These are an almost standard feature of today&apos;s even bargain bin games that they missed completely. Does it detract from gameplay? Not really. Could they have spent a little more time bringing the graphics engine into this decade without effecting gameplay? yes.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer. What can I say here? Game Zone worked (kinda) back in the day, but thankfully we have learned from those early days and have integrated the game wholly into Steam&apos;s online network with only a few launch bugs and some early lag issues (to be continued). What this means is a front row ticket to a beautifully seamless multiplayer before-game matching experience, but completely removes the LAN option that, like me, so many young geeks had permanently set up in their basements just for this.  Inclusion with the Workshop will make mod and map finding a breeze, and I believe the good outweighs the bad here, but somehow there is still a bad taste somewhere in my mind from losing our offline multiplayer. (single play is still allowed offline).
<br>
<br>The music score has been redone, but I can still pound the number keys for WOLOLOOO and &quot;I Need Wood&quot;. No complaints there.
<br>
<br>All-in-all it was well worth the $12 preorder, and it is the authentic Age Of Kings/Conquerors experience, but the lack of improvements to the gameplay, and the surface improvement to the graphics makes this game feel more like a decent mod than a blockbuster.
<br>
<br>(For further fiddling- the mod &quot;Forgotten Empires&quot; does everything this HD remake does, plus adds hours of single player campaigns, and a good dozen fixes)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3097721">Expand</a></span>

Broken online mode means it&apos;s a lag fest, am I playing on a dial-up modem? Game has almost no changes from the original, no resolution options or anything like that or graphics options. Well why would it need graphics options? Well</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This was my favorite RTS until I played starcraft 2.

<br>
<br>Broken online mode means it&apos;s a lag fest, am I playing on a dial-up modem? Game has almost no changes from the original, no resolution options or anything like that or graphics options. Well why would it need graphics options? Well f*** me but they managed to botch the port so bad I get 20 FPS online WITH AN ATI 7950 AND A CORE I7 3.5GHZ, CRYSIS 3 RUNS BETTER THAN YOUR GAME, HOW THE HELL.
<br>
<br>Last but not least, it&apos;s 20 dollars, and 10 dollars for the dlc. Yeah, how about you instead by yourselves starcraft 2 for 10 dollars more mkay? The developers of the DLC should be commended but we paid 20 DOLLARS ALREADY, WHY NOT GIVE THEM SOME OF THAT MONEY AND MAKE THE DLC FREE, MICROSOFT. You know I love you guys under all this awful PR lately but COME ON.
<br>
<br>I have never seen, a more botched port of an old game in my life, at least with a lot of ports today it makes sense because they are just larger games, but this, there is no excuse...
<br>
<br>This game gets a 2 because of how much they make you pay for a broken game. A game that you can pirate guilt freely and get the FREE MODDED DLC TO WORK WITH YOUR SYSTEM. Also, the new update, CHANGED THE MUSIC AND BROKE MY SAVE FILES. The only thing this game has is that when it is fixed and lets me choose the original freaking music, than it will be a fun game, but guess what, SEVEN MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN WAITING aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand the new update added more crashing issues.
<br>
<br>Now I came to this games defense when it was coming out, people were going on about how you can get forgotten empires (the now 10 dollar dlc for HD) for free to work on modern systems and an original copy of the game for a small price (free if you pirate, which you probably would because you probably bought the game anyway if you were defending it so who cares?.) I defended the game saying that the online and the HD port is the reason why..... Yeah I feel pretty stupid now.
<br>
<br>Also, it isn&apos;t out on mac or linux, despite the original being on mac. Which I find hilarious.
<br>
<br>So to recap:
<br>Broken Multiplayer (after the new update to ready for the DLC, it actually adds crashes to everything)
<br>Changed audio
<br>Horrid performance
<br>Lack of options
<br>Overpriced
<br>
<br>Do I sound angry? Yeah I am, because microsoft botched my childhood almost as much as they botched this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3747642">Expand</a></span>

So naturally with a remake of such a game there is very little to truly get wrong especially if the source material is a well liked game. However, Age of Empires 2 HD does not live up to the idea of a HD remake, especially not a release worthy of the price tag set which in all honesty is pretty steep for exactly what you get.
<br>
<br>So what do you get for your money? Well the HD in the title seems pretty much exclusive to the better resolution support and improved water textures, as for other artwork it simply does not feel clear and crisp, as what one would expect from the title. This is not terribly surprising given the engine seems more or less the same, so there is only so much new artwork could do for it. If your expecting visuals to rival rts&apos;s of today then i am afraid you&apos;ll be sorely disappointed. But overall the game is not exactly ugly, but as i said above, it lacks what you would expect from a HD edition. As for it&apos;s gameplay it is pretty much identical to the original AoE2, the same strengths and the same flaws. The uninspired AI from the original is unchanged, and any attempt to change the mechanics of the gameplay go without notice, which may be a good thing if you consider that the source material is the main draw, yet is obviously negative to the goal of a remake. Multiplayer has been upgraded, giving the ability to play online through Steam and it&apos;s servers meaning no need for Hamachi or other internet lan based alternative to play. Though the multiplayer is improved, it should be mentioned that it has plenty of issues, namely in it&apos;s coding. There seems to be plenty of examples of errors and incompatibilities that make the experience unpredictable at best, especially in large games of 4+ people. There are client side fixes to some of these problems like port forwarding, but it is obviously not ideal.
<br>
<br>Overall, in my opinion you do not get enough for your money with AOE2: HD, but if it is on sale or you happen to have the money to waste then i would advise to go for it if you enjoyed the original, the series or the rts genre as a whole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3444355">Expand</a></span>

Other than cranking up some textures, some for the better, some for the worse and the removing of LAN support, they didn&apos;t change anything. With that said, I don&apos;t care about graphics. What I care about are &quot;quality of life&quot; features I simply expect from a RTS game that is being released in 2013. AoE:II is old and you can&apos;t only tell by its graphics.
<br>
<br>Arbitrary low number of units that can be selected at one time (how are you supposed to manage your army of 400 units???),  horrible path-finding, no real attack move, selecting more than one recruiting-building so that it divides the units between them doesn&apos;t work ect. Those were acceptable 15 years ago but not any more!
<br>
<br>If you plan to play multiplayer, go for this version. If you don&apos;t then you probably should save yourself the 20$ and get the Forgotten Empires mod which also has a resolution fix for up to 1080p.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106469">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Like some have already stated there could have been a lot more done to the game to enhance it visually. Also there is/was a bug at intial release that gave XP users problems with playing at all. Lastly, in multiplayer there seems to be a bit of a lag issue, almost seems like video lag, but it doesn&apos;t make the game unplayable. Seeing how it&apos;s only been released a few days now (if you pre-ordered), I would assume a patch is coming. So I wouldn&apos;t take anyone seriously yet about the bugs in the game. Most every game these days has bugs at release, and for every game there&apos;s users on Metcritic that will just give a game a 0 because they are whining about bugs.
<br>
<br>If your new to AoE2, and into the RTS genre i&apos;d check it out. Maybe find a friend that has it, and see if you can&apos;t play a bit. It has always been an awesome RTS. Don&apos;t expect new cutting edge graphics. This is an older game. Then again if graphics are what you base your gaming experience on... well..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3097408">Expand</a></span>

Compared to the original, it has some nicer textures (e.g. fog of war, water), Steam leaderboards, achievement, and a good multiplayer community. Patches are still being released, so I recommend it;.</span>

<br>As others have stated, even if you put aside the fact that the game is actually less stable than the original there are no beneficial changes, this is literally a just very lazy cash grab.

<br>The real icing on the cake is that whenever you launch the game it will load a launcher app containing an embedded Internet Explorer window with many invalid links and a script error that you have to cancel before you can actually play the game. Avoid this at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878508">Expand</a></span>

Age of Empire 2 that works on Windows 7. The great thing about steam and the remake is the steam workshop. There are pages and pages of mods. I got realistic farms and the original flames. The AI is smarter and presents a challenge on the higher difficulties. Also being able to invite and play with friends on steam is awesome. Most of the negative reviews are about launch and the fact they were expecting a whole new game. They even added the Forgotten Empires DLC which adds a lot to the game. Even for a guy like me who has played since 2003. I quite enjoy those new civilizations. I would buy this game again. I bought a four pack and give 3 to my friends. I am sure it will go on sale this summer. I would definitely consider getting this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4146681">Expand</a></span>

On anything higher than Windows Vista, it&apos;s loaded with compatibility errors.  It&apos;s really just unplayable.  On the other hand, you can buy this new version of the game priced starting at $20 ($15 if you preordered) and it has some new details and effects, smoothed out graphics, and more.  Along with this, it has steam community support, which means easy game setup.  It even comes complete with workshop so that rather than screwing up the textures, they just let the users easily download content for the game, such as texture packs.  I mean, look at the changes they DID make... those cliff textures were the first to go.
<br>
<br>However, I did notice that sadly, there were some changes that never happened.  I think it would have been nice of them to change the models into actual 3D figures, rather than more detailed pixel-art.  You can&apos;t rotate the camera or anything.  You can&apos;t even zoom in at all.
<br>
<br>All in all, I think it was worth it.  It isn&apos;t the main exhibit of my steam library, but I&apos;m still pretty glad I picked it up while it was on sale.  To sum it all up, it isn&apos;t exactly Red Alert HD, where it has a different style of play from any other game that can compete with Company of Heroes, but rather a Halo 1 Anniversary.  If you expect to see an amazing remake of the game that hit stores full force, you&apos;ll be mildly disappointed.  If it hadn&apos;t been in legal limbo around 2008, maybe it would be something special.  However, this is really just the compatibility update for a classic RTS, that you might enjoy from GOG in maybe 6 years or so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3960671">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing on and off since 1999 and i still learn new tricks after all those years. In random map match there are many ways to play, every game feels diferent, specially in team games (team games demand so much strategy), if you like single player, the campaigns are great. I understand some players don&apos;t like AOE. It&apos;s easy to learn and very hard to master. Some people think its slow because they don&apos;t know how to take advantage of each second of the game (exploring, scouting, balancing economy, planning strategys, placing buildings in the best way possible, micromanagementing economy and army). StarCraft is more like Checkers, Age of Empires is more like Chess. AOE focus a lot more on strategy. I like the first AOE a lot. AOE 2 (AOC) fixed lot of bugs and added cool recorded game option. in 2008 AoE 2 lost official multiplayer support, AoE 2 HD is the chance to revival this great game with a new multiplayer support and some new fixes. If you are a RTS fan you can&apos;t miss this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4019375">Expand</a></span>

AoE 2 HD can also be put fullscreen 16:9 and also features two kinds of choises for the AI: Original AI and just AI, witch is a great thing since the original AI is over 10 years old and need updating. Is it worth buying? Well, the graphics arent that good, but its a big improvement over the original, if you would compare them right now, witch would be unfair since the original came out over 10 years ago.

<br>But now things are a lot different: the game is really mature, they are at patch 3.7 and works have not stopped! New champaigns, AI and everything are well polished and tuned.
<br>
<br>The game is finally a nice improvement over the original, I find no reason to prefer the old version to the new one.

<br>If you can afford AoE II HD for 15$ or less buy it: it worth that much!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4422359">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only thing I&apos;d consider a drawback is that it adds another campaign focused on Spanish, when they already had a campaign back in Conquerors, I think El Dorado could&apos;ve been a campaign focused on Incas instead, as they&apos;re one of the new civilizations in this expansion. Also, the Alaric campaign is a bit boring and all campaigns still don&apos;t have an intro movie-like story and narration. There could be more units (that I expect to see in their later updates). Other than that, it is all good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4800958">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is the best RTS ever, simple as that. There are so many possible strategies and possibilities for epic comebacks that you never get enough of it. Im not giving a 10 because i still think it needs some proper balance between civilizations and it doesnt make too much sense having japanese swordmen looking like a bunch of french folk. But still, this game is the best since 1997.</span>

The gameplay in fact is the same as having those two games (nothing new except for the 500 population cap, widescreen support, Steam Workshop, Steam servers and leaderboard). The water, fire, cliffs, trees and effects have changed in order to make the game more HD. Single player is still the same  but for the multiplayer, it was fixed before (last time, the players were out of sync).

The game automatically fits your desktop resolution. Why it&#xB4;s bad,.....because the animations of the boats, units and all the nice animations they had, which we AoE players enjoyed, are unrecognizable anymore, thanks to the damn 16:9 resolution. I want a 16:9 picture, but with less Field of View. I want a zoom/fov option for this game. And there are even more problems! It&#xB4;s HD, but the graphics stayed the same. For such a price (18,99) they could at least have been updating the textures and also making the old AoE 2 style optional as an option in the options. Switching between old textures and new textures would be a great fan service. For such a high price i expect at least these changes! Also the singleplayer laggs. Yes the damn Singleplayer laggs! Framerate issues and the unit animations, skip frames and through that, they don&#xB4;t look smooth anymore. Thankfully that can be fixed through patches, just as the resolution problem. It&#xB4;s about 20$, 18,99&#x20AC;  in Europe. That&#xB4;s too much for such a ****ty edition! I expected more. At least they did a great job including Workshop and Mutliplayer. Trolled! The multiplayer is lagging and you have connection issues. But that&#xB4;s something that can be fixed through patches...again. I hope they patch the game...unbelievable. I&#xB4;m very dissapointed from this edition. I hope I can buy it as soon as they fixed it. Don&#xB4;t buy it yet. Wait for the Steam Sale and the patches. You can play it, but it&#xB4;s just AoE 2  Conquerors with higher resolution, some bugs and laggs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115515">Expand</a></span>

And with gamesworkshop you can even get new maps new game modes and texture packs.</span>

Second of all, if it was changed, the same people would have been saying &quot;ah it&apos;s not the same, they ruined it&quot;... just the common trolls in the internet.. I am really happy that they did not change this classic in the strategy genre. For me the expansion  The conquerors changed the original age of empires game too much and I was not happy with this, but I accepted it, and I&apos;m really happy they did not do this again. For everyone who loves age of empires, and want to play it with players, I recommend buying it. It has 4-5k players in steam all the time, and it&apos;s great!  it has a workshop, where you can change some of the skins like farms, mines, terrain, etc. Thank you for bringing my favorite strategy back to life!!!!

The title &apos;HD&apos; is a joke cause its the same scaled up textures also it doesn&apos;t offer any new gameplay featuresat all. We quickly stopped playing it because of the serious performance issues it has. By that i mean constant desync and lag problems during multiplayer gaming.</span>

I thought I&apos;d try to get this AOE2 HD version so that he could learn more about actual history as opposed to the &quot;history lite&quot; in AOE3.
<br>
<br>Well I fire it up and my son says, &quot;That looks terrible&quot;.  The graphics really are not good.  The interface stinks, just like the original AOE2.  I was reminded of all the annoying micromanaging things that you had to do in AOE2 like create mining camps.  The bottom line is that AOE2 HD seems just as dated as AOE2 does today.  Will Microsoft please wise up and either create AOE4 or sell the rights to the franchise so someone else can?  The fact that people are buying this polished turd is testament to how much latent demand is out there for this franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3202190">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For starters, I don&apos;t know how many of you tried to use your old AOE II disks recently but...unless you find a user-made patch on the internet, they don&apos;t WORK on modern machines.  They also increased the resolution the game can run at, and reenabled internet play on AOE II, since GameSpy or whoever else originally hosted multiplayer connections does not do so, and has not for years.
<br>
<br>Finally, they added steam support to the game, so that using &quot;Join Game&quot; from the friends menu would pop right into the game, which was a nice feature, and added Steam Workshop integration, which is AMAZING in comparison to the old style of manually installing files, finding them on different sites, etc.

<br>The game is exactly how it was, but with fixes to work on modern PC&apos;s which is what I wanted...but just not fro $20.  It seems like a massive rip-off that they are selling a game that has a few tweaks and modernizations for the same price.  $10 would have been a much more reasonable price, and I bet less people would be pissed off if it were re-sold for that price with the fixes included.
<br>
<br>Overall, I liked AOE II when I was younger, and while due to their fixes I can play it on modern PC&apos;s...the price is very exorbitant, and it feels like they are just trying to use my nostalgia to make a quick buck.  The game itself is perfectly fine however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3593193">Expand</a></span>

Online gameplay still not good, always playing with: rushers, destroyers and as always, people with high ping... Main thing that I love in this game is: Nothing changed, only textures, added good soundtrack. Everyone wants same game with better textures: here it is!

The game is great but the lack of support the developers give to the game is shocking. Multiplayer is practically unplayable after 15mins due to lag/stutturing/desync and the support forum is ignored.
<br>
<br>I would stay away till they give the game some love if they ever do.</span>

<br>The game would probably need a source code release to fix completely.
<br>Did they update for modern systems? Five or four days before release their game only ran out of the box on win7 32bits, all the others had problems, win8 had a white screen if 32bit, black screen if 64, or something like that. They along with win7 64bits had to do some trickery to get their game to launch. Poor XP users couldn&apos;t launch at all because the game was not compiled for their system, Hidden Path managed to get the game to run on XP right before the official launch, but XP users couldn&apos;t benefit from the early release for pre-purchases that HP had offered.
<br>Not like that would have mattered much, players that could play complained then and still wait for a patch that will fix the &quot;awful lag issue&quot; where the fps of the game will drop like a brick if the game has any minimal amount of units running around (the sure fix is to play 1v1 with only 100 units), so upping the maximum unit count to 500, or even 1000 isn&apos;t of much practical use (also, the AI won&apos;t use over 200 units even if the game is set to 500, and according to HP it is expected behavior). There are desynchs too, with no fix. Saving and restoring a game doesn&apos;t work.
<br>Achievements are broken and random.
<br>Matchmaking is region-locked (some regions are empty), you must have players on your steam friend list or change your steam region settings. Friend or private only lobbies are in fact, public. So ready yourself to start kicking people left and right.
<br>The ladder system includes ALL game modes in the same ladder. RM, DM, you name it, despite some modes being able to complete games at a much faster rate. The ladder system is not very intuitive at best or broken at worst, win 15 games and get awarded 20, win three games and have a 3/2 record. The stats include any and all games played, so if you load a game with a friend for fooling around or test something, it will count too. The matchmaking is not very good on top so you have to first have people on your region, then get lucky the player doesn&apos;t rage quit early, then get lucky the game doesn&apos;t desynch, get lucky the player, whom didn&apos;t quit, was actually good at the game, meaning 30 minutes in they should have gone past dark age already!
<br>HP REMOVED the ping display, so you can&apos;t tell who is lagging in a game.
<br>The AI is the dumb AI, and will forfeit the game unless its played on anything but standard mode.
<br>Trebuchets will unpack one step before reaching their attack range, so they&apos;ll unpack and not fire at all.
<br>Hotkey changes don&apos;t load properly, you must, once in the game, load the hotkey menu for the hotkeys to load.
<br>Save game defaults to F12 but also Take screenshot.
<br>The mouse is not locked to the game screen so if you happen to move your mouse too much to the side you&apos;ll have problems with multiple monitors. HP claims this behavior was chosen by design.
<br>To change resolution you must change your Windows resolution (no ingame menu).
<br>Parts of the game load links on your default browser, others on Internet Explorer.
<br>&quot;Portuguese, Chinese &amp; Russian translation is very wrong&quot;
<br>If your Steam name is too long the game will crash, you must shorten it.
<br>On the scenario editor when choosing exit to main menu, it will ask to save or not, if you choose no, it goes back and you are stuck in a loop. You need to save or force quit.
<br>Does not have version check, players with different patch versions can play a game, only for it to crash of course. Steam allows practically infinite patches.
<br>When playing &quot;competitively&quot;, the game doesn&apos;t seem to care about workshop changes.
<br>A developer has stated the &quot;beta testing&quot; the community has done so far is easily worth 100k$ when hiring private entities.
<br>The developers are lucky they are getting 70s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3100260">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Lots of people are giving this game negative reviews because they are saying that this is exactly the same as the original.  However, I am going to judge this as a separate game.  The gameplay itself is extremely good, and the graphics are fine.  The steam workshop support is nice.  There are a few bugs, but I imagine that they will be fixed.</span>

<br>
<br>The main menu displaces objects. The music is near the worst. The videos are not new nor better. The textures are not real HD.
<br>
<br>Congratulations Microsoft.</span>

<br>I know it is a good game, but I thought an HD remake would have better gameplay.
<br>
<br>There were a few things I did not like, and that was with the El Cid Dead body in the final level; they should have at least made a new died character instead of re-using the alive model.</span>

                                        <span>One of the weaker &apos;HD upgrades&apos; out there. Certainly not worth the $20 asking price, and reasonable only when at $5 on Steam sale. It&apos;s the original game with bare-bones graphical adjustments for new monitors, but no real graphic enhancements to speak of. Basically a lazy product designed to milk money out of nostalgia. The game itself is fine. The enhancements are a joke.

However if you just buy the HD version without the expansion for the full $20 I would not recommend it as much. Otherwise a solid 9/10 with the expansion, but only a 7/10 for the base game.

                                        <span>I am going to start off by saying that I am a big fan of the Total War series and I like it better then age of empires so I am biased against this series. I had a lot of fun with this game but then I found the Total War series. Total War trumps this game in all ways except the AI is better in age of empire. If you want fun game get this but if you want a vary fun game get one Total war games.</span>

<br>I don&apos;t understand the ratings saying that nothing was changed, when if there were changes there would be hate on that. The reason why this game came out with a HD version was because a lot of people loved the game. Not for there to be changes.

It may work for some, and may work terrible for others: worst game support ever, absolutely no feed back on issues; game may crash during multiplayer load without no reason, today version 4.8 three years after its release, its still happening; game desyncs for no internet problem, it just shut you off its horrible servers for no reason, even game like Tibia have better servers; game could not be restore, even after save, if you got desync, game over for you. The game everyone already knows how it is, so I don&apos;t need to give score for that, my score is based upon how broken the game is and how the Developers do nothing to solve its problem. Please don&apos;t buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810333">Expand</a></span>

After all, the original Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings and its expansion are so admired that there is still a rich modding and multiplayer community devoted to the game. This is quite an impressive feat for a real-time strategy game that came out just over a decade ago, notably when you consider that the official multiplayer matchmaking service was shut down years ago. An HD version of AOEII with simpler multiplayer matchmaking and mod support (Steam&apos;s servers and Steam Workshop) is a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, Hidden Path&apos;s HD edition of Ensemble Studios&apos; beloved RTS suffers from a wide range of bugs and missed opportunities.
<br>
<br>The fast-paced-game-play has you abusing natural resources, constructing beautiful wonders and intimidating castles, and advancing from the Dark Ages to the much more dignified-sounding Imperial Age. Along the way, you can use the old fashion tried-and-true-favorite formula (pointy sticks kill horses, villagers kill sheep, and so on) to evict other players from the map. There is a lot of depth and variety in AOEII:HD, because all of the 18 playable nations have unique bonuses, units, and tech trees. For example, The Korean guard tower and keep upgrades are free, Turks employ astonishing gun-powder units early on, and the Huns do not require houses to support their population.
<br>
<br>Though we cannot forget about the randomly generated and real-world maps to play on, as well as several game modes, including a laid-back game type where the first player to complete a wonder wins. Because of the various ways to achieve victory conditions and diverse powers for each nation, there are many ways to play, and excel, in Age of Empires II HD. Though, Hidden Path missed several opportunities to better AOEII&apos;s game-play. You cannot give move-attack orders; dragging a box over a crowd of units selects both villagers and troops; and it&apos;s hopeless to queue up a mixture of units and research at the same building. Not to mention AI path-finding also needs some work. For instance, villagers ordered to travel to a mining camp located in plain sight 200 yards away over open country may decide to take a scenic route through a forest populated by hungry wolfs. These are examples of flaws that could have been resolved and fixed, but increasing the maximum population limit from 200 to 500 is the only notice able change made interms of game-play.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s only been a week since the game was released and there are already a decent amount of texture packs, gameplay tweaks, and plenty of other goodies. In almost the same way that Skyrim took my investment of 100 hours and magically grew that to something in the neighborhood of 400, the Workshop for AOEII:HD is an amazing bonus. And, combined with access to multiplayer via Steam, it&apos;s really the only addition the game needs.
<br>
<br>Though, while a little frustrating if you&#x2019;re not into tons of micro-management, Age of Empires II HD with the Workshop and updated multiplayer features is an commendable title. The brilliance of the game&#x2019;s design is still there, you just might need to look past its age to see it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3117337">Expand</a></span>
