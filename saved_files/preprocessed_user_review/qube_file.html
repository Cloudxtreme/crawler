<br>Some people think that the game is crappy for the lack story but in my opinion one thing that make this game so good is exactly the lack of it. That way when you proceed through the chambers you wonder who created them, what was the purpose of all that and many other things that are, at least partially, explained when you beat it. People with at least a drop of creativity, imagination and logic should love this game.

The graphics won&apos;t blow you away, but the indie developers have done an excellent job of making the game look as intriguing as possible, from flashing lights to puzzles in darkness to broken cubes falling from the ceiling. The puzzles (apart from one in particular ) feel fair and take a while to understand, resulting in a perfect balance between frustration and cleverness. Yet with that said, i find that the game really is a bit too repetitive at a certain points, and certain puzzles actually repeat them selves with very minor changes. Compare that with games like Portal 2 which was exciting all the way through, It results in a dissapointing flow of events.  The soundtrack is excellent, with the cool beats keeping up the atmosphere of the lab . The constant sense of solitude is a continuous factor that keeps you going to discover. The lack of story complements this game, and it finishes with a spectacular ending. Yet i doubt this is will be a game i  will play again. I will certainly purchase a sequel should they make one and that said this game is certainly worth a play though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2527341">Expand</a></span>

Although Q.U.B.E. looks a lot like the Portal series and has a certain similar feel to it, the gameplay itself is quite different, as in the kind of puzzles you solve and game mechanics that you utilise. Overall it&apos;s a fairly good and fun puzzle game. Visually it&apos;s very stunning, despite most of it being set in a mysterious white environment. The puzzles are really great, even though at times can be frustrating. The controls and game mechanics relating to what each type of cube does are very intuitive and easy to pick up within a couple of minutes, and with each new area there are new elements added to the puzzle solving aspect (though some of these elements are not used again in latter areas). Some of the puzzles here are very challenging, so be prepared to spend some time on solving them, especially two in particular which take up a fairly big chunk of the game&apos;s playtime and sort of follow one after the other. The game doesn&apos;t really have any story, but I suppose that is fine for a puzzle game. In fact there is something happening in the background, but it&apos;s always kept in mystery and I suppose can be up to interpretation. In fact I somewhat enjoyed that feeling of mystery which was well complemented with the white-themed environments. Perhaps the only major drawback of the game is that it doesn&apos;t last long. It should take you around 4-5 hours to complete it and after that there isn&apos;t much of anything else to do apart from replaying the puzzles. I think if there were more features added, then they would&apos;ve extended the game&apos;s lifespan, stuff like a mapmaker perhaps, or additional challenges added to some of the existing puzzles (as the first Portal game had). Generally a good game, just short-lived.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2533984">Expand</a></span>

But it&apos;s fun, it&apos;s austere aesthetic is compelling and interesting all by itself. There are a lot of solid ideas in here that are well done. Some of the later puzzles are frustrating though. The solutions and the manipulation of objects to achieve those solutions were... rough. Raising the red blocks into the light being the worst offenders. I also have to give a nod to Q.U.B.E. for implementing true darkness. In one section everything but certain elements and lights on the walls is black, turn the gamma up and it still won&apos;t matter dark. The game is very short (which can be a good thing if you&apos;ve got a backlog a mile long and want a quick distraction.) Worth playing, music was ho-hum and did little to enhance or hinder the environment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811325">Expand</a></span>

The quality of the puzzles on the hand is kind of mixed. The game never gives you any tutorial or hints on how stuff works and you sometimes find yourself in awkward situations where its not clear what you are supposed to do to advance. Later in the game there is also some puzzles that is mostly trial and error based and are more time-consuming than really hard. There is also instances where its more difficult to psychically solve the puzzles than to mentally solve the puzzles which is kind of annoying. Its campaign could be a bit longer (about 5-6 hours) but its pretty varied with pretty interesting level and puzzle design.  Its still an alright puzzle game though and if you are into the genre you should definitely check it out consider its low price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2547612">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a decent game, but it falls far short of Portal&apos;s glory.<br><br>The decision to not incude any instructions is interesting. I was able to figure everything out after a while, but there are many moving parts and it&apos;s easy to forget which parts do what. Portal was elegant. Portals were the solution to every problem. In this game, you push blocks, pull blocks, rotate rooms, move balls, switch gravity, push wires, and more. Once you figure out how something works, instead of mastering it, new moving parts are thrown in. Combine that with non-resettable puzzles where you can get stuck, and it adds up to poor level design. The puzzles are somewhat entertaining and decently tough.<br><br>The setting is really boring. Little sound, and nobody says anything. It&apos;s like walking through a hospital.<br><br>Puzzle fans may enjoy this, but don&apos;t pay too much for it, especially for such a short game. $5 is about right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2228955">Expand</a></span>

However, the mechanics of this puzzle game is significantly different from that of Portal games. In this game you don&apos;t generate portals. Instead you are supposed to touch and to activate varous colored cubes which have different functions. You need to figure out the functions of different color cubes and to find out the way to go forward by using these color cubes in appropriate combinations. Since the mechanics of this game is very different from that of Portal, you don&apos;t feel like repeating Portal games under different disguises at all. There is no story unlike Portal 2. This game is for pure logic puzzles. The game is available as both a steam version and a DRM-free version (Gamersgate).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2098424">Expand</a></span>

You want to make sure you play this game with your colors on full blast otherwise it can kind of look dull. I would have given this game a 10 but they didn&apos;t complete the game, you couldn&apos;t even get all the achievements. Aside from that the game was fun and more difficult than Portal. I&apos;m sure everyone has different opinions but as a person who loves puzzle games I can tell you that this game is more enjoyable than Portal 1 and 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2434372">Expand</a></span>

Simple mechanics, complex challenges. Strange environment. Uh, what else.. Oh the music.

That said, obviously there is no portal gun, instead, you have some fancy gloves that are able to manipulate coloured blocks to reach the exit. different colours/blocks do different things and its really down to figuring out the correct order to activate them in. As a review, I must state the obvious, if you enjoyed portal you will enjoy this game - if you have not played portal you will enjoy this game if you like logic/environment puzzles. Certainly not the best game out there but a worthwhile addition to your catalogue and better than average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=2104107">Expand</a></span>

Portal is boring while this keeps you playing. Sure it looks like portal but its fun, something  that portal lacks. Seriously, one of my favorite games.</span>

The game is just an interesting idea, but if she had to compete with other games of this type (even ignoring portals) that this is not only a revolution of the arcade.

The fundamental flaw with this game is that the developers were simply scared to let players have any freedom to explore or experiment.  Which is to say that the whole premise is flawed.  A Portal wannabe, this game lacks any of Portal&apos;s fun, both in the sense that I really, truly missed GLaDoS making the game hilarious as well as giving the game any sort of context for what happens, as well as in the sense that simply pushing and pulling blocks isn&apos;t nearly as fun as running through a perpetual portal tunnel.
<br>
<br>Even if Portal 1 constrained you to one solution just to teach you a new trick with the portal gun, you could still USE the portal gun wherever.  The gloves in this game only do one specific thing on the handful of blocks specifically given to you in specific areas for you to accomplish your specified mandatory puzzle time.
<br>
<br>When all you have are two to five blocks to push or pull, and you know that EVERY one of those blocks will be used, all the puzzle solutions become obvious.  Even a few red herring blocks would have been welcome.  What the game could have really used, however, would have been freer-floating blocks, and puzzles that actually use the character&apos;s relative position in some interesting physics puzzles (like Portal did) so everything wasn&apos;t just so scripted.
<br>
<br>As a result, the developers seem to have quickly found out that they painted themselves into a corner, and couldn&apos;t keep coming up with new puzzles using the same block types, so they had to keep inventing new arbitrary block types or conditions.  First you have color blocks you have to push with other blocks, then it&apos;s a ball. Then it&apos;s a ball on a slope with timed actions (annoying). Then you have to do everything all over again in the dark (REALLY annoying). Then some blue balls start wrecking the place for no reason (but you don&apos;t know if that&apos;s supposed to be good or bad for lack of plot). Then they start being suspiciously part of obviously pre-planned puzzles where they don&apos;t wreck things and move in set patterns to activate other blocks. Then magnet blocks. Then lasers and lenses. Then they forget the whole &quot;blue balls wreck everything&quot; concept entirely, and there&apos;s just rubble everywhere for no reason, even though everything still works. Then they super-charge your gloves at a Lego temple for some reason, and you can start changing the colors of different blocks (which would almost make you have to stop and think were it not for the fact that there are only 1 to 4 blocks you can change at a time, anyway, so there are still too few permutations to make puzzles challenging).  Then the game ends in a completely unexpected, anti-climactic, and utterly confusing way because the game has no plot, and dumps you out to the menu screen because the devs couldn&apos;t think of anything more to do with their premise.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s funny to see a game so utterly linear seem so utterly aimless. It just leaves me with the feeling that the developers discovered how limiting their game&apos;s premise was too late, so they just kept throwing new things at you every 5 minutes hoping that they could milk another 2 or 3 puzzles out of it before you got bored.
<br>
<br>Plus the devs seem to spend an inordinate amount of time making you sit through cutscenes or walk in tunnels where the Lego structures jiggle in ways that cause them to clip through one another...
<br>
<br>What this game could have really stood to try to copy would be games like Trine or Fantastic Contraption, where you DON&apos;T have just one arbitrary solution to the puzzle.  Fantastic Contraption, especially, rewards coming up with clever new ways to use the same tiny handful of pieces in new ways to solve new problems, or even to just go back and solve the old puzzles in a new way.  When you complete qube, which only took about 2 hours, you never really want to go back, because there&apos;s no reason to do so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=3112926">Expand</a></span>

It has the same overall style (though not humor) as Portal, there is a plot but I won&apos;t spoil it here though. Many of the puzzles were great especially in the second half with coloured laser reflectors &amp; electric cords. Requirements are quite low - should run fine even on a low-end gaming PC. Physics are good (as they need to be in a physics based puzzle game!)
<br>
<br>Some &quot;professional&quot; reviewers sulking about the sterile non-photo-realistic textures - um, that&apos;s pretty much the point of the location! Likewise, this is an Indie title and judging it by AAA standards is just silly, especially given Portal itself is a derivative of &quot;Narbacular Drop&quot; (Google it to understand Portal&apos;s early development). Voice acting &amp; music aren&apos;t bad - what do people expect a full 200-piece orchestra on every puzzle game?
<br>
<br>If you liked Portal, then this is definitely worth playing overall as a game in its own right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=4234701">Expand</a></span>

<br>(Originally 7, but changed because not being to save manually is really annoying, and I&apos;m stuck on a puzzle, with the pressure of having to re-do the previous puzzles if I don&apos;t solve it.

The biggest problem with the game, like most puzzle games, is its length. I don&apos;t consider myself very good at puzzle games, yet i was through the entire game without any outside assistance in just 3 hours. It also has a very evident Portal feel to it as in the later levels you walk through a destroyed facility from puzzle to puzzle much like portal. For the amount of content this game offers, you definitely would need to make a purchase when it is $2.50 or less. If this game had a 8-10 hour campaign, it would easily get a 8/10 instead of a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=3020507">Expand</a></span>

<br>And that&apos;s a solid 8.
<br>On the other side you got many graphical glitches that are annoying at the least, but will quickly turn into the biggest source of frustrated rage when they actually prevent the player to continue the game, and this happened way more often (at least 3 during the whole story) than it should be (zero). Disappearing cubes, invisible walls, important elements stuck forever...
<br>And that&apos;s a 5, that makes the average vote a 6.5.
<br>I rounded down my vote because of the DLC &quot;Against the Clock&quot;, that I didn&apos;t like very much; the best part of this game was the fact thet you could go on at your own pace, looking around and thinking and stuff: a constant race against time doesn&apos;t apply very much to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=3237359">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Fun, simple and challenging. Although it heavily borrows from Portal it still shines with its own unique and clever puzzle designs. It&apos;s only fault is it ends just as you feel you&apos;re getting really good at the puzzles and fails to challenge you even more.</span>

I&apos;ve seen a lot of criticism heaped on it for its lack of story or lack of soundtrack, basically its minimalistic design, but I think people just compare it far, FAR too much to Portal.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the thing: You are a nameless, faceless figure with an inexplicable ability to control blocks in your environment. Everything is black and white, with the occasional splash of color to indicate a piece of the room you can interface with. Red for spots you can extend or retract, blue for spots that act as launchers, and so on.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are really quite clever and enjoyable, and the controls are simple. At no point did I feel like I didn&apos;t understand what I was doing or what I had to do; a bit of experimentation was needed to learn new mechanics as they appeared, but the minimalistic design and the simplicity of the mechanics you have to learn make your course very clear at all times. The game gives you all the pieces to solve the puzzle, you just have to figure out how they fit. It&apos;s perfect design in that respect, really.
<br>
<br>As for the lack of story or dialogue or anything else, I think that actually enhances the experience. It&apos;s a puzzle game, there&apos;s nothing else to it than that. There&apos;s very clearly something going on in this world you&apos;re suddenly thrust into, but it&apos;s never clear what. Leaving the player with a question as to who they are or what they&apos;re doing is good design, in my opinion. It lets them wonder and try to answer any unanswered questions, and really creates a memorable experience.
<br>
<br>Final recommendation? It&apos;s a great puzzle game. If you enjoy those, you&apos;ll like it. If you absolutely need story to explain why you&apos;re pushing blocks around, you&apos;ll be disappointed; but if you&apos;re willing to push blocks for the sake of it and test your cleverness for no reason than because you can, this is the perfect game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/qube/user-reviews?user_review_id=4406475">Expand</a></span>
