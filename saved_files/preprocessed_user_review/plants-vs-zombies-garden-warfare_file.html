But it doesn&apos;t affect the game math , the game is running fine on a GT 620 @720p Ultra Texture &amp; AF &amp; Other Low , And it Looks Very Good ,</span>

It&#x2019;s close to that very high rating but a few issues hold it back. I&#x2019;ll outline the good first and end with its flaws, most of which are correctable and hopefully addressed in the near future.
<br>
<br>The game has a style and charm that are immediately recognizable and enjoyable. The various buildings and characters all look like 3D realizations of the plants vs. zombies 2D games and the weapon effects are highly appropriate; the zombie foot soldier&#x2019;s stink bombs leave lingering purple clouds, the chomper looks like the dangerous predator it is while still maintaining the comical look of the game universe, and such things as fake noses, snack tray hats, concrete glasses, and a host of other customization options all aptly display the game&#x2019;s whimsical nature even while shooting the opposing team with gusto.
<br>
<br>The sounds are also well done and add even more magic to the atmosphere of the battles. These range from the various zombies cries of &#x2018;brains&#x2019;, the sunflower&#x2019;s happy chirping vocalizations, the way the zombie engineer&#x2019;s devices all sound like someone making machine sounds with their mouths, the pseudo-speech of both Dr. Zomboss and Crazy Dave as they declare various in-game events, and the zombies &#x2018;rar rar raring&#x2019; the chorus for Beethoven&#x2019;s &#x2018;Ode to Joy&#x2019; when they win a round of Gnome Bomb.
<br>Game modes and maps are a bit limited but still enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The maps are really well done and so far I like them all. The game features one co-op mode; Garden Ops, the rest are all team vs. team and include; Team Vanquish (death match), Gardens &amp; Graveyards (plants defend, zombies attack), and Gnome Bomb (hot potato to blow up 3 enemy gardens/graveyards without losing yours). The Vanquish Confirmed game mode is not on PC at the time of this writing. Gardens &amp; Graveyards is my favorite and it seems to be many other players&#x2019; as well. It allows both teams to use the stickers they get from the shop to summon reinforcements and the attack/defend mechanic works very well in this game making these modes great fun as either side.
<br>
<br>Star challenges are how you level up your classes and are in-game tasks to unlock a star, once you unlock enough of these that class will level up. At first this is how you unlock your additional special ability slots but later you get class specific sticker packs you can open via the Sticker Stop.
<br>
<br>The sticker shop is quite fun and despite some rumors it does not require you to spend real money, although that option does exist. You get PvZ coins for playing the game and then spend them at the shop to open various packs of stickers as well as the aforementioned automatic class stickers. The better you perform in game, both on a personal level but also by helping your team, I want to stress how much the game encourages teamwork here, the more coins you get and the higher your placement in the scoreboard at the end of a round. Packs currently cost from 1,000to 40,000 coins depending on what you wish to buy.
<br>
<br>The stickers open up class variants, customizations, weapon upgrades, and reinforcements you can use in Garden Ops mode (plants only) and Gardens &amp; Graveyards (both plants and zombies). You also get revivals and re-tries for Garden Ops mode and star challenge cards, these last cards will let you bypass challenges by using the stars to complete them immediately.
<br>
<br>With all that good comes the bad. The DRM has been brought up other reviewers and it requires Origin to buy and play since the game is always online. Also the lack of maps and map modes may be limiting its longevity but this is easily fixed in patches and they&#x2019;ve already added maps and mods since its initial console launch. The game auto-connects to servers when we should have a server list that lets us pick as well as tagging servers as favorites or blacklisted. Team balance is overall good but you can get stuck on a team for round after round and if it&#x2019;s bad, your only recourse is to get lucky as people join/leave or you leave the server. But if you do leave a bad server team, and join the same game mode again, it will often just put you right back where you were since you can&#x2019;t pick servers.
<br>
<br>The worst thing right now however is the microphone issue. I cannot stress enough how annoying this can be. The game has no way to set it and it defaults to auto-voice detect with no option to mute yourself or set push-to-talk like we really need. You will often join a server and be bombarded with coughing, static, background noise, etc. until you can tab out to the scoreboard and toggle mute all. This is a serious irritation and must be addressed ASAP.
<br>
<br>In conclusion this is a fun and addictive experience with a lot of charm and is a blast to play, but with a few flaws that need to be corrected, especially that microphone problem. I&#x2019;m an older gamer (44) and I love this game and look forward to fixes and more content!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4345800">Expand</a></span>

Essentially, the target audience for the original Plants vs. Zombies. If you liked Plants vs. Zombies at any point in your gaming career, and you enjoy third person shooters, then you&apos;ve found a game that will fit neatly into a niche in your gaming collection.
<br>
<br>The first thing to note is that there IS customization. Garden Warfare has plenty of customization options, from cool to crazy, that you can deck your plants and zombies out with. Best of all is that the longer you play, the more stuff you&apos;ll have to choose from, including taunts and &apos;characters&apos;. Some of the unique alternate characters genuinely play differently, and it&apos;s nice. Keeps things interesting. You can also change aesthetic and statistical aspects of your abilities. Digging even deeper, each class has its own unique &apos;upgrades&apos; that let you reload faster, carry more ammo, or just generally be a more effective unit.
<br>
<br>Each of the base classes have a niche to fill on the battlefield. Sunflower/Scientist are the healers, Peashooter/Soldier are the base front line fighters, Engineer/Chomper are specialists, while Cactus fills a genuine sniper role and All-Star is a heavy, in-your-face class. If you&apos;ve ever had a chance to play Team Fortress 2, the classes all fit similar niches, but diversify more because of their abilities.
<br>
<br>First thing most players do when they boot up the game is hit Multiplayer. The Welcome Mat is just that: it&apos;s there to welcome new players to the game by leaving out customizations, upgrades and ability variations. It&apos;s very much the stock version of Garden Warfare. One thing you&apos;ll notice immediately is that Zombies have an overwhelming disadvantage against Plants. Unless your team consists of solid, experienced players on the Zombie side, Plants tend to win quite often.
<br>
<br>The reason for this is largely because, one on one, Plants overwhelm the Zombies. In fact, there are plenty of situations a Plant can find itself in against multiple Zombies and come out the victor. They tend to do more focused damage and have more useful abilities. It also doesn&apos;t help that their healers are mobile, while Zombie healers have to camp. The only chance a Zombie team has of victory is to move as a group. Running off solo without tagging along with at least one other Zombie is a recipe for failure no matter what class you choose.
<br>
<br>Another thing you&apos;ll notice quickly is that the spawn system is fairly wonky. It has a tendency to spawn the enemy behind you, where you&apos;ll often be flanked immediately. Keeping an eye out behind you at all times is absolutely crucial to avoid an enemy sneaking up on you. Thankfully, in objective based game modes, this isn&apos;t a problem.
<br>
<br>Once you learn the flow of a battle and that teamwork is far more crucial in this game than in other shooters, no matter the game mode, it becomes a smoother ride. This game is not for solo warriors, unless you&apos;re playing on the Plant side. Then you have a legitimate chance of making an impact on your own.
<br>
<br>There are naturally other game modes - several variations of multiplayer, Garden Ops - and they each have their pros and cons, but you&apos;ll have to play them to really get an idea of what you like. Then, just stick with it. There&apos;s plenty of content to keep you busy for a while, but its flaws are readily apparent. If you can look past that, well, it&apos;s certainly worth the money.
<br>
<br>Oh, and in case you&apos;re wondering, the Digital Deluxe version is only worth it if you give a crap about aesthetics. The actual unique aesthetics you get for it are minimal at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4387559">Expand</a></span>

As a big fan of the PVZ franchise, I was very curious to see what were coming. And the result, at least for me, is an instant success. Graphics are simply amazing running on 1080p on ultra, even with antialiasing set to high (and I play on a laptop with a gt 555m!), gameplay is very addictive, as different plants and zombies play in a unique way, sounds are very nice, the servers are working wonderfully (at least for now, while i&apos;m writing this review). Overall a VERY polished game and for a little price for what it offers. There are several game modes, going from the classic deathmatch style, to garden ops (an up to 4 players coop where you can plant things to help you stop the zombies) and things like capture the gardens (like a capture the flag), and others. The replay value is incredible. Oh, and the game has a card store, that makes it freshier over time, as you unlock a LOT of things with it.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend it to anyone. Been a while since I had this fun playing an online shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4305713">Expand</a></span>

I had a free month of live gold so I used that profile to play the game and was very pleasantly surprised. My son and I both really enjoy the game. Sometimes I think I like it more than him. However I really really do not like to play shooter games with a controller, so when I heard this was coming to PC, I was very excited. I have to admit that I was apprehensive about dealing with EA and Origin, but I liked the game enough to give it a shot. While I was waiting for the game day to launch, Origin offered Titanfall for free for 48 hours. The game would not launch correctly and I never got to play. So, that definitely added to my paranoia about preordering which I never do out of principal. The launch of this game was surpirsingly smooth as were the servers for the past few days. I am very pleasantly surprised with EA with regards to this title.
<br>
<br>The only negatives that I have to comment on are the microphones. Thankfully my keyboard has a mute button that I can push before going into a match where I can then mute everyone manually and still play with sound. Also waiting between matches is kind of a downer. Its only one minute, but then you have to wait for the game to load. Just seems like extra waiting that could be eliminated, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>My favorite thing about the game is that it is easy to pick up but hard to master. It reminds me of TF2 a lot, but is different enough that it doesn&apos;t feel too familiar. There are always little tricks and hiding spots to find and use to get the edge and I really admire that in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296953">Expand</a></span>

If you love quirky colourful FPS games such as TF2 or Loadout like I do, you&apos;ll love this game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is primarily asymmetrical competitive multi-player in the form of classic PvZ action; the Plants team squaring off against the Zombie horde. Each team offers 4 class, each unique to that team with three abilities, also unique to each class, new abilities can also be unlocked through gameplay.
<br>
<br>Gamemodes consist of classic Team Deathmatch, called Team Vanquish in this, Gardens &amp; Graveyards, where Plants are tasked with defending points on a map while Zombies attack, and lastly Gnome Bomb, in which each team has three points that must be defended from the enemy team planting an explosive gnome which spawns randomly on the map and can be picked up by players.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re more into solo/co-op non-competitive action there&apos;s also Garden Ops mode, where you and up to 3 other players play as the Plants team defending your Garden from the hordes of AI Zombie attackers.
<br>
<br>Only problems I have with the game are minor nit-picks that other reviews have pointed out as well, like the microphone problem and no text chat, but I imagine these will be resolved fairly quickly.
<br>
<br>All in all this game is my favourite game of 2014 thus far, and right up there with TF2 in my favourite FPS book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4297617">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is solid and a good evolution for the franchise. Think a 3rd person, asymmetrical version of Battlefield without vehicles. Unfortunately, mics are defaulted to transmit for everyone with no option for push-to-talk or to permanently turn off all voice chat. At the start of almost every match, you will be sonically assaulted with audio clutter including annoying white noise, slight feedback, or irritating chatting/music from players, some who don&apos;t even realize they are broadcasting. The quick fix is to mute everyone at the start of each match. And then again if anyone with an annoying mic joins in-game. And finally again in the between game lobby. This is the epitome of lazy porting even though there are multiple articles where devs deceptively claim this game will not be a simple port. There is no written chat function. You cannot create a party with friends in-game, it must be done out of game thru Origin. There are a handful of minor bugs, quality-of-life issues, and rare crashing even though the game was released almost half a year ago for consoles . Ultimately a fantastic and humorous shooter soiled by terrible porting and not enough polish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4325337">Expand</a></span>

<br>ist MEIN Spass ?
<br>Der Patch ? L&#xE4;cherlich und  viel zu sp&#xE4;t. 20.000er Packs bringne keine Char Bilder mehr. nur noch Kosmetischen Krams. Das geheule und gest&#xF6;ne seiner Mitspieler ist abschaltbar ? Ja, Denkste.
<br>Klappt leider auch nicht immer.
<br>Der Startsound benutzt die Einstellungen ? ne, warum ? Soll das ganze Haus doch wissen was man
<br>Spielt und neue Boxen braucht man danach auch.
<br>
<br>Der Netcode ? Ist ja wohl das allerlezte. Man steht vor seinen Gegenspielern und trifft. (Fadenkreuz Rot) Der Spieler bekommt aber keinen Schaden.
<br>Cheaten wird das wohl nicht sein. Obwohl Level 255 Spieler ... na egal.
<br>Die Karten sind voller Clipping Fehler. Spieler k&#xF6;nnen Problemlos durch Felsen und Mauern schiessen.
<br>
<br>Wer ein kurzweiliges Spiel ohne irgendwelche Ambitionen sucht, ist hier willkommen.
<br>Alle anderen, die auch so bl&#xF6;de sind und glauben man k&#xF6;nnte Teamplay betreiben, glaubt weiter an das
<br>gute bei EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4385354">Expand</a></span>

Actually a really good FPS, more along the lines of Team Fortress rather than Call of Duty.  The action is nonstop, the graphics are lush and  full of color and the many battlegrounds full of life.  But I think what sets PvZGW apart are the characters themselves - each can be customized to the point of creating a truly crazy, unique character - and each of the &apos;classes&apos; of both zombies and plants have interesting roles that are useful, as well as fun to explore and improve.  The entire game just oozes over with character and personality, and if you were in any way a fan of the original PvP, you&apos;ll feel oddly at home here.  For the record I&apos;ve been playing since release and I&apos;ve never been one-shot-killed yet.  And I play regularly.  In fact I haven&apos;t really seen any instance of cheating.  I deduct one star because the game can occasionally be wonky, with game-ending bugs popping up from time-to-time (such as falling into the landscape or getting stuck in a black screen you can only Cntrl-Alt-Del to get out of).  But overall it&apos;s mostly quite stable, and very fun.  Do I wish EA didn&apos;t own this franchise?  Of course.  I don&apos;t think they improve anything they own.  But I&apos;m not going to let that stop me from giving the game the score it deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4389513">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Various maps (over 10 + day/night versions).
<br>2. Co-op and Versus modes (also for beginners).
<br>3. Funny characters (8 total) and enemies.
<br>
<br>--- Cons ---
<br>1. Graphics are pretty poor.
<br>2. Lack of depth (planting and combat is very limited).
<br>3. Minor lags and connection issues (tested with 50 Mbps line).
<br>
<br>A decent online multiplayer shooter,that doesnt take itself too seriously.</span>

<br>
<br>Underlying this shiny exterior is this delicious core of solid team-based gameplay.  The co-op mode can get pretty intense and hectic, as waves of zombies come at your garden from every which way.  The team deathmatch definitely awards the team that plays and coordinates together.
<br>
<br>The only thing i wish this game had was a split-screen and/or a LAN option or at least bots to play against.  I&apos;m sure at some point in the future the servers will go down, and this being a multiplayer-only title, it will be unplayable without the servers.  A split-screen mode would have ensured that this game would still be playable - and some consumers may be hesitant to buy a game that won&apos;t be playable at an unknown date in the future.
<br>
<br>About the sticker pack system.  Hey i understand - it&apos;s a business, and you don&apos;t have to pay a dime for the stickers if you don&apos;t want to.  And if having it in the game keeps the light on (or the servers online), then I&apos;m all for it.  Plus, there are plenty of servers that run the game mode where unlocks aren&apos;t used, so you don&apos;t have to feel like it&apos;s a pay-to-win type of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5212426">Expand</a></span>

WELL...PLANTS vs ZOMBIES you should think WTF that&#xB4;s for kids!!! it might be right but the developers did a really cool game, with nice graphics, well sound and the servers are so smooth with the connection that I give a 9 ...not a 10 because I did not like much the aiming response of each character but don&#xB4;t take this seriously. For 18dlls at ORIGIN hey this is worthy I have 3 hrs and I just bought it a few hours ago....this is addiction.......DAMMNN!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4366157">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I waited four months for this game to come on pc after its early release on xbox. I&apos;m happy with the pc version being a strong port and all but it still isn&apos;t as addictive as i wish it would be. A great game yes but it would be cool if there was a text chat feature and more gameplay modes and even more maps as the maps easily get repetitive in garden ops mode. Other than that its an amazing game.</span>

<br>Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare is a third-person multiplayer game with elements of tower defense game. Giving us a unique mix of gameplay elements and design, but there is one issue with the final product that brings it down to an unplayable state. The issue is LACK OF PLAYERS, wait. Not only a lack of players but NO PLAYERS AT ALL. No matter what gamemode I selected, the game started &quot;Looking for really great game sessions...&quot; occasionally this only took a few seconds other times it could take almost an hour but it always ended in the same way. AN EMPTY LOBBY.
<br>Now this issue wouldn&apos;t be so bad if the game had a single player but that is to much to ask for. Which is sad when DICE&apos;s Battlefield franchise has gone to the effort to incorporate some highly scripted tech demo into their latest release.
<br>But this is not all doom and gloom, it has shined new light on a feature I have been waiting to try in the Origin client. The Origin Great Game Guarantee, which within a few minutes had fully refunded the amount that I had forked out for this pile of rotting corpses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4864128">Expand</a></span>

Little cheaters, btw i report anyone who use some way of hacking in game. Graphic of the game is very good, plants and zombies are good designed, maps are nice. This is just one of those games that suck you in and don&apos;t let go for a long time. Why 9 score then? Game is not perfect that is why.</span>

                                        <span>I bought this game to play with my friend at his home. The game is magic and fun but I thought 2p couch play meant you could actually play the full game with a friend home. But, it turned out that couch playing only allows &quot;survive the incoming waves&quot;-mode. It is far from what I expected.
<br>
<br>Home alone online = 10!
<br>couch play with friend = 2!
<br>My score: 5!</span>
