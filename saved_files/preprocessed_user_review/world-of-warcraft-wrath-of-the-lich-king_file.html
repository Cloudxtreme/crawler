I have been playing WoW ever since its release and unfortunately got quite bored with it through the original release and the BC expansion. However when Blizzard started the patch to ready WoW for WotLK I was instantly hooked. Although I found it hard to play until WotLK, I have been a big fan of the mystical world the WoW takes place in which causes me to find it humorous on some reviews on here saying things such as &quot;WoW is an old and outdated boring MMORPG, all about grinding mobs and gearing up.&quot; When they dont realize that WoW is more about a mythical world that you can take a part in and experience and while you can ignore that aspect, it&apos;s still fun to do the many quests, group with others to run instances or raids, and to just play the game. I know many people won&apos;t agree with me and I know I cant change that but in my opinion WotLK is a great expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420298">Expand</a></span>

I think the developers went too mainstream and focused to much on the profit model giving players anything they ask for by just putting a price tag on it. While not all that came with this expansion is bad, many things have really irked me enough to take a long break from the game.</span>

You&apos;ll get bad grades, forget about your kids, and / or die. It is that engrossing. But seriously, either try the trial first or play at a friends house, this games isn&apos;t for everyone and we don&apos;t need more bad reviews because a few people are mad they lost a measly $15 (assuming they only paid for a month since it was so bad for them :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=421105">Expand</a></span>

For those of you who say that WoW is just a massive grind fest, no wonder you hate the game! Best way to level is to quest, group up with your pals, and do some dungeons, this is where the &quot;King&quot; really shines. This game IS NOT a repeat of past expansions. There are so many new quests from hopping on a mammoth and goring a boss to taking flight in an air plane and getting into dog fights with gargoyles. Basically, the people who give this a low score know nothing about lore. People who give this a hi score are the ones that read the quests, know there lore, and is wondering what is going to happen next in one of the greatest and detailed stories ever, Warcraft. (I&apos;d like to see one of those 0 rating people tell me who and where illidan is and where he came from, and how he came to be evil). Also, the graphics are upgraded by alot. Better textures and lighting and effects. Those of you still playing on the same system during the release of the original game are not going to see an upgrade. (The old pentium 4, 512 mb ram, ati 9800 beast just isn&apos;t going to cut it anymore) Play the game on an HD LCD Monitor and get a graphics card that can handle WoW on all max settings (ati 2600 XT or better) and has pixel shader 3.0 and the game really shines. For those of you who complain about queues and how blizz should make more servers, you all need to switch servers. There are about 10 servers that are full constantly, the remainder 40 some odd servers are sitting there.... waiting..... waiting for someone else to finally log on before the server forgets its on. Blizzard also made 3 new servers to compensate for the Northrend Blitz. One last note. Warhammer is still on its knees begging to be worthy of even thinking about World of Warcraft, for it lacks depth story and most if all..... a community of over 1000 players ;-) WoW 11 million....AND COUNTING!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420525">Expand</a></span>

Much of the end game content is more shallow, offering less to shoot for. My guess is this will be changed with patches though. There have been small improvements all around the board, making it worth while to play. I think the only major downfall of this game is the players. A sadistic crazed addiction to get more stuff for no real ultimate reason other than to get more stuff shoots this game into the shitter. This game is made to be enjoyed by DOING those things which give you the cool stuff. stupid, stupid people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420522">Expand</a></span>

Firstly being that this game is just more fun to play, there&apos;s no two ways about it. It&apos;s called world of warcrack for a reason, it&apos;s addictive and YES it will remove all your spare time from you, but when your paying monthly to play something surely you&apos;d expect to get the most from it. Secondly i wanted to play as a death knight. Upon release they&apos;re clearly overpowered however at 80 any skilled player can deal with them if specced correctly. Finally i was already playing burning crusade and had a level 70 character so i figured this would be the logical step to take to continue my enjoyment of the game. I now have 9 characters to 60 or above and one at 40. Reviewing this as a standalone title is just stupid, &quot;Same graphics&quot; well yeh it&apos;s an expansion and sorry to put you down but the graphics engine has changed quite a lot. People complaining about queues are just upset they couldn&apos;t get on to play the game... you obviously want to play it so why throw a tantrum when you can&apos;t. There&apos;s a reason the other games don&apos;t have massive queues, because they don&apos;t have half as many players (Hell even 1/10th) as WoW does. One thing the game doesn&apos;t mention is that you need to have burning crusade to play this game, but i suppose common sense may provail here... hopefully In the end it&apos;s a simple descision wether you buy this game or not. If you have burning crusade, and have a character above level 55 then you should buy this game, you&apos;ll have access to the deathknight and you&apos;ll start with all blue gear when you get to outland. And if you havn&apos;t seen all the outland content then the deathknight is probly the best character to do it with due to gear advantages, a free epic mount, and being pretty overpowered at 60-70. If you don&apos;t like WoW then don&apos;t expect an expansion pack to change your mind, it&apos;s high level content and considering you didn&apos;t like the game to begin with then you&apos;re never gonna see this content anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=421039">Expand</a></span>

The questing and dungeons seemed to be tuned to be way too easy. Some things were improved, 5 mans and raids no longer had an hour&apos;s worth of trash that you had to go through to get to the bosses, they just had a couple of groups of minions you had to quickly kill before you got to the important boss which I liked. I did not like the vehicle fights in this expansion, they had the potential to be really fun but they were tuned to be way too difficult so even if you were pro at playing your class, you would die repeatedly while using a vehicle in a quest or in an instance which was not fun. Naxx was remade to be the entry level raid for this expansion since not many people experienced it in the original Vanilla release (myself included). It was tuned to be very easy and most bosses were loot pinatas with the exception of 1 or 2. It was alright but too easy to be that exciting.
<br>
<br>Ulduar was the next level raid in this expansion, that was a fun instance. The first time my guild and I engaged XT-002 and heard it speak in a whiney teenage voice we all cracked up laughing and completely wiped, that was my favourite part of the whole expansion. I loved how Blizzard takes this mean looking robot and then gives it the voice of a whiney teenager, who came up with that? It was great. The patch which brought out Trial of the grand champion (I think it was called that, I&apos;ll refer to it as Totgc) and the LFD tool (I think it was the same patch, it was around the same time) is where things started to go downhill a bit. Totgc was released a bit too soon when most guilds were still progressing in Ulduar, so it kind of ruined my guilds progression since it had better gear we never bothered to finish Ulduar despite being on the 2nd last boss. Now I think what really started to lead to the demise of WoW was the introduction of the LFD tool and the 5-man heroic dungeons being tuned to be too easy. Tanks who played in Vanilla and the Burning Crusade would start to set up the pull and give CC instructions while the new players who just started playing in Wrath would just yell &quot;gogogogo&quot; and then force you to chain pull the whole instance. But the instance was tuned so easy that you could actually chain pull the whole instance and survive so the heroics just became a zerg fest instead of a place you needed to use skill. Activision purchased Blizzard shortly before this patch so I am not sure if that had anything to do with the game being tuned too easy or not. All I know is that WoW was at its peak of subscribers just berfore this patch was released and it started bleeding subscribers from this patch on.
<br>I figure it was either LFD or the Activision purchase or a combination of both that caused this, those were the only things that changed around that time.
<br>
<br>Ice Crown Citadel was kind of a meh raid instance for me but people seemed to like it alright, probably because the Lich King was such a loved character by the lore fans. Really the game got kind of boring for me after Ulduar was no longer the highest expansion, but I still kept playing, I was still having a decent time raiding with my guild. I&apos;ll give this expansion a 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=2599421">Expand</a></span>

It swallows the membership of the next 3 biggest MMORPG&apos;s for breakfast. The people who play WoW COULD play one of these other games..they dont. There&apos;s a reason for this...have a guess what that might be ... WotLK is a good addition. Many many quest trees (those who criticise the game for grinding only can&apos;t be playing the same game..It&apos;s possible to get 75% or more through every level without Mob grinding at all. I&apos;ve gone from 69 to 74 without a single minute outside of quest lines. The new instances are very good, the GFX are improved (only slightly though). The game is very well balanced. DK&apos;s seem overpowered to begin with, but at level 60+ (when the blues they start with at 55 are beginning to look a bit tired) it begins to level out..and hey ANYONE can become a DK at 55 (one per server) so why bitch ? All in all a superb addition to a game that, like it or not, is soooo far ahead in terms of content and balance that LotR, WAR, Conan etc seem primitive by comparison (yes they have slightly better GFX than WoW - but that&apos;s where thet ends) 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420188">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately the innovative quests are starting to become repetative and, like all MMOs that broaden to this scope and depth, it seems like no one in all the Outlands and Azeroth can help themselves. The questing modle is feeling dated but the team manages to string together quests as they have done before to take you across the continent in an orderly fashion. The graphics are the same but the presentation has been improved. There is a difference but I wonder how much more this engine can be improved upon. In terms of difficulty...it&apos;s not. Since the beginning WoW has been the definition of an MMO set on easy difficulty. The quests tell you where to go. Key figures in each quest are (usually) there. The only thing they didn&apos;t put in is a trail of bread crumbs for you to follow. This has opened the doors to people who didn&apos;t particularly enjoy the less than descriptive questing in other MMOs or the grinding required to get to the next level. It also helps that everyone is here. Once the population has chosen an MMO it is very hard to pull them away. EQ1 was the champion for a long time and WoW came out at the right time to pull them away from an aging model that was transitioning to a sequal. This all adds up to most people will continue to play WotLK even if they don&apos;t particularly enjoy it anymore. While it is still the king I believe WoW is aging. PvP is done better in Warhammer...one aspect of MMOs. PvE-wise...you can&apos;t do better than WotLK for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420511">Expand</a></span>

A lot of the facts are down right incorrect. For example, you can use your flying mount in Northrend, however you must first reach level 77 and spend 1000 gold for the Cold Weather Flying training in Dalaran, but I digress. This is a fantastic addition to the WoW universe. Wrath of the Lich King brings a ton of new features, zones, abilities, monsters, instances, raids, and factions to the table. There is more then enough content to keep even the most die hard player busy for months, especially if they&apos;re the OCD type that feels every faction must be Exalted. The quests are a lot of fun and there have been several new and unique quest types that are actually a lot of fun. The instances and raids are beautiful and a lot of fun to do. Boss mechanics focus on fun and interesting strategies rather than the popular gear check tank and spank that plagued past content. Of course we can&apos;t forget the new Death Knight class, and while there is a huge influx of players rolling this class at the moment this will eventually die down. Their group mechanics are off the wall and fill many different rolls. Blizzard went above and beyond to deliver such an amazing expansion and it&apos;ll only get better with future content patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420128">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s just fun to do them. The 5 mans are beautifully done and fun as well. I&apos;m not in an endgame guild, so I can&apos;t comment on the content in that area, but I&apos;m sure harder content will be available in upcoming content patches.

                                        <span>I played this game for a long time and i all ways loved it! I all ways thought that this game easily deserved a 100/100. Sadly the new expansion &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; did not turn out as well as i thought but all the other ones were good and i can&apos;t wait to see what new expansion comes out next! :D</span>

People say they don&apos;t like the graphics because &quot;they&apos;re too cartoony&quot;. In my own personal opinion, I&apos;m pretty sure that gritty realism is NOT the way to handle the looks of a fantasy mmorpg. Sound: 9 The music is great and fits the mood near perfectly. Dont like it? Turn it off and put on some music of your own. Gameplay: 9 PVE: 9.5 - If there&apos;s anything funner than playing a DK or questing in Northrend in any given MMO, I&apos;d like to hear it. The Northrend quests are fun, and contrary to popular beliefs (read: idiotic reviews) WoW is not, will not be, and never has been all about grinding. Yes, there are kill/collect x of y for ***hole z quests, but those are outweiged by quests themed around things such as large scale battles, aerial combat, bombing the **** out of various locations, and decimating armies of elite troops while riding an enourmous fire/ice breathing dragon. BLOWING. ****. TO. HELL. WITH. A. DRAGON. IS. NOT. THE. SAME. AS. GRINDING. Good, I&apos;m glad that that&apos;s settled. PVP: 7- Gyawd I hate Death Knights. Being a caster, there is nothing that I hate more than going into a battleground only to find that 80% of everyone there is a Dk. Blizzard screwed us over that way. Death Knights: Fun to play, not fun when they start to take over servers. Next subject! Also, stop comparing this to Warhammer online etc. This is not warhammer online. Warhammer is a PVP based game, and WoW is a PVE based game with PVP elements. So please, don&apos;t b**** about the pvp and give it a 0. World of Warcraft has 12 MILLION players for a reason. *Note: my actual rating for this game is a 9, as no game is perfect, but I&apos;m scoring it to make up for one of the many idiots who wrote &quot;Werld uv Worecraft is dum&quot; &quot;The grafiks are stoopid&quot; etc. - 0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=424317">Expand</a></span>

There is absolutely no reason why anyone should feel compelled to play this game all day every day, and if they do, its those people who will be addicted to anything. If you are so bored of your life that you can only find solace in a virtual world, then please by all means avoid this game. World of Warcraft is an amazing game and its an even better experience to share with your friends. Thats why I love this game, I can raid one day, battle in an arena or a battleground on another or just goof around with my friends, and there is no pressure. Relax, and enjoy this great game, make new friends and share some fun adventures with your existing ones, just please stop blaming a game for &quot;ruining your life&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=1401095">Expand</a></span>

This was an expansion pack I waited with great fun too. It was really good to catch up with everyone&apos;s favorite heros&apos; story from Warcraft 3 and 2, Ner&apos;zhul and Arthas. When I started a Death Knight (Former recruits of the Argent Dawn who got raised as the Scourge&apos;s &quot;shock troopers&quot; by the Lich King to serve his needs), I was shocked and not in a negative meaning. The linear and good story, the characters, the phasing and especially, the music was so damn good that I had to play the Scarlet Enclave again. Then I went back to my main character and started leveling. The same could be told here too. Good and linear story, great characters and music. Getting Items felt easier here, though u still needed the time or many gold to do the crafted epics. But it was still hard here. Heroics in the beginning were pretty much hard. But they meant a lot of fun, as did the new Achievement system. Naxxramas and Sartharion were only for really experienced players. This was the time when I was on top in WoW. I had full epic from crafted items and from Sartharion/Naxx. This was my favorite time. Unfortuneatly, It all ended in a damn patch that introduced the finished Argent Colisseum and the new Badge System. This was the Patch that murdered the half of WoW. Unexperienced players with full epics running all around and the only way to know what they MIGHT know was to check their Achievements. This was the time when I was only heroicing, playing on battlegrounds, and doing daily quests because I simply couldn&apos;t stand ToC and also didn&apos;t need anything from there because I got everything else from crafteds and heroics. You got everything from heroics and didn&apos;t even needed to raid! ToC was like standing in one place and killing waves. Great. By Icecrown came out I was barely doing anything beside doing the first daily heroic and getting money because it gave you 2 Emblem of Frost and from those you could get everything you needed to get on the same level as those who actually went to Icecrown Citadel. About the money, this was the only thing that was still challange to get, much little challange, but still a challange. I was saving the money I got for a Traveler&apos;s Tundra Mammoth which was 16000 gold and a Dalaran Signet that cost 6800 gold and the 3 upgrades were 1000 gold (I was exalted with Kirin Tor, which meant 20% discount for repairs and prices). With Miner-farming i got the money for the rings and the mammoth, well, a little trick was needed for the mammoth, but i got them all. It was 22000 gold, but I got it. After this point, I found no other challange, so I started doing 2 alts. A Death Knight and a Paladin. I did some heroic with the DK at lvl 80 but I got bored with it so i leveled the Paladin. It was so overpowered that it was disgusting. I could solo a raid quest with it on lvl 60 and leveling was a laugh, especially when the enemys were undeads. After both alt got their Cold Weather flying skill (1000 gold) and epic mount, I stopped playing this game until Cataclysm. I simply didn&apos;t find joy in playing this game and I was hoping Cataclysm would bring back that. I still checked the World of Warcraft Wiki on what happened to the Lich King and I thought that It was really stupid to butcher two of the most popular character from the original Warcraft trilogy. They had put the adventurers in a far larger role they should have. That moment was really a punch in the stomach for those who played Warcraft 3 or 2. So, it was a long review. To sum up: It was the greatest expansion pack until 3.2.0 patch, which completely destroyed challanges in the game. I&apos;d really like to give it a 10, but I have to consider the part which happened after 3.2.0 so with a kind heart it&apos;s an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=1548008">Expand</a></span>

While the gear was great and the art was impressive, the style was way off and the quests seemed fragmented. WoTLK is the return of the old WoW, but with an impressive upgrade in graphics, art, music, and functionality. The view distances are huge! WoTLK demands a far better hardware spec than the original. Single-player is as rewarding as dungeon/raiding (in terms of scope and content). If you liked WoW before TBC, or if you have a 70 sitting around, you owe it to yourself to renew and buy the expansion. It will not disappoint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Difficulty: While WotLK&apos;s content was quite difficult, it was not remorselessly so like in previous incarnations of the game. It still had room for the raiding elite to show off their swag whilst simultaneously allowing more of the broader audience of the game to access the end-game content they had previously been denied.
<br>
<br>- Plot: Wrath of the Lich King addressed a FANTASTIC villain and story in the form of Arthas Menethil, one of the greatest villains in video gaming history as well as approaching many other, brand-new plot elements such as the Nexus War against the Blue Dragonflight and the secrets of Ulduar.
<br>
<br>-Music: The soundtrack to Wrath of the Lich King managed to capture the perfect balance between epic orchestral scoring and subtle, ambience, something I personally feel has been lost in subsequent expansions.
<br>
<br>-Environments: Wrath of the Lich King introduced Northrend, which had a variety of fantastically emersive environments for us to explore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=4420876">Expand</a></span>

They lowered the difficulty to appeal to more players and also left in a challenging version in PVE for the more experienced and hardcore players. Ulduar is one of the best raids in the entire game and is my personal favorite. It was great to play through back when it was brand new and the top tiered content. The story in this expansion was very linear and didn&apos;t stray from the story like they did in Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria. The focus was the Lich King from the beginning to the end and everything you did in Northrend had something to do with the Lich King and it felt like it all belonged there. The addition of the Death Knight class was also pretty spectacular. Although I am disappointed they never continued on with the line of hero classes, this one was a great addition. Northrend is beautiful and the music score is amazing. The boss fights are all very creative and unique. I hope Warlords of Draenor is more like this and the Burning Crusade than the most recent two expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=4672129">Expand</a></span>

Though I still remember the wonder and freshness of WoW and the level 60 cap that it started with, I think I really spent more time digging into the high level content in Burning Crusade.  There is no denying it: World of Warcraft is the true blueprint to MMORPGs and is why games like The Old Republic and Guild Wars sit in its shadow instead of standing out both as critical and profitable successes.  Wrath of the Lich King actually furthered WoW a bit in the quest department.  Cool cutscene bits were introduced for larger quest story lines and the raid content began to get more varied and unique than the more standard approaches from previous end game content.  The only real problem with Wrath was the inevitable simplification of classes and the nerfs that came along with it.  Blizzard have had a nightmare trying to balance classes, but their answer to balancing was just to slowly strip away or consolidate class skills and advantages, dumbing down some of the mechanics and mastery required to be a great player.  That doesn&apos;t ruin WoW, but it definitely took some of the pride out of PvP matches.  That being said, Wrath definitely serves as a great WoW expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962683">Expand</a></span>

Although raids were vastly improved for the hardcore gamer, they were now more accessible for those who like to play WOW casually, and now it doesn&apos;t take as much to reach a nice position among your guild. This expansion also keeps that hardcore group intact by adding difficult battles and intricate raids that last a long time, and take a lot of effort and strategy to progress, and should you succeed, you will be heavily rewarded. To me that was the biggest feature. I was a raider, and this just made it that much better.

TBC gets first in my book.  WotLK was without a doubt a great expansion.  Had I had the time to be a full-time raider during this game&apos;s prime it might have taken my number 1 vote.</span>

Rightfully so. Though the graphics aren&apos;t great, they still manage to beautifully illustrate the worlds of Azeroth and Outland, and enable a wide range of PCs and Macs to operate the game smoothly. The game play is straightforward and full of funny little parodies of the real world, and professions are fun ways to explore the world make a little extra money. The game may have lost its difficulty over the years, but there is always a place where the hardcore player can enjoy themselves. The music and lore is of very high quality as well.

They have they&apos;re starting zone and then Boom! Your in the faction. I feel that Death Knights should have been somewhat different. Northerend was quit a nice area though. I enjoyed the music and the scenery. The new dungeons were pretty weak in my opinion.</span>

Theres no reason for you to even think about this if you havent played it yet, so yeah. I&apos;m giving it an 9 because its very easy. I enjoy the fact that I havent replaced more than 4 of my items from The Burning Crusade (Yay!), but of course, thats at the expense of not getting anything new...and not upgrading. Course, not everyone&apos;s path is going to go like this. In my opinion, none of the zones have felt alike, making this game not very repetitive, I enjoy the return to azeroth, and the lore here is much better than that of The Burning Jokesade (haha). Far too easy(79 from 70 in less than a month), loads of fun. If you play, you must buy. If you dont..Its an expansion people. Why would you buy it anyway? Free trials be there for a reason~!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420276">Expand</a></span>

It was the expansion that began to chip away the magic and wonder of a game that I had previously loved. I didn&apos;t hate WOTLK - there were many things I really liked about it. However, many of the added races such as the Vrykul, Tuskarr, Taunka and Gorloc and Wolvar ranged from superfluous (like the Taunka) to out of place (the Vrykul) to ridiculous (the Tuskarr, the Gorloc and the Wolvar). The ridiculous races gave the game a puerile quality that eroded the dark tone that WOTLK was trying to set by introducing slapstick, childish humour with these new races. This created a sense of dissonance with the feelings of impending doom caused by the return of the Lich King and the accompanying scourge threat to the world. There were also zones in Northrend that seemed redundant (ie: Borean Tundra is the same zone level as Howling Fjord) and there was too much overlap in terms of zone levels, so players didn&apos;t get to experience Northrend in its entirety because they often had to choose between zones, whereas Burning Crusade had a more balanced approach in this way. Other zones such as Crystalsong Forest seemed to have little to no function or relevance at all except for housing the city of Dalaran. I also want to say that I wasn&apos;t fond of how they handled the Death Knight class, which are GOOD, but they&apos;re not great and are still seen as a bit of a joke among the core classes because they&apos;re somewhat redundant - they&apos;re not the best tank (unless the player is really skilled - and many I&apos;ve played with too many who aren&apos;t), their DPS is sketchy (again, it depends on if they player really knows this class inside out, as DKs seem to be less forgiving of mediocrity than other classes) and they really haven&apos;t found a useful place among the base classes. I think they would have been more functional as a hybrid class (tank/DPS/heals), and they could have done something interesting with them as a healer, using weird demonic spells to heal (because lore-wise, I think makes sense that healers would have been converted to DKs). Among things I liked: Achievements, the expanded lore of the DKs and the fall of Arthas, the coupe attempt against the Undercity, the beautifully crafted city of Dalaran and easter eggs like Higher Learning that encouraged players to explore and rewarded them with pets, mounts or titles. I really loved that Blizzard brought back titles, something they seemed to briefly touch upon and abandoned without explanation in Vanilla WoW, as well as the addition of the Inscription profession, which felt far less painful than Jewelcrafting, a profession introduced in BC that I still hate with a passion for reasons I can&apos;t explain. I loved the addition of Wintergrasp and the use of siege vehicles. The introduction of BoA gear was an idea I was somewhat warm to at first, but as the game has progressed, BoAs have proven to be a scourge in low-level PvP BGs/zones. BoAs give players without it an unfair disadvantage and I feel it&apos;s broken the lower-level PvP aspect of the game as they&apos;ve added BoAs in subsequent expansions. Though I don&apos;t hate WOTLK, I didn&apos;t like the precedent it set for later expansions with ridiculous races, a redundant new class, overlapping zone levels that prevented the player from fully experiencing the new content and the introduction of BoAs that later resulted in a broken low-level PvP experience for new players (or players who didn&apos;t feel like grinding). WOTLK did a LOT of things right and they did them well. Though the mistakes they made in this expansion didn&apos;t break the game for me, it started to show cracks that subsequent expansions shattered, irrevocably changing a fantastic game into a mediocre experience that I no longer enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=2657902">Expand</a></span>

After your boss is gone, kicking ass becomes really hard and you feel like one moment you are hero, next avg slub joe. Being a death knight and working for the litch king was very cool, but basically ending it as your boss is gone and now your unemployment, really? We play these games to escape the current events. Is the lich king secretly a GM exec? Not really worth $80 (wife&apos;s account and mine), $20 sure.

I have had fun during this experience. This game has been addicting, though, more than anything else. But, after getting a warlock into upper 60s and an over-powered death knight to the mid 60s, I&apos;m saying enough. I&apos;ve realized that through the modest amount of gaming I have done, I have never had as unsatisfying of a gaming experience as WoW. Other types of games reward you when you personally gain skill; it is satisfying to use that skill to defeat the computer or human opponent. With WoW, you only become better by playing more because you rank up and getting better gear. So there is the constant desire and EXPECTATION of killing monsters and completing quests to level and gear up. Because this is an expectation, you never truly enjoy it, you are always thinking about the next level or piece of equipment. With other games, I can sit down for half an hour or an hour and be satisfied by my exercise of skill and the result of such and walk a way and not have a need to play for a few days. With WoW, I&apos;ve spent a couple hours here, a couple there, trying to find this same feeling. I thought I was having fun, but never had the sense of enjoyment or accomplishment like other games. Again, this is because you don&apos;t get better at the game, you just spend time to make your character better, and you don&apos;t gain satisfaction from doing so, rather you only expect your character to get better because of your time commitment. Overall, I feel like I had fun with WoW, but understand that I fell victim to Blizzard&apos;s design. I&apos;m fortunate to only have spent a couple of months sucked in when others have spent years. It was a good lesson to learn, but one that I hope not many more people will not waste too much time finding out for themselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=738989">Expand</a></span>

Even more so now, when there are EQ2, Vanguard:SOH, AOC, WAoR, LOTR. The &quot;King&quot; may be an excellent addition to WoW in its own right, but by the MMORPG standards of today the game itself waggles behind other titles in all aspects, most importantly it lacks non-grinding and non-repetitive gameplay. And I don&apos;t even mention the outdated graphics, which would shock anyone more or less acquainted with modern MMORPGs or off-line PC titles. It is only the never ending media hype that keeps this title running. So only a 3 from me. Please forgive me diehard WoW fans, but this game is really past its time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=420080">Expand</a></span>

There is alot of bad video&apos;s about it and the game just gets super boring after a few months... Come on, xcom or a old pixel game is better than wow. Wow also has way to many players Over 7million.</span>

I had high hopes for Wotlk, but it never materialised. Leveling in Northrand was boring as it was repetitve, the character changes we&apos;re quite outlandish and had too many things wrong about them, finally when you reach 80 - it was EASY, i meean extremely easy, you could complete Naxxramas in leveling gear , and do it in 3 hours. the Music was teribly composed, giving the game a cheesy ambiance. once you had completed evetything, you were stuck with this mundane content for months. Blizzards intention was to make it easier, so they didnt spend time developing worthwile hard content. They made the game extremely casual and hard for any Vanilla or TBC raider to enjoy. i have no delusions of nostalgia when it comes to WOW, overall it was an amazing experiance, but WOTLK caused that expirance to end abruptly. 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=738608">Expand</a></span>

Yet again another grind to a higher lvl and then what? Raiding? From what i&apos;ve heard the raiding isn&apos;t that great. At all. And yet again the xpac is very expensive. Just don&apos;t bother imo.</span>

I used to be a die-hard WoW addicted, just like in 99 I was a diehard everquest addict, now I am a WAR addict and if you want to get your mmorphg fix go for war, your not going to impressed when this launches as anyone like me in beta can tell you. hope all that time spending on raiding for gear pays off when the first green you get at 71 is better than your uber epic.

One of my old end game raid guildies messaged me and showed me how excited he was, he was level 80, had all these epics, was talking about how fun it was to get gear, ect . . . and I could think about was man I already went through this before. I have fully a full epic rogue in pvp and pve and a decently geard warlock and I was thinking whats the point in working for this all over again. I really busted my butt leveling my guys and getting them all kinds of cool stuff. I mean it was fun then, but no I just can&apos;t go through all that hard work all over again. I mean raiding and pvp was fun when it was new but I have done that stuff to death and am sick of it. It&apos;s just going to be the same process work work work get something work work work get something else. If you have never played wow I would say you will really enjoy this game, but if you have played this before and did all the end game raiding and pvp I say forget it.

                                        <span>Since the original release, World of Warcraft has been an enjoyable game. Since Wrath of the Lich King, this game has been under management of Activision, and it has been showing it. The game is becoming more and more simplistic and boring. Activision is milking World of Warcraft for all it can as it slowly dies.</span>

However it becomes monotonous after awhile. I jumped on about two months after BC came out. I found the lore of WoW on the whole to be amazing. I love the backstory, and some of of the arcs in game as well. It took me about two months to level my toon to 70, which was fine with me because I had fun doing it, and felt a sense of accomplishment when I reached that level. I found a marginally decent guild to raid with, and got some decent gear and was pretty strong I thought. I DID have fun for awhile. But you will soon realize that the fun disappears with the high end content (which is really what the game is all about). It starts to feel like more like a job than a game. Endless hours spent collecting items to level up one of your professions. And if you don&apos;t gather things yourself (because you want to spend more time on the &quot;fun&quot; stuff, the items are ridiculously priced on the auction house because it took that person hours of their own time to collect, which is why they want the exorbant fees they charge). If you don&apos;t have gold in the game you can go absolutely nowhere. You have to pay for repairs, and &quot;battle buffs&quot; aka flasks, elixirs etc., and if you&apos;re really lucky the occasional epic piece of gear that can actually be sold on the AH. So you&apos;re stuck with the montony of gathering, crafting to make money whether you like it or not. The game is also way too dependant on you finding a group of people (Guild) who&apos;s schedules and personalities seemingly align perfectly with your own. Good luck on that one. Because if you don&apos;t find a great guild, you&apos;re screwed. Completely. All the high end content is more or less raiding. And if you don&apos;t have a guild, you&apos;re not raiding. Pick up groups are a joke. Not to mention they don&apos;t have rules on who is next in line to finally recieve that awesome piece of gear you&apos;ve been waiting weeks, or even months to acquire. It&apos;s just random with them. So I say again, if you don&apos;t find that perfect guild you&apos;re screwed. You won&apos;t get to experience the raids like they should be done. Not too mention, even if you do get a great guild, you can only do each seperate raid only ONCE a week. So even then you still have to sink a very huge chunk of time being a part of the guild to earn respect and senority. So you&apos;re able to get ahold of the gear that drops from raids before the newer, or &quot;less able members&quot; (read: people who can&apos;t devote their life to the game) of the guild. You have to consider that the raids need 10 people for the normal ones, and 25 for the heroic modes. 25 ! Twenty-five people to take on the hardest mode, and thus get the strongest gear. Assume that there are only three members who are the same class and spec as you&apos;re own. You then have to compete against them for the gear you want (assuming it even drops !). You could potentially lose out to getting new gear 2 weeks in a row ! Nothing, notta, zilch, to show for those 2 weeks of your time in the game. And of course I&apos;m being modest with the 2 or 3 people with your same spec. It&apos;s usually 4-5. Unless you&apos;re lucky enough to stumble into a guild who doesen&apos;t have any of your chosen class (which is HIGHLY unlikely because Blizzard makes it almost essential to have at least 1 of every class to go on raids). Wrath of the Lich King is just more of the same that BC offered. Of course it made all the months I spent acquiring gear moot. And they also added a &quot;fun&quot; new twist that they were careful to leave out in Classic and BC; powerleveling. This just makes it ridiculously easy for people to level up new toons. You can literally do it in a few days if you wanted to. Just have a high level buddy run you through some dungeons 10-20 times. That made my sense of pride at reaching the top level disappear in an instant, because now any jackass can do it in a weekend. More raids were added, but they&apos;re still the same as before, just with a different skin on it. You&apos;ll spend MONTHS to get a full set of tiered gear. And by the time you finally do get that set, you think &quot;Hey, finally, I&apos;m powerful and have achieved something&quot;; you are painfully smacked off you&apos;re pedestal by the mighty hand of Blizzard with newer raids that make you&apos;re gear obsolete. It&apos;s just too much of a time sink to actually achieve things in the game. And when you finally do, all of your time spent is made moot by the newest content. It&apos;s done over and over. I had fun for awhile, I did. But I&apos;m done this time. I&apos;ve quit and come back before, but this time I really am done. I will no longer sink months, or years of my life into a game that does nothing but rehash the same formula. So in conclusion, go ahead and pick up the game if you don&apos;t have alot of other things going on in your life. Because that&apos;s the only way you will really get anywhere. You can have fun for awhile, moreso if you&apos;re new to the game, but you WILL become tired of the constant screwovers by Blizzard. If I were you though, I&apos;d heed my advice and just skip the game and try one of the newer MMOs out there (as I&apos;m about to do), and hope they don&apos;t copy the same messed up formula that is WoW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=84924">Expand</a></span>

Another expansion to further ruin an originally good game. WotLK is another effort by Blizzard at pilfering BILLIONS of dollars from addicted users. Epic gear for the casual players, daily quests for the gold farmers, and another forced expansion for anyone who wants to compete. All that time and hard WORK and I do mean WORK was again for nothing as the expansion makes everything you can do in the game worthless and forces you to expand. I can&apos;t believe I WASTED 3 years playing this franchise and I think I&apos;m gonna have to boycott Blizzard games forever. It used to be the only people wearing EPIC gear were the hard-core players, but low and behold Blizzard realized that they can make 100&apos;s of millions of more dollars by offering these so-called &quot;EPICS&quot; to everyone for little effort and time. It&apos;s a sad, sad day for me to finally say goodbye to all my fellow gamers that I played WoW with. The hours and money I had invested in the game over 3 years could&apos;ve been spent getting a better education or maybe a more active social life. If you are considering starting a WoW account I highly recommend you don&apos;t. If you are considering getting the WotLK expansion I&apos;d advise you to reconsider and play other games. 40 dollars for the expansion and you don&apos;t get 30 days of free play, as if Blizzard needs the money. It&apos;s rape people plain and simple. Blizzard is the Crack dealer and you are the crackhead.

A few petty adjustments and addons does not compensate for its lack of real gameplay. I seriously hope that Diablo 3 is nothing like WoW. Thanks for trying Blizzard.</span>

I do have to admit that the overpower shammy is getting more powerful with the new bump spell. You cant even ride your 50 dollar flying mount in the new zone.</span>

What more to say? This game takes your life, you become a nerd, you loose real-life friends the higher level you reach. Deathknights are overpowered and forces you to buy from burning crusade to wrath of lichking because you will still meet deathknights that will defeat you in no time even you&apos;re 5-10 levels higher than yourself. I highly recommend you not to buy it if you don&apos;t want to end like a nerd and should start using glasses because you will begin start staring at your monitor that shows your world of warcraft. When you finally know that you can take all cloths off except underwear, you want to create a female character with a random name and you will take her cloths off until you see this *cough* neat woman with her bikini. You want to stare at her in hours and your eyes gets broken and can&apos;t read at 10 foot distance because of your monitor leeches your sharpeness in your eyes. Therefore, this deserves a bloody zero and alot of thumbs down as it already stole 10-16 million peoples lifes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=419955">Expand</a></span>

As mentioned before the expansion, they stated there would be flying combat mounts in Winter Grasp, new dances, guild battlegrounds, guild housing, and many of the other illusions that could have been converted into actual content. Please, and be rational of what you&apos;re saying Blizzard. Although there are a few positives to this expansion, but as little as a rating of 2 must do. Although, with the previous 3.3 patch, questing and dungeons have made a slight smile to the fan base due to simple, reliable, interfaces implemented. Yet in comparison, they are speckles of paint versus a concrete wall. Of course you&apos;ll understand that some day. Again, I hope all the best content goes into Cataclysm as hopefully they&apos;ve learned these lessons. But I would rather have them contemplate rather than take a GLANCE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=741587">Expand</a></span>

Took only a few days to reach max level.  While leveling up the &quot;normal&quot; difficulties of instances already felt like pure waste of time and the &quot;heroic&quot; versions were very easy to finish first time playing them soon becoming absolutely obsolete. Gold had no value anymore. Any player not beeing fully equipped with epic items after like one week at max level got called noob. The complete gameplay changed to repeating boring quests in boring instances on daily base to collect for pointless item updates. Well and once you were half finished collecting your items blizzard just released a new content patch with new items, nerfed old icontent and made all your past &quot;efforts&quot; regarding items and achievements wortless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=2084659">Expand</a></span>
