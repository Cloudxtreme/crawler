<br>
<br>Alot of jumping, some occasionaly rocks to push around which are bizarely difficult to stand on. And creatures just vanish into the ground.
<br>
<br>The sound design is really quite great, and it looks pretty. But everything else (particularly the awful cutscenes) is unpolished and sub par.

The platforming gameplay is ok. A game to try, but not pay full price.</span>

It&apos;s a five-hour-long platformer with beige mountains and valleys as scenery. The &quot;puzzles&quot; are nothing more than placing a glowing green rock in a glowing green hole followed by a lot of jogging, or simply more platforming. Honestly, the game would&apos;ve been better if it was a condensed version that focused more on the story, rather than the endless miles of jogging and jumping. It has the contents to make a good thirty-minute game, but it was dragged out, made long and boring. Also, expect the data logs and entries, along with whatever scientific samples you collect, to be wiped whenever you quit the game. Not that they matter, really.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4291950">Expand</a></span>

Before it gets filtered out and becomes a typical game. I don&#x2019;t know i had a personal attachment to this game and i was really sad when it ended. I give a two thumbs up.

<br>Unfortunately the best of the game is in those first few chapters. The mystery and atmosphere that is built up is lost very quickly some 30 minutes or so in. The story line is just not strong enough to carry this game when there is very little danger or jeopardy in the environment. Despite the feeling and sense of large open spaces and as moody and atmospheric our Lifeless Planet is, there is no great joy or reward in exploring it beyond the obvious path.
<br>As a gentle diversion this game just about hangs together. Some of the platforming elements are fun(ish) as are one or two of the &quot;puzzles&quot;, there are also dotted around the game just enough &quot;oooh&quot; moments to bring you back to play again. The music, when it is there,is the real star of the show.
<br>What stops this being a VERY low score is that this is the work of a single Dev, and that at the core of Lifeless Planet is a kernel of a really great game.
<br>Is it worth the money? No not right now, but if you get a chance to pick it up for half price later on then might be worth a little look see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267138">Expand</a></span>

And, at first it seems to be doing that job admirably with beautiful landscapes and an interesting movement mechanic as well as a wonderful atmosphere (pun not intended).  However, the further the game goes, the more pretentious it becomes, and previous cracks start to become great chasms.
<br>
<br>First, let&apos;s get the praise out of the way.  The world and the situation that the main character finds himself in is fascinating and for quite some time I felt myself being driven forward.  The landscapes are truly impressive and the architecture is interesting, if far from complex.  The first time I used the advanced jetpack mechanic I felt real exhilaration and the native life is simple, but elegantly intimidating at moments.  The sound design, while hardly perfect, creates wonderfully tense and gripping moments, to the point that at one moment I actually wound up with chills down my spine for around twenty minutes straight.
<br>
<br>However, the game suffers rather badly from reaching beyond its budget.  First of all, throughout the game the main character has a voice actor droning his running narration.  For the most part he does the job, but whenever he&apos;s called on to be emotional he makes Commander Shepard look like Othello.  The worst is when you get his backstory via snippets of an interview and he talks about his dead wife the same way someone would debate philosophy with a colleague.  Additionally, there&apos;s a character who is basically running around in gym clothes, and while she&apos;s effective whenever she has some distance from the main character, they kept doing close-ups of her and the model is unimpressive to say the least.  The funny part is that they seemed to be accidentally doing things which would have fixed the situation, providing journal entries for the main character&apos;s commentary and having clever instances where the woman I mentioned was barely silhouetted in the distance, which was more in keeping with the budget they seemed to be on.  More in theme too.  I think just giving the game instances of smoke and mirrors would have gone a long way towards helping it along.  Also, while early on the game is content to let the sound be soft and rise only when appropriate, later on it gets annoying and headache inducing.  There are some token puzzles, but usually it&apos;s just a matter of &quot;Find key, put in hole.&quot;
<br>
<br>Yet I still feel like being charitable to the game, relatively speaking.  The story, as I said, is interesting, though I&apos;m loathe to give spoilers, and the atmosphere in the early game is very gripping.  And as I said, it has a neat twist on typical sci-fi tropes in its plot, but it seems to cram them all in a little tightly, which might be a large part of its issue.  Weirdly for a bad/lesser game, this one goes by too quickly rather than too slowly--if it had just breathed and paced itself better, perhaps it would have been better off.  This strikes me as a game which makes a lot of rookie mistakes and reaches too far too early.  The worlds are too large and the ambitions too high for what the dev team was able to do.  Personally, I think with a little help it would have been wonderful, a bit more smoke and mirrors to make up for its shortcomings.  Use camera angles to hide the model, have the figure only appear briefly.  Ease off on the sound.  And forget voice acting, just let us go in a quiet, lonely adventure.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a decent, respectable game which is worth looking into if you catch it on sale for around 10 dollars, if only for its uniqueness value, but it&apos;s definitely not something which I would personally come back to.  Maybe if I wanted to show a game dev friend an example of how not to do things, I might rack up some hours on it, because that seems to be its one true calling: an Icarus flight to demonstrate where to fly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5358399">Expand</a></span>

Whereas Ico and Lara were pretty linear, Lifeless Planet isn&apos;t. Well, yes it is in (in places), then it isn&apos;t (in places). Therein lies the problem, early in the game you traverse through a forest , I got lost! I had to resort to a guide to find out that there was a rock I could jump over. It wasn&apos;t an obvious track to take, previous routes were subtlety marked.  Similarly, a volcano level got me baffled (and burnt). Then there are platforming segments that made me throw my controller down in frustration almost as much as I did with Pandemonium.
<br>Despite these gripes, the game has a lot of charm and I don&apos;t mind saying that I came back for more. There&apos;s a story there too. By the end of the game I was intrigued to see the outcome - were I on another planet, were on I a past/future Earth or were I in purgatory?
<br>Well done Stage 2 Studios for a lovely game.

As it is in fact a book not a game I will review it as such.  It&apos;s still bad. The ending is bad.  So bad I&apos;m going to make up my own that is better.  You&apos;re character never explored the planet at all the whole thing is a hallucination caused by oxygen deprivation when the ship crashed and then you die.  See.  That&apos;s a better ending than the crap you get.   Early on it hooked me with its strangeness and uniqueness.  It didn&apos;t live up to that.  As far as I can tell there is no point to this game, sorry, book at all.  You land on a planet.  You do some stuff, and suddenly SOVIETS!  Then you go on an epic hike across its dead surface following a green trail that takes you past pretty much every obstacle.  Weird **** and contradictory story elements via read text translated from Russian voice over and then you go home after your only companion kinda sorta sacrifices herself and sorta kinda fixes the planet.  The whole experience was a waste of my time.  Glad I got this on a humble bundle with some actually entertaining games as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4423629">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting stood out as being particularly good for a low budget/indy game. Some complain that the environment isn&apos;t beautiful enough, but it&apos;s supposed to be a wasteland, not a tropical paradise, and I feel like it fits the bill really well.
<br>
<br>The only reason I don&apos;t give it a 10 is because there are some glitches. Got stuck in a rock once or twice, killed by an enemy I was no longer standing on once, and a couple times the arm refused to activate until I restarted the game. Nothing huge, but still kinda annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4263214">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My friend picked this game up, and asked me if I was interested to play it to have a laugh. I booted up the game, and began playing. At first sight, this game really intrigued me. The reason for that was that I thought this game to be some sort of open world exploration RPG type of deal. Never had I been so sorely dissapointed. The first locale you step into is a desolate, deserted and barren wasteland. You must navigate it and &apos;manage&apos; your oxygen before it runs out. You are locked into one path you can follow, because of the oxygen limitation, which conveniently dissapears and reappears later in the game.
<br>
<br>I will not spoil anything, but the next location was also quite interesting, with a bunch of minerals to collect, represented by tiny light-orbs. I thought that it would be wise to collect them, so that I could perhaps craft them into something or use them in some other way. Turns out I can&apos;t. These minerals are scatterd around for absolutely zero reason. But I wasn&apos;t aware of that yet.
<br>
<br>I arrive in the third locale. At this point, I&apos;ve been playing for a good 2 hours, scouring every inch of the absolutely monotonous and linear path. And this is where I start realising what I&apos;m playing, and am left wondering why I&apos;m playing it. But in a few minutes I finally get a tiny cutscene, serving as an introduction to some semblance of a story. So I pursue it, and end up forcing myself into another hour of this nonsense. After that, I tell my friend that I will be sick if I don&apos;t stop playing this game and propose to stop this torture. He gladly agrees, and we quit and delete the game entirely.
<br>
<br>To sum this probably unnecessary story up: don&apos;t buy this game. I had high hopes that something exciting was about to happen for the first 2 hours, but nothing did. I hoped that this game would bring something new to the table, but it turned out to be a simple, extremely linear platformer, with dull locations, a shoddy story, zero gameplay, and 2-3 pseudo-puzzles, which wouldn&apos;t even be a challenge for a 3-year-old. All you do is jump from one rock to another, and literally nothing else. I don&apos;t know if the game has anything to offer beyond the point where I stopped playing, but that would still not make it deserving of your money. If a game makes you suffer through the first 3 hours (at least), it&apos;s not a good game.
<br>
<br>All in all, the dev gets points for effort, since he&apos;s a one man team as far as I know, but the game itself is poor to say the least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4365327">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay&apos;s basically a jump and run with some random puzzle elements and a bit of &quot;jetpack&quot; (which is actually just double- and triple-jumping) mixed in- but you don&apos;t and you shouldn&apos;t care about that because the gameplay&apos;s quite obviously a cheap excuse right here. It gives nothing of substance to you, this was clear to me within two minutes of playing the &quot;game&quot;, it&apos;s just a vehicle to move the plot along.
<br>
<br>But this is the other big failing of this game, the plot that&apos;s should be good enough to excuse the blatantly inadequate gameplay falls just as flat. The plot starts out with you crashed on this Mars-like planet supposedly 15 light-years away from earth, arriving after 15 years of light speed travel with you and your crew in cryo tubes. Suprise suprise, it was actually supposed to be a lush green paradise but now it&apos;s a dead rock with no breathable atmosphere. Your crew dies in short order and you find the remains of a Soviet Russian outpost- they apparently managed to get there via some one-way portal Stargate ring they found on earth.
<br>
<br>They started experimenting with this green moss-like substance that was on the planet -dubbed Green Fire- and also found lots of ancient structures and powerplants left behind by ancient aliens, just like the portal itself.  One more suprise, Soviet science goes too far, the plants themselves start rebelling and kill the **** out of the entire colony. In an effort to stop their inevitable demise the Soviets go full Mengele and crossbreed a young woman with the Green Fire until the very touch of her feet on the barren ground makes the moss spring into being around her. They also find a portal that leads back to Earth, however some time dilation effect makes it so the path back would catapult them into the far future, centuries ahead, so they don&apos;t take it and by the time they&apos;re desperate enough to take it the very ancient alien structures have turned against them and telefrag them as they try to use it.
<br>
<br>SO, everyone&apos;s dead, that was years ago. You arrive, see the singular survivor, the Plant Girl, and chase her around the planet, solving rock pushing puzzles along the way. You also have a few really damn disjointed hallucinations for blatantly no reason, learn a bit about the astronauts backstory that involves his wife having a hiking accident, falling into a coma and being put on life support indefinately, mixed with some vague implications that the Plant Girl is a stand-in? A surrogate for his wife or something like that? It&apos;s all vague and goes unexplained. At some point the plant mosters you have to dodge all the time absorb the Plant Girl into themselves and she seems perfectly fine with that, for some reason or another. maybe being alone on the planet for decades on end eroded her sanity.
<br>Two hours later or so you find the time warp return trip portal rings, jump through them, see a futuristic city on what is presumably Earth.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the flattest story I&apos;ve seen since forever. It starts mostly in medias res, then you dig up the prerequisite backstory that should have been clear from the start, then you do a lot of stuff that amounts to basically nothing and go back to where you started. The plot and story that should have been the erecting pillar for this game is pathetic and I&apos;ve seen better stories told in three pages of manga. Whoever paid for this turd on Kickstarter got scammed like few people before; I&apos;m glad I pirated this game to get myself a first impression.
<br>
<br>Not recommended, especially not for twenty bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4258550">Expand</a></span>

You crash on an alien planet, there are mysterious things going on, explore and find out what happened. Sounds like the plot of a good sci-fi/horror movie. You soon discover that Russians had been on that planet a long time ago. Cartoon Russians apparently, because on the majority of their logs that you discover, they go on about how amazing the Motherland is and how glorious Communism is and how butthurt they are because a long time ago Americans landed on the moon first, so they are &quot;getting back at them&quot; this way... Really? That&apos;s Red Alert 3 levels of silly right there, and Red Alert 3 was a comedy. Yeah... Doesn&apos;t bode well for the story. Unfortunately, I did not finish the game so I can tell you where it all leads to, because the game is just insanely buggy. I fell through the world geometry 4 times in 2 hours, and had to reload and replay the entire areas, which are pretty big. One elevator caused my character model to freak out and become weirdly &quot;magnetized&quot;, moving through the air even though I was standing still. On another elevator at the power plant level I fell through its floor while it was going up, every single time. I only managed to not fall by spamming the jump button while riding it. Also, while the game is very heavy on platforming, the physics and controls are extremely shaky. While running on some surfaces in order to make a long jump, your character suddenly, out of the blue, decides to slow down a bit, which causes you to miss the jump. I cannot express how frustrating this is, especially when the jump you miss is the 4th or 5th in a row and you have to restart the whole thing. At some point I decided that I shouldn&apos;t be playing a game that&apos;s broken and frustrating, when I could be playing a game that isn&apos;t. I think this game was made by one guy, but I really don&apos;t care. If you ask for 20$ for a game, you&apos;d better at least make sure it&apos;s polished and that the player doesn&apos;t fall through everything. It&apos;s impossible to recommend this game at its current state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4270112">Expand</a></span>

Avoid and grab on a sale for 3 bucks or so if you into that sort of thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4266824">Expand</a></span>

This game is horrible. from the models to the textures to the animations to the plot. Also the gameplay is a pile of sh*t since all you do for hours is to follow footprints and do few jumps, there is kinda nothing to explore because the maps are so flat... Anyway always remember this rule: if it has been made in unity and has been funded on kickstarter, DO NOT BUY THAT GAME.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4266469">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoyed the voice acting and the landscape was really well done. Although the engines graphics wasn&apos;t &quot;realistic&quot; I found that despite this fact the game was gorgeous and atmospheric. There were times where there was no ambient music which damaged the score also.
<br>
<br>The game handled well the controls were very responsive, sometimes almost too responsive. The story ends a little vague but I felt like I was on a good journey with some story. Worth the money and the time.

<br>The graphics are &quot;mediocre&quot; for a indie game (there are a lot of stunning indie games, this is not one of these)

<br>The audio is OK but not great
<br>The gameplay does not exist &apos;-&apos;
<br>
<br>This game should be called &quot;Jumping and walking like an idiot on the Planet&quot;
<br>
<br>You will walk a lot and jump a lot.. That&apos;s it! Nothing more! Except for the countless times you&apos;ll die because you&apos;ll be stuck on rocks and the HORRIBLE performance drops (seriously, on my HIGH END ENTHUSIAST machine, this game runs at 25 average fps when there are any objects, walls, anything nearby).

Exploring the unknown. The graphics are really good as well as the sound. The gameplay is fine (could be a bit smoother in some cases but nothing serious) and it&apos;s as &quot;repetitive&quot; as every other game.

The strongest points of Lifeless Planet for me were a) atmospheric b) exploration, and c) creative environment and visuals. I loved the feeling of exploring this world and uncovering the story. It was better than I was expecting based on some of the reviews here. I&apos;m a player who likes taking my time playing the game, enjoying the little details - and there&apos;s a lot of nice touches in this game. Atmospheric is the word that keeps popping into my head - I felt like an explorer and I can tell that alot of love and care went into the game. None of the puzzles are very complicated, but for me that was OK. This game wasn&apos;t about the puzzles - it was about exploring and the wonder of experiencing this strange world. There were many places where I just climbed to a certain vantage point to survey the view. It&apos;s a beautiful game. Also - I wanted to mention the music is well done - and responsive to events in the story. There were several places where it felt like the music was playing to urge me forward - like in a movie. One thing of note: There is a lot of walking and open space - there are some huge areas - but this serves a purpose of creating scale if you take time to breath it all in. I try to imagine the game in a smaller world and I think the effect would not be as strong. This is a super-size world - somewhat reminds me of a game called Kairo.
<br>
<br>Now there were some negatives - sometimes the jumping puzzles were a bit much sometimes ideas were stretched out a bit too long - but the pace was overall good.  The progression of the world had a nice pace so there were interesting things to draw you forward. The controls were a bit frustrating, especially when precise landing on jumps is required in tight places, but not gamebreaking in any way - just a bit fiddly.
<br>
<br>But bottom line: THIS IS A QUALITY GAME. I don&apos;t give many 8s and this game deserves all of it. I got frustrated at one point w/ the jumps in the middle, but I found once I got past that toward the latter half of the game I enjoyed it quite a bit and found that it finished strong (unlike some others have said). don&apos;t let the negatives overshadow all the coolness here - this is an atmospheric game that pulled me into the world and encouraged me to actively explore it. If this type of game interests you, give it a shot. I&apos;m glad I played it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4492596">Expand</a></span>

The story is I guess not bad, but I&apos;m having an issue with how cliche it is. Okay, you based the story line around evil Russians, that&apos;s cool. But then at least have a decency to make the protagonist Russian cosmonaut, or someone of unspecified nation. I mean, what was even the purpose of this dude in this mission? If it wasn&apos;t for that, I&apos;d maybe give the game a 7. Overall, I did complete it and had reasonable fun, but I was sort of glad it isn&apos;t that long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5465018">Expand</a></span>

<br>awesome exploration
<br>Lifeless Planet is a platforming game where you play as an astronaut who&#x2019;s crew crash lands on a planet that was once inhabited by the soviet union
<br>when you wake up you see that your crew is gone and you have no idea how long you were out for...
<br>you set out to find them and along your journey you discovery other mysteries to be solved..
<br>You&#x2019;ll find data and audio logs that explain what happened on this planet and why it&#x2019;s no longer crawling with life...
<br>The game is a constant 6 hours search for answers, and while this planet is lifeless.. it still manages to be just varied enough to stop it from feeling repetitive&#x2026;
<br>Though not varied enough to blow you away or keep you immersed for the entire 6 hours&#x2026;
<br>as the scenery doesn&#x2019;t really change all too much&#x2026;
<br>The gameplay itself is straight up platforming and throwing switches to continue on your path to get home&#x2026;
<br>you hop gaps with your oxygen tank which can definitely take some getting used to as it feels just a little too floaty to ever feel satisfying&#x2026;
<br>And the level design doesn&#x2019;t quite do the greatest job at keeping the player moving forward as there are rarely visual clues to give you an idea of what to do, occasionally halting momentum&#x2026;
<br>I found myself scratching my head probably once every 30 minutes not knowing where I was supposed to be going&#x2026;
<br>the game also does some weird things towards the end with geysers that don&#x2019;t really work, but I do appreciate their attempt at throwing something new into the game&#x2026;
<br>The gameplay in Lifeless Planet definitely isn&#x2019;t great, it&#x2019;s passable...
<br>But the greatness is in the mystery and exploration of this planet&#x2026;
<br>I give lifeless planet a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lifeless-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=6566678">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are too few and too easy, but the game was still enjoyable.  The controls were just a little wonky, probably better than the average indie game, with some room for improvement.  I would play a sequel if one is ever released.</span>

Found it to be quite immersive, albeit a bit long. Occasional challenges with the controls, but not nearly as bad as some have made it seem. I found the sense of isolation to be unusually strong for a video game. A good thing, I think, in this case.</span>

Sam pocz&#x105;tek gry i stopniowo budowane napi&#x119;cie zas&#x142;uguj&#x105; na plus, jednak w p&#xF3;&#x17A;niejszych etapach wyra&#x17A;nie wieje nud&#x105;, na co g&#x142;&#xF3;wnie maj&#x105; wp&#x142;yw powielaj&#x105;ce si&#x119; elementy zr&#x119;czno&#x15B;ciowe. W grze u&#x15B;wiadczymy r&#xF3;wnie&#x17C; kilka &#x142;amig&#x142;&#xF3;wek, s&#x105; one jednak na tyle proste i nieliczne, &#x17C;e nie warto nawet o nich wspomina&#x107;. Fabu&#x142;a jest r&#xF3;wnie&#x17C; troch&#x119; naci&#x105;gana, przez co nie do ko&#x144;ca mo&#x17C;na poczu&#x107; klimat tego niesamowitego miejsca. Je&#x15B;li chodzi o d&#x142;ugo&#x15B;&#x107; rozgrywki, to uko&#x144;czenie gry zaj&#x119;&#x142;o mi 4 godziny. Wida&#x107;, &#x17C;e tw&#xF3;rcy mieli wiele &#x15B;wietnych pomys&#x142;&#xF3;w, niestety w kilku miejscach zabrak&#x142;o dobrego wykonania&#x2026; Mimo to jednak, je&#x15B;li lubicie klimaty science fiction z nastawieniem na poznawanie odleg&#x142;ych, obcych miejsc - to zdecydowanie polecam Wam zagranie w Lifeless Planet. A je&#x15B;li to wszystko by&#x142;o jedynie wytworem wyobra&#x17A;ni g&#x142;&#xF3;wnego bohatera, kt&#xF3;ry umiera&#x142; samotnie z braku tlenu? By&#x107; mo&#x17C;e wtedy fabu&#x142;a tego tytu&#x142;u nabra&#x142;a by zupe&#x142;nie nowego znaczenia&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Plusy:
<br>+ poczucie samotno&#x15B;ci na obcej planecie
<br>+ projekt otoczenia i niekt&#xF3;rych etap&#xF3;w
<br>+ pocz&#x105;tek gry, odkrywanie historii planety, stopniowo budowane napi&#x119;cie
<br>+ w kilku momentach &#x15B;cie&#x17C;ka d&#x17A;wi&#x119;kowa
<br>
<br>Minusy:
<br>&#x2013; przekombinowana fabu&#x142;a
<br>&#x2013; liczne b&#x142;&#x119;dy techniczne
<br>&#x2013; nudz&#x105;ce elementy zr&#x119;czno&#x15B;ciowe
<br>&#x2013; do uko&#x144;czenia w 4 godziny
