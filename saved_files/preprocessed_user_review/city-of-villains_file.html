That said, there are a lot of things different - I&apos;ve read reviews saying that the archetypes aren&apos;t very different from CoH&apos;s.

The &quot;new&quot; character archtypes aren&apos;t necessarily all that different from the CoH archtypes, though the Mastermind offers some very interesting new gaming possibilities with its henchmen. I am a little disappointed that characters are so limited in their missions at early levels and that one cannot skip over the tutorial. This makes experimenting with new characters rather tiresome. As with CoH, the aspect about this that I enjoy the most is the fact that you can play for 15 minutes or for 15 hours and feel that you&apos;ve had a satisfying multi-player game experience.

But the best thing I like about CoH is the new archetypes. On the surface they seem familiar, but make no mistake, they play entirely different.</span>

                                        <span> CoV/H is probable one of the BEST games to date. Everything got an update from powers to new areas. I can&apos;t see anything wrong with it. CoV is an Expansion if you have CoH. CoV is a standalone if you don&apos;t have CoH. FAR better then the other MMORPG&apos;s out there. Closest other GOOD game is Everquest II. Well worth the $70 or $50 for the non DVD version.</span>

Running a mission in an office building against the Council with a Dark Melee/Invulnerable Brute in Villains is essentially the same experience as running a mission in an office building against the Council with a Dark Melee/invulnerable Scrapper in Heroes. Only this time the carpet is red. The chief failing of the game is that you never get the sense you&apos;re playing a villain the way you got the sense you were playing a hero in the original game. If you&apos;re new to the series, you probably won&apos;t be disappoi nted.

I had/have 4 level 50 characters in CoH and didn&apos;t know if I was ready to basically start all over again with CoV, but boy am I glad I did. The storylines and experiences are SO much different than CoH and I truly feel villainous when I am playing. The new classes are mostly unique and the fact that everyone has damage to contribute this time around makes the early game less of a grind. I have also been PvPing in Warburg (PvP zone) quite abit with my hero toons and have to say that PvP is a blast and is very addictive. There is really no penalty for PvPing (maybe some lost pride!) so I don&apos;t see why anyone would be upset getting thier toon slaughtered by me = ) I can&apos;t wait until there are some level 40 villains to challenge my supremecy! Graphically the game couldn&apos;t get much more beautiful. I&apos;m giving it a 10 because I&apos;ve never felt bored playing CoV despite it&apos;s obvious similarity to CoH.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/city-of-villains/user-reviews?user_review_id=383778">Expand</a></span>

Picks up on all of WoW&apos;s many short fallings. The only downfall to this game is that there is no single player aspect, but obviously I am just being picky.</span>

Very laggy and very buggy code. If you don&apos;t mind jerky graphics, buggy content, and frequent disconnects then this is your game. The content gets just as old as it did in City of Heroes. Very disappointing.</span>

However I just don&apos;t feel &quot;evil&quot; enough, kidnap missions feel more like a rescue. You always end up stealing from some group of thugs that have already commited the original theft. And apart from a bit of wanton vandalism that seems to be it so far.</span>

It was an expansion. period. You know it, I know it. You weren&apos;t going to get two completely seperate games. If you think the archtypes are the same, just because they have some common powers, then you have not played them for any substantial amount of time. all of the CoV archtypes play VASTLY different from those in CoH, and if you try to play your CoV characters like CoH ones, you will FAIL. though some powersets are identical, slight changes in their orientation make a whole hell of a lot of difference in how the ATs play. Show me a Hero with Thorny Assault or Energy Aura. Show me a Hero with built in stealth and Assassin skills. Show me a Controller with a Melee/Ranged Hybrid Secondary. People who say the graphics are not updated, need to get better video cards. The ragdoll physics ALONE render that claim patently false. a word of advice for those who complain about facing the same enemies. 1. Get off Mercy Island. 2. Level up. Lemme know when heroes start fighting The Legacy Chain, Wyvern, Longbow, and the other Hero Groups that exist in the game, after the beginner island. Lemme know when CoH heroes start collecting bodies for Dr. Vahzilok. Lemme know when CoH heroes manipulate the Children of Paragon City Heroes and make them turn evil. k? Bottom line, the game is fun. If you like CoH, you&apos;ve Like CoV. It&apos;s basically an expansion built on the CoH engine, and if you thought it&apos;d be otherwise you are foolish. and play past Mercy Island before you start spouting off garbage about the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/city-of-villains/user-reviews?user_review_id=383933">Expand</a></span>

All in all, if you like CoH, or got bored with CoH, giving CoV a shot is probably a good idea. If didn&apos;t like CoH at all, then you probably want to avoid this game, unless the big turn off was a lack of a pet class -- CoV is a different flavor of CoH with some tweaks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/city-of-villains/user-reviews?user_review_id=384547">Expand</a></span>

Whereas CoH became monotonous and banal, City of Villains is fresh and frentic. Never once - so far - have I found myself bored. Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m getting to be evil. Not evil in a sadistic way, but evil enough to cackle and steal candy from children. It&apos;s too much fun - robbing people, kidnapping, all good times... beating up cops, yeah. This game is also relentlessly addictive - my first night where I could play the game freely I found myself still playing at 2:30 in the morning. Did I mention the fact that this game looks great, sounds great, AND handles great? I&apos;m sure you could have infered that by now. Sadly, however, upon my casting this vote technical problems have shown their ugly faces. The game&apos;s a tad laggier than normal and there&apos;s this odd &quot;Mapserver Disconnect&quot; error that shuts you out of the game when you attempt to enter missions (you&apos;ll have to restart your computer if you encounter it - there&apos;s about a 50% chance of this happening). So currently, this game is a 7.5 (now), but once all these problems are fixed it should be back to a 9.3 (later)! Good times, good times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/city-of-villains/user-reviews?user_review_id=383975">Expand</a></span>
