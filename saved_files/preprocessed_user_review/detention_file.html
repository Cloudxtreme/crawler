<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- excellent graphics, great music and outstanding presentation in general. This could as well be a cartoon or a movie. The artists have created a masterpiece here
<br>- the story is intriguing, I couldn&apos;t stop playing until I completed the game just because I was interested in what this all was about
<br>- there are some really innovative mechanics here, e.g. late in the game you talk to your own shadow and switch control between your character and its shadow
<br>- there are some moments in the game which I think many guys from the West would find disturbing, but I liked them a lot. E.g. the scene with the guy hanging upside down - I thought I will actually cut the rope to free him or something, but it turned out completely different (I won&apos;t spoil this for you)
<br>- Asian stuff (Bhudda shrines as checkpoints, strange ghost-like enemies, esoteric philosophical babble about guilt etc) feels fresh in a computer game on Steam. And it&apos;s great to find just for once a deeply psychological Asian game.
<br>- this game has a &quot;soul&quot;. It was created by people who are artists in their heart. It stands far above mass culture
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- the game starts feeling very linear pretty early. Usually there is just 1 door or block which doesn&apos;t let you progress, and you find the needed item to unlock the door or solve the puzzle not far away. Well, this makes the game easier for people who are more interested in the story, but I preferred the multitude of puzzles in the Silent Hill and Resident Evil (probably the closest games to this one) where sometimes all the quest items you&apos;d picked up didn&apos;t even fit into your backpack
<br>- most puzzles are very simple. I only got stuck at the clock puzzle, and only because it&apos;s not easy to see without the numbers where the hands of the clock are pointing. I had to look that one up in a youtube replay. But the rest of the puzzles where too straightforward, involving almost no mental strain to solve
<br>- the game is pretty short. You will complete it in a single evening. Yet the variety and richness of experience makes up for the shortness.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- this game feels too much like a movie, I mean it&apos;s not &quot;gamey&quot; enough. Actually, this is the problem common in games where you hunt for collectible objects and then use them on other objects. E.g. lack of combat of any kind, plus scripted, non-generic interactions with objects make you feel that you just can&apos;t do much in the game apart from just following the linear story.
<br>- the whole political angle feels somewhat too one-sided. Here you have an oppressive government which is completely bad and the rebels who are completely good. It&apos;s never that simple in real life. At least it&apos;s refreshing that for once in games we have communists on the good side, or at least their sympathizers on the good side or whatever.
<br>
<br>An excellent game which may feel too movie-like and linear for hardcore gamers but is still very valuable for its distictively Asian atmosphere and masterpiece-level presentation</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/detention/user-reviews?user_review_id=6932960">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a point-and-click game.  Navigation is a bit different from other games in the genre because your character moves right and left, entering and exiting doors in the environment.  I was able to remember all the locations in my head without having to make a map or take notes.  The puzzles were very satisfying.  They challenged me without stumping me, and most of the time I felt like I arrived at the solution through my own thought process, without being given an obvious hint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/detention/user-reviews?user_review_id=7396803">Expand</a></span>

The issue being that a lot of the time games in this genre seem to want to follow a set list. There is somewhat a rigid rulebook on how horror games are meant to be, but these rules aren&#x2019;t supposed to be one hundred percent abided by. Developers can and should, for the most part, make up the rules and experiment as much as they want. At the end of the day I find that it&#x2019;s the somewhat unique games that capture people&#x2019;s attention.
<br>Now I&#x2019;m not saying Detention is unique, I mean let&#x2019;s face it what is unique nowadays? However it does like to throw in its own little rulebook.
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>The summary of the plot is; you are start off the game as a male student named Wei who falls asleep in class. Hours later he wakes up alone in a dark and obviously quite spooky school. After sometime exploring he comes across a girl sitting asleep on the school stage. He wakes her up and things start really kicking off. A lot of weird stuff starts happening around the school and creatures called Lingered start appearing. These seem to be undead students and teachers and are the first enemies you come across. They&#x2019;re slow creature which, like the rest of the enemies in the game, seem to have a hunger for anything that breathes. Luckily there&#x2019;s a useful mechanic that can help with that. By clicking the right mouse button, or whichever button it&#x2019;s been mapped to, Wei or Ray will hold their breath. This allows for you to scamper on past the Lingered without them attacking, however you will have to catch your breath if you hold for too long.
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Detention plays out as a point and click horror game where you will need to solve puzzles in order to progress. Some of the puzzles can be fairly straight forward, for example using an umbrella to fetch a key from a ventilation shaft. But others require a bit of thought to them. One example was where I had to look at three clock faces. Two had hands and the one in the middle didn&#x2019;t. There was then three pictures, each with a bloody symbol on them. These symbols represented the clock hands and once I&#x2019;d adjusted the clocks to the correct times the door that was previously locked opened. Some puzzles do require certain items to complete them. These items aren&#x2019;t too difficult to come across, you just need to be a little bit observant. The puzzles themselves don&#x2019;t feel too tedious or pointless. There&#x2019;s always a valid reason to complete them and most of the time it&#x2019;s to move the story forward.
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Graphics wise I&#x2019;d say detention has an unusual but very well done art style. It&#x2019;s clear the artist took a lot of time to add in as much detail as possible to give the game a sense of reality. Each area is well drawn, with clear distinctions from the odd dark world, with it&#x2019;s grainy overly, to the creepy school at night. The characters and enemies are defined too. With Wei and Ray wearing very white school uniforms and the enemies seemingly very dark and shadowy.
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>In conclusion I think Detention is horror game that tries to break the mould of the genres standards. But does it? Yes and no. There are a few things that really shine for me in Detention. The story is pretty complex but welcome, as I know of many horror games that have little to no story at all. Also I like the various stealth mechanics that are introduced for the number of enemies you have to face. It does throw in the odd jumpscare here and there, but I mean what horror games doesn&#x2019;t.
<br>It&#x2019;s got puzzles of varying difficulties and an eerie soundtrack that fits the game&#x2019;s quite chilling atmosphere. All in all if you love horror games and want something a little different than the norm then I&#x2019;d suggest giving Detention a go. And even if you don&#x2019;t want it for the horror aspect, it&#x2019;s full of puzzles to test your wits too.
