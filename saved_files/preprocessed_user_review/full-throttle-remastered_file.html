<br>
<br>The good:  The dialogue is witty, the music is atmospheric, the original pixel artwork is still amazing (IMHO), the story is engaging and the puzzles are original and their solutions are generally logical (for a LucasArts point-and-click adventure).
<br>
<br>The bad:  The new graphical makeover is as charmless as it is pointless - it looks like a bad Flash game.  The motorbike combat bits are as awful as they every were.  Some puzzles end up being a &quot;Where&apos;s Waldo&quot; search for a non-descript item that is indistinguishable from the non-interactive background.  The whole thing is also very short and linear; for all of the dialogue choices you get, there&apos;s only one path through the game, therefore there&apos;s no replay value.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t help but feel that the money used to develop this remaster might have been better put towards a proper (full-priced) sequel, perhaps with the original Full Throttle bundled in and playable in its original form.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve never played Full Throttle before, I would encourage you to give it a go, but do so with an open and forgiving mind, as it hasn&apos;t aged particularly well.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played it before and you&apos;ve misplaced your rose-tinted glasses, avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/full-throttle-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=7274889">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Amazing remastered soundtrack and SFX, great idea for the jukebox to add &quot;hi-fi&quot;, &quot;lo-fi&quot; switch. I like to compare old and new sound, this is fantastic. Actually i like it in every remaster.
<br>
<br>It was redrawn everything and looks very nice, i guess i like remaster better now.
<br>
<br>Not have any problem with mechanics and fight on the bikes, think it&apos;s became even smoother.
<br>
<br>Very useful feature is able to switch between classic and remastered versions. Request it for every future remaster ever :))
<br>
<br>Great remaster for the great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/full-throttle-remastered/user-reviews?user_review_id=7361212">Expand</a></span>

<br>Favorite Thing: The remaster looks great. A fitting facelift for a great classic.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: Controlling the motorcycle. It&apos;s not just the mouse control, it&apos;s the oh-so-terrible mouse control.
