And I&apos;m not going to lie, I expected it to be a pretty terrible game. I mean it came along with like six other no-name games for less than $3; how good could it be? I don&apos;t know why I even bought that bundle now that I think about it, I was probably drunk or something. However, after playing &apos;Bus Driver&apos; for a few hours I can safely admit that this is one of the best simulation games that I have ever played. And even though it is truly a simulation game it also feels like an arcade game at the same time. But that probably has something to do with the look and the feel of the game. Just think &apos;Crazy Taxi&apos; with a bus and some rules.
<br>
<br>Now I know that rules don&apos;t sound like the most fun thing ever, but the best part of this game is, you guessed it, following the rules. Don&apos;t forget to use your turn signal, don&apos;t rattle the passengers too much or they&apos;ll leave, don&apos;t brake too often, don&apos;t brake too little, etc. You can see where I&apos;m going with this. Another great aspect of this game is how true-to-bus the steering is, making it a pretty difficult game at times. So if you&apos;ve ever wondered what the life of a bus driver was like, grab this game while you can. And if you really want to make this game realistic, have a few drinks before picking up the controller! Happy driving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bus-driver/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920818">Expand</a></span>

The concepts actually work alright and it can be fun in short bursts in trying to maximize your score, but the game is always same same with poor graphics, sound and limited animations. The people you take around don&apos;t actually have any animations at all; they somehow are able to move from the bus stop into the bus and out again without moving their legs at all. I wish I was able to do that. So yeah, although the concepts work alright, in the context of a computer game, it is very repetitive and limited.The reaction your friend would have to you stating you play Bus Driver  says it all: invest your time and money in a real game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bus-driver/user-reviews?user_review_id=3725558">Expand</a></span>
