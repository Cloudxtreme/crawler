There are 35 floors and it takes around 20 minutes to complete one floor since the random level design. The gameplay is fantastic. It&apos;s practicly the same as in Diablo and Diablo 2 but with some additions like the spellbar and just walking over coins to pick it up.(Note both of these features were announced for Diablo 3) The storyline is not close as good as in Diablo. No wonder though. This game is named Torchlight, but as much resemblance it has with the Diablo franchise, it would have made a great name as &quot;Diablo 2.5&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=744950">Expand</a></span>

One town and a dungeon beneath the town to explore. The skill system is also very cool. You choose between three tabs with lots of skills in each. There are also 3 classes.

No video sequence or multiplayer but read the multiplayer may come later. If your a fan of Diablo and rpg games of that sort, it will be the best $20 you have spent for a game. They also offer a very nice demo should you want to try it before buying.</span>

Torchlight has pleasant cartoon graphics that give the game a magical fun atmosphere and has excellent sound and music to match. The music is extremely similar to the music found in Diablo 1 and 2 but no complains there. There are many other elements that are extremely similar to the Diablo series, the gem crafting system works almost exactly the same but I think they went a little overboard with it as there are I believe seven levels of gem qualities and it can take ages finding the one gem you are missing in order to finish &quot;transmuting&quot; them altogether to get the final product. The prices in the game are a little wonky and gold can be hard to come by. A weapon that you paid 5000 gold for will normally sell back to the vendor for 50-100 gold. This can lead to one broke ass hero through the early stages of the game. I liked the fact that the game has unique animations for many of the weapons (with enchantment glows) and armor in the game, and they did a good job with the animations too. I find it highly amusing that a $5 little indie-esque game like this has better armor animations than the hugely grossing World of Warcraft. My ultimate gripe with the game is that sometimes dungeons will repeat. You&apos;ll be in a dungeon with a sense of deja-vu about the layout and once you figure out a stairway, door, exit is in the exact same place you will know that your assumption was well founded. It takes about 10-12 hours to get a character to level 35-40 and beat the main storyline of the game, but again for $5 I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458865">Expand</a></span>

It is quick and nonstop action for one, but the foundation and focus is on character improvement. Which is dominated by loot and gear and pure collecting galore for the perfectionists, where each item is potentially better than the last. This is driven by a random system, looting and enchanting and everything to make the best out of your stuff. Retire your character and pass any one item to a descendant, it acts as a legendary and better version endlessly. The game may be tiny ,but this makes even repeating rewarding. Very nicely shaped game overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458426">Expand</a></span>

There are only 3 classes but they&apos;ve done a good job of making each unique. Lots of opportunity for customizing your character&apos;s abilities. Loads of cool armor and weapons. Good variety of weapons. For just a few dollars you get hours of fun. Highly recommended for PC gamers.</span>

The positives: the games saves everything exactly as it is, you leave a town portal up it is still there later, and other such examples. The downside: lack of quests, they exist but are few and far between. The good thing is that the developers encourage mods. So if you feel that they are lacking in the quests mod some more.

Of course, the only downside, was no multiplayer. Torchlight 2 however, is my most anticipated game of this year, or even the past few years.

All around a fun game, but the sequel is looking to be much, much, much better.</span>

                                        <span>really like this game which I&apos;m sure everyone knows is sort of a Diablo knock off.  That&apos;s not a drawback and at least 2 of the developers were key members of the original Diablo team.  I don&apos;t play console and I have a mac so some of my choices are limited.  This was a fantastic break from my usual MMO grind.  Really nice game.</span>

Torchlight doesn&apos;t really do anything new, but that doesn&apos;t make it any less fun for a play through or two.</span>

I&apos;ve seen they are putting co-op in 2 so I&apos;m extremely excited for that. Just hope they get it out before D3!</span>

A beautiful interface, smooth gameplay, rewarding loot, and a great modding community make this a must have. The visuals are rounded, attractive, and run on very old pc&apos;s, however the music is probably the best aesthetic thing about the entire game - it is truly exceptional. And while the package and content is fantastic, the game has some faults as well. It&apos;s very repetitive, focusing purely on a single descending dungeon (with a few side portals). In a game like this, you do need more variety to make it interesting for longer. And the omission of multiplayer and the ability to share your game experience limits the longterm value. Regardless, this game understands what makes a action rpg tick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144929">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re not too concerned about a wafer thin storyline you&apos;re going to definitely enjoy your stay in Torchlight. There&apos;s also great replay value as you can try different character builds and collect different sets of loot to swap about. One fault worth mentioning is that the load times can be surprisingly long at times and the abundance of enemies can be overwhelming to say the least, but it&apos;s really just nit-picking on an otherwise solid title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2083441">Expand</a></span>

When playing the Vanquisher I was promised &quot;Traps&quot; however all I got was a skill tree full of &quot;Throw Bomb&quot;, not very good at all. I hope to see better skill in T2 or I won&apos;t be interested. Overall pretty good experience and looks like some new &quot;Light&quot; for the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2385394">Expand</a></span>

Yep! But so what? Diablo was one of the best games of all time - torchlight contains all of the epicness of d2 with a streamlined interface and more vivid graphics. For 15 bucks you really can&apos;t say no, you will have hours of fun figuring out how to turn yourself into an unstoppable train locomotive of gory death - and once you do, turning an entire room with 20 little guys and two big bosses into a bleeding pile of corpses in seven short seconds of screen shaking and big numbers gives you the spectacle that defines the action rpg genre. No running around forests gathering plants, you run dungeons and slaughter evil for your gear! It doesn&apos;t get a solid 10/10 because during the main questline you have to go through five-dungeon level jaunts of samey-looking environments and that gets old. In addition, there is so much white trash loot that it becomes cumbersome to pick through (since you can&apos;t just pick it all up and deal with it later because your inventory is small) in the middle of a dungeon, and that takes away from the flow of the game. Torchlight is a tribute to the genre of action RPGs - but if you have never played an action RPG before, do yourself a favor and play Diablo first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2328060">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are not super, but not bad, like it&apos;s special style of Texture! Feels like Warcraft&apos;ish.. I kinda like that! Misses Online Play, but that is coming with Torchlight II, what makes this game unique, is the Modding. Like Seriously.. The game can get 6 times bigger than Diablo II: Lord of Destruction with the modding. It&apos;s not as good though... But a very good RPG! I would put it second on the list. Definately worth 19,99$ ! Hope TOrchlight II will have more ACTs and zone types!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2199891">Expand</a></span>

How ever all the excitement for Diablo 3 was infectious so i wanted to try it again but singleplayer TQ is boring and having pre-ordered Guild Wars 2 I didn&apos;t want to spent another &#xC2;&#xA3;50. So I tryed the demo for torchlight, and instantly preordered Tl2 once I finished. With that came the original and it is amazing. Tons of loot and the levels change scenary just as you are starting to get tired of them so it has great pacing. The combat is also extremely satisfying and has excellent blood splatters. It is also very addicting in the same way wow is, you constantly want better loot and to level up. And don&apos;t listen to the crap about how budget games are short, I tend to have the most fun with indie games and I have sunk 11hrs into the game, and I am on floor 22 and I don&apos;t know how many floors there are but there is an achievement for getting to floor 50. The reasons it doesn&apos;t get 10 is primarily the difficulty. There first few level can be played one handed and after that it does require some concentration but as long as u keep chugging healing potions which the game gives you plenty of will ensure you won&apos;t die. Though I am only playing on hard so the higher difficulty might improve this. Also it is such a rich and vibrant gameworld and as a lore addict I would have appreciated some more backround like what is ember used for? And what is happening outside of Torchlight. A bit more of a story than &quot;Bad stuff is happening, lets go into this dungeon and keep on going deeper till we find it&quot; would have been nice. Oh and multiplayer. but TL2 looks like all of this will be fixed, well I don&apos;t know about the story and the lore but one can hope. And there will be more hubs than the single one in the original which is also nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2414219">Expand</a></span>

For the ones that say it&apos;s too much like Diablo do some research, 2 of the 3 Diablo creators are at Runic games so yes it&apos;s meant to be like that.</span>

I&apos;ve realized that even the original Torchlight is a better game than D3. You actually get drops that your improve your character. When you break things and open chests you actually get gold and items. Imagine that.</span>

It is brilliant, very cute with outstanding gameplay.  Good interfaces and easy to just pick up and play.  There has been some criticism that the game does not feature co-op or multiplayer, however in this day and age where EVERYTHING has co-op and multiplayer I found it a refreshing change to have a game I can just sit and play all on my own in peace.  The treasure hunting and fishing aspects of the game keep it fresh as do the maps that lead to hidden bonus dungeons.  I am still hunting for some very specific items to get full sets of the epic type suits with awesome bonuses.   All in all this game has mass appeal, yes it is not original but damn it is fun, very pretty to look at and superb to play.  Highly recommended and I am looking forward to the forthcoming release of Torchlight 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1470565">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s certainly a more casual approach than Diablo, but that doesn&apos;t stop it being an extremely fun game to play, the  3 classes are distinctly different and all a joy to control. Combat feels very impacting, and the there&apos;s a perfect balance between fun and difficulty, though like most ARPG&apos;s it can be a bit samey, but hey that comes with the genre. The story is a bit meh and never really grips you but that doesn&apos;t matter, you won&apos;t be paying much attention to it anyway. Anyway if you like ARPG&apos;s you owe it to yourself to play it, it&apos;s a hoot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2337474">Expand</a></span>

I really think this game has potential in it, or had, unfortunately it was not used to its maximum power. The environments are repetitive, really repetitive, every 5 dungeons or so you get a change but that doesn&apos;t kill the repetition, and all the lost dungeons and extra ones are the same thing, that is the major disappointment of this game. After I see the enemies getting extremely repetitive too which get a little tedious and then of course there is repetitive loot which is found in massive amounts. All these issues make this game a little bit tedious but there is a saving grace, the art style is just outstanding, the sound is good and the learning curve here is just about right. I will tell you to buy this game if you are a diablo fan since this is a great experience for dungeon crawler fans but its not the reboot of the genre nor is it innovative to death, it gets a 6/10 but i will still recommend a buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158022">Expand</a></span>

Can the fans create a new CS in the fantasy rpg ganre. Maby who knows what will happen, at least you wont be dissapointed.</span>

Sure, it can be somewhat repetitive in its dungeon crawling ways, but it&apos;s pace makes up for that. As for having no multiplayer as some reviewers have stated, well, we all know this, but one thing to remember is that the developers are in the midst of making this title into an MMO, which could end up being a very nice game if it manages to do it before Diablo 3 is released - or after. I feel if they attempt it whilst D3 is out there, they may end up failing to bring the game to the market it deserves. If you are a fan of hack&apos;n&apos;slash, then you have to buy this game, if not, give it a go anyway, it&apos;s very user friendly and has a very intuative user interface with an easy learning curve. The only other suggestion I would say is don&apos;t play it on anything less than the Hard setting as normal and easy are ridiculously easy with no challenge whatsoever - at any stage of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=744786">Expand</a></span>

You are then placed in the small town of Torchlight, and thrust into action which foreshadows the main story line of the game. Now, I don&apos;t have a lot of experince in this genre really, but to me the story seemed very weak, which I will come back to later. In the first few missions you are only required to do simple things (kill this thing here, go talk to that person there) which I found boring at first, but after a while of clicking away the story progressed and so did the quests, and I started to really get into the combat and it became very entertaining. As I beleive to be common in the genre, as you level up you get a certain amount of points to increase your stats as well as gain new abilities. Playing as the &apos;alchemist&apos; (the mage type character), I found the new spells and pets kept me playing, and for a while I really liked the game.<br>The problems came after the 17th floor (each quest brings you deeper and deeper into the main &apos;dungeon&apos;, and I beleive there are 35 floors to the main dungeon) or thereabouts where the game slowed down to a crawl (in a dungeon crawl game, who would have thought?). I think there are several problems that are faced by each genre, and even in general, that need to be addressed by developers. In dungeon crawls, you are bascially asking the player to do the same thing over and over again to get through a dungeon, usually in a pretty formulaic way (you go through here, kill those, go to another level/area). To keep the player interested, I think its pretty important to balance interesting and varied combat against the background of an intriguing and engaging story so the player doesn&apos;t realise that all they are doing is clicking buttons and killing data.<br><br>While Torchlight delivers varied combat, seen in its variation in level design (to an extent) and enemy models, introduction of new spells at a nice and natural pace and drawing the player into combat through an interesting armour/weapon discovery system which gives a good incentive, the story is greatly lacking. While not overly generic, the development of the story is slow and not overly compelling, making me often question why I was even bothering to play, other than to watch my character perform some devastating spells and attacks. To me, they failed in the balancing act I mentioned previously. By the 20th floor the game turned into nothing but &apos;walk here, AoE that, find the stairs to the next floor&apos;, which lead me to the analogy of self harm with kitchen utensils.<br><br>The game also has some cool features worth mentioning, like having a dog or cat (you decide at the beginning of the game) to help you in combat, as well as being able to tell them to go back to town from a dungeon with items to sell, a handy way to make money as well as clear inventory space without losing momentum in dungeon crawling. The use of town portal scrolls is also handy, which allows you to teleport to town to hand in quests etc and then you can return to the place you teleported from. While being helpful features, they are not nearly enough to save the game from it&apos;s weak story line and player motivation.<br><br>I do not contend that this is a horrible game, the combat (a key feature of this kind of game) is very fun, and the game does well to draw you in. Fans of the genre will probably enjoy this game a great deal, as I&apos;ve read in numerous other reviews, overlooking the game&apos;s plot faults. It has a lot of replay value for fans, being able to try the game again on different difficulties or as a different class, as well as the option of fighting through a dungeon with infinite levels and side missions at the end of the main quest (but if I wanted to do this, I would go back to World of Wastecraft).<br><br>To conclude, while the combat of Torchlight is fun and engaging, the story is not much of either. For people who aren&apos;t great fans of the genre, you will probably get a few hours of great fun and then a few hours of soul crushing monotony, while fans will probably spend the 10-60 hours of possible gameplay in complete bliss.<br><br>Breakdown<br><br>Presentation - 7/10 -The user interface is reasonably compact and functional, with the use of a number of easy to use buttons to hotkey spells. Some keys are a little awkwardly placed, which cramped my hands a few times.<br><br>Graphics - 8/10 - Cartoony graphics, but quite detailed and very charming<br><br>Sound - 8/10 - Very fitting musical score, capturing the ambiance and feel of each level of the dungeon<br><br>Gameplay - 7/10 - Combat is very fun, but gets old some time into the game, slowing to a grind<br><br>Plot - 3.5/10 - weak story, slowly implemented and not compelling/does not draw you in<br><br>Lasting impact on player - variable - if you&apos;re a fan, you will love the options, but if you aren&apos;t like me you might avoid finishing it once<br><br><br>Overall about a 6/10 (Okay)<br>See other reviews at http://criticalgamingstudies.blogspot.com</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1701280">Expand</a></span>

Although the concepts behind the game are not original (primarily absorbed from DII and Fate)  there was still a lot of work and creativity that went into designing this game at a movie ticket price.  So for those trolls out there who are score raping this game, you should reconsider based on the definition of a dungeon crawler.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1402843">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the best Hack&apos;n Slash after Diablo games ever. Great gameplay, nice graphics and good but just good maps. Biggest minus in this game is just 3 heroes..... This is enough.
<br>I can&apos;t played this game more them 10 hours in week because this become boring.
<br>I advice Torchlight Diablo II fans and people who likes Hack&apos;n Slash games. My rate is 8.3/10</span>

The game is well polished but the gameplay tends to get very repetative in a short amount of time. If you enjoyed Diablo you will likely enjoy Torchlight but you just won&apos;t love it.</span>

If you want originality in a game...well, go back in time to the 80&apos;s, but this ain&apos;t it.  What it does offer is fun gameplay at a reasonable price.  This title now sells for $15, a reduction from a whopping $20, making it a screaming deal when it was full priced still.  The graphics are pretty, not overly taxing on your system (the company says it can be played on a tablet, pretty cool) and it runs smoothly.  Levels are randomly built so you won&apos;t have the same map over and over.  Tons of loot drops, also randomly generated, keeping you always looking for an upgrade.  Again, just like Diablo.  A couple of things are missing from the game like the ability to keymap (seriously developers, let me set my own buttons, IN EVERY GAME) and you can&apos;t respec (I guess everyone is supposed to automatically know what every spell and ability does) both things which hurt the game.  Another rude awakening thing you will learn is the enchantment system is also random and there is a chance that the item you are enchanting will be rendered useless (all stats removed) which is very annoying if you really like whatever it is you are using.  But overall, considering how many Diablo clones there are in the world, how fun this one actually is to play and its price it comes out as quite a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1766421">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s some great features, such as loading up your pet with items and sending him to town to sell them, that really add to the experience. As with most games in the genre, it can turn into a bit of a grind-fest at times, but the huge amount of variety between the different skills (and classes, for that matter) makes it totally worth it.

<br>At first I enjoyed the gameplay, particularly with the opening town exploration and &quot;buddy&quot; mission to kick off the story, but that all ends within an hour of play.  After about ten hours I suddenly had an epiphany that it was undeniably repetitive and it didn&apos;t really matter what I did.  It very quickly became a run-of-the-mill level grind with almost no story development.  99% of the time you&apos;ll be left-clicking bad guys or adjusting your inventory.  The levels also started to get visually so repetitive it was easy to get turned around and accidentally back-track.
<br>
<br>The sudden realization that all the armor, stat and magic advances my character had made really were pointless was enough to move on for greener pastures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3220376">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is repetitive even by the standards of the genre, and it all feels rather pointless. The quests are lame and the gear grinding is undisguised.</span>

Would have expected a game of much higher calibre from the co-creators of Diablo and Diablo II. For more reasons why, read on:<br><br>I&apos;m not sure where to start, and not in a good way. I bought this game in response to a fairly fantastic reviews all round, but was greatly disappointed.<br><br>If you&apos;ve ever played an rpg before, particularly Diablo or one of its many clones, (or if you can roll your face on your keyboard) Torchlight is trivially easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Roll an alchemist and it becomes a mind-numbingly boring process of spamming 2 spells (which are more or less copy and pasted from every rpg ever made, ever) on unimagined monsters for what seems like an eternity. Furthermore, the storyline is slow, clich&#xC3;&#xA9;d and more or less non-existent, so the game feels less like an rpg and more like an arbitrary grind-fest for an unknown purpose.<br><br>The inventory system is also somewhat haphazard and feels a little unpolished, as do the items. Don&apos;t expect to pick up an item without picking up everything near it, which adds to a second minor problem: lack of inventory space. While your pet does have a pack, you&apos;ll constantly find yourself stepping out of the action in order to slowly give everything to your dog or cat and sending it back to town. Alternatively, you can pick up everything above the item you desire, then drop all the things you didn&apos;t want.<br>The items themselves are very much like what you&apos;d see in a typical rpg, although with less variation. The gem does have a gem system, but the actual gems drop so rarely (and bonuses of which weren&apos;t even good enough to merit being rare) that I only used 2 gems throughout one playthrough. Going back to your pet, its ai seems quite fond of being completely useless. It often gets stuck when you run up stairs, or behind walls. The fishing system, while innovative, provides benefits for your pet which, while making your pet actually combat capable, are next to useless due to how easy most fights actually are. This is a particular irk of mine: your pet is either useless, or more or less makes your playable character unnecessary. Most fish transform your pet into a monster capable of destroying everything nearby (including bosses), which, while fun to watch, your pets beastly-ness means you don&apos;t really have to do much for 5 minutes. The hitboxes (where you have to click to attack a unit) are also misleadingly small, and many a time I&apos;d find my character running around the place instead of actually performing any useful action, even when trying to open a chest.<br><br>Characters themselves seem like interesting twists on popular rpg classes, but are in fact as generic as they get. Essentially, you have a mage, a ranger and a warrior, with unnecessarily renamed skills, and a mixture of useless and overpowered spells and abilities. The only class I found remotely fun to play was the alchemist, and that was ruined by how easy the game becomes after lvl 5 or so. There is so much that could have been done to add a little flair to these classes, but Torchlight seemingly neglected any character creativity in preference for a quick and easy clone.<br><br>The game has a little saving grace from its lovely graphics. The design team really hit the spot with fleshed out environments and spell effects. Additionally, while it lacks originality, it did a reasonable job of stealing many of the things that made Diablo great, and using them again. It does make Torchlight seem a little redundant.<br><br>All in all, if you&apos;re a fan of mindless click-spamming and killing everything that moves with not much effort, you&apos;ll like this game. If you want any depth, challenges or something new, save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=1451270">Expand</a></span>

This game would have been great 10 years ago, but today it&apos;s simply a stale ripoff of a formula that&apos;s been done at least a dozen times before. While you may find your first playthrough as enjoyable as any other game in the genre, the lack of multiplayer or any uniqueness to the three basic classes prevents it from having any replay value. You&apos;re just killing the same old mobs in the same old way you&apos;ve been doing for 15 years since the first Diablo was released, with no depth, very little originality, and no replayability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=741790">Expand</a></span>
