No more using resources for teleporters and having to worry about running out of them for upgrades.
<br>I also really enjoyed the new methods of moving throughout the world and the incredibly regular stream of upgrades one gets. As well as the number of challenges, secrets and generally quite big map. It took me almost 13 hours to finish at 100%. With the first Dig, it was almost 6 hours.
<br>Usually, I have a lot to say about games but here, I can only say that almost everything just feels right.
<br>The only downsides for me were that there are still not enough meaningful boss encounters. The only one stuck in my mind is the very first one. A funny cut scene and pretty decent mechanics. After that, until the final boss, there really aren&apos;t any encounters that feel as significant. And the last boss is very easy once again. Beat it on the first attempt, just like in Dig.
<br>Overall, I loved every minute of it and already can&apos;t wait to see what these bots are up to next!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/steamworld-dig-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7542400">Expand</a></span>
