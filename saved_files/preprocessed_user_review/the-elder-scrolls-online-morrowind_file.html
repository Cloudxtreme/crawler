If you are still stuck on what the Elder Scrolls Online was at launch, please reconsider!  The questing is wonderful.  The dungeons are designed beautifully and the upper level ones very challenging.  The combat is SO good.  It might feel a little slow at 1st when you only have a few abilities but once you unlock both skill bars and have a full set of skills to swap between, it is very fast paced.  The battlegrounds pvp they added with this update is a ton of fun too.  I played this game in beta and for a few months at launch and felt it just wasn&apos;t quite there.  It&apos;s there now.  If you want to explore Tamriel with a friend, now is a better time than ever to do so!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=7345879">Expand</a></span>

Stop supporting this greedy company that puts out content thats AWFUL 1 trial and a questing zone is utter garbage and BG&apos;s should have already been part of the game. So initially you should only be paying for the class and trial so it should be 20 usd not 40.

This expansion (or DLC) adds a new class which is always fun, but it just feels a little shallow.  The price is rather high and you don&apos;t get a lot for the money.  Helps to add on to the game, just not much, and not $40 worth either.</span>

<br>
<br>The reason I gave it such a low rating is because the balance changes done with this update made PvP much more enjoyable but it made PvE much less enjoyable. I happen to be a PvE player primarily so this update has soured the game for me. I&apos;ve been playing this game since the beta and I think now is the time that I will put it down once and for all. The grind that it took to get some of the end-game gear from certain trials is ridiculous. Played this game for 2 years and still don&apos;t have some of the end-game weapons I&apos;ve been working for. Now that the PvE aspect has been changed in the way that it has, it makes the grind feel even less worth it. I think this update, for the most part, killed the PvE aspect of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=7440632">Expand</a></span>

Of course this isn&apos;t Bethesda&apos;s game, it is Zenimax, but I for some reason expected some of the the cities, characters, and vibes from the original game to carry over. The cities are cool, but just lack feeling. The buildings are closed for the most part, and there is not much to do aside from the usual shops and the NPCs involved with my active quests. In Morrowind, just about every destination and persona had huge amounts of character. It just feels to me like they skimmed a little bit of morrowind off the top and sprinkled it on to their MMO. I appreciate this gesture to appease long term fans, but you CAN&apos;T SKIMP THE DETAILS when trying to compare to an incredible classic game like Morrowind.
<br>
<br>Disappointment aside, I really like the storylines, dialogues, and MAIN characters. Some locations are very detailed, but overuse of props doesn&apos;t make up for the lack of meaningful accessible locations and interesting characters. I also think that for an expansion or &quot;Chapter&quot; that costs two thirds as much as a newly released PS4 games should have content quality and quantity that justifies the price. I DO enjoy the new class addition. Only a small handful of new armor sets and weapons were introduced, and the mounts and pets do not really seem to be relevant to the content at all.  Maybe my opinion will start to change as I get farther through the content, who knows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=7347727">Expand</a></span>

However by calling it an expansion, the devs now can exclude subscribers that do not purchase Morrowind from future contents related to Morrowind.  That being said what&apos;s there is good, there&apos;s no doubt about that.  The price point however should be no more than $20.</span>

In comparison to other mmo full expansions it&apos;s extremely lacking in content, it feels about on pace to the Wrothgar DLC maybe a small bit larger in overall size but content wise not much more.  The world does feel like original Morrowind and the nostalgia is real - however I was disappointed in the somewhat lifeless and closed off Balmora and Vivec the same way.  Many buildings in Balmora are closed up and only 1 of the cantons in Vivec is fully explorable like TES III.  I&apos;m happy to say some old tunes are in the OST for the expansion, redone, but that&apos;s nice to hear.  Overall it&apos;s a nice romp with nostalgia but pretty lackluster to me if I&apos;m being objective about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=7345321">Expand</a></span>

Vvardenfell delivers an amazing landscape, and some of the best story writing I have ever seen from an mmo. The warden class is a breath of fresh air, with a great variety of abilities.  From the ground up all of the architecture is entirely new assets, as well as a majority of the items within them. The alternate start supplies a compelling story, and leads to a giant nostalgia trip as you make your way to Seyda Neen.  Overall the new story content is better than any of its predecessors, the landscape and new assets are detailed making it that much more enjoyable to be doing content within Vvardenfell, the new battlegrounds offer more variety to the pvp, and the new class will be welcomed by seasoned players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/user-reviews?user_review_id=7348718">Expand</a></span>
