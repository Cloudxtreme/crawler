Explosions look satisfying, and the unit, terrain and environmental details are nice and clear.<br><br>If your new to WiC then the control scheme might seem strange for an RTS game. As you control it more like an FPS game than a standard RTS game. Due to this, it could very well be ported over to consoles without any trouble at all.<br><br>In Soviet Assault you essentially play two campaigns rolled into one.

First up is the strategy elements in the game, this can sometimes feel as if it was a Total War game set in the &quot;Modern Era&quot; in which every single movement counts. Infantry and sometimes light transport can hide in the forests designed for ambushes and strategic placement for ground infantry. Infantry can go into buildings and use them as makeshift forts, making an apartment complex an MG nest, or even hold off tanks with AT units firing from windows that suddenly attack you from the side as you&apos;re going by. APC&apos;s are used as transport over land, and if it&apos;s amphibious even by sea if you are in need of that approach. Tanks are broken down into light, medium, and heavy. Light for taking out small infantry units and light transport, but are dominated by AT. Medium for taking out APC&apos;s, but are easily taken out by artillery. Finally, there&apos;s heavy that is for taking out buildings, and breaking through enemy locations to capture strategic points on the map, that have only two weaknesses I could find, air units and Tac Point bonuses. Anti-air is broken into light and heavy, heavy being mobile sam turrets mostly, and light using heavy bullets that tear apart helicopters mid-air, but both are easily taken out by land units. Air vehicles are in two different places, the &quot;Tac Points&quot; and the buy menu. The buy menu uses helicopters ranging from lightweight scouts used to find enemies moving around to flank or simply finding where the enemy is advancing from. Transport to quickly move behind enemy lines and fortify to capture a point. And heavy to take out armored units such as any tank, and some APC&apos;s. Artillery is broken down into light and heavy weight, as well as getting much larger single strikes through &quot;Tac Points&quot;. Heavy for the Soviets are Howitzers that fire large shells that deal much more damage than the rapid fire artillery for Nato, or the balanced between version of American heavy artillery. Lightweight artillery takes out pretty much only light transport, and infantry which is a bit underwhelming at first but if you figure out where to fire with it, it can change battles around. Perhaps the best part of this game is the Tac Points that range from calling in paratroopers, to tactical nuclear devices. This is what expands the strategy in almost every way. The tac points such as the cluster bomb is devastating and should be kept close to you if you ever get the points. The nuclear device levels entire sections of the map with little to no effort besides getting there, and is by far the most visually and shows the best use of the game&apos;s physics. The lighter, cheaper tac points are made to allow for strategic flanks around enemies, or such as an A10 taking out a group of APC&apos;s or tanks. Here&apos;s a tip instead of moving infantry in to take out the enemy snipers use a Napalm strike on his position, or a bunker buster if he&apos;s in a building. The story is good for the most part, you take the role of both sides starting with the invasion of West Germany, killing the 6th armored platoon of America. This is the first battle of what is supposedly WWIII. The Soviets later invade North America through cargo freights and sneaking in to American homelands and attacking Seattle and fighting back the unprepared National Guard and U.S. Army. Although the most surprising part, is where a rather hated character turns loved by me where he sacrifices himself in the most honorable way possible, living up to the code that he will fight for his country no matter the cost. The part that was most surprising to me was it&apos;s what he wanted, he died and you had to call in the order to do it. Giving a fairly touching cinematic, and giving you motive to not let a strike be launched at Seattle later on. It shocked both sides as well, halting the soviet forces that attempted to go through the area, Paradise Falls, and shocked America by how they were almost forced to do it. Multiplayer is perhaps the best part allowing for some rather significant features, and the key feature is choosing a role and using it to cover the weaknesses for other players, although not completely as they do allow you to get some things in all parts which is commendable in it&apos;s own right but I&apos;m going to give that a minus because it ruins part of the teamwork experience. The reason it earns it&apos;s 10/10 is for truly significant gameplay and it&apos;s complete add-on to the story of it&apos;s base game, giving you actual emotions when you order your men to kill. The multiplayer is amazing, and the Engine was made specifically for this type of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict-soviet-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106570">Expand</a></span>

I feel like i wasted what was it? $20 for basically just a few campaign maps? I mean common, the Download was only like 10mb-20mb, What a waste of 6 months.</span>

My pc is quite old but with a &#xA3;50 graphics card inside, this game runs very smoothly with great graphics. Best game i have ever got for my pc!

The added Soviet storyline is not a continuation of the story; it ties in with the US and NATO campaigns, yet it&apos;s a worthy addition. The Soviet characters are just as memorable as their American counterparts. The fact that you can now play the story from both perspectives making this already amazing game even better.

And extremely well recommended for anyone who likes action based RPS where you get right into it, Cold War thrillers, and wants a game that feels like a movie experience.
<br>
<br>The story and narrative are creative, voice-acting and cut-scenes are awesome. It&apos;s like experiencing a Cold War action flick (a well acted one, like Hunt For the Red October, coincidental since Alec Baldwin voices the main character).
<br>
<br>The action, though frantic and not realistic, is extremely well done and fun to play. It&apos;s even a bit dare I say emotional in parts. Because the action portrays the desperation of the characters well. There&apos;s nothing like taking a hill, then positioning heavy artillery on it. Linking your artillery to a hotkey and unleashing the rain.
<br>
<br>What doesn&apos;t get said enough is the detail. One of the Soviet Missions has you going through eastern Washington State farmland and having lived near there all my life they nail it. The brown, earth tones and yellow-dried grass fields. It&apos;s amazing how scalable the game is. One mission I was firing artillery from a high up &quot;god&apos;s view&quot; and then mouse wheeled close to an American tank and there was actually voice dialogue I could hear from inside the tank going &quot;What&apos;s happening? Is that artillery?&quot; Similar the Russian vehicles and men are constantly yelling out in battle what I can only assume is real Russian dialogue...Despite the fact that perhaps 95% of the game&apos;s audience may never understand it. Even in one of the Washington missions in the hayfields there&apos;s a sprinkler system, fully animated with the little arm that taps it in circles, with its own sound.
<br>
<br>The level of care and desire to make an awesome Cold War RTS is here. So again, if you like action games, RTS, Cold War movies and a great story experience you simply cannot go wrong with Soviet Assault.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict-soviet-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=6356576">Expand</a></span>
