<br>
<br>The main thing that it has going for it is that it&apos;s a truly charming game. It&apos;s lighthearted and playful and funny. The author isn&apos;t afraid to throw in anachronisms or pop culture references just to get a giggle out of the audience. It has a time travel subplot that is much more Doctor Who than Twelve Monkeys  just zany, wibbly-wobbly, and fun.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a short game, clocking in at maybe eight hours, depending on how thoroughly you explore and read all the flavor text. It has a good sense of pacing. It holds your interest and never gets boring. Your character progresses at a nice, linear rate; there&apos;s no level grinding; nothing ever feels tedious. It&apos;s also largely bug-free; I only found one in my playthrough, and it wasn&apos;t game-breaking.
<br>
<br>But one of the main strikes against it is that there&apos;s truly nothing new to see here. Maybe that&apos;s actually a &quot;plus&quot; to some people  that it just fondly recalls a bunch of very, very familiar RPG mechanics and tropes. But everything about the game is profoundly generic. It&apos;s Baldur&apos;s Gate with less complicated game mechanics, a shorter running time, and a much flatter difficulty curve. You run fetch quests and click on things to fight them. You do this for eight hours. And then the game is over.
<br>
<br>I also had one complaint about the interface: I don&apos;t like the fact that the camera can only be rotated about ten degrees. I got the sense that the lack of camera control was simply based on the fact that neither of the game&apos;s creators knew how to draw faces  and if I&apos;m right, that&apos;s a very unfortunate reason.
<br>
<br>sh4dow, the first user to review this game, is not out in left field. The game&apos;s politics are rather glaring, and they&apos;re a problem. People get understandably upset when reviews are excessively political and agenda driven, reflecting only the author&apos;s personal pet peeves. But the thing is, this game wears its own social agenda right on its sleeve, so commenting on that social agenda is fair game.
<br>
<br>Most telling: from about the second act, you start finding Bibles hidden in the game. Not the scripture of some fictional religion; the actual Holy Bible, unabridged, chapter and verse. Why? What point does this serve? Driftmoon is supposedly set on some hypothetical moon, where dragons and magic exist. There is no Red Sea, no Jerusalem. What are Bibles doing here? I guess it&apos;s just the author&apos;s way of saying &quot;I&apos;m a Christian, I think you should be too, and I made my own game so I get to say that.&quot; We&apos;re being proselytized to.
<br>
<br>Other than the presence of the Bibles, the game doesn&apos;t exactly scream &quot;I am trying to convert you to Christianity,&quot; but there are a number of hints of that  like one of the main themes of the game being that eternal life can only exist in the hereafter, and the fact that the &quot;omniscient sage&quot; type character of the game is named Paul and I got a strong sense he was a reference to the Apostle Paul.
<br>
<br>Whether you consider this a political issue or not, the romance subplot is just a disaster. If you want to look at it apolitically, let&apos;s just say that the romance springs out of nowhere, it&apos;s poorly written, it&apos;s eye-rollingly genetic and forced, and there&apos;s absolutely no reason for it to be in there. If you do care about feminist issues, let&apos;s just say this romance contains enough sexist tropes to make Anita Sarkeesian lose her lunch. I can&apos;t really explain those without spoilers, but if you know anything about those tropes, you&apos;ll find them.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of really charming things about Driftmoon. I wanted to love it more than I did. I think my hopes were too high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driftmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3759517">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1. Excellent game balance
<br>
<br>The player can progress through the game at a steady pace.  No constant &#x201C;run here to pick up drops from dead enemies&#x201D;, &#x201C;run there to sell useless items to a merchant&#x201D;.
<br>
<br>Occasionally during the game, I worried &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to make it...I&#x2019;m not going to make it&#x201D;.  At that moment, Driftmoon provided some kind of welcome relief.
<br>
<br>In short, the game&#x2019;s developer is **very** empathetic towards the player.
<br>
<br>2. Puzzles
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;m not a big fan of puzzles in RPG games because they break up my &#x201C;hacking and slashing&#x201D; rhythm.
<br>
<br>In Driftmoon, the puzzles are perfect, adding another facet to the game&#x2019;s pleasant atmosphere.
<br>
<br>3. Waypoints
<br>
<br>As the player explores an area, Driftmoon **automatically** sets waypoints.
<br>
<br>Then, at moments when, in any other game, the player would think, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to trudge through there again&#x201D;, the player can simply display the local map and click on the desired waypoint to transfer immediately to a previous location.
<br>
<br>4. Font
<br>
<br>Silly, I know, but I really like the font that the developer used for text in Driftmoon.  Moreover&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve never seen it in any other game&#x2014;the player can adjust the font size via a slider.
<br>
<br>5. Feedback
<br>
<br>Driftmoon&#x2019;s developer welcomes feedback.  Throughout the game, the player can press the &#x201C;f&#x201D; key to display a feedback form.  The completed form is automatically sent to the developer along with, if the player desires, an automatically generated screenshot.
<br>
<br>Negative Features
<br>
<br>This review would seem like a marketing pitch (and I do recommend purchasing Driftmoon) if I didn&#x2019;t include some complaints:
<br>
<br>1. Even though the Mod Editor provides tooltips, the Mod Editor is **not** intuitively obvious to the uninitiated.  No documentation exists to explain its functions.
<br>
<br>2. The website of the game&#x2019;s developer, Instant Kingdom, needs a makeover.
<br>
<br>What do these two complaints have in common?  They show that the game&#x2019;s developer has focused attention on producing an excellent game rather than on secondary issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driftmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4111999">Expand</a></span>

Objects have to be dragged and interacted with in all sorts of ways like in few (if any) other RPGs. I guess that&apos;s why I believe the devs themselves have talked about it as more of an RPG adventure. I also appreciated the atypical monster characters (aside from one direct movie ripoff that was just too blatant).
<br>But what bothered me as an anti-religious egalitarian are the conservative values that permeate the game. From lots of holy scriptures, talking about the maker and whatnot to characters so typically girly that one might not even see them in some &quot;well-known sexist&quot; games. One may argue that in that fantasy setting, it would make sense for people to have such a traditional world view. But first of all... if you imagine a fantasy world, you can imagine anything. Secondly, that is precisely what a lot of RPGs have done over the years. AND I especially find it questionable because this game seems to be heavily targeted towards kids. If one was to make a Game of Thrones like fantasy RPG filled with chauvinist a-holes  (not that Driftmoon would be THAT extreme but still...) because that&apos;s just how that world is and is really more of a criticism of that attitude than an endorsement and one clearly markets it to an adult audience, why not. But in this case... personally, I wouldn&apos;t want my children to be influenced by such a conservative world views. But to enlightened, adult RPG lovers, I would recommend it with a grain of salt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driftmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3078515">Expand</a></span>
