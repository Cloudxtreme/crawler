<br>In general I&apos;ve had loads of fun with this game, but some of the bugs and broken mechanics makes it really frustrating at times.
<br>
<br>The best thing about it is the local coop against AI and playing online, why you can&apos;t play coop online beats me, that would instantly raise the score of the game in my book.
<br>Playing with a friend on the same PC using kb+mouse and a controller works great though, I even wish I had 2 controllers because using the controller is much more comfortable and speeds up the game, kb+mouse controls aren&apos;t as innovative and clicking and dragging takes longer than using the controller.
<br>
<br>The bugs and broken mechanics really brings this game down though.
<br>There&apos;s a bug in multiplayer online where the game freezes for both players when you use an artifact ability or sometimes when you sacrifice a creature which makes artifact abilities unusable.
<br>There&apos;s also the issue of wrong mana being used, which lost me a game once when I needed mana of a specific color and the game tapped the wrong land for me. Being able to choose which mana to tap should have been included from the start as an option for advanced users, or just a specific key you press when playing a card.
<br>
<br>Then there is the issue with time limit on your moves online, most often you will not have time to think and act if an opponent attacks with too many creatures at the same time, and it can be really hard to tell which creatures are blocking each other, even with just a few creatures attacking. With more than 10 on each side it becomes almost impossible..
<br>
<br>There has also been a lot of people bashing on the lack of deck-building, which I think is valid from their standpoint, but it&apos;s more of a relief for me.
<br>As a former Magic-nut I used to spend loads of cash building decks, getting boosters and looking up cards online to get the perfect fit for my deck, but that was years ago. I recently decided to get back into magic and play with a few close friends but with one rule, pre-made decks only.
<br>Building decks and tweaking them is too time consuming and way too expensive.
<br>
<br>I cannot say I would be against the ability to fully customize a deck, or even partly.
<br>But at the moment I feel that pre-made decks are a relief, since they are somewhat balanced, or at least I hope they are.
<br>And I don&apos;t have to spend loads of time theory crafting which cards to put in my deck, or be afraid of playing an opponent because they might have a really good deck with some crazy combos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers/user-reviews?user_review_id=1391539">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is no deck customization.  The decks make precons look cutting edge.   The only &quot;deck customization&quot; is through unlocking &quot;sideboard&quot; cards (great way to misinform new players by calling it a sideboard).  You can remove the &quot;sideboard&quot; cards, but you can&apos;t remove other cards to make room for it, so they just keep making your deck bigger (and adding more land).  You can keep your deck smaller by removing the sideboard cards, but since they&apos;re all way better than the garbage they give you by default it&apos;s pointless.  You just end up with 80 card decks with like 35 mana sources.  The game would be playable in this form, as just sort of a &quot;how magic used to be when I started playing&quot; simulator, except for one thing.  The game seems to pick and choose what rules it obeys.  It tends to do things like instantly go to your attack phase if you cast anything during your main phase, and skip your 2nd main phase, or not let you cast after blockers are declared.  If you&apos;re anything like me, within 20 minutes you&apos;ll find yourself screaming at the game.
<br>
<br>This game would have been much better if they&apos;d taken the old 1997 MTG pc game and made a windows 7 port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers/user-reviews?user_review_id=1452184">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Adding insult to injury, several of the constructed decks are _really_ bad, with no option to remove the junk cards; and the AI -- at the highest difficulty level -- makes amateurish mistakes, especially about timing. I appreciate that a good AI for a game like Magic is hard, but the quality of the AI is by no means adequate to make up for the huge, gaping hole where the deckbuilding is supposed to be.
<br>
<br>This is coming from an individual who&apos;s played in maybe five Magic tournaments total (one sealed-deck, the rest booster draft), and is by _no_ means an expert at the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381125">Expand</a></span>

If you compare it to the outside, sure it&apos;s highly nerfed version of the game, but if you look at it from a stand alone game perspective or even from a challenge point of view, it&apos;s a fun and challenging game, you&apos;ll be using your brain because you&apos;re not mowing your opponents down by the size of your wallet. The depending on the A.I. setting you choose, the AI will not be a pushover. Both sides are balanced and depending which deck you choose, You may steamroll them, get steamrolled or its a fair fight. The decks are all fairly balanced, there&apos;s the annoying overpowered elf deck of course, but even that has it&apos;s weak points. :P<br><br>The game also has some challenge scenarios where you must defeat the opponent in one turn, but those are usually fairly simple until the last few ones, which get a little trickier but nothing drastic.<br><br>At $10, you get 6 or 7 decks (maybe more, I&apos;ve bought the 2 expansions which ups it to 14 decks total) and as most of you guys knows, $10 will not buy you 7 decks in the real world and $20 will not buy you 14 decks. They also have two expansion packs at $5 a piece and .99 packs to unlock the ingame decks if you&apos;re lazy. Those who want to reminiscence about playing the game without reminding yourself how much you spent on Magic The Gathering Online or the thousands (Yes I&apos;ve spent that much over time) in real life, or hell, just to use to learn and get into the real game...pick it up, it&apos;s $10 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers/user-reviews?user_review_id=1369011">Expand</a></span>

Why not make it simpler, with more edibility and possibility for a faster gameplay. Also, you cannot chose what mana to use in combat, which renders some combos impossible, to your frustration. I played it a bit for a while, but found it so boring as you&apos;re set in a fixed position with no possibility to get something new out of the game (new decks, combos) and not to mention the bugged Two-headed giant is not playable, that I quit playing it. Do not buy it. Do not buy the 2012 edition either, it is not that different from this at all. I just don&apos;t understand how you can sell a game that has broken features and not fix it before you make a new game to sell.....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers/user-reviews?user_review_id=1942410">Expand</a></span>
