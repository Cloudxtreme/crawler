But a big warning to those following the story so far, this is quite one of the darkest episodes not just in Life is Strange, but in gaming in general. Instead of using buckets of blood and violence, The Dark Room bathes in creepiness, the unknown, and general paranoia of something much darker on the horizon. The beginning I have to admit however, is an emotional roller coaster, probably the best I&apos;ve ever experienced in a game so far because it harkens back to the relationship between Max and Chloe and manages to bring me to tears at several points in this Episode alone. Episode 4 more than the other 3 Episodes sees the culmination of your past choices and actually alter the little stories in the game rather than the overall arching narrative. What this Episode does absolutely right is setting up powerful scenes. I can recall at least three times within the 5 hour frame where I was ready to spill tears because of how wonderful of a job the VA for Chloe did. Also the shift to a darker tone while not an easy transition sells itself really well in letting you know something awful will occur. So what does EP4 stumble with? Well, for one, it&apos;s the least polished episode with numerous audio glitches, a broken time mechanic, and a certain sequence which really underwhelmed. But I do appreciate DontNod for adding to their gameplay by having Max do somewhat detective work even if it&apos;s just connect the dots esque. The music does not always hit the right notes, but when it does it keeps hounding you until the Episode has wrought you free of all your tear ducts. In many ways, Episode 4&apos;s shocking conclusion will set up to be what is most likely to be an ending for the ages in terms of video game storytelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-4---dark-room/user-reviews?user_review_id=5394028">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really do not want to spoil anything in this review, I&apos;ll just say the following:
<br>- Some photos are really hard to get
<br>- It is by far the longest episode in the series so far
<br>- It nicely combines elements from previous episodes and brings something new to the table (not gonna tell you ... :))
<br>
<br>- Certain portions of the story are kind of slow this time, though.
<br>- And there was no suspense moment throughout the episode, not counting the final scene.
<br>
<br>So, I&apos;d say it does not compare to the previous episodes.
<br>The first episode felt fresh and new and introduced all the characters and the premise of the story to us and did it in an amazing way that made me get interested in the whole plot. 9/10
<br>The second episode felt worse than the first one, but managed to get on the same level of the first one, as you could actually take part in the drama at the end of the second episode and the impact of your actions was really big. 9/10
<br>The third episode showed some new game play elements and the ending was simply amazing. 10/10
<br>The fourth episode follows in the footsteps of the third one, once again introducing some new game play elements and returning a few elements from other episodes, but fails in presenting any actually thrilling moment that you can have an impact on. Some puzzles are quite annoying and the middle part kind of drags on. 8/10
<br>
<br>But, do not let that discourage you, it is still an amazing episode in an amazing series of games, it&apos;s just ... not as good as Episodes 1-3.
<br>I&apos;m super excited for the final episode, though. It looks like things are going to get super interesting.
<br>
<br>Update (07.02.16):
<br>Having replayed Episode 4 I decided to increase the score by one point. It is still the weakest of the episodes, but I have had my share of fun with Episode 4 after knowing what to do in several puzzles that are in this episode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-4---dark-room/user-reviews?user_review_id=5399546">Expand</a></span>

Without trying to spoil much, Episode 4 gives everything us fans of Life is Strange have been wanting. The story gives more depth in things like characters, story, graphics, gameplay, and brought out the worst and good in people. The story was a roller coaster of emotions through sadness, joy, anger, and sadness again. The ending left me shocked and gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. Life is Strange: Episode 4 is an reason alone to buy the season pass to this game immediately. Good luck with episode 5 after what they have to live up with now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-4---dark-room/user-reviews?user_review_id=5397411">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Life is Strange is hands down the best interactive story I played so far. It feels like it targets a specific &quot;creative&quot; crowd, but that doesn&apos;t make it unappealing to everyone else. The story is very engaging, at times dark, and in the course of 4 episodes it escalated to some really unexpected events. I would easily give it a 10, if it wasn&apos;t for some mildly annoying graphic bugs on PC.</span>

<br>While it struggles to balance its plot, mechanics and characters, Life is Strange&apos;s penultimate episode is a gripping, action-packed thrill ride with superb leading voice performances. There&apos;s a lot for the final episode to wrap up, but this is already the best adventure game in years.</span>

But this episode has a distinctly darker and more mature tone right from the get-go. The beginning of the episode had me feeling a whole mess of emotions, from depressed to bittersweet.

I am very excited for the fifth episode, and I can&apos;t wait to see what happens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-4---dark-room/user-reviews?user_review_id=5434536">Expand</a></span>
