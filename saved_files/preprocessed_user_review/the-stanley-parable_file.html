I will say it&apos;s something that I believe most people should try once and then discuss with others, but it also seems over priced for how long each play-through is.  That being said there appears to be a lot of ways this game can be played and there might be more value in that.  Great game and achieves what it wanted to achieve.  For this reason it definitely deserves a high score.
<br>
<br>If it&apos;s on sale it&apos;s a must buy, but the current amount of $14.99 seems a bit to high for me to tell people to buy it. I don&apos;t know if I can recommend it at that price, so I gave it an 8/10 for that reason.  I recommend watching their wonderfully done trailers before buying, it will help in deciding if this is the type of game for you.  However, try to avoid &quot;Let&apos;s Play&quot; videos that show an entire run of the game.  This is all about the experience and it is quite a good one at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3644144">Expand</a></span>

I myself played around 2&#xBD; and went every path, discovering 95% of what the game has to offer. I looked it up so that&apos;s why I know that I missed two easter eggs. Overall the narrator was great. the gameplay nonexistent, but the experience humorous and interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&apos;t mind shorter experiences with no replay value. Once you have seen all the paths and endings there is no reason to ever play again as you discovered everything there is and then it just repeats itself. Good game, but nowhere near &apos;OMG best game eva, GOTY 2013!&apos; as many silly fan boys make it out to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3644500">Expand</a></span>

But it happened, and the Stanley&apos;s path is a wonderful journey of emotions, interactions and fun. For what seemed like hours, I was sitting back, and enjoying the narrative experience that the Stanley&apos;s Parable is. The truth was, the game is so rich and diverse in it&apos;s very core that it dragged me in it&apos;s story far more than it should. Everything about the game that needs to be executed properly, well... is. It exceeds my expectations of top-notch games with it&apos;s original approach to an original setting. The great factor about the Stanley Parable is it&apos;s terrific replay value. I couldn&apos;t believe how much fun could discovering all the endings be, as well as how funny and original many of the jokes and pun this game makes are. It is the first game this year that makes me really think about what it tries to present to the player, with it&apos;s clever monologues and great scripting. It is hard for me not to recommend this masterpiece to everyone I know, but I think YOU! will do. Good luck trying to exit the beautiful, simplistic world of The Stanley Parable, because I&apos;m still trapped in the room 427.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3642186">Expand</a></span>

Easy to get all endings within a few hours, and game quickly becomes pointless and worthless thereafter.  Definitely not worth its overinflated reviews or price.  Wait for a sale.</span>

According to Steam it kept me interested for 67minutes, until I realised I had in fact played through almost every ending available and there was literally nothing left to do. I feel completely ripped off as there is ZERO re-playability. You choose a path and listen to the narrator for 5-10 minutes...</span>

Maybe the professional reviewers were afraid to give it a low score, because they didn&apos;t want to have fingers pointed at them and people saying &quot;Ha, ha, they didn&apos;t get it&quot;. Or maybe the professional reviewers have no experience with good books, because breaking the 4th wall is nothing new, and random infantile events and parody in a story is something kids aged 8 are able to do.

<br>The concept is innovative and brilliant!
<br>I love how the Narrator voice (which is perfectly interpreted) is fundamental to the fun (and it really demonstrates you that, in some occasions, literally).
<br>It&apos;s even philosophical at some points.
<br>It&apos;s a mature game that can really teach you something or at least make you think.

<br>Sure the game is short, but it blew my mind, it did things that completely baffled me. It is a great experience that everyone who loves video games should play. People who think that in order for a video game to be good you need a gun, should not play this game.... this experience is a lot deeper than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3869181">Expand</a></span>

But the Stanley Parable is something which, ironically, EVERY gamer should at least consider, even though it&apos;s a very controversial one. No, you&apos;re not going to get some super-amazing all-in-one experience. Nor are you going to get the longest or most exciting &quot;game&quot;. Nor is there any notion of GAMEPLAY. However, this piece of art illustrates the problem of having no gameplay altogether. It&apos;s weird and wonderful. It&apos;s repetitive yet different every time. It&apos;s easy to understand yet infinitely complex. The game can be interpretted in so many ways, and there is so much to discover behind its seemingly shallow exterior, I can&apos;t recommend it enough if you&apos;re looking for something that will entertain you in ways you couldn&apos;t have imagined. What is perhaps most commendable about The Stanley Parable isn&apos;t the whole &quot;game within a game within a game&quot; concept, but its presentation. The slick narration combined with sharp graphics and incredible attention to detail as well as a whole host of secrets, twists, pathways and endings to discover make it feel longer than it actually is. You might get bored of it after a few hours, but those first few crucial moments are something that can&apos;t be experienced anywhere else. It&apos;s a rich experience but one that isn&apos;t so muddled that it&apos;s difficult to make progress. Exploration of what seems to be an extremely linear game is very rewarding because the narrator speaks to you personally. The comedy value as well as the unique concept make The Stanley Parable a stand-out piece of entertainment that can&apos;t be expressed through any other medium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=4104859">Expand</a></span>

The Stanley Parable also has a lot of replay-ability, because there are so many different ending. Definitely a game for everyone that enjoys having their brain confused at times.</span>

It breaks the fourth-wall with good use. You will lose many hours to this games depth. There are extra dialog options by doing nothing. There are almost and infinite amount of things to do along the game. It is not only a game; It is more creative. I can even go to say that it isn&apos;t a game more so than it is a digital narrative journey. But the only way to truly appreciate the games attention to detail is to play the game. [spoiler]    One of the options in a path is literally to unplug a cord to a phone as it rings. Another is where you just enable cheats in the game console. Then the narrator just puts you in a room with a table and keeps coming back to the point of how long he looked at tables to find the most serious table, and that the matter of enabling the cheats is a very serious matter and he must take action against it because he fears for you. Another time you stand in a broom closet and he first openly mocks the character then directly says the reason you are standing in the closet doing nothing is because the person playing has suddenly died- where he then yells to grab the attention of anyone listening to say you (The player) are dead. There are so many things to do it is crazy. This game offers more than just enjoyment, it offers and experience that no other game can offer you. This game is one of the best I have ever played and well worth the money spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3722903">Expand</a></span>

This game is amazing, seriously, it encourages you to do things, that you wouldn&apos;t do in any other games, I&apos;m trying to keep this as spoiler-free as I can, but, anything you say will spoil the multitude of choices that are laid out before you, you just have to figure out how to get to them. The game will reward you for thinking outside of the box, It will change you as a gamer. It will change you to the point, that you will begin to almost ignore the main path of a game and explore in search of alternate paths you could go down. Basically, we play as a man named Stanley, who is guided throughout his adventure by a voice, similar to that of LittleBigPlanet. We can choose whatever path we like, from listening to the &quot;Narrator&quot; (as he&apos;s referred to), to locking ourselves in a broom closet. Great game, worth the 11 Euro. This game gets a well deserved 10/10 from me. I encourage you to try the game for yourself and see how many endings you can find. And remember  &quot;The end is never the end, the end is loading&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3816380">Expand</a></span>

TSP is a story driven first-person novel game, if you will, in which you could be Stanley, an average joe with the most boring job in history. One day, the eternal monotony of his (or your) job is broken, and Stanley (or you) is then your avatar in a conundrum of doors, buttons, ferns, the Line(tm) and the number eight. Kevan Brighting&apos;s dry yet witty referential narration, its whirling mass of pokes and jokes at scripted narrative events and choice systems in general, is something to behold. Get friends and family to experience TSP&apos;s witty self-aware humor and the fun never stops. Simple xinput support means that a mouse and keyboard aren&apos;t the only way to proceed. And graphically, it&apos;s a treat, using the Portal 2 incarnation of the much loved Source engine, with graphical enhancements abound.

Stanley Parable is an experience. An experience that all gamers should have. Don&apos;t bother if you play this title 1 hour or 100, it&apos;s a personal adventure built by a genial team. This game is worth all the money it costs, and it&apos;s really cheap btw.</span>

<br>That being said, it is a very fun and funny game. I really enjoyed seeing all the content that it had to offer, even if I had to look up how to do a lot of it. I won&apos;t go into its plot or even the game mechanics, since that might be a slight spoiler.
<br>
<br>I will say that if you like Portal or similar type games (and have an open mind about what games should be), you will like this. I don&apos;t mean that Portal didn&apos;t have substance, because it did.
<br>
<br>Also, $15 bucks is a bit much for a MAX 2-3 hour game, with little replay-ability beyond showing friends. It is a good game worth playing, though. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=4043604">Expand</a></span>

<br>Simply because it&#x2019;s really funny and interesting. The story of Stanley is well made and while you are playing the narrator that tells the story usually tells a joke or restarts the game.
<br>
<br>Whenever the narrator restarts the game, you get more addicted to the game and you want to discover another ending. However, the game restarts too much .The graphics are decent too. The Stanley Parable also talks about games. I recommend to the world this game, because everyone will enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994542">Expand</a></span>

The most stressful ending was countdown ending(the one that you turn the machine on.).

This isn&apos;t a game based around interesting gameplay or action-packed sequences and setpieces.  I hesitate to even call it story-focused.  The truth is that this game turns the notion of choice in gaming on its head.  It makes you look at what choice actually means and why it, in the end, can&apos;t actually exist in a video game.
<br>For a game with such a philosophical bent, The Stanley Parable has a lot of charm to it.  The narration has the dry wit and dark humor of Portal, and it carries itself with just the right parts levity and mocking derision that you can&apos;t help but laugh at yourself.  It&apos;s like being on the receiving end of a particularly well executed, well timed, but well meaning practical joke.
<br>I beg you if you have gotten this far to try this game.  It isn&apos;t much cost-wise and it, above all, deserves to be played.  Keep in mind what it&apos;s about, and you will have a great time.
<br>All that being said, though, there are a few things that could have been improved.  While it is a good game, there isn&apos;t a lot of it.  I would say that it &quot;doesn&apos;t overstay its welcome,&quot; but I would have liked it to stick around a while longer.  There are some secrets and achievements (each of which mocking the concepts they represent nicely), but there isn&apos;t much reason to play this game after you&apos;ve seen every ending.  This is not a full release title, however, and we shouldn&apos;t be expecting 20+ hours of gameplay from this.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Deep, well thought out meaning
<br>- Incredible Humor
<br>- Unique
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Short</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=4039927">Expand</a></span>

And it was worth the money. Stanley Parable is not a normal game like another First Person game, it has its own shelf, its own category, the best way to say it short, its a fantastic special game. The game has really many different endings, and feels like, you&#xB4;re in a commentary, or even a book written on the choices you choose. The game is not the best graphics game that you&#xB4;re gonna see, but its really easy to run, and you&#xB4;re not gonna think about the graphics, but about the story you&#xB4;re making. The game isn&#xB4;t an action game, its a relaxing game, you can sit when you&#xB4;re bored. You can&#xB4;t really tell anything about the story, or the game itself, without its a spoiler. The game has a really, really good telling, even when im played the game, and i made sometimes the sad endings or something, i felt like, i was touched.
<br>Final word: Buy the game if you like relaxing Indie Games, and you love where you interact to the choices, and even make your own story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106402">Expand</a></span>

The dialogue from the narrator was condescending but I thought it was hilarious and found myself responding to his dialogue through the choices I made. At one point he pissed me off enough that I refused to listen to any of his directions and that gave me a rather interesting ending. That is, in my opinion, the essence of the Stanley Parable: making a decision whether to obey or disobey. In a way, the game challenges not only the existence of Stanley but it also forces you to consider how your own life is similar to the way this game is played. It is at once both unnerving and impressive that a game can force so much philosophical, existential dogma down your throat while you listen to the same intro time and time again.
<br>
<br>I personally enjoyed finding all the different endings and to see which one I liked best. That being said, the frustration and mental exhaustion is real. Never has a game actually made me feel so mentally exhausted due to repetition and tedium. While the narrator was hilarious, his dialogue got more and more irritating as I got more tired. I would highly recommend to play this game in one sitting. If you are someone who loves to explore and seek out the unknown then I would highly suggest you try this game out. If you are someone who is impatient and needs instant gratification then you may struggle with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=5429189">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s interesting and funny but only for a short period of time I&apos;ve finished almost every ending possible it took me a massive 2 hours to complete. So if you want to pay for a good laugh (however very short) this is the game for you.</span>

<br>
<br>Ok... but the problem is that it&apos;s just simply not fun to play. You are just walking in a big museum of absurd comedy. At times, it can be brilliant and make you laugh, but also repetitive, annoying, and not really revolutionary. Since there is no real gameplay involved, you might as well save yourself the 10 bucks and just watch someone play it on youtube. Because for only 2 hours of content, the price of the game is even more absurd than it&apos;s art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3925143">Expand</a></span>

This is an extremely overrated title that shouldn&apos;t warrant any cost.  The concept is quirky and the narrative amusing but it feels as if these are factored in to cover up the sheer linearity of the game. You basically play an office worker called Stanley and the voice-over story depicts his life and job.  You can either follow the story how it is told or go your own way which impacts the person telling the story.  This can be humorous but it&apos;s hardly up there with Steven Merchant from Portal 2. You can complete the game in many different ways and even in under 5 minutes.  There is bascially nothing to this &apos;game&apos; apart from the narrative and a few corridors. There is no depth or ingenious moments that really stand out like we have seen in many other budget games or mods.
<br>
<br>The Stanley Parable has joined the growing list of indie/arcade titles that cost money and are give huge plaudits from the media but are actually poor attempts at conveying a game. Developers should be judged on their product solely and not taking into account factors surrounding development or the budget it cost to make the game.  This is a poor, pricey and tedious attempt of a mod and the fact the game has a price-tag is shocking.  The narrative saves it in some way but if you want to experience this title; just watch a few YouTube videos of the game in action.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3842764">Expand</a></span>

While I&apos;m certainly not against games that will abstract themselves from the traditional gaming paradigms, I demand that they remain GAMES, NOT STATEMENTS ABOUT GAMES. And so, don&apos;t be fooled by that pseudo-wisecrack-british-accent narrator that&apos;ll accompany you all along the way: The Stanly Parable is a statement about games that, in itself, is a poor game.
<br>
<br>In the end, it&apos;s really no wonder that this title has received such a high critical acclaim; it&apos;s indie, it&apos;s unconventional, it&apos;s a game about games, it&apos;s pure critic&apos;s dog food. Let me hammer it again: it&apos;s not enough to step out of the traditional gaming paradigms just for the sake of it, you still have to make a game. This is what Anti-Chamber did, this is what Telltale did with (love it or not) with Walking Dead, this is what Miasmata did; those game stepped out of the conventional path and yet, they stand by themselves.
<br>
<br>And then you have your Andy Warhol games: The Stanley Parable, Gone Home (a very bland experiment in cheap empathy) and Dear Esther (that thing is so pompous I tried 3 times to spend more than an hour in front of it without feeling like I&apos;m watching the English Patient).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3803208">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m still convinced that game rated high as people didn&apos;t want to look like they weren&apos;t hip or able to appreciate it.
<br>So is this the same? Or does the narration make it worthwhile?
<br>if tis just a good story then fair enough...</span>

The irony of the story line is simply superb. If you are an action junkie, then this might not be for you, but those who enjoy a fulfilling, cerebral experience, then this is a must. To say more would not do it justice, just buy it. Buy it now.</span>

In fact, I am not sure if this could be seen as a game in normal sense for it lacks much of what is gameplay and focuses on your mind and your thoughts instead. Filled with jokes within jokes hurled into a big bucket of creativity can be hard to spot if not giving attention. If one finds themselves bored or perhaps confused the natural thing would be to push away. If you let this one go, you may have lost many thoughts worth bearing with you.
<br>
<br>All I can do is connect it with Monthy Python, not everyone gets the joke, because there is often ain&apos;t a joke but the situation itself. The only thing that is lacking is the playtime. Some would be foolish and rush within a couple of hours but to really get it all you have to spend about 5 hours on it at least.
<br>From an artistic point of view this could have a reason, nevertheless I could just be wanting more.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s one in a shortlist of games that could be described as &quot;as close to a perfect game as is possible to create&quot;, a shortlist including the likes of Portal (the first Portal, that is) and Anti-chamber.
<br>
<br>The Stanley Parable is quite a short game, but objectively one of the best video games ever made... And I literally mean *objectively*.
<br>
<br>If you compared this to the hundreds of games I have played in my entire life, all my most beloved games on which I spent tens or hundreds of hours on each...
<br>Games I hold far more dearly to my heart than The Stanley Parable...
<br>Games which have given me far more fun than The Stanley Parable...
<br>I could only honestly rate those games as 9/10.
<br>
<br>In a mere 5 hours of playtime from start to 100% completion The Stanley Parable is the one game that I could truthfully give a 10/10.
<br>
<br>Now that may make me sound like some pretentious hipster, but I regularly indulge in and fall in love with games that are super-mainstream, as well as more-indie games that I adore despite them objectively more closely resembling a glitchy pile of faeces than a video game.
<br>
<br>The Stanley Parable features the best narration you&apos;ll ever hear in your life and an extremely self-aware, incredible breakdown of what video games are as a whole.
<br>
<br>The game will make you feel curious, ashamed, awe-struck, annoyed, excited, terrified, ecstatic, sad, confused and hopeful seamlessly throughout every playthrough dependent entirely upon the many choices you make.
<br>
<br>If you have not played the game yet, then please immediately play the demo, then buy the full game and play that.
<br>
<br>Stop reading this review and do it, right now.
<br>
<br>Seriously. I mean it.
<br>
<br>Stop reading.
<br>
<br>Go play it.
<br>
<br>Now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3882071">Expand</a></span>

I just never got the sense of freedom and choice that the reviewers raved about; there are many choices you can make, sure, but you&apos;re never really &quot;free&quot;. Everything is written, and that&apos;s honestly the feeling I got from it. Warren Spector (the lead on Deus Ex) once talked about how he could watch people play his game and come up to solutions to problems that he&apos;d never thought about- that&apos;s the definition of a gameplay-choice driven game to me. The Stanley Parable tries to pull this off, but ultimately, it&apos;s just leading you down a path, no matter what. The Stanley Parable is more just the ILLUSION of choice wrapped in a well-written, humorous narrative. It&apos;s nothing like it tries to make itself seem, and it suffers greatly for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3977495">Expand</a></span>

To me, this is very refreshing compared to some games that are just mind numbing violence and actions.  Please keep in mind, this is not everyone cup of tea.  If you are on the fence in purchasing, play the demo.  The humor is great and you will fall in love it.</span>

I&apos;ve experienced the incredible story of the Kingdom Hearts series, The amazing immersion of the Half Life series, the beautiful narration of Thomas Was Alone and the stupid crazy fun of games like Just Cause 2. Thoughout my many years as a full time gamer I&apos;ve only considered 1 game to be perfect, and that number has now become 2. The Stanley Parable is a perfect game. I could seriously write an enormous review but I really can&apos;t go into too much detail as it&apos;s something you need to experience rather than have explained to you. I will say that this game features an incredibly immersive environment. I was focused in more than I have been in any game of the past 2 years. The narration is amazing. There were points in the game where I was pissing myself laughing and some points where I was locked in a deep train of thought. My only issue with this game is that it&apos;s too short. After 2 hours I completed all the endings (My favorite was the broom closet ending) and it really left me hungry for more. I do hope we see some more content added in later on. Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I really really really recommend you pick up this game as it is an absolute gem and will leave you with a message that I personally will never forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=3655774">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its a friggin walking simulator. And thats it.
<br>There are 18 possible endings, but they are pretty similar apart from 4-5 of them. Wont spoil it for you guys. My first 2-3 runs were entertaining, the narrator did a great job with the voice overs. But after 1 hour of playing.... the game became a chore. Its extremely repetitive, hearing the same long ass dialogus over and over JUST TO DISCOVER  the alternate endings.
<br>Apart from like 5 endings, the remaining 13 endings are bland and repetitive. in fact they shouldn&apos;t even be counted as proper endings.
<br>i&apos;m giving it a ZERO not to offset the biased overall score, bt because this game ACTUALLY deserves a ZERO for charging me $15 for  0.99cent gameplay</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-stanley-parable/user-reviews?user_review_id=4055445">Expand</a></span>
