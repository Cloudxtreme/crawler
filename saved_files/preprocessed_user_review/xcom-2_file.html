<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>1) Terrible performance/optimization. The game run terribly for a lot of people (if not everyone) even if you have a good rig. I have a GTX 970, i7 3.4ghz, 12GB RAM. I could even turn all of the graphical settings to the absolute bare minimum and even though the game looks ugly it STILL would not run completely smoothly and would have FPS dips. Also, every time enemies are triggered there are awkward ~3 second pauses which ruins the flow of things. This is the worst problem for me because it affects your enjoyment of everything.
<br>
<br>2) Line of sight issues. Some walls, floors, and roofs in the game do not properly block line of sight. This is especially evident in the urban city maps when you are trying to be on roofs. Firaxis should not have release the game with these issues in place.
<br>
<br>3) Chrysallids aren&apos;t the only bugs that will make you have a bad time. The game has numerous bugs and glitches. Some are as bad as completely ruining saves SO DO NOT TURN ON IRONMAN MODE (just do honest man instead). Others include animations not playing, damage numbers not showing, and etc.
<br>
<br>4) Some questionable/bad design choices: For example, you&apos;ll get voice over messages from a person during missions. He will say the exact same thing every mission and he says these things very often and the whole time he&apos;s talking you aren&apos;t allowed to do anything. So you have to sit there waiting, doing nothing while he says the same thing you&apos;ve heard him say or the 20th time. Another example, the new HP bars are inferior to Enemy Unknown.
<br>
<br>5) Debatable: the music is worse than EU. This is of course subjective and some people think the music is good or is fine, but I&apos;m pretty sure more people would agree that EU&apos;s music was superior.
<br>
<br>6) Debatable: the majority of missions involve timers or scenarios that force you to rush/run and gun. I&apos;m on the fence on this issue. Some people say they&apos;re fine and people need to &quot;git gud and not rely on overwatch crawling&quot;. I agree that XCOM should be very difficult and the  round limits did make for some exciting escapes. I think though I would&apos;ve preferred that instead of the vast majority of missions being about being fast and praying you don&apos;t trigger 3+ pods, that there be more missions with more lenient timers but with some other kind of difficulty that isn&apos;t rushing against the clock.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>Aside from the above, the game improves on EU in most every other aspect. The game could&apos;ve been a real work of art if it didn&apos;t suffer from these issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6075266">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am a long time Turn based game player.  I thought Xcom:Enemy within was one of the best games i played in a long time .   The long war add on/ expansion made it one of the best games I ever played (After some minor ini editing)  I managed to beat  the regular game on hard and long war on classic so im pretty good at the strategy games so when i say the following its with experiance and wisdom ;
<br>
<br>The devs took WAY to much of a page from the long war guys.  Long war was made to be super hard but fun and while that what all the hard cores liked it was only 100k people that played it. Normally i am made about games catering to the masses and dumbing things down.  But this time they took the opposite approach cator to the super hardcore.  I am playing on normal (classic)  and getting my ass handed to me at some points.
<br>
<br>First the games power creep for the bad guys so out paces you there are some points where a single unit can all of a sudden show up and if your not perfectly prepared for it it will wipe out half your squad on its own with your whole squad trying to take it out (I am looking at you Andy)   This should not be again about following the perfect single path to get things done.
<br>
<br>So great you can try to play a bit more conservatively right....NOPE they put a timer on everything.  A very short one that makes you constantly rush forward using very little startegy  , often needing to rush through over watch or into areas you know where you will trigger another pod of bad guys while still fighting the first to reach the objective before the time runs out.  So its a Tactics game that forces you to use limited tactics and rush most the time.  When your not rushing the enemy i can basicly 1 hit your best guy with the best gear.
<br>
<br>Now the 2 things I have seen in other reviews that people try to counter 1) Probably not researching the right stuff)   But seriously its not fun if you HAVE to follow a set path . Maybe i shouldnt of focused on weapons as much.
<br>2) you can mod the timers: Mods should not be a fix for a base game, they should be there to make a good game better.
<br>
<br>I should not be losing 4 out 6 guys on normal when not rushing when i can beat the other one on Hard/Iron-man with less losses .
<br>
<br>I just want a game that is a fun turn based strategy game that doesn&apos;t punish you for not following the exact perfect building/ research paths.
<br>
<br>Slow the game down a bit...less power creep , longer research maybe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073780">Expand</a></span>

Yeah, that&apos;s the entire game now. Nearly every mission is complete and utter frustration as you try to savescum your way through the map to find where you need to go.
<br>
<br>The tactics in the game are just as solid as before, but with this completely forced speed on every level, I never felt comfortable actually trying the new stealth or ambush mechanics, because they took longer to complete than just sprinting around the map, trying to avoid the instant game over time limit.
<br>
<br>Once there&apos;s a mod to remove this, I&apos;ll get it. Until then, they&apos;ve turned the game into a frustrating slog.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070332">Expand</a></span>

XCom 2 is, unfortunately, a letdown. It&apos;s still a decent game, but terribly flawed. My most pressing issue with the game is that most of the missions now apply time-pressure to the player - which, when uses from time to time, like in XCOMEU, is a nice twist - but having a turn limit in 3 out of 4 missions spoils the core, tactical gameplay. It forces you to push forward instead of following your own style and/or strategy. It also spoils the new concealment feature, which else would have been a great addition. While there are, no doubt, also some positive changes and additions, like a greater enemy diversity than ever and (most importantly) dynamically generated maps, there are also further drawbacks, even if none of them is as bad as the mission design. One to mention should be the terrible performance of the game - while the game looks good, it&apos;s really nothing special. And that&apos;s fine, XCom does not need to be a visually stunning game on the bleeding edge of technology. But still, it pushes even higher end hardware to its limits. To me, it seems this is what the developers meant by the advantages of targeting PC only: the ability to be lazy in optimizing your game as you can always push the player to invest into expensive hardware instead investing in a decent performing game yourself. But the main flaw, again, is the time-pressuring mission design, sucking all creative fun out of the gameplay most of the time. I happily prefer XCOMEU which much less sophisticated visuals and pre-defined map layouts anytime over XCOM 2. Because XCom is not about graphics, it&apos;s about gameplay - and this is the area where Firaxis unfortunately underperformed the most.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070707">Expand</a></span>

<br>so, whats wrong here, why low score?
<br>
<br>- graphic: better than previous game, there&apos;s much more objects and scenery, so maps will look very different. Also, they are created right before you go in, so every time it will be different (not sure if this is true for story missions, didn&apos;t start new game). But its not great, its pretty but technically lacking. And hardware requirement is simply unimaginable for turn based strategy. You need a beast to play it without frame drops and on high details. That&apos;s just bad optimization.
<br>
<br>- gameplay: this title should be named: &quot;xcom 2: prepare to die&quot;. Cause you will. A lot. In some missions I have to reload various saves for 3 hours in order to finally keep all team alive. Now, in my book this would be a good thing since in first xcom from 2k I didn&apos;t have a need for more soldiers, only dead were first 2 (or 3?) from tutorial. Game starts moderately difficult for first few hours, but then ramps up considerably. So whats the problem? Game isn&apos;t hard because enemies are smart or tactical in approach. They simply have way better stats than your soldiers and they outnumber you 4:1. The most basic trooper will hit you from 20 tiles away behind hard cover on elevated position with no problem whatsoever. 8 out of 10 times. Sectoids will wreak havoc in your ranks since their psionic hit chance is 100% and since you will be wounded in almost every mission your willpower will be nonexistent. Alien rangers can run up to you from beyond your field of vision and hit you with a sword.
<br>And forget about hiding behind the wall, they will shoot straight trough it. While I first thought this is cool idea since even weapons of today can shoot trough walls with no problem, later i realized that they don&apos;t have any penalties for shooting where they cannot see you. Also, they can shoot trough solid rock or cliffs like it is a wall. Their crit chance is waaaaay better than yours.
<br>It&apos;s actually very bad idea to try and remain concealed for too long because all enemies walk towards you (I tried this for several hours, they don&apos;t have patrol routes, they walk towards you), and if you delay action, you will be swarmed eventually. If you put all your squad on overwatch and then start combat with last one, you will lose 1 turn of action (this must be bug, so i guess it will be repaired).
<br>
<br>On a bright side there is still that good old &quot;just one more turn&quot; feeling, and i really hope that they will repair some obvious bugs with fields of vision.
<br>For a die hard fan of the series: go for it! For casual strategy gamer: wait 6 months &apos;till they update and optimize it, and buy it on sale. For non-strategy gamer: nothing to see here :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070132">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is definitely not optimized.  It performs poorly on my above-average rig and has tons of graphical glitches, choppy cut-scenes and inexplicable pauses in game-play. I hope they will fix most of these issues with some patches later on.
<br>
<br>If you enjoyed XCOM 1 with a gamepad, skip this one as they have dropped gamepad support.  This is really infuriating because they had excellent gamepad support in the last game.  So they actually took it out of the engine. It does support Steam controllers, if you have one of those.  I bought one; it&apos;s not great.  Almost every action requires using the trackpad like a mouse. They&apos;ve totally missed the point of a gamepad .
<br>
<br>It&apos;s pretty disappointing to see such a sloppy sequel to an awesome game.  I am sure it will get better over time.  Once they patch out the graphical and performance issues and patch in proper gamepad support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070935">Expand</a></span>

Most of it comes from the randomness that exists as its core mechanic, from the level design (procedural), to hit chances, to turn limit sizes, to world map events. Whether you&apos;ll like it or not depends on what you want out of it.
<br>
<br>Personally, I&apos;d prefer a more tightly designed game that is harder than this (more enemies in maps +bigger maps +more &quot;puzzle-y&quot; encounters), but without the timers and stress and RNG everywhere. I&apos;d rather have developer-designed maps and missions with tough encounters where you need to utilize the terrain and your equipment in the right way, rather than proceduraly generated missions with a turn limit that is barely enough for you to sprint to the objective and destroy it, and then pray as the 4 pods that you aggroed along the way rain down on you from the ceilings and wipe out your entire squad while your overwatches miss. Only to go back to the world map and see the Avatar gaining its 3rd ping in the same week due to RNG dark events.
<br>
<br>XCOM 2 is overwhelming in a way that makes you feel helpless. Because you are. Better read some Reddit threads and restart the whole thing, doing only the absolutely most optimal things. Why do the rest of the options exist again?
<br>
<br>You can mod out all the crazy 8 turn limits and massive random spikes in Avatar progress though. Great. What you are left with then is an extremely easy game. Guess why. Because that&apos;s what it is. An extremely easy game, made hard only through RNG rigged to screw you as a core design philosophy. The encounters themselves are easy and the maps are poorly designed, like everything procedural. There&apos;s no actual depth. There are no &quot;damn, I&apos;m a genious&quot; moments as you lure an overwhelming force back to a well fortified position with half of your squad lying in the perfect ambush. The game gives you no time to think. No time to strategize. No time to have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073050">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>&quot;I&apos;ll teach you. You can be the white knights of X-Com, I shall be the black Advent aliens.&quot;
<br>
<br>They started playing.
<br>
<br>&quot;Ha, I&apos;ve got you now!&quot; the commander said, grinning, as his knight attacked the colonel&apos;s bishop.
<br>
<br>&quot;Not so fast! First we need to spin this.&quot; The colonel pointed to a roulette wheel that came in the box. &quot;You see, whether a piece can take another piece is random! Fun!&quot;
<br>
<br>The commander seemed unsure about this concept. &quot;That makes no sense,&quot; he said. &quot;My knight is clearly right in front of that bishop, and he is well trained, so why would he not succeed? Ah, whatever, just spin the damn wheel.&quot;
<br>
<br>A few minutes later, the commander&apos;s peasant moved close to the colonel&apos;s queen. Quickly, the colonel moved several pieces out of the way and placed a new knight on the board, which defeated the commander&apos;s peasant. The colonel was so into the game that he did all this in slow motion, like a kid playing with action figures.
<br>
<br>&quot;What the hell did you just do, soldier?!&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s a rule,&quot; the colonel said excitedly. &quot;The black advents get free moves while it&apos;s your turn to play, and some newly appearing pieces even get to hit your pieces without the roulette wheel most of the time!&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;Are you kidding me?!&quot; the commander said, an incredulous look on his face. &quot;This is not a strategy game if you have random events like this. And in a turn-based game, pay attention to whose turn it is! Oh, and for the love of advent burgers, stop with the slow motion and killing animations already! You&apos;re wasting my time!&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;Sorry, commander, but these are the rules! You chicken? If you&apos;d like, you can just reload your piece and try the same turn again until the outcome suits you. Hmm, come to think of it...basing a game on a probabilistic scheme should always lead people to reload, which means any such system ends up being tedious and no fun for most players. Ha! This is pretty dumb game design, ha ha ha!&quot; The colonel beamed anyway, pretending it was just difficult and challenging.
<br>
<br>&quot;I don&apos;t need no frickin reload!!&quot;
<br>
<br>They continued playing, the commander getting more and more frustrated with the strange rules of the game. Despite all odds, he ended up devising an ingenious strategy, circumnavigating the defenses of his subordinate, when suddenly ...
<br>
<br>&quot;Ooh, well,&quot; the colonel said. &quot;You lose.&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;What?&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;It has been 15 turns, and you have not defeated me yet, so you lose,&quot; the colonel explained. &quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you? The white knights of X-Com only get a few turns to win the match. I already cheated on your behalf and gave you 7 more turns than normal.&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;What in the absolute hell?!&quot; the commander yelled. &quot;That is the dumbest thing I&apos;ve heard since the incident with the microwave casserole at Black Mesa! On the one hand, I am supposed to devise a strategy to avoid your stupid rules, but on the other hand, you give me no time to do so and waste half of that with roulette! This is not chess, this is not a strategy game, this is a casino!&quot;
<br>
<br>The colonel frowned and took a closer look at the box of the game. &quot;Warning: May cause gambling addiction,&quot; he read. &quot;Oh, so that&apos;s why I&apos;m so hooked on this thing... Anyway, this casino-chess-simulator comes with a story, but it consists of many, many nearly identical matches like this, more time limits and forced gameplay, and I will also be compelled to explain your goal in every match as if you didn&apos;t know it already.&quot; The colonel smiled brightly. &quot;We can try that, if you like -- you know, for the benefit of the story!&quot;
<br>
<br>The commander sighed. &quot;Is the story any good, at least? Proper characters that grow and change as the plot unfolds? A fine ending with a shocking twist, a clever idea at its base and an emotionally significant boss battle?&quot;
<br>
<br>&quot;Hmm...&quot; The colonel&apos;s face fell a little. &quot;Actually, at the end, I&apos;m just going to throw a large number of pieces on the board for you to defeat, after which I shall act out a meaningless cutscene. The characters have as much personality as a sea slug and come from the planet of hats. Nothing else to it, I&apos;m afraid. On the bright side, these chess pieces and the board are visually really impressive!&quot;
<br>
<br>At that moment, a piece glitched through the table and fell in a stuttering motion to the floor.
<br>
<br>&quot;Alright, that&apos;s it!&quot;, the commander yelled as he stood up. &quot;I&apos;ve had it with you and your badly designed games! We are going to use this one for target practice tomorrow! Star Wars Battlefront - The Board Game Edition, is relieved of this position immediately!&quot;

<br>- There&apos;s basicaly no height advantage since everyone can see everyone and aim perfectly through the roofs, walls etc.. more than ridiculous.
<br>- Patrols are triggered without seeing you, only because your guy noticed them 5 miles away
<br>- You noticed the enemy? Don&apos;t worry you won&apos;t get any tactical advantage since they always see you as well, get a free turn to position themselves behind covers. Lazy lazy programming and &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; design.
<br>- Removed secondary weapons because too much tactical depth. You have to reload your plastic guns every few turns.
<br>- There&apos;s nothing that makes sense for this game being a PC exclusive, as it&apos;s basicaly an overall dumbed down experience.
<br>- They were praising Long War all this time, but made basically no changes to the overall formula. There was a massive amount of improvements in Long War that they were very much unable to include in the sequel.
<br>- Turn timers for each mission...
<br>- No optimalization aka game runs like &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;
<br>- 3 of my soldiers were killed by exploding walls while shooting in the overwatch stance
<br>- Awesome Enemy Unknown music was replaced by a stereotypical hollywood strings.
<br>- You can&apos;t realistically hide in this game, because even if you are positioned behind a solid concrete building, waiting to ambush an enemy, you are instantly exposed and being shoot through the walls.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t even imagine what kind of people design their games in firaxis. It&apos;s just unreal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070056">Expand</a></span>

<br>4. Have several bases around the world, because aliens have conquered Earth and...? and they are so many there is no way to put up a base even in Antarctica or Gobi desert?
<br>5. Have a fighting team of more than 6 elements, because now you are a guerrilla leader, and...?
<br>6. Research more projects simultaneously, because you had several base with several laboratories and several teams, like it should logically be, and now your scientists can only work on one project at time, because...?
<br>7. Take enemies by surprise, catching them from behind, and now you can do it, but only once during concealment phase, then surprise a hidden enemy  is no more possible, because when discovered, enemies automatically see you and go in cover mode.
<br>8. Plan you tactical battles carefully, using overwatch and advancing slowly to minimize risks, like every good soldier should do, and now it&apos;s too often not possible because you are on a turn limit that forces you to dash under enemy fire, because urgency really makes a game more tactical, or so the experts say.
<br>9. Have tanks fight alongisde human soldiers, using them as disposable scouts, mobile covers and heavy artillery, and now....?
<br>10. Have a balance in enemies progress, and now you have aliens who can revive their comrades and mind trick your soldiers in 2nd-3rd mission, because the world out there is cruel, and kids must learn frustration and videogames are the best Teachers.
<br>
<br>And I&apos;m not even going to list all the bugs and glitches. Others have done it well enough.

<br>TL:DR
<br>
<br>In some ways, better than EU but still no way near as good as the originals and without mods to rebalance the game, you&apos;ll find it frustrating.  Firaxis needs to do better with this franchise, and as always don&apos;t listen to most of the critics and 10/10 reviewers, this is strictly for the fans of the reboot.
<br>
<br>After being a fan of the original trilogy, let me rephrase that as a huge fan of the originals - the reboots have angered me greatly as they have not done any justice in my personal opinion, if anything - have been a travesty to the Xcom franchise and Xcom 2 is arguably the worst because not only do you have the same cheating AI with miraculous almost impossible shots to spawning extra alien squads at the worst possible times making some missions all but impossible to add further insults.
<br>
<br>A large chunk of missions are timed with very tight limits making a front frontal assault the only viable option to meet the limit and that method almost always puts your prized troops at risk with each and every mission.  The balance of the game is just dreadful,  along with EU the enemy units out class you, and out gun and out number you forcing you to rely on guerilla style tactics and ambushes,  which is good and all, until the AI decides to cheat and shoot you through walls or shoot you half way across the map with near 100% accuracy.
<br>
<br>Xcom 2 complicates it even more with many different units this time, not to mention some of the classic ones returning, but in a beefed up version than before - even those pesky sectoids are considerably more dangerous now, and will PSI attack you all the time, often with very high success rates.    Another very major problem is related to the avatar project,  the aliens can power through construction sometimes making a game over situation possible just because you miss-managed your time, or didn&apos;t discover enough ways to slow down the project in time,  this aspect in Xcom 2 doesn&apos;t work very well but luckily there are enough mods to balance this.
<br>
<br>Time Management is a huge problem,  you hardly ever have time to breath in Xcom 2 without a new &apos;important&apos; mission appearing that you must do,  either extract VIPS,  protect the rebels,  attack dark sites and the list goes on and on and you hardly get any peace without being interrupted, it gets incredibly tiresome after the 200th cookie cutter mission has forced you to abandon your supply collections.
<br>
<br>Xcom 2 needs a huge amount of mods to essentially balance out the game, even with major rebalances almost to the point of outright cheating, the game can still be stressful and frustrating - essentially you&apos;ll be save scumming a lot if you become attached to your favorite crew.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073507">Expand</a></span>

<br>Another thing, the characters faces in customization need some improvements,too, especially females, most of them are just too ugly, I can&apos;t bond with my team mates if I cannot even stand with their looks.

This is it, I&apos;m done. This is not a kickstarter early access title. This hasn&apos;t been developed by a young studio with little money. This is a full priced triple A studio title.
<br>But even with a decent PC which runs games with similar (and better) graphics flawlessly, the performance is disastrous and btw I&apos;m running medium settings. The framerate often drops so hard that it feels like playing crysis 2 on a gameboy. The UI responenses sluggishly. Clicking buttons in XCOM2 to me feels a bit like using a cheap Android smartphone from 10 years ago. XCOM2 graphics overall have not improved that much to justify those high system requirements. In addition I don&apos;t like the overall look and feel of the game. It often times is so hard to tell what is going on in this game. The levels are often dark and the colors don&apos;t vary much -its like an all dark blue, grey, black soup where you often try to find your soldier&apos;s and your foe&apos;s position. Don&apos;t get me wrong you CAN and WILL find characters but it is exhausting to do. Also because the camera is really bad. It acts like a monkey on steriods trying to capture a michael bay movie. I often times find little me trying to adjust the perspective with spinning and clicking the mouse wheel to zoom in and out and pressing q and e repeatedly for rotating back and forward to find a good view. It&apos;s just so unsatisfying.
<br>Sound design is quite ok but i personally would have liked it a lot more if characters from non english speaking countries would speak with their specific accent just like the characters from Jagged Alliance 2 back in the days. God I miss JA2 -a game where you actually are able to perform tactical decisions. In XCOM2 you now have a turn limit which forces you to rush forward with no cover and get face melted by the enemy.
<br>Oh and those bugs... god I am so sick of jumping cursors, displaced soldiers, blocked characters, shots through walls and all that stuff.
<br>
<br>If I were you I would wait a few more month until some patchwork has been done and non 2K-designers with a brain brought out a UI mod.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070739">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Golden age games (1994 Xcom, Jagged Alliance, etc) gave player full freedom to decide how game&apos;s going to play. XCom 2 is for some dumb reason very scared of this, and what you get is boundaries at every aspect. Numerous mods to those games which expand freedom even more should be very clear message what players want. I guess people at 2K just don&apos;t care about this and imagine that average player is paralyzed, braindead and and of course, extremely bad player.
<br>No ammo, inventory management is basically non-existing, and even seemingly free movement on globe is constantly broken up by game forcing you with &quot;critical&quot; missions. I swear it took 6 times to finish one &quot;contact rebels&quot; quest (which takes 4 game days) due my Avenger being constantly called off to the other side of world due some &quot;crisis&quot;. The game even forces you to have full squad all the time, unless you take time to manually remove soldiers each time before mission. Why?
<br>
<br>XCom remake wasn&apos;t good game to begin with - compared to original, and they just managed to dumb this down and restrict player even more. For a PC exclusive, I also wonder why almost whole tactical combat can be played with plain keyboard... in 2016.
<br>
<br>Storyline is rushed and interesting for maybe 10-year old, especially insultingly bad ending with some Dragonball Z or whatever going on. Science is not interesting (unlike in 1994 original or recent Xenonauts) and I found myself not even reading at research results after few tries. Game is ridden with bugs and runs very choppily here and there. Final mission is harder than one in XCom: Terror from the Deep, and that is saying a lot!
<br>
<br>Graphics look like it were developed for Playstation 2, but still pop-in and break at any chance. Music, now without Michael McCann, feels mostly like stock hollywood &quot;heroic scene&quot; soundtrack, which also kills all and any mood previous game had and doesn&apos;t even come close to &quot;Fear simulator&quot; the 1994 game had.
<br>
<br>Long story short, get Jagged Alliance 2, install 1.13 patch and you&apos;ll forget XCom 2 existed in about 5 minutes.

Game is awesome-If you like XCOM 1 or tactical turn based strategy, it&apos;s a must have.

Compared to XCOM 1:</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Alien attacks my soldier and causes him to panic.

<br>
<br>11/10 will die again
<br>
<br>Game is awesome-If you like XCOM 1 or tactical turn based strategy, it&apos;s a must have.
<br>
<br>Compared to XCOM 1:
<br>-improved graphics
<br>-better story
<br>-more and better cutscenes
<br>-same edge of your seat difficulty
<br>-new soldier types and upgrades
<br>-tons of facility improvements and research
<br>-more destructible environments (i.e. threw a grenade at an enemy on the roof and roof blew apart making him fall to first floor)
<br>
<br>I have not experienced any performance issues that many are giving bad ratings for.  My rig is: i7 4770k, 7970 ghz card, 16gb ram.  It runs great at max settings.
<br>
<br>I honestly feel the game deserves a 9.5/10.  It&apos;s almost perfect in my opinion.  Tactical strategy games are my favorite genre, so YMMV</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6066655">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It runs horribly. My rig GTX770, Xeon E3-1231v3, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD (runs Fallout 4 high/very high quite comfortably). I turned AA and AO off, turned rest of the settings to medium, and it still runs like crap. Constant fps drops, hangs, graphical glitches, jarring microstuttering, you name it.
<br>
<br>Most of the missions are now timed, which means you usually have about 8-12 turns to complete a mission. This heavily encourages running and gunning, which in turn means that you will lose a lot of squad mates, and if you want to keep them alive, well you have to reload the entire mission so you get new RNG-seeds for the enemy shots, and pray to RNGeesus that they dont hit you.
<br>
<br>No more tactical advancement, no more strategy, just run in, shoot aliens, hope that you hit them, rinse and repeat. The game also puts in sectoids against you right from the second mission. They can mind control, raise dead soldiers (which get a HP boost because **** you thats why), use panic attacks, and oh they also have 8 HP (your starting weapons deal 3-5dmg, usually 3 though), and they usually run deep into cover, inside a building where they cant be killed, while they destroy your squad with Psionic attacks that have 100% accuracy. Sounds fair, no?
<br>
<br>Did you get frustrated in the previous X-Com, when the aliens, once discovered, could freely run to cover on YOUR turn? Well, dont worry, because they still do that in X-Com 2 too! The only time this doesnt happen is when your squad is in concealment, but the missions never give more than 2 or maybe 3 enemies to shoot from concealment, and there&apos;s no way to regain the concealment. Then you advance on the map, you discover another group of 3 aliens, and off they go, sprinting to cover for free. Because **** you, thats why.
<br>
<br>On the starter weapons you have 4 shots before you have to reload, which further slows you down, because again, yep you guessed, **** you thats why. This couldve easily been 5 or 6 shots.
<br>
<br>Enemies get reinforcements on almost all missions, and you never know where the dropship comes in from, usually behind you, and then, yep you guessed it, they get free movement to cover while they flank you. And you know the reason why.
<br>
<br>An example mission: Need to get to EVAC zone, 3 turns left before mission fails, one of your squad mates is already dead, others on low HP. 2 enemies ahead, between you and the EVAC zone. And boom, reinforcements from the back (they literally appear out of the dark), now you have no cover anywhere on the map, clock is ticking, each enemy shot kills a squad mate, and how did I forget to mention that one of the mission objectives was &quot;Extract all X-Com soldiers&quot;, which mean if one of them dies, you have to pick the corpse up (and you cant shoot when youre carrying a body), and get it to the EVAC zone.
<br>
<br>That was mission 3, btw, about 1,5hrs in the game, while youre still in starter gear, starting weapons, starter everything.
<br>
<br>I dont have a problem with challenging games, but only if the challenge is fair. This game is just dice rolling, in timed missions, against superior numbers, superior gear, and superior skill-moves all the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6069218">Expand</a></span>

<br>That is not tactical, it&apos;s not clever. it&apos;s
<br>NOT WHAT GUERILA WARFARE IS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
<br>
<br>Real guerilla warfare is 90% about gathering the intelligence, setting the trap and getting into position
<br>
<br>YES... the actual firefight may be short and sharp, but the preparation is absolutely paramount - every rime
<br>
<br>There is no prep in this game. No time. On many maps the maths of the distance and your squads movement limit barely allows you to reach the objective at a full sprint.
<br>
<br>Ready steady TANK RUSH!!!!
<br>
<br>No guerilla warfare is fought like that. Not from a guerilla group that expects their troops to fight more than one battle it isn&apos;t. Recon, planning, set up then a short fire fight then out.
<br>Mad rush to objective is not the way small forces fight against large ones anywhere - ever.
<br>
<br>Why do they rely on this timer over and over again?
<br>Because the enemy AI is risibly poor and the sense of urgency and tension is completely and 100% down to the timer in the early game
<br>Later in the game enemies have uber HP levels (so the programmer typed a bigger number into the enemy HP when designing the game .. yeah, great - top strategy... yawn)
<br>Then their are the faces of your troops. OMG. Like melted waxworks. The extra detail only show cases how damn ugly they all are. YEUCH!!
<br>Real disappointment, Terrible design decisions destroyed the franchise for a second time after the Interceptor did almost 20 years ago.
<br>What a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070807">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have no idea what the devs were thinking and why they feel that forcing people to rush recklessly across the map is &apos;fun&apos;. It is NOT fun to play well only to be forced to run double moves and BAM...right in to a pod.
<br>
<br>Seriously, is this a joke? Are you all just swimming around naked in a pile of our money laughing at us? Clearly your plan to release preview copies to critics that only allowed them to play for a month worked! Look at that metascore!

<br>
<br>I am not saying the game runs without a hitch (hence the 9, rather than 10) but I get a strong feeling that the people saying this is making the game unplayable are playing it on **** rigs...  I turned it down to high because I got a few drops in FPS when new enemies spawned and some in the loading screens.  Being turn based, NONE of this makes it unplayable...  The game runs absolutely fine for me now, only very minor drops.
<br>
<br>As for difficulty...  It&apos;s XCOM ffs.  Don&apos;t jump in to a game that&apos;s designed to be difficult and then complain it&apos;s too hard and thus mark it down...  A 1-3 is for genuinely &apos;bad&apos; games, not because the reviewer sucks at it...
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing for 4 hours and have not yet lost a soldier (granted I currently sit with 4-5 out for the next 2 weeks, but that&apos;s expected) so no, the sectoids are NOT that hard to beat, even with the backup...
<br>
<br>Anyways, rant over stupid reviews over...
<br>
<br>Graphics - Not great, but they don&apos;t need to be.  The art style is nice and fitting with the previous game, so in short it isn&apos;t ground breaking, but looks nice.
<br>
<br>Gameplay - Same as XCOM, little more difficult but not much so far.  (Not X-Com - By that, I mean it doesn&apos;t have the &quot;OMG I am going to smash my PC&quot; of the originals, when a sectoid blows your entire team up as soon as you step off the lander).
<br>
<br>Story - Couldn&apos;t say yet, not far enough in but I&apos;m enjoying it so far.
<br>
<br>Launch - Shaky, but not game breaking.
<br>
<br>As a staunch fan of XCOM and its predecessors, I can not recommend this enough IF you like the style of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6067232">Expand</a></span>

<br>I know XCOM can be a tough game to play. But this time the word &quot;tough&quot; needs to be replaced with
<br>whatever suits the following:
<br>
<br>- I started playing the game on the third of the four difficulty levels, because I know the first game
<br>and wanted an intense gameplay experience.
<br>I realized that the aim percentage you see while attacking an enemy is seemingly reduced by 15-20% because of the difficulty level. I missed four out of five shots when the percentage was between 65-80%. Long story short: no fun - executing tactics where a disaster. I perfectly flank an enemy to kill him, I miss and get kicked right away losing one of my best soldiers.
<br>
<br>- I started overs four times before I realized, I would have to lower the difficulty. Did that, enjoyed two hours of gameplay, until I went through a routine mission with the first time facing the snake like enemy. The moment one of my soldiers was grabbed and pulled to the this enemy through three walls without any line of sight was the moment I just had to quit this game and give it this review.
<br>
<br>My conclusion unfortunately is that this game is unplayable if you like a strategic challenge, because the game just does not let you execute any strategy - it just keeps kicking you in the face from out of nowhere.
<br>
<br>If you like the story and do not bother about the gameplay experience to much, then play on Rookie and go ahead.
<br>
<br>Definitely not recommended. A pity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6072402">Expand</a></span>

I have done 8 missions so far, and 7 have had a turn limit imposed.  The missions are getting boring after 5 hours of play.  There are basically 2 mission types, they are, get to the objective within 6 turn, then kill any remaining enemy forces, or, kill all enemy forces and take as long as you want.  The stealth mechanic in the game sounds nice but is a pointless element that hasn&apos;t been fully developed. In reality, the stealth concept hasn&apos;t added anything to the so called strategy part of this strategy game.  I am still not sure why the enemy gets a free movement turn during your turn when they discover you, this really makes the whole stealth concept stupid and irreverent.  This was a big annoyance for me in the previous game, when the enemy discovers you, they get to move all their units into cover during your turn.  Really breaks the immersion and idea of creating a strategy of getting the enemy caught in a cross fire as they can just run off behind some cover.  The looting system is a dumbed down element from the previous game, it doesn&apos;t matter if you use explosives to kill enemy&apos;s , you still get all their crap, corpses, upgrades etc.  The graphics issues list is a large one, there are camera issues, line of sight issues, shot through 3 walls issues, see through walls issues, excessive loading times during the missions and loading in and out of missions.  In it&apos;s current state it is almost unplayable, another game release that doesn&apos;t work, just add it to the list.  The gaming industry is in an absolute shambles atm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6067543">Expand</a></span>

It looks gorgeous, it plays very well, and it is one hell of a challenge.  If you liked X COM the original, then you simply have to buy this.  They have improved practically everything about the original.  This feels more much more dynamic.  Gone are the days of satellite spamming your way to victory.  This game provides meaningful choices throughout so that you really dont know which way you want to go.  And i think that many different paths to victory will be possible.  I think this is probably the best looking turn based game we have ever seen.  Kudos to Firaxis on a job well done.  A sure contender for game of the year.  The only thing that slightly spoils it are a few buggy camera angles and some dodgy hang times, but you can forgive it that as they dont spoil the fun.  And it is in infinitely better shape than most games when released.  But the real gem of this is the mods.  Oh my goodness what a year we have in store.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6066650">Expand</a></span>

Not giving this zero as there are some elements that i kinda like in here but the sum of all not so good elements is far greater that the positives.
<br>
<br>To get started the first thing that puts me off from this is the enemy movement. Setting up ambushes and the triggering the end of concealment is ok but having reinforcements drop in byt transport and then allowing enemies to move into position is not.
<br>
<br>Then the ammo capacity. 2k apparently did the exactly opposite what is even close to realistic and made clip size even smaller that was in Xcom 1. Which is just horse manure. Point me to a soldier with AR who wastes clip with 4 shots. And 1 grenade (without perks) oh really?
<br>
<br>What comes to timed missions can understand that they create sense of urgency but yet again the presentation is greatly flawed as the mission just ends stating that xcom was disbanded and everything went to hell. Then why the F&quot;@# they send only 4 soldiers with equipment for one to mission so important that resistance and humanity ends if it fails, yet spend time designing fancy looking avenger and armour. Yes i know these are design choices by devs but to me it show how little they put thought onto this particular thing and instead made roller-coaster ride out of turn based tactical game.
<br>
<br>I might be able to live with some of the choices made while developing this game but the condition it was released is just shameful. I can&apos;t understand how it runs so poorly (i could play Fallout 4 without problems) and has so many bugs and yet it looks just the same as xcom 1. Seems that every site that reviewed it and gave max scores have forgotten that not everyone has ultra gaming rig and developers have forgotten to optimize this because of how scalable pc is. In that regard i would&apos;ve liked to see console version as that would&apos;ve forced devs to optimize this a bit.
<br>
<br>All in all.
<br>+ idea behind the game
<br>
<br>- Presentation (enemy movement during our turn, ammo clips size, equipment capacity, shooting thru walls, etc)

<br>So this game was rushed with release and has many problems, it doesn&apos;t feel completely finished and polished. So you should seriously consider whether to buy it in such state or wait for more serious patching.
<br>
<br>THE BAD.
<br>1) this game has serious optimization issues - the fps in this game is all over the place, jumps between 25 and 80 on decent rig that tops recommended settings by quite some (and not, it&apos;s not even max settings). Anti-aliasing solutions are super heavy taxing, except FXAA which is good as nothing. The game has no triple buffering for vsync, and because fps is very unstable, you jump between 30 and 60 periodically, or if you decide to turn off vsync, you have massive screen tearing - again because of very unstable fps. The game runs poorly, even it&apos;s not visually exceptional in any way. And this game is not even a consolish port done by some 3rd party rookie studio.
<br>
<br>2) Glitchy camera, some weird issues with line of sight and other minor issues that were not resolved from previous installment. Like shouting thru walls, floors and other objects which are confusing and break the immersion.
<br>
<br>3) the game has some very bad design choices and some balance issues. Timed missions are very badly designed, they not make the game much harder, but definitely make it more stupid and leave with less options for your strategy and tactical decisions.
<br>
<br>4) Balance is bad in a lot of cases only because of how poorly RNG is designed, which acts in very weird way - you can reload multiple times and same action will have same result - RNG is predefined, the dice is not rolled when you take specific action.. I failed a mission because I missed 95% at point blank situation (seriously), there was no time for backup plan since it was timed mission.. There are so many things in this game that don&apos;t increase the difficulty fairly, but instead make it unfairly frustrating.
<br>
<br>THE GOOD.
<br>Now with some more and less serious issues this game still can be good and fun. Overall mission design is great, tho later on I&apos;d say it becomes easier and easier as you progress (except maybe final mission which I liked a lot, now this is what I call proper challenge). The customization is satisfying and you unlock many items and gadgets to play with. Game is pretty flexible here. Now gameplay itself would be really great if not earlier mentioned glitches and weird RNG, but it&apos;s manageable.  Also I loved the whole presentation, they put good effort into it - like mission launcher, returning from mission, showing injured squad members etc. There is a lot of nice detail to it.
<br>
<br>Final note: I don&apos;t thing games in such state should be released. Things should be sold when they are finished and meet certain criteria of overall quality. I was even considering a refund, because I don&apos;t like to pay for unfinished games and here is that case. So if someone still consider buying it, think twice about issues this game has!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070035">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes the performance issues suck, but this is one thing out of so many things this game does perfect. If you love turn based games or the Xcom series, pick this up ASAP or if you are on the fence maybe wait for a patch or two to come for the performance issues.

<br>- unskippable cut scenes
<br>- bad performance, constant mini-hangs, long loading times, need to wait all the time despite top of the line hardware.
<br>- high difficulty &amp; learning curve, no useful tutorial help to introduce strategies for new aliens &amp; new challenges. Missions constantly require you to rush... I like hard but combined with the two items above it gets frustrating to no end
<br>
<br>Overall very disappointing - am hoping it will be much better after a few patches.
<br>Yet another game where I wonder how the game site reviewers all rate it so high. No credibility &amp; integrity at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6066985">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is not a &quot;perfect game&quot; but it is a perfect xcom game.  Bugs are occasional and are always going to be around on launch (What little there is)
<br>
<br>It seems to me the majority of negative comments don&apos;t like the difficulty or the fact that numerous missions are timed.  Unfortunately for those people they must not know Xcom because the pure fact that it is difficult, grueling, and punishing is what makes it shine.  You will never forget those soldiers who fell under your command.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been so torn up with deaths in a strategy game.
<br>The percentage system (Thank god) seems overhauled from the original in that over 70% is pretty guaranteed a kill so no more standing with your shot gun up someones bum and watching your man hit the ceiling.
<br>There is much more i can say positive about this game but if you are honestly still reading this review and haven&apos;t scoffed at-least 3 teams at my remarks you should just go out and buy it.  Its like the old Xcom&apos;s but better!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6068071">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are excellent in par of what you expect from turn-based tactics genre Forget about tall the negativity in some review they are either sore consolers or some MOBA freaks who never played this genre. The game has steep learning curve for newbies and punishing gameplay for veterans but it&apos;s the most rewarding game you can play on your PC right now! Now, there are few bugs like few stuttering here and then but i&apos;m sure it&apos;s gonna be patched nothing will effect your overall gaming experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6067951">Expand</a></span>

Metacritic threw a 503 error and erased my original review. Since most of it was a warning about the poor design/performance, this will just be a point form listing of the cons (too few pros to waste time on).  This could never *honestly* be considered a 10/10, even with a reviewer optimized copy unless you are essentially brain-dead as to what the term gameplay means.  Anyone claiming the gameplay is the same as the previous release clearly has not played this.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>-Performance Issues
<br>
<br>-Run&amp;Gun as missions are ~85% timed now (artifical and pathetic attempt at difficulty or suspense).  This also eliminates the value of all but two classes.
<br>
<br>-Little-to-no tactics or strategy (see Run&amp;Gun)
<br>
<br>-Many silly/lazy gameplay elements (RNG used without consideration or believability) both in, and out of combat
<br>
<br>-Scripted elements within the the missions (spawns), and the way the game unfolds at a pace that is far too quickly advanced, robs this of much of XCom 2&apos;s advertised replayability
<br>
<br>-No active Physically Based Render engine as it looks nearly identical to their original game, just with higher resolution textures that are not nearly as realistic as the procedurally generated GTA5 car paint-jobs
<br>
<br>Mods will be needed to save this, as Firaxis has shown it does not have a clue. So much for all their promises about listening to fans of the Long War mod.

<br>Basically they have taken all the things that made enemy within/unknown good and buried it beneath layers and layers of pointless animations, cut scenes, loading screens. Its a bit like trying to watch a program on MTV. Its probably quite good but there is so much filler and padding it ends up being a waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6067225">Expand</a></span>

And the game has been tested on several PCs and a laptop. Everywhere it went very badly. The very same game and the plot is not bad ... but the same type and annoying timing that puts sometimes impossible mission. Oh, and random. Even on the easiest difficulty crit enemies that demolished my team for 2-3 turn.

<br>
<br>The idea of a guerrilla war after losing in the first part is great.
<br>Moving main base, covert operation, ambushes, stealing technologies, building the resistance... It all sounds very nice. In theory.
<br>
<br>What you get in reality is a somewhat interesting, but quite an obvious storyline with pretty dull characters (miss Dr. Vahlen so much).
<br>
<br>You get new classes, with Ranger and the tech specialist seeming most interesting. The battle is very much decided by whether your ranger can perform a melee kill and stay alive after that, and whether your hacker can get rid of turrets and mechanized enemies.
<br>
<br>You get a new global map, where you&apos;ll be leaping like an energized toad, trying to get resources and do all the missions.
<br>
<br>And you get TIMERS. Timers in literally every mission. You want some careful planning, you want tactics, you want maneuvers and smart moves - forget it. Your best tactics is a frontal rush to beat the bloody timer. To add insult to offence you get a GLOBAL TIMER. Yeah, the Avatar project.
<br>
<br>Also you get an unmatched feel of frustration, when your skilled soldier miss an enemy standing right on the neighbouring tile with a 99% chance to hit. An Alien God&apos;s miracle, trust me.
<br>
<br>And of course you get lags and glitches on a PC, which runs Total Warhammer and The Wither 3 with Ultra quality.
<br>
<br>The first game was a nice adaptation of an old X-Com from 1993 to meet the modern standards. The second is even worse in terms of a sequel than Terror from the Deep was. Then they also wanted to get some easy money from the success the first game had, but at least they introduced some new ideas and didn&apos;t break what was working.
<br>
<br>Shame 2K. Real shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7482632">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now for what I wanted this game to have.
<br>1) The story line is very Linear. They could have made a much better experience if your choices changed the war against Advent. For instance the VIP Missions where you could extract or kill them, if you saved them you got a engineer or a scientist, that is it. This was a great opportunity to have side quests and different outcomes.
<br>2) Soldiers was fully changeable even their back stories. I would have liked to see some cultural perks in some characters hidden until a certain rank. (Good or Bad) For example a soldier from Africa in the assault class being able to throw their blade as an auto over-watch perk. Or a Irish character can be immune to panic, a french guy got a extra retreat movement after being shot at. simple things that could get you more invested in your team.
<br>
<br>Just in finishing, This is still one of my favorite franchised and even thou it was still fun to play I hope they start taking their end users a bit serious. Recent games have shown what is possible with today&apos;s technology. Give us consequences for our choices!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6580483">Expand</a></span>

I very much regret buying it. All the strategy elements have been stripped away in favor of what can only be a future iPhone port. Almost every single mission is now artificially shortened by a forced turn timer that leaves absolutely no time to finish the objective. While I&apos;m sure this length of level would be perfect for playing on the bus or waiting at the DMV, but as a tactical game it falls very short of what people want. The game play now is painfully frustrating as you are sprinting to the other side of the map to finish the objective and then to the evac site all while dodging through hidden groups of enemies. People will claim realism or whatever else to defend this failed game but honestly we are to assume they started deleting files before they knew we even got there  or were about to finish uploading data minutes before the team arrived? This game seems to have ran out of ways to challenge players and just resorted to cheating enemies, a shoddy RNG and very very very limited time to muddle through their cheap levels. I simply cannot express how much I dislike this game. I wouldn&apos;t wish this game on my worst enemy, please please do not support these developers. They&apos;ve destroyed the series in favor a future iPhone game. There are much better, less frustrating games out there more deserving of support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6323419">Expand</a></span>

Do NOT buy this if you hate things above.

And why the time limits on almost every missions??

<br>Ai that stays right out of your line of sight if your hole squad is on overwatch.
<br>Sneaks in perfect &amp; stops before your guys get off a shot, even if they dont see my guys, bs that crap!
<br>
<br>Just make the ai with more life &amp; more of them instead of stupid cheating ****
<br>
<br>Also I have completed the game on classic &amp; that was way to easy but the ai didnt cheat at least!
<br>But the ai is really stupid, so thats why Fireaxis have too cheat on legend mode because they cant make the ai good enough!
<br>
<br>Fireaxis, kick your ai &amp; graphics dudes, they all did a bad job on this game!

<br>They need to acknowledge that they only made this game for themselves - an ultra-hardcore subset of the prior games&apos; fans.  Whoever backed this as a business venture was badly ripped off by a self-serving development team.  The XCom brand hasn&apos;t been this badly mishandled since Enforcer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6474509">Expand</a></span>

As usual for a AAA title the &quot;professional&quot; reviews rate the game much higher than the general public.
<br>
<br>First off, the tutorial is terrible, pretty much completely useless. It hardly merits being called a tutorial, it is just a short mission with a few prompts. It misses many important parts of the mission interface. As for the rest of the game, good luck, no tutorial for what to do back at the base. I did play the previous XCOM but that was years ago, I&apos;ve forgotten pretty much everything about the game. There is a manual but it is useless, it just repeats what the equally useless tutorial tells you.
<br>
<br>Most of the game consists of video sequences, it is obvious where most of the budget went. The missions themselves are extremely simple yet very frustrating. Still the same over emphasis on luck. Making most of the missions timed was a huge mistake, you mostly have to rush the target with little time for tactics.
<br>
<br>I normally don&apos;t buy AAA titles, mostly boring graphics showcases. XCOM2 is a prime example of this, all flash but no substance. Microprose did it so much better, Firaxis has managed to ruin both XCOM and Civilization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6929638">Expand</a></span>

Every time Firaxis releases a patch for this game things get worse.  I stopped playing it hoping it would get patched and it&#x2019;s in worse shape than at release.  It was already unplayable at release.  Soloman really lost his way creating this un-optimized heap.  He relied too much on gameplay from YouTuber&#x2019;s and forgot to make a technically sound game first.  How Firaxis allowed an adolescent, unqualified YouTube kid to infiltrate their business, influence design decisions, and upend their entire process is beyond me.
<br>
<br>Ignoring glaring technical issues in favor of one kid&#x2019;s idea of fun, makes no business sense.   How they got away with expending company resources chasing someone else&#x2019;s dream, while damaging Sid&#x2019;s good name and reputation, is just mismanagement.
<br>
<br>The changes being made late in the development and testing stage of XCOM 2, should have been decided long ago during discovery.  Even the Agile process couldn&#x2019;t adapt quickly enough to adjust to the mad rush to appease their new child master.  It&#x2019;s just baffling to me, the only conclusion I can come up with, Firaxis is just out of touch with their audience, got desperate and threw a Hail Mary to a spectator.  I really wish I could get my money back.

<br>Xcom 2 is definetly more refined then its predecessor and i, personally, don&apos;t see the timers as inherently unfitting. They just may appear in too much missions. Xcom 2 tries a different approach on some things like the covert mode at mission begin. Also you&apos;re forced to use more soldiers, trying to make it less dreadful if you loose a soldier. And sometimes it works, but othertimes the mechanics trip over themselves.
<br>
<br>For example, during the covert mode you can&apos;t see the sight radius of an enemy that you haven&apos;t discovered yet. Also, if you attack a target during covert mode, you pull every enemy that is in your visibility into the fight. Which means that you want to have as little sight as possible or else you might easily pull a cascade of enemies that will completly destroy you.
<br>
<br>Enemies are far more dangerous now, with more special attacks and variety. Which is cool, but they&apos;re too strong fot the most part. A pack of 3 vipers will disable 3 of your soldiers in one turn, leaving you with another 3. If you have pulled two or three groups, you might as well reload. A mission may either run perfect or not at all. Which is a shame, because like this, there are no stories your soldiers can develop. Because they either suceed or die. There is no in-between.
<br>
<br>Also there are some bugs and a rather questionable performance.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a good game. But it feels like it could&apos;ve done well with three months more balancing and bug hunting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6070345">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really want to give this game an 8, but I simply can not. I&apos;m sure once all the bugs get ironed out and some performance improvements are made this game will easily be deserving of an 8 - 8.5 rating. The biggest problems with the game are it&apos;s poor performing interface and a very inconsistent behaviour in mechanics. AI cheats/performs moves that simply should be impossible according to the rules of the gameplay.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the cutscenes and the music. However, the game got repetitive and boring quickly. Overall, a good game plagued by bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6075631">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Some of the new enemies completely unbalance the game. Like the enemy that has the same ability as the Ranger class. Which is lazy and lame, the rangers ability should be unique to your squad. Your going up against a much larger force, they should&apos;nt have the same abilities as you, and this ability allows them to move across vast distances and melee you, and it rarely misses, so basically you&apos;ll always have a wounded soldier almost guaranteed every mission once that enemy is introduced.
<br>
<br>When your not in missions the sheer amount of crap constantly going on is ridiculous. Its micro management hell. I understand your supposed to make some hard decisions, and I felt the original remake did a good job of balancing this.
<br>The sequel we got here though, my god... It&apos;s like getting piles and piles of little sticky notes constantly, meanwhile your trying to deal with another pile of sticky notes, and to top it off you are just constantly getting interrupted when you are just trying to get something done!
<br>
<br>Its buggy, choppy, and slow.
<br>
<br>Oh, and the amount of timed missions is completely awful! Once you get a few hours into the game the enemy troop difficulty ramps up VERY quickly. If your lucky you&apos;ll barely have magnetic guns at this point, and its not enough...
<br>
<br>Something is just off with this game, and leaves me just frustrated, with little willingness to play it anymore.
<br>I&apos;m going to try getting a refund. This just just isn&apos;t the sequel i thought we&apos;d get. It must have a new lead game designer or something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6118645">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sectopods appear almost straight away and start messing with your troops minds&apos; and there is zero defence.
<br>Enemies make shots you can only dream of whilst your troops miss the massive slob alien that&apos;s just magically appeared in front of you when you have no movement points left.
<br>Tactics are usually irrelevant as your under such a timer pressure you&apos;re guaranteed to run straight into a large groups of enemies who will appear out of the ether and you will have no movement left to take cover or run.
<br>Just now three of my four man squad were panicked when the other got killed for two turns allowing the ai free reign to just march about the map and wipe them all out.
<br>The enemy moves on your turn, huh? yes that&apos;s right a turn based game that ignores who&apos;s turn it is.
<br>add into the mix some rather odd LoS shots, getting shot through scenery, the car your hiding behind exploding without warning and sundry other bugs and its just a frustrating mess.
<br>I really cant see how people can rate this so highly so felt I just had to say something before other fall foul of the gameplay travesty.
<br>It&apos;s just no FUN at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6193137">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Fair enough, the game is tough but it is not tough in an interesting way. Arbitrary numbers and over-powered enemies result in simply reloading the game multiple times. It seems like the wanted to create an &quot;against all odds&quot; feeling to the game in terms of narrative, and that is exactly what it is - against all odds. It doesn&apos;t feel like it matters *that much* what you actually do, until you learn the mission by reloading and stacking the odds in your favour.
<br>
<br>The massive amount of pop-up information from research to building to missions that can&apos;t just be &quot;done&quot; but have to be scanned for, and whilst you&apos;re scanning 3 more things pop up which are &quot;really urgent!&quot; And an annoying guy keeps telling me what to do, but also calling me commander. Why even pretend that I am in charge!
<br>
<br>If your squad had some interesting abilities rather than just get in cover and fire a dice gun, some fun things like all the aliens seem to get, then you could probably call this a tactical game. But as it is it feels like taking on a whole chess set with 2 pawns, a bishop and a knight (why do you only get 4 people in a squad anyway!?), and having to roll a 6 to be able to take any of their pieces. Frustrating at first, but quickly dull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073458">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The original game did a lot of things right, but delved too much in oversimplification and catering to the console market. It was still a solid, balanced game, just not as good as the original.
<br>
<br>The sequel doesn&apos;t have a console version but is still commits all the sins of a rushed console port. In my opinion, a console version probably exists, but has not been released or revealed yet because it is still looking for a publisher. You should expect poor optimization (if any), a weird mouse GUI, an abundance of bugs and glitches, and overall a disgraceful PC experience not unlike most AAA releases nowadays. For all the hate Arkham Knight got, it worked better for me at release than XCom 2 does, post-patch. There is also no reason at all for the poor framerate and extremely long loading times, as the graphics are definitively outdated and arguably worse than the prequel (probably in preparation for the inevitable iPad release), yet the performance is perhaps the worst I&apos;ve seen in the last few years for a PC game.
<br>
<br>So, how is the game regardless of those technical &apos;merits&apos; conveniently not mentioned by any and all big-media paid-for &apos;reviews&apos;? Well, unfortunately the oversimplification has been fully embraced and turned up to eleven. Now the game only accepts a single play style (what we could call &apos;the rushing YOLO&apos;) and will punish you severely for trying anything different. Almost every mission has a big on-screen turn timer or other kind of timed events forcing you to play in a certain way, and even the strategy world-map gameplay is a linear adventure thanks again to more timed events. The timers are deeply ingrained with the game design and balance, so unfortunately any mods trying to remove actually provide an even worse experience (and yes, I&apos;ve tried them).
<br>
<br>In addition, the poorly designed RNG-based mechanics, one of the worst sins from the original, comes back with a vengeance. The combat has been tweaked in order to give way more importance to the RNG at the expense of tactical options, making the difficulty of the game essentially a random venture. Sadly, every mission is now filled with one-hit kill luck switches, including such shenanigans as having your squad leader mind-controlled by an off-screen enemy you haven&apos;t seen yet and wiping all your other teammates in a single turn (this happened to me *in the first mission* of the game). Sure, some times the RNG works in your favor, but many other times you&apos;ll miss multiple 80%+ shots in a row and get all your entire squad killed from situations that should impose no risk to you. It doesn&apos;t help when the few mechanics provided to tip the balance in your favor are introduced late in the game while the kill switches come in full force since the first mission.
<br>
<br>If you rush your way into tactic games, don&apos;t mind luck playing the biggest role in such games, and are in fact usually very lucky, you may still get some fun out of this game. But for the most part, you are better just playing the vastly superior prequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6128435">Expand</a></span>

<br>TO me it seems like they fired anyone who knew anything and developed a game with a bunch of noobs and left quality control for later, after gamers give them feed back and if they will feel like it.

Unfortunately this is not the case with the latest installment. The big disappointment begins right from the start of the game.
<br>
<br>Game mechanics:
<br>Enemy units can shoot through the floors, ceilings and other objects that normally would not allow for that. This makes the whole planning and strategy a very frustrating and unenjoyable. I often left with the feeling that game developers left product 50% finished just enough to make profit from sales and let the fans go to hell.
<br>
<br>Balance:
<br>What?! There is no balance what so ever. Seriously, none. Enemy units overpowered in every mission just enough to make sure that at least half of your team dies. And it doesn&apos;t matter how well you plan and play because game mechanics and timer will do their dirty work of forcing you into a simple run-and-gun path where you just engage head-on with enemy quads and then.. then you die or fail the objective no matter what you do.
<br>Overall story is randomized by advent events which are even more unbalanced in terms of rewards/loses. Every mission feels like a playing roulette.
<br>
<br>Resources:
<br>Supplies are always in shortage. It is impossible to keep your squad at it is required minimum to do the next mission while your wounded soldiers are heeling. As result you send your team as a unit of 2-3 or with no gear to fight effectively overpowered AI.
<br>
<br>Bugs:
<br>Oh dear, bugs were there core concept of this game. Loading times are eternal, waiting times between actions are beyond any imagination. On top of all this you get no less lethal bugs that leave you only with one option - uninstall this garbage. One thing that will remain though - is a regret about invested time and money on this game.
<br>
<br>My advise:
<br>Stay AWAY from XCOM 2. This game is not worth even a cent. A complete fiasco from Firaxis studios.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6119882">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Like many of the &quot;hardcore&quot; trend of late, it mistakes poor design or outright frustration for genuine fun and challenge.  I grew up in the 80s.  I know those games well.  You want hard?  Beat Ghosts &apos;n Goblins on one quarter and come talk to me.  If they took save-scumming out of this game, all the people saying, &quot;git gud, n00b&quot; in response to valid criticism would also be trashing this game.
<br>
<br>At the heart of the problem is this is a tactical, methodical game that was force-fed high-fructose corn syrup.  It comes in the form of mission timers for nearly every mission you&apos;ll play.  And like pounding can after can of soda, it doesn&apos;t take long before you&apos;re sick of it, and start to ask an obvious question: &quot;why did they think this is fun?&quot;
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the broken game mechanics, like that time you ran your guy behind their guy and stuck your gun into the back of his head and it says you have 90% chance to hit?  Yeah, sorry, that&apos;s more like 50/50.  See this game is so clever it knew you&apos;d do the, ya know, LOGICAL thing, so they made that not work anymore!  So clever.  Such good game design!  10/10!
<br>
<br>Seriously, check around the forums.  I kid you not: the most oft-repeated strategy is to run forward and chuck grenades, for the main reason that grenades will hit 100% of the time.  Let me be clear: in a turn-based, tactical game.  1) Run forward. 2) Chuck grenades.
<br>
<br>And I tried it.  And sadly, they&apos;re right.  The absolute dumbest, guaranteed to get your squad wiped move is a great idea in this game.  That&apos;s how BROKEN the RNG outcomes are!  No, you don&apos;t save grenades for tactical opportunities, like when two or more enemies are bunched up or you get in a jam.  You throw all your grenades up front and pray it&apos;s enough that whatever&apos;s left over won&apos;t be able to full-wipe your squad in the face of the RNG screwing you over for the remainder of the battle.  Gaming at its finest.
<br>
<br>XCOM 2 is the out-of-the-box paradigm shift of game design we don&apos;t deserve, didn&apos;t need and never asked for.  Save the world?  Nah.  Save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6590342">Expand</a></span>

<br>The statistics also feels broken, even after the first patch. This could be due to the counter intuitive nature of the math involved, but it detracts from the game-play experience.
<br>
<br>I gave it two points for having a good graphical presentation.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say that I will go back to XCOM in the future. They will have to completely rethink the probability model, and that could remove the basic character of the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6214231">Expand</a></span>

I like the setting and the customization, but it feels like most of it doesn&apos;t work well together, in particular customization and the nature of the game.   Do you like to spend 20-30 minutes customizing a character only to have them get lost due to some bogus rolls?
<br>
<br>Theres also some other nasty things.  One of the things that really bothered me was how the &apos;Concealed&apos; mechanic is actually not really a stealth mechanic.  After a certain amount of turns, the AI patrols will walk towards your stealthed characters, basically creating an artificial confrontation when in fact the game itself is programmed to do that.
<br>
<br>I just don&apos;t really understand it.  It&apos;s a neat game but at the same its just flawed.  I would wait to buy it when its like, under $20.  But other wise just avoid it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6137494">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The cons.
<br>This is more strategy than luck.
<br>
<br>Core mechanics appear to be broken.  (ie. Line of sight is really botched, some odd things happen, at times, the engine itself appears confused.
<br>
<br>I have had an alien run at my squad where they were on overwatch with high percentage chances.  They all miss their shots.  This is not unusual and the maths does not stack up.
<br>
<br>I have also hit an alien expecting 3 damage (as indicated) and done 7.  It doesn&apos;t fill you with confidence that the game is ok.
<br>
<br>The odds are very stacked against you which makes it challenging unless your playing on very easy mode.  However, what make the game annoying is that the missions are insanely repetitive.  Some similarity would be understandable but it is so limited it is ridiculous.
<br>
<br>Worst of all, the missions are in the main time limited so its more a of run through, keep repeating until you get lucky and do it again. Very little strategy involved and at times, it is simply like repeatedly rolling the dice hoping that the line of sight doesn&apos;t botch and nothing weird happens until it works out.  It isn&apos;t fun.
<br>
<br>The Global strategic outlout is very much the same. You are not choosing where you go, the game is really telling you what you need to do and giving a very poor illusion of choice.
<br>
<br>Runs very badly indeed. This is not subjective, I have extremely high 3d mark scores and spend a lot of time and effort building my PC;s (not to mention cash) My Titan X&apos;s are running at 1550-1600 during gaming and the CPU 4.7ghz (hexacore) yet the game though smooth doesn&apos;t run well. It  feels like console port in terms of not being happy with hardware and seemingly not using properly.  I see this seems to be across a wide range of builds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6094474">Expand</a></span>

<br>1) Game play loop
<br>2) Story
<br>3) Technical issues
<br>
<br>Firstly game play loop.
<br>It&apos;s solid, the tactical strategies and choices you make both in the combat part and the &quot;base building&quot; matters. The combat game play is very solid, but will frustrate people who had degrees of RNG. The skill element to this game is much like poker. In poker you need to understand your strengths long and short terms, cards and chip stack size. In X-com 2, you need to understand the RNG and what leads to it. Sometimes you have to rush to complete a mission and maybe sacrifice a solider in order to complete the objective and progress long term. It&apos;s a good and challenging loop that rewards a thoughtful process of weighting pros and cons of you actions. It can also be extremely heartbreaking sometimes.
<br>
<br>Secondly the story... Oh boy... The world design is fine, but they&apos;ve clearly not done a very good job at writing the actual story OR creating any sort of connection between the player and the characters. It&apos;s the most bland AAA title i&apos;ve played in a very long time. I&apos;d argue that some sports games like Fifa almost does a better job at creating a more engaging story. And this scars my soul as a big sci-fi fan and a player of the original x-com, i really thought they would have taken this into the brave new world of games, but alas, it wasn&apos;t anywhere near.
<br>
<br>On the technical side, It looks good... but it suffers from down right stupid design decision and poor performance in certain places. There are little animation sequences that slow down the game play something drastic, and after a while it&apos;ll start infuriating you. It&apos;s when you hack a terminal and you need to press a button to continue, there&apos;s a small delay from the time to press the key until something actually happens - it makes the game feel unresponsive. It&apos;s the same deal with reloading and attacking, and not to mention when you discover some enemies. The first time you encounter some enemies it&apos;s cool that the game slows down so you can acknowledge what it is you&apos;re dealing with, but after you&apos;ve faced those enemy types just a few times, it becomes a very annoying slow down of the game play flow, which counts against the experience of the game. There are multiple examples of these slow downs of game play and it&apos;s pulling the score down for me, massively. Also, despite having a rather powerful rig with SSD and all the trimming, i suffered horrible load times and looking at the windows resource monitor while it loading, it really wasn&apos;t pushing the hardware, which is rather annoying. Also I had an issue when just starting a new map where the game would &quot;time out&quot; for upwards for a minute before actually starting... makes no sense.
<br>
<br>All in all - the game is enjoyable if you can see pass the technical issues and only focus on the game play loop, this will be the corner stone for many people, because we don&apos;t have many of these games around anymore. The step up in AI of the enemies was nice, but fundamentally i don&apos;t think this was a much better game that X-com from a few years ago. Personally it missed the mark for me, and the technically aspects and poor design decision ultimately pulled the score down for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6072198">Expand</a></span>

XCOM 2 is more of the same rubbish as XCOM Enemy Unknown but with some tweaks. Some of those tweaks are just down right silly at that. These new XCOM games are just shadows of a previously excellent series and I feel ripped off that I would get excited and hopeful about them only to be dashed.
<br>
<br>They have some basic things going for them in their own right but I cannot help but compare them to a much more brilliant past. Bring XCOM back the way it should be, awesome.This is a veneer thin, poorly planned and frustratingly executed pile of poop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6116344">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would have given it an 8/10, but not as it is now:
<br>
<br>Pro:
<br>- The new difficulty in combat is fun AND manageable - even the teleporting around codex guys. Just need some clever layered positioning, not just simple cover and overwatch lines. The early battles are actually the hardest, cause the enemy compositions are quite serious at the beginning - get 5 squadsize and some officer soldiers soon, and it gets better. And if you see a lonley human sitting in the middle of a burning refugee camp, not running into hiding from evil aliens...
<br>
<br>- New graphics look good, a lot of (mostly useless) customization options for your squad looks.
<br>
<br>- High level skills cleverly positioned and used  can really turn around everything - had a sniper killing 5 zombies and an advent with a handgun and faceoff in one sequence xD
<br>
<br>Con
<br>
<br>- The metagame lost a lot of its predecessor&apos;s appeal - the worldmap is no longer an additional strategic layer, where you actually defend earth by  &quot;hunting&quot; UFOs with your interceptors. It is just flying from mission to mission.
<br>
<br>- The graphic requirements, as some already mentioned, are insane and not really optimized. I had to scale down graphics (AA, TAF, shadows etc) a lot to get it playable and I don&apos;t have a low spec PC. That said, the game no longer looked as nice, but in some maps worse than xcom 1, which is sad. This will hopefully be adressed soon.
<br>
<br>- Too many &quot;forced&quot; missions. In X-Com 1, I often ignored smaller UFOs after some time, but X-Com 2 forces on you many missions you probably would&apos;nt want to do anymore at this point of the game.
<br>
<br>- Some annoying bugs where your characters die suddenly.
<br>
<br>- I still don&apos;t like the strange shooting percentages xcom has - My soldier is 5m in front on an enemy, even flanking it - in short, presented with a perfect kill shot -  and gets a hit chance of 65%. This can get a supposed safe situation into a **** up situation, which gets worse with a new stat they introduced (dodge for grazing shots). Compared to that, i like the armor mechanic, as its effects are predictable.
<br>
<br>- Some timer missions were really cool and gave me a feeling of accomplishment... but others didn&apos;t and those became too many. Better balance would have been good here.
<br>
<br>Fazit:
<br>In short, it is still a good game, but the launch version is very much flawed mainly because of the poor optimization; I would strongly recommend buying it some time (patches) later, especially if you don&apos;t own a high end machine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6076822">Expand</a></span>

Once everything was installed I fired XCom 2 up and proceeded with the tutorial mission to see what is new. Guess what...there&apos;s a bug that may or may not happen, but it happened to me, where a character can&apos;t move to cover as the instructions state. The fix was to do the Three Finger Salute(tm) back to desktop since at this point everything is frozen and then relaunch the game. So far I&apos;m not too impressed, especially reading about the turn timer implemented in the game now. I&apos;ve stopped playing XCom 2 because I still need to finish some other games on backlog. Maybe when it&apos;s time to get back it things will have improved. For those that are curious...on my Core i7 desktop with GTX780ti everything is on high/medium @2560x1080. I won&apos;t even bother loading it onto my 4 year old ASUS ROG laptop with a measly GTX560M gpu.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6077158">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On top of this, throw in a lacklustre story that promised to be so much more than it ultimately was, and you have a single-player experience that is a slog to play through and unrewarding to do so.
<br>
<br>Not a terrible game by any means, but a missed chance to create a strategy classic. If there is to be an XCOM 3, I hope the devs take the best from both the original and sequel (but moreso from the original) and create something truly great - because this isn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6215451">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall progress and research is boring. Yes, you want that new weapon or armor to get a upper hand, but each time the progress feels very underwhelming. Not that much game altering elements to research anyway.

<br>Repetitive missions and scenery.
<br>
<br>I had some fun at start, but now I am glad it&apos;s over. Last missions were only an overlong rehash of already experienced enemies and gameplay.

In order to make it seem like a new game, and to please all the long-war geeks, the difficulty is cranked up in a bunch of artificial ways. Almost every mission has a timer or constant stream of scripted enemy drop-ins. And this is the overall theme of the game: you are constantly being spammed with so many events and non-meaningful choices that it&apos;s almost impossible to keep up with basic tasks, and eventually you will be forced to make a detrimental choice. Strategy gaming at its finest!
<br>
<br>Once again, all percentages are pre-determined at the start of every mission, so an 80 or 90 percentage shot is completely meaningless - it doesn&apos;t matter what you do or where you move, from the beginning of the mission it&apos;s been determined whether you&apos;re going to hit or miss (this is true - search the forums for discussion). You can stand right next to an enemy, going full auto, and still miss every time. So ridiculous. You the mouseclicker aren&apos;t even necessary for  the game, because everything&apos;s already determined. It could just run the percentages itself and determine the same outcome. Your actions have literally no effect on whether you hit or miss - just like real life and real combat, right?
<br>
<br>Given that every mission relies on pre-scripted events and pre-determined enemy placements, the only &quot;strategy&quot; or &quot;tactics&quot; are remembering where the enemies are going to spawn and pre-placing your troops to ambush them. So, the only thing that matters is positioning, based on either luck in the fog of war or your knowledge of previous failures.
<br>
<br>This game might as well be calling &quot;Pathing Manager 2016&quot;, since pathing is the only meaningful thing you control and the singular thing that makes the difference between success and failure in the mission. If most of your paths succeed on the first try, you got lucky. If most of your paths fail, suck it up and lose, or try new paths on a reload. And that&apos;s it. That&apos;s all you do in the entire game. This is obscured by other crap like &quot;Dark Events&quot;, which are basically &apos;pick which 1 out of 3 bad things you want to try to stop&apos; through another &apos;pick-a-path&apos; mission. Again, totally meaningless for the overall outcome, but it&apos;s very deep &quot;strategy&quot;, right?  Not so much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6717842">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But the missions? How is it that 9/10 of the missions they have a &apos;turn timer&apos;; If you don&apos;t do this or that in 6 turns, you lose. This is the case with almost in every mission. This makes the game a constant save/reload -fest. The tactics that you try to implement mean almost *absolutely* nothing. It does not matter in which position you place your units.. Where ever they are placed they will get shredded in any case. Only way - I mean the only way - to get through the missions is to save/reload through the RNG.
<br>
<br>The animations, they have been copied over from previous XCOM, as has almost everything else. Line of sight - while working OK when shooting - looks like **** when the soldiers stick their gun thru wall and shoot..
<br>
<br>I even tried to play with novice and still it is not fun, the same concept applies.. It should be fun to fail and try a new approach, but soon you realize the new approach matters nothing, only RNG matters. Not that you changed your units to better positions, its all numbers game.. really shameful
<br>
<br>The enemies spawn out of nowhere and each mission tries to be different but in essence they are all exactly the same.
<br>
<br>I can not recommend this game, I really would like to but the missions really are broken.
<br>
<br>+ the unit customization
<br>+ metagame in the &quot;ship&quot;
<br>+ performance (looks ok, runs flawlessly)
<br>
<br>- each mission completely same
<br>- each mission insanely difficult
<br>- doesn&apos;t matter where you place your units, they get killed each time (reload)
<br>- concealment is a state of the game, it is not something your units can use: when &apos;concealment&apos; is blown, your units will be seen by enemy all the time, even if behind full cover walls.. lazy lazy lazy programmers..
<br>- RNG
<br>- RNG
<br>- RNG
<br>- RNG
<br>- RNG
<br>
<br>As User &quot;Avadon&quot; writes, I agree completely:
<br>
<br>&quot;You can mod out all the crazy 8 turn limits and massive random spikes in Avatar progress though. Great. What you are left with then is an extremely easy game. Guess why. Because that&apos;s what it is. An extremely easy game, made hard only through RNG rigged to screw you as a core design philosophy. The encounters themselves are easy and the maps are poorly designed, like everything procedural. There&apos;s no actual depth. There are no &quot;damn, I&apos;m a genious&quot; moments as you lure an overwhelming force back to a well fortified position with half of your squad lying in the perfect ambush. The game gives you no time to think. No time to strategize. No time to have fun.&quot;
<br>
<br>and Silverflame :)
<br>&quot;&quot;Oh, that&apos;s a rule,&quot; the colonel said excitedly. &quot;The black advents get free moves while it&apos;s your turn to play, and some newly appearing pieces even get to hit your pieces without the roulette wheel most of the time!&quot; &quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6696127">Expand</a></span>

<br>1 Hour in the game and i already lost 7 people because of stupid RNG missing enemys 1 meter in front of the soldiers.
<br>
<br>I read this game has some performance issues (cynical brit) on release date so i didn&apos;t bought it and forgot about it.
<br>So now, half a year later, I played this game and it still performs like ****.
<br>
<br>The game flow is very ugly. You don&apos;t have enough time to micromanage your base and build equipment like it was in the older games. You click on the scan icon and 1 second later another stupid mission pops up that you have to attend to, or else you will loose instantly.

(Well, almost, when the gloomy character you made in the pool will show with an idiotic smile instead, you may feel a bit let down, their attitude is randomized, immersion lost). And, that&apos;s it.
<br>Everything else seems &quot;more less&quot; (DLCs pattern).
<br>
<br>The worldmap.
<br>Oh man, I was so kicked by it on the teasers.. By the looks of it, It may be like Aftershock, maybe even more, like the one in Afterlight.. Well, it is not.
<br>It is an empty land with pop-ups. Where you are urged to slow the &quot;Avatar Project&quot; by Captain Obvious every 2 minutes, actually by wasting this so precious time, moving and locking your camera and controls away for the time he repeats the same phrase over and over again. (In order to show you a spot where you can only interact with on the very last mission).
<br>Of course this pattern so had to happen while in missions too.
<br>Can feel like Internet without ad-blockers. Old days.
<br>
<br>The resistance.
<br>After contacting them, well, they will write you a check after the end of each month.
<br>And they get passively slaughtered on retaliation missions (&apos;cause aliens don&apos;t like them for writing you checks), as Bradford will unavoidably never fail to mention.
<br>A resistance that doesn&apos;t actually resists. Strange concept. (To be fair, they may not carry wepons, but they will manage to take down some UFO&apos;s for you, to remind you the name of the original title).
<br>
<br>The Base.
<br>You build what you can, when you can. Thats&apos;s about it, with a bit of management. Feels better than the last one, can&apos;t compare to the originals (was more like mini-SimCity).
<br>Discussions between staff can be muted, if not, they don&apos;t freeze your screen when talking (wich is something someone could have learnt from his comrades).
<br>
<br>Research.
<br>It is deeply simplified, for the second time (so long old-timers) : Research Tier 2 weapons &amp; armor, research Tier 3 weapons &amp; armor. Autopsies unlock new tools, and they made the option to instantly research those after some &quot;breakthrough&quot; on the next Tier.
<br>So, do you want to research x for 3 days, y for 4, then next Tier for 10 ? Or next Tier for 10 and instant x &amp; y ? Tough choice.
<br>Let me break your expectations, there are bullets, laser, plasma. Yes, those are the same (more straightforward). And no, there&apos;s no MEC.
<br>
<br>Overall progression.
<br>Fine by your troops, slow and steady, each skill, every bit of scrap seem to matter. Very well done.
<br>The way new ennemies are introduced every two missions however  is not.
<br>It soon feels like a freak show, and utterly destroys the low profile Aliens are supposed to have (Sure Bradford, they don&apos;t have to hide, but frightening the population doesn&apos;t seem great either).
<br>
<br>More coherence would have been nice, like maybe only Advents troops in cities, other species represented in the &quot;wild&quot;, or in Resistance lands, maybe common/rare types, etc.
<br>Some are underused and replaced, other overused. &quot;Codex&quot; is a perfect example, so great ennemy, brillant design, until it becomes absolutely common in every mission, therefore losing all of its aura.
<br>
<br>The combat.
<br>The system still works, stealth mecanic is also a fine addition. But it lacks coherence.
<br>Why the ennemy would blow up his precious installation without him knowing we&apos;re here ? Why is all squad revealed when only one member is detected ?
<br>Just to justify the turn-limit and the one scout class, who will be better at never actually fighting. Not enough for me. It limits the way you play more than it opens it, not so good for tactics.
<br>
<br>The turn-limit system and very small maps resume gameplay to :
<br>1) Take a direct shot at 30%.
<br>2) Make a flanking move (with a 70% to trigger new ennemies).
<br>3) Blow up cover with explosives and shot after.
<br>Answer is 3) until you have to make 2) due to the turn limit. I think the precedent system of ennemy triggering and their free move &amp; turn should have been arranged to better fit this new layout.
<br>
<br>In its current state, all of this will be darkened by the fact that you will be detected for no reason, sometimes even shot at the very same moment, melee &amp; shot through walls, moving on another tile than the one you clicked, suffering from performance issues, etc.
<br>If you haven&apos;t already bought the game, spare yourself the disappointment now and buy it when the actual release comes out, wich is programmed for the second half of 2016.
<br>
<br>+ Another XCOM
<br>+ We can play before release !
<br>- Shouldn&apos;t have been released yet.

This title is very iterative in some respects but innovative in the worst possible ways. I played a great deal of EU/EW on both Classic and later Impossible difficulty(as well as Long War, but I can&apos;t base this off something Firaxis didn&apos;t create), and never did I feel as though I was being hurt by circumstances out of my control.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately this game is plagued by artificial difficulty due a combination of multiple factors.
<br>-You a railroaded into one playstyle(one very dependent on RNG, unlike the previous reboot) due to a limit of 8-12 turns on most missions
<br>-Procedurally generated maps add to this, as you can be placed in borderline impossible situations as a result of start positions and alien pod patrols(it&apos;s quite honestly a shame, the maps are a strength of the game in all other aspects).
<br>-Powerful alien encounters can be made unwinnable due to the above.
<br>
<br>Also if your hardware isn&apos;t top of the line, you may have problems even running this game. I myself haven&apos;t run into anything unplayable, but sporadic fps drops as well as stuttering and hitching have been encountered. This was even after playing with the settings quite a bit. I may have just been lucky, some have reported worse on better hardware than I have available. My PC is probably somewhere in the mid tier now, but it&apos;s by no means low end. Sandy Bridge i7 3820, GTX 680, 16GB DDR3 RAM, and no SSD.
<br>
<br>I mentioned there being a good game here despite these issues? Well there have been some improvements from the previous Firaxis XCOM.
<br>
<br>+Obvious graphical improvements in all areas.
<br>+Sound design is overall better, as in effects and such(though EU had better music in my opinion).
<br>+The procedural generation of the levels is fundamentally a strength(despite the way it&apos;s actually utilized).
<br>+Mod support is benefit to any title.
<br>+Customization is mostly better, though lacking in a few areas.
<br>
<br>Anything I didn&apos;t mention I feel is either the same as the previous game, or just overshadowed by more important things I wanted to stress here. Overall a 5/10(average game for me) is incredibly generous as I&apos;ve been extremely disappointed with this release in more ways than one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073056">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s stressing and feels unfair being always, no matter what, at disadvantage. What I describe is manageable at the beginning of the game but after some hours the frustration starts to build up to the point where you are not enjoying the game anymore.
<br>
<br>The AI is unfair too, they can see you all the time and hit you through walls. You find that perfect spot for your sniper over a roof and the AI just shoots you from a sidewalk trespassing all floors, that is stupid.

<br>Superb customization ( I love dollies ) and it makes you care for your troops.
<br>A bit of graphical improvement.
<br>FULL destructible environment - anything that can explode and crumble...will if you throw enough &quot;ka-boom&quot; at it.
<br>
<br>CON:
<br>Timers- you enjoyed taking your time with each mission in EU/EW ?
<br>Yeah no more of that.
<br>Now it&apos;s run ahead and make mistakes or you lose.
<br>Catch 22 - you run and  die in enemy fire or the god-timer **** you up because reasons.
<br>Annoyance 6/10
<br>
<br>Enemy free turn.
<br>Oh you sneak on the enemy? Haha who cares, unless you are concealed ( 50% of missions and only at start ) you get spotted and they TAKE COVER ON YOUR TURN !
<br>This **** was in EU and EW.
<br>And it is here.
<br>Annoyance 9/10
<br>
<br>Difficulty curve.
<br>I&apos;m not Napoleon but this game is stupidly punishing.
<br>A SINGLE RNG miss can sometimes snowball into such a mess the whole CAMPAIGN is ruined since your rookies can never take down a sectopod not in a million years.
<br>Too much RNG.
<br>
<br>Colonel Sniper VS FAT mutton Berzerker in OPEN FIELD with NO COVER =70%.
<br>Yeah..i don&apos;t think so ****

<br>Oh and 70% = auto-miss usually.
<br>Annoyance 10/10 !
<br>
<br>RNG is just a trick to hide POOR AI.
<br>
<br>Speaking of AI. There are certain CIVILIAN RESCUE missions where you have to gather autistic &quot;civilians&quot; who run like suicidal idiots into enemy fire.
<br>So far so good, we&apos;re used to this in game.
<br>The best part is now.
<br>Enemy troops FLANKED and about to die in the next round - DO NOT retreat or fire at you or take cover or whatever.
<br>
<br>Nope they ...SHOOT THE CIVILIANS as if they KNOW that will hurt your mission ranting more.
<br>Spiteful AI - google it. This is the very example.
<br>
<br>Awful game, full of bugs, red screen errors and idiotic RNG.
<br>2/10 for customization - that&apos;s it. Rest is garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6083385">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Xcom universe
<br>- Made me want to install Jagged Alliance 2/xcom again, and have some proper tactic rpg/strategy.
<br>- casualisation, (more people might get interested in STRATEGY games)
<br>-Story is decent and whole world got nice 80&apos;s cheap sci-fi vibe (which is good).
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s:
<br>- further dumbing down the genre.
<br>-Missions basicly finish themselfs without any real tactic. (nope, its not tactic to move from cover to cover
<br>and clear everything)
<br>-cartoonish gfx. Its 2016, Just check what unreal enngine can do.
<br>- U cant crouch or lie down (unacceptable). ATM  whole game got more in common with cover based shooter then tactic strategy game.
<br>-Bugs - opponents shoot/melee through concrete wall. Its unacceptable for this genre.
<br>- Base building is even more streamlined then before. No hard decisions.
<br>- weak research tree&apos;s, everything is tier based.
<br>- Boring/bland auto generated missions...
<br>- Boring, unrealistic sci-fi weapons, 1 type for every tier for each class...
<br>- 8-12 round timed mission(game got alot of those). Loading screen takes more then finishing this &quot;mission&quot;.
<br>- In game difficulty only lowers weapon hit %, not actuall number/type of opponents, tactical decisions or anything else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6082651">Expand</a></span>

I just have to accept the fact that XCOM 2 disappoints in just about every aspect of actual gameplay it is built on.
<br>
<br>I played the original UFO:Enemy unknown 20 years ago. This sequel tries to fill its shoes and fails miserably. Gameplay/missions are repetetive and boring, difficulty scales poorly, and the so called &quot;strategy&quot; layer is nothing more then you flying around constructing radio masts and picking up crates while being pulled by the nose through the story at a pace that leaves you stressed out and frustrated. Its like the Devs want to force you to finish the playthrough as fast as you possibly can and I cant really figure out whay they were thinking in their design choices for the strategical platform.
<br>
<br>Strategic RNG is horrible, for example you can get well and truly ganked by what missions the ALIENS get and there is virtually nothing you can do about it regardless of how well you have played so far.
<br>
<br>Character customization is great though. Sometimes I find my self attending to every detail of my team for 30 minutes or so. Then I send them on another mission and someone comes back promoted to Captain.
<br>
<br>Now I have a squad consisting of 5 Liutenants and a Captain. Cool. Or not. Oh yeah, someone got a scratch in the latest mission, lost 1 of his 16 HP. Now he is out on medical leave for 18 Days. Ah well, plenty of more Liutenants where he came from...
<br>
<br>Well, you get my point. But it still blows my mind how the Devs can screw up like this given that they had the 1994 UFO:Enemy Unknown legacy to guide them and the excellent prequel XCOM to build on. So sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6076273">Expand</a></span>
