More voices, the only ones I heard (which were pretty good) were &apos;&apos;bad scary&apos;&apos; and some screaming.  It could have also used more pictures to get to know the characteres...maybe even a ladder like the old game. Where is DUKE!?  The story also sucked, there were like 5 story races.

<br>-The game plays at a much slower pace
<br>-Narrower tracks, -The camera is far closer to your car than before, hence you&apos;ll have trouble seeing upcoming turns
<br>-Just...bad car handling (even with an upgraded car. Even on a technical level, it won&apos;t let you turn+accelerate+shoot your secondary weapon at the same time. Instead you&apos;ll just go straight shooting and ram into a wall)
<br>-Very short races -No more pedestrians to run over
<br>-Your basic machine gun AUTO-SHOOTS? Now we are being noob friendly/streamlined?
<br>
<br>I regret buying this on sale and this game has hampered my view of Remedy. However, if you just stumbled upon this title and haven&apos;t played the original - drop everything you&apos;re doing now and go play it. It really is one of (if not) the best top down racer ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-rally-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2554762">Expand</a></span>

Since you don&apos;t really get any objectives, completion is the only thing you can play for. That means</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The races in Death Rally are each only about 1 minute long, and there are only about 10 maps. Consequently, it&apos;s a VERY repetitive game. You usually have to do 3 to 5 races to get enough cash for an upgrade, and there are 5+ upgrades for every car, and 9 upgrades for each of the 6 weapons. Since you don&apos;t really get any objectives, completion is the only thing you can play for. That means you&apos;ll have to do several thousand of these 1 minute races.
<br>
<br>The game was fun to begin with, but 30 minutes later it was a repetitive snorefest. Don&apos;t get this game if you don&apos;t like grinding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-rally-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2553863">Expand</a></span>

All cars go at the same speed, Easy/Medium/Hard/Extreme works in a dumb way compared to the DOS version. So many upgrades for so much repetitive and so much failing. Not worth at all, specially if you are looking for the old good Death Rally.</span>

<br>
<br>The aiming is bad, the repair option is insanely expensive. It gets to a point where you&apos;re just trying to repair instead of win. Other games will actually give you a better sense of earned victory after spending hours of trying to get the highest score possible, this game just makes you feel dumb every minute of your life while playing it. Cause that&apos;s how long the races are. One minute. The original didn&apos;t have long races either but, At the very least you had better aim and your car actually felt like it was getting better, instead of worse. You&apos;d hope your next car feels better right? It felt the total opposite for me. It felt even slower and handled even worse and took even more damage. I couldn&apos;t bare it anymore, I just had to shut it down. I like to play games until I 100% them, but, when it feels like a grind and a luck match, I&apos;d rather go I feel most games have gotten more casual since the older gaming days, but, This was poorly done, I feel like an option or tweak for steering would be nice also maybe mouse aim, less turns, distracts from the carnage part.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-rally-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2556330">Expand</a></span>

Controls suck, graphics suck, gameplay sucks, music sucks, and the menus/interface are the worst nonworking counter intuitive broken buggy maddening garbage I&apos;ve ever been forced to attempt to use. We never got a multiplayer game working once and the two single player games I played were absolute tedium. You can&apos;t even change your controls away from &quot;absolute direction&quot; to &quot;relative to position&quot; which is a staple of any top-down racer. Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Racing was better. Ironman Stewart&apos;s Super Off Road was far better. RC Pro Am of any flavor, even the Gameboy versions, was far, far better. Heck the original Death Rally was at least twice this fun and this is supposed to be a remake of it. Epic fail. This is the worst top-down racing game ever designed by humans, cyborgs, self aware robots, or sentient computer viruses. If you waste any money on this trash you deserve all the virtual road rage you will get while trying to even make this raw sewage function properly, to say nothing of having anything approaching fun. Death Rally is a &apos;fun black hole&apos; out of which fun cannot possibly escape. Zero stars out of ten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-rally-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2746312">Expand</a></span>

<br>4) It&apos;s too hard to aim! The gun should auto-aim and auto-fire with unlimited ammo.
<br>5) Those secret weapons in the underground market are too expensive! You should just need to unlock them once and be able to use them in every race.
<br>6) I ran out of money and lost! They should give money even if you lose the race or get lapped, and repairing shouldn&apos;t cost as much.
<br>
<br>In short, this very casual remake of Death Rally. If the list above sounds like you, and that&apos;s what you want, then by all means, this might be the game for you.
<br>
<br>If you were looking for something with the challenge the original Death Rally offered, with fast, close races on the edge between destroying your opponents and being destroyed yourself then you may be disappointed.

The original was funny, exciting, challenging, also had some bad points like short campaign and the enemies are faster than you in higher difficulties. The new Death Rally has more problems. While the graphics are good and the music is good too (but not badass like in the original), the gameplay isn&apos;t as good as in the original. The maps are too little (much smaller than in the original) and there are about 10 maps and some of them are really bad. The upgrade system is not bad, but it&apos;s far from being good. The cash system is terrible, extremly terrible. The boosting is bad, the controlling is bad too, the bosses are much faster than the others and also they have much more health. The aiming is soo hard and this is why new (and old) weapons are useless (eg. snipergun, minigun, shotgun). The differences between the cars are smaller and there are +2 cars, but the extra cars are useless, the Deliverator is the best as in the original. The extra game modes are bad, some of them are extremly bad. The original game was a really good game (9/10), this one is not (5/10). If you like the original one much, then don&apos;t buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/death-rally-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2877019">Expand</a></span>

It was a game that defined my childhood and gave me a lifelong love for automotive combat. High-speed racing, deadly weaponry, awesome music and clear goal- to overcome the demon king of the race, the Adversary. This new incarnation brings all that and more, now featuring cooperative multiplayer and many minor tweaks the orignal lacked, given the hardware limitations of the time. This is the kind of game we could use more of in these troubled times- a game about pure, unadulterated fun. Listen to the Captain, racer boy. Things can get out of hand real fast out there. Now ride your machine, your motor-war-chariot. Hear it&apos;s sublime roar. Strap it, fuel up, reload, and ride out. It&apos;s time for death in the fast lane. It&apos;s time to race.
