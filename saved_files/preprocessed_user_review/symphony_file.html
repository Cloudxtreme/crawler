My only pet peeve with it was that it failed to recognize my iTunes library at first, and it took me a bit of time to figure out I had to download the latest version of Quick Time to get it to work. The game play experience is clean, simple and fun.  As you progress through the levels of difficulty, you also get progressively deeper interactions with enemies that warp or change the music in different ways until you kill them. The ship&apos;s progression mechanic and the ability to unlock a multitude of weapon and customize your ship accordingly kept my interest in the game&apos;s mechanic going, but ultimately - it is the experience of playing a cool game on top of your favorite music that draws me back to it. For the price-point it&apos;s at - I highly recommend this game. It feels cleaner and better than Beat Hazard, and it provides a different and novel visual experience.
<br>
<br>If - like me - you have a large song library of tunes you love, this is a great way to re-experience and rediscover your music ;).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/symphony/user-reviews?user_review_id=2558500">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the ridiculously clunky implementation of leaderboards (which is really what these kind of games are mostly about - at least to me) and overall very bad interface keep it from being that.
<br>It looks like it was designed for mobile platforms and there was NO optimization for PC gaming whatsoever. HUGE text and mouse input only (and on a general note: one cannot store weapon loadouts. It&apos;s tremendous fun having to swap all those weapons depending on what difficulty one chooses...). But worse than that, you can&apos;t see anywhere which songs were already played by others, you have to let the game analyze a whole song (which takes about 20 seconds) and then you still have to click a button just to check whether there are leaderboards for that particular song. Good luck finding one. Aside from the songs that come with the game and those that are discussed on the GOG forums I have not found a single one so far. And... the fact that there may not be a huge diversity of songs that have been played by people (I can&apos;t say for sure because I don&apos;t have the time to let the game analyze 100 songs just to check that) wouldn&apos;t even be so bad if they would either at least show in the song list which songs have leaderboards or have a catalog somewhere, even if it is just on their website. SOMETHING, damn it!
<br>They should&apos;ve ditched the whole story aspect (which I find just annoying aside from the somewhat interesting boss battles) and concentrated on the things mentioned above instead. It could have been so great because while I like the interface of Audiosurf, I don&apos;t really like the gameplay of it. With Symphony, I would LOVE the basic gameplay but without proper leaderboards it&apos;s just useless. So in a way, my score is somewhat generous. But... it does look and play very well and I see all the potential that it has. It seems such a waste because it seems to me that implementing those things I mentioned probably would just take them 5% of the time that it took to create this whole game. And it could catapult it from nice but useless to cult status.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/symphony/user-reviews?user_review_id=2815611">Expand</a></span>

You could disable the music and put a random track in the background and feel no difference.
<br>After the Mezzo-piano difficulty, Mezzo-forte and so on are completely impossible to beat 100% for the 95% of the songs: plenty of enemies, small arena and a big collision box due to the large ship.
<br>Not mentioning the &quot;cannon balls&quot; fired by the enemies ships that can&apos;t be seen when the arena became red (on black background) since they&apos;re red or black.
<br>The story is useless for this type of game and unattractive, the Bosses are easy and only of 5 types. There should be a way to &quot;deactivate&quot; the story mode if I do not want to be interrupted when I&apos;m playing since it doesn&apos;t allow you to record a score on the leaderboard because of the extra points you get for the Boss.

The procedural game setup can always be a double-edged sword, since, even if you &quot;never get the same layout twice&quot; by randomizing the stages, if all the stages just consist of the same 6 things over and over, then if you&apos;ve seen one, you&apos;ve really seen it all.  Symphony has not just too few enemies to stay entertaining, it has the same small number of enemies flying in the same small number of patterns over and over again.  In fact, there are so few patterns of enemy flight paths that you frequently find ships overlapping!
<br>
<br>There is another major problem in the game, in that, apparently fearing that they might make some songs too hard or others too easy, they decided to give the player infinite lives, a ship so huge you can&apos;t possibly dodge anything, but make it take tons of hits and regenerate with every enemy killed (including by ramming your ship into it), so there&apos;s basically no skill to the game at all, you just play by buying up more expensive weapons for your ship to be able to handle higher levels that give you more cash to upgrade your weapons enough to handle the next highest level.
<br>
<br>In general, I think how much you like this game depends on how much you&apos;ve played it.  It&apos;s fun for the first few hours, but notably, only 0.5% of players ever actually played the game for 12 hours.   That, right there, shows exactly the problem in the game.  It just doesn&apos;t have enough variety to keep people coming back past playing their favorite 20 songs or so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/symphony/user-reviews?user_review_id=3261363">Expand</a></span>
