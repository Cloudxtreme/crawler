If you haven&apos;t played the games in this collection yet, well, buy it! If you&apos;re a Mega Man fan that is. All 4 games are quite solid, Mega Man 10 being my favorite because of all the different gameplay styles and music. I believe that Mega Man 10 takes the best parts out of the previous games. Except that Mega Man can&apos;t slide- but Proto Man can if you want to play as him. He can also charge, unlike mega man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mega-man-legacy-collection-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7813804">Expand</a></span>
