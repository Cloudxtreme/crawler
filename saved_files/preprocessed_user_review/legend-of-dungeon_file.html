<br>
<br>Pros +
<br>Game music is not usually something you notice in a game, but the music in this game really stood out.
<br>
<br>The randomized dungeon system keeps the game interesting
<br>
<br>The graphics are creative and colorful.
<br>
<br>cons-
<br>The item system is confusing, you can only scroll through using one button.
<br>
<br>Hard to tell what items are/do.
<br>
<br>Only one attack.</span>

Even though you do the same thing each play, the dungeon is completely randomized and you&apos;ll spend a good amount of time discovering new small tricks or interesting features. The items can be unbalanced at times, and the monsters can sometimes be down-right way too hard, but overall I got a good amount of play time out of this, and plan on playing it more in the near future. The best quality to this game is that you can just pick it up, play through it once, and put it back down. It doesn&apos;t require a large attention span which is good if you&apos;re someone like me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-dungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3890744">Expand</a></span>

LoD is not only a fun to play game but fun to look at, its a very colorful game and it has a highly unique style and theme to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-dungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527209">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyway, I really wanted to like this game but other than the graphics theres nothing original or even worth mentioning. The combat is a step below flash games, the sound is nothing  write home about and its just SO incredibly tedious and boring.  Honestly the critics were gentle with this game.  Avoid at all cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-dungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3634735">Expand</a></span>

At times downright silly, always challenging, and feverishly addictive, Legend of Dungeon sets a new benchmark for coffee-break roguelikes. The stunning lighting, brilliant colors, and deceptively-simple mechanics bring wide-appeal to the once-obscure, hardcore-only genre. With full gamepad support, up to 4-player (local-only) co-op, online and local leaderboards, and mountains of cuddly kittens, RobotLovesKitty threw in everything but the kitchen sink, (which may or may not be added as a weapon in a future update.) The married-dev-duo&apos;s passion for old-school beat &apos;em ups, roguelikes, and wonderfully-lit pixel art culminate in a bewildering spectacle of light and magic no gamer should miss. If you&apos;re a fan of wearing-cats-as-hats, permadeath, pretty colors, dark dungeons, shoulder-punching co-op sessions, and running screaming from hell-spawned monsters, this is the game for you. Look no further; Legend of Dungeon is roguelike perfected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-dungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3525767">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Nice variety of items and monsters
<br>- Great pacing. New monsters, items and random NPC events are revealed in such a way that keeps the game interesting.
<br>
<br>The Bad...
<br>- Some people would complain that there isn&apos;t much difference in the look of the dungeon as your progress other than lighting. All rooms feel fairly similar.
<br>- Currently there is no save feature... Which wouldn&apos;t be a problem other than a good run can last upwards of 4 hours. But apparently a save feature is something in the works though.
<br>- Only local co-op.
<br>
<br>Conclusion...
<br>- Worth picking up. I certainly feel like I got my money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-dungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913990">Expand</a></span>

For starters this</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game... it&apos;s something special. And not a &quot;good&quot; kind of special either. You see i&apos;ve not played a game with the &quot;dead-you&apos;re-gonna&apos;-start-from-the-beginning&quot; concept for a long while now, not since clock tower for the Snes which was a long time back lemme&apos; tell you that.
<br>
<br>But i guess i have to give this game the benefit of the doubt and give it a second chance.
<br>
<br>For starters this game is hard to get into, you will die a LOT without reading some strategy guides, watching a gameplay video, or practicing a bit for yourself for a while.
<br>It&apos;s a basic beat em&apos; up concept with random loot. Unfortunately, weapons drop rarely (except for meaby one enemy) and that is what a game like this needs to survive for, i don&apos;t know like five more years without being completely forgotten by the community. Games like Borderlands 2, delver, spiral knights, tf2, and others rely on the comcept to survive long after their debut. For an example Tf2 was created nearly eight years ago (at least when this review was posted) but it&apos;s still going with a very large community still backing the nearly pointless game that is Valve&apos;s least interest.
<br>
<br>Returning to Legend of dumbasses there isn&apos;t much more to be said, the graphics are appealing and the soundtrack is alright but not too majestic.
<br>
<br>So here&apos;s the summary:
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>1) Pixel graphics that are appealing
<br>2) Random loot (however still not entertaining)
<br>3) Nice soundtrack, weak however.
<br>4) Multiplayer is the most fun you&apos;ll have with this game
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>1) The random loot isn&apos;t getting this game anywhere... like.... wow.
<br>2) Pretty much a clone of many other dungeon-crawling games
<br>3) Multiplayer isn&apos;t very fun. And that is the BEST thing about this game!
<br>4) A group of enemies are way too hard to beat.
<br>5) Death occurs a lot even with the best gear obtainable
<br>
<br>In short, this game is crap. It&apos;s not a game i would play for very long with other similar games like Delver and Terraria. But still, if you are gonna&apos; waste time you might as well try this out.
<br>
<br>So in other words this game earns the title: &quot;Give me ten bucks and then i&apos;ll play it&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-dungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4894270">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Then you play in VR it adds a lot, implementation is OK (not great follow camera causes slight motion sickness).+1
<br>VR adds a lot to dungeon crawlers feeling of being in dark, gloomy place sucks you in and +1 for that (can&apos;t wait for Diablo/Torchlight in VR).</span>
