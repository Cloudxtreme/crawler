Ever PvP match is manipulated by an AI and if you don&apos;t play an specific deck on one of the eleven ranks on the letter let this AI always draw the wrong cards or on the other hand the perfect cards on your opponents site so you don&apos;t have any change but loose the match. Of course give the game you the illusion you can craft every card and deck as long as you spent enough time with farming the PvE mode. But there works the same AI and cheats you so badly that I already swear several times to spent my next vacation in the USA to &quot;visit&quot;some developers. It&apos;s just ridicules what **** the AI produce game for game for game.
<br>
<br>Also the balancing is absolute trash. Yes, there are some interesting cards you might build an interesting deck. Buuutttt, any deck that has more depth than the most simple rush decks has an win-rate under 40 percentage so you have the choice - play an uninteresting most simple deck with success or an interesting deck just for fun until you get frustrated form the high losing rate!
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s definitive not a Free to Play game and an insistent cheating AI is for me reason enough to boycott the game! Cheating players are bad enough. But where do we come to when game manufacturers start to implement there homemade cheats into there computer games?
<br>A bad course that should never find support!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7548408">Expand</a></span>

A duel starts and all you can do is to hope you become this advantage because it&apos;s ways to strong!

There is no creativity, just reading a deck list and collecting those cards. This isn&apos;t like Hearthstone where you can build a deck unlike other people&apos;s decks and still have fun, you are forced to play a specific type, most often based on Lethal or Mana Ramp, in order to compete. I discourage anyone from spending cash on this game, after spending $60 I got a total of 2 legendary and 4 epics. That was an average of $10 per card. The Skyrim story pack is also worthless in regards to rewards, so if you&apos;re completing it for cards, it&apos;s not going to help you much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7515285">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Legendary cards are super powerful in this game and most of them are not limited to 1, you can have 3 per deck. The minimum deck size in ladder games is 50, it&#xB4;s not uncommon for decks to have 9+ legendarys, which means that building a competitive deck is super expensive. The chance to get legendarys from packs or rewards is very low, so the pressure to spend money on the game if you want to be competitive is extreme. Collecting cards in TESL is very slow and expensive. I&#xB4;ve never played a ccg with such a shameless pay to win business model.
<br>
<br>The prophecy feature seems like a nice idea. Every time one of your runes is broken (at 25, 20, 15 health etc.) you draw a card and if that card is a prophecy you can play it for free. That seems like it&#xB4;s intended to help against the &quot;problem&quot; of aggro-decks hat many ccgs have. However, while you have a chance to get a prophecy card based on how many prophecys you have in your deck (which adds a very strong rng element to the game), many aggro decks have cards that give them a guaranteed positive effect when an opponents&apos; rune is broken. So the runes, that seem to be a counter to aggro, do the exact opposite.
<br>
<br>TESL has a lot of combos and card interactions that add nice complexity to the game. Sadly, many of those are so powerful and unbalanced that the game is simply decided by rng not by player decisions. Whoever draws his &quot;killer-combos&quot; first, wins. And those strong cards are hidden behind a pay wall.
<br>
<br>I really liked the PvE content of TESL, the story mode is very well done. The AI its much better than what other games have to offer. Sadly solo arena gets really frustrating at higher levels. The AI has strong rebuild decks with awesome interactions and also &quot;magically&quot; draws perfect, while you have to draft a deck and obviously the rng in draft can result in awful decks. I&#xB4;ve reached rank 1 in solo arena and managed to win against all 9 opponents at rank 1 multiple times, I&apos;m not saying this because I&apos;m angry for losing. I&apos;m angry that the developers use the decent rewards in PvE as carrot, a carrot you often can&apos;t reach because the difficulty level is designed in a way that most players will not make any profits out of PvE. But hey, you can spend money on arena tickets and try again. Just another cash grab.
<br>
<br>It takes months until balance changes are made, if that ever happens (no problem, most changes make no sense anyway). Player feedback is ignored and there is almost no developer interaction with the community.
<br>
<br>TESL had the potential to be an awesome ccg in the elder scrolls universe. Shameless greed and developer incompetence when it comes to game design and balancing prevent that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7506993">Expand</a></span>

The game is very generous with rewards for &apos;soul gems&apos; to craft decks as well as gold for arena tickets and other items. The game has multiple gamemodes from casual pvp to story elements and arena, each with their own unique flavor - great to have options to play different modes. Definitely a must if you are a fan of CCG&apos;s and a great introduction to the world of the Elder Scrolls.

To start off the game needs a lot of balancing and tweaking to allow more diverse card combos. Example the intelligence cards are used nearly by everyone because of the utility of the cards, that many other types do not have. Also the animations of the cards are pretty lacking. However it makes it up in the tactical game-play of placing which cards on which side, and thinking of when to break the seals of the enemy. Yet at times RNG seems to not favor you especially when you draw poorly and your seals don&apos;t draw the good cards. However, that to can be fixed by getting between 2-3 of the same cards, which reduces the bad draws drastically. This part I don&apos;t truly like because there are so many options for deck build, yet usually if you do not have 2-3 of the same card the chance of getting that single card is very low within the 50 card deck. Which brings up to another bad part of the game and that is the cost of crafting cards takes a lot of soul shards. After playing the story I ended up with around 400 shards and all of that went into one simple card. However you only get an average of 5-50 shards for most of your cards you deconstruct. This makes it feel like there is a bigger intensive to buying card packs, especially if you do not like the solo arena mode. Overall this is a good card game is good but not amazing, yet, and just needs more attention from the devs and players for it to become an amazing game. Despite that I&apos;m still enjoying the 2 lane system and the magic the gathering like card combo system Collapse</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7136515">Expand</a></span>

The story line gets very interesting in the 2nd half. The story line for the expansion is great as well.
<br>
<br>I`ve seen more variety online then while playing hearthstone. This might be why i had more fun with this game. Its easyer to get the cards you want compared to gwent or hearthstone. I did not have trouble building a somewhat competitive deck with it. Ranked it to the 8th level.
<br>
<br>It does only take about 15-20 seconds to find a match and arena is quite fun. I can see myself play this game a little bit for each day. It was very fun to play so far. Nice art and music. A lot of avatars and progression to be made with leveling system as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7477199">Expand</a></span>

That subtlety really starts to hit home the more you play it.  The story mode is equal parts hamfisted chicanery and strangely compelling in its simplicity.  It sort of reminds you of playing through Oblivion or Morrowind to some extent.  And that simplicity is completely gone from rest of the game.  The cards and deck building might titillate the hardcore card player, of which I am not.  Juxtapose this to Gwent for a moment; Gwent is intuitive and naturally easy to pick up and devise stratagem.  Somewhere in the complexity it loses a sense of fun and purpose.  The mana system is restrictive and can easily put you in a bad situation; i feel the only reason to use this is to force players to play weaker cards and give it a bit of randomness at the outset.  I think it&apos;s a poor substitution for a much more simple system.   The UI is horrible, but that&apos;s a beth standard.  In Sum, i feel like it initially gets your attention but after the first story mode act it dawns on you that this is it.  and the crawl to the real gem of strategy and reflex is far more than it should be.  I think it lacks the sense of being in control and limits your options to the point that you may as well be rolling dice or playing poker.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7219654">Expand</a></span>

The &quot;casual&quot; mode is anything but casual as you will get stomped by tier 1 decks played by the most experienced gamers quite frequently. If you are a highly competitive person with a lot of time and money to spend, you may enjoy this. If not, stay away!

<br>Is it all bad? No. I find the card mechanics and art to be very appealing. Unfortunately, the game isn&apos;t design to be &quot;fun&quot;. The game is designed to appeal to gambling weaknesses and &quot;hamster wheel&quot; mechanics. You play thinking you will have fun, grind, never go anywhere, and never get to the fun part. You think. &quot;Maybe if you spend a little more time and money things will change. It is so shiny, I should keep going.&quot;
<br>
<br>Even if the game isn&apos;t as bad as the ftp models for other ftp games, it is still terrible.
<br>
<br>Welcome to the New Age
<br>This game and it&apos;s ilk are the bane of gamers. The &quot;free to play&quot; model is not free if you want to compete. Yes, if you want to grind 6 hours a day and leave your computer on 24X7 while attached to twitch, you may be able to limit the amount of money you want to spend. Obviously, The power and the bandwidth required for the twitch stuff isn&apos;t really free and you are giving the game free advertising. You time grinding, while not having as much fun as you could play a game designed to be fun, isn&apos;t free either.
<br>
<br>These ftp games have one upped the mmo model as far as the grinding hamster wheel goes while spending a fraction of the upfront and maintenance costs of an mmo. This stuff is insidious.
<br>
<br>Are you angry about dlc bullstuff in AAA games? Ironically, the extra dlc will usually cost you less than a ftp game&apos;s in app purchases. Assuming you will actually enjoy the AAA game from start to finish -- I recommend paying for that AAA game with dlc and being happy about the deal you are getting.

<br>
<br>The only problems I see is slightly clunky and slow UI/menus and completing your card collection full of various multiple legendaries can be very slow, especially with no legendary duplicate filter active, even in Hearthstone you cannot get duplicate legendaries anymore, so this is definitely something to improve in the future.
<br>
<br>Overall, with some additional work, code optimization and mentioned card collection improvements, TESL can easily become the best card game on the market. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7704259">Expand</a></span>

<br>NOT p2w : &#x2714;&#x2714;&#x2714; (who says &quot;game is p2w or expensive&quot; just ignore them.. I can play with semi-budget decks in top 100.. Just check google.. You can see low lvl, low collection players in top 100)
