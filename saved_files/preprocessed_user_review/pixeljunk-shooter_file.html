I have not finished this game yet, but it is progressing nicely so far.
<br>
<br>The interface is great, the controls are great, the music and sound is great, things are self-explanatory or easy to figure out, and I haven&apos;t found any bugs so far.  It&apos;s difficult to rate graphics in a game that isn&apos;t trying to have super detailed graphics, so instead I&apos;ll say the graphics are great for what they are trying to be.
<br>
<br>To fairly give this game a lower score than a 10/10 would mean finding another game with very similar game play to compare it against, but I don&apos;t know of any such game so I think this deserves its own category.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-shooter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3766085">Expand</a></span>

It controls like Asteroids and your goal is rescuing civilians, like Choplifter, giving it an old school charm, but its physics and puzzles also make it feel modern. You control your ship&apos;s movement with WASD and your aiming with the mouse. Both are completely independent, so you can move one way and shoot the other, for example. Your job is to pilot your ship through a planet to rescue miners, which you do by right clicking to grab them with your tractor beam-like device. Left click is for shooting at a variety of underground creatures and for blasting away rock that may be in your path. Once you rescue a set number of miners on a level, the exit will unlock, allowing you to move onto the next level.
<br>
<br>The heart, fun and real challenge in the game comes with the puzzle element, which greatly employs physics-obeying lava and water. You can fly through water, but lava will destroy your ship, meaning that you have to either move the lava out of the way or neutralize it with water, both of which you may do by shooting out rock underneath it. You need to plan your moves, though, because a mistake could burn you or some miners with lava or make it otherwise difficult to accomplish your objective. There are also items that you&apos;ll find that interact with the lava and water and which you may need to use wisely to finish levels, but I won&apos;t say more, since part of the fun is discovering things on your own.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m only partway into the game and it&apos;s fun. It&apos;s a nice combination of arcade shooter and puzzle game. Neither aspect is too hard, so you can enjoy the game without being frustrated, but it&apos;s just challenging enough that you&apos;ll make mistakes now and then. I recommend it to arcade fans and puzzle fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-shooter/user-reviews?user_review_id=3784729">Expand</a></span>

On one hand the premises is very simple, just a simple 2D shooter and the difficulty is almost non-existent for now I guess. Very little complaints as everything hits the mark very well, though I have heard the game is pretty short and the final boss battle is pretty cheap. But overall a great, solid, fluid physics shooter game!</span>
