<br>- a geat depressing feel of being powerless, hunted down, oppressed. The game shows a soulless industrial world, with mind-controlled bodies of humans, dead pigs and huge empty hangars and warehouses
<br>- pretty nice sound (there is practically no music here but the sounds are very atmospheric)
<br>- sirprisingly complex and natural animations of characters - dunno how they did this either
<br>- tons of innovative, truly original scripted sequences and puzzles which I have never seen anywhere else! This leaves an impression that they simply didn&apos;t allow any mediocre design idea into the game.
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- lack of story! There is a general feeling of a story happening, and a very strange ending. I went online searching for an explanation of the ending, thinking I may have not paid attention during play or was too unsophisticated to decypher it - but instead of a clear explanation I just found multiple &quot;theories&quot; about who mind controls whom etc. Seriously, people, artists use this trick to make you think their work is more deep that it actually is. The devs don&apos;t know themselves what they wanted to say, which means there is no story there. Instead, there are vague and contradicting clues, &quot;signs&quot; and mini-narratives inserted at random to make you curious. These theories and discussions they need just to get some buzz around the game. Don&apos;t fall for that trick. If the creator has a clear story in mind, he tells it directly and clearly. And if you see a vague piece like this be sure the creator himself has no clue. Anyway, this isn&apos;t really a bad thing. Whatever. It feels too &quot;artsy&quot; and a bit too cheap of a trick to me. But they are in their own right here as artists. Maybe i&apos;m just a too &quot;logical&quot; math/sci type for this. Still, i did enjoy the feeling and the overall setting of the game, even if there is no story.
<br>- a somewhat too linear style of puzzles - frequently I would solve them just by doing the only things possible, only realizing the idea behind the puzzle after solving it. Which still may be ok for casual players who don&apos;t like harder games (?)
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- truly, I found none.
<br>
<br>My respect to Denmark has grown after seeing what its game developers can create. Hats off to you guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6776785">Expand</a></span>

Aside from the gorgeous gorgeous visuals, and immersive environment that really gets you attached to the character and some situations emotional disturbed by some of the going on&apos;s in the game, the puzzles are very creative and varied enough that you don&apos;t feel like your doing similar puzzles. With some intuitive thinking, they are also not that difficult to the point where you just get plain frustrated. This isn&apos;t a triple A title, or a game backed up with a huge budget, but for what it is, it is simply amazing. It does suffer from lack of &apos;repalyability&apos;, but your really just going to play this game for the one time experience anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6757336">Expand</a></span>

Yes, its too easy and yes its short, but if you like strange films like from Jim Jarmusch or Terry Gilliam you will love this game. There are a lot of references and the atmosphere is just magic and disturbing at the same time. Best setting is to play it on surround and on a big screen (beamer). And yes it has an open ending but in my opinion this is one of the best parts of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6687273">Expand</a></span>

I played that game to death--got every achievement, showed it to all my friends--the works.  As such, this will be less of an overview of INSIDE generally, but rather a comparison of the similarities and differences between LIMBO and INSIDE.
<br>
<br>As an aside, it should be noted that the game mechanics of these two games are almost identical.  The same jumping, pushing, and climbing mechanics in INSIDE are basically identical to LIMBO, with minor control improvements (for example, holding up no longer causes you to continually jump, sparing you accidental jumping after you land or reach the top of a ladder).  There are also at least two new mechanics in INSIDE.  Both games also feature &quot;secret&quot; areas, which appeals to completionists like myself.
<br>
<br>As far as gameplay goes, LIMBO was unfair.  It would teach you one thing and then kill you for doing it in the next puzzle, or throw a long platforming section at you that required near perfect execution to live through it, or a puzzle that requires you to do a few actions and then wait a very specific amount of time before continuing, or die.  And the pacing was quick, and often, the player&apos;s execution had to be precise.  There was an achievement to get through the game with five or less deaths.  With a few notable exceptions, the puzzles in LIMBO come more or less back to back.  Overall, the gameplay was quick, precise, and memorization-based.
<br>
<br>The first notable thing about INSIDE is its 2.5D graphics.  At first, I thought this was aesthetic only, but I found that puzzles incorporate the &quot;background&quot; quite a lot, and in a very effective way.  In 2D, if you have an enemy chasing you that&apos;s far faster than you, you have to use audio cues to let the player know that something is chasing them.  In 2.5D, you can have the enemy appear visually in the background, and the player can see how fast it is moving, and anticipate when they will have to take action.  It&apos;s actually a really neat way to present information to the player.  On that note, the puzzles on INSIDE are largely predictable, so unlike in LIMBO, many of the puzzles can be accomplished on the first try.
<br>
<br>The pacing of INSIDE is considerably slower than in LIMBO.  It takes about 45 minutes to get through LIMBO if you know all the puzzles and are going at a reasonable pace.  INSIDE takes closer to an hour and a half, largely due to long sections where you are just holding down one key to run, sometimes for almost a minute at a time.  That is not to say this is time wasted, as INSIDE is a considerably more aesthetic game, whereas LIMBO is more stylized, though both are more or less monochromatic.  INSIDE also has a vague sort of storyline, which develops (mostly through environmental cues) throughout the game.
<br>
<br>To conclude, I was not as impressed with INSIDE as I was with LIMBO.  The gameplay of INSIDE was fun, but not often very engaging, since there was a lot of downtime where you just run and look at the pretty visuals, and consider what&apos;s going on in the story.  I&apos;m still recommending INSIDE to some close friends as a once-through sort of game, but it&apos;s not the sort of game I&apos;m going to obsess over like I did with LIMBO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6532067">Expand</a></span>

Builds to a GREAT payoff with a twist near the ending.  And the third act is like a cross between dark sci-fi and a Beckett play.  It&apos;s a game where my friends have discussed the ending and debated its meaning for hours.  Good stuff.</span>

I was fun but very short and easy. I still give it 7 points because it had an intense atmosphere and ripping off the tail of a pig was something really weird.</span>

<br>
<br>The game play mechanics are solid and responsive and overall represent a more satisfying experience than limbo (not that the latter was disappointing in any way). It is visually stunning - especially in the underwater scenes - and introduces background threats in a novel and satisfying way, creating a greater sense of immersion within the scenery. At the same time, however, I often found this frustrating as puzzle-solving and movement in general is confined solely to two dimensions, so that I&apos;d often find myself trying to differentiate between what was accessible and what was merely scenery when considering how to move forward.
<br>
<br>The story is compelling from the start but asks many more questions than it answers, which may or may not be a good thing. Personally I enjoy having something to discuss after the game, whereas my partner (who played with me) strictly prefers the closure of a narrative upon completion. Either way, the experience is unique and it gives a lot of food for thought.
<br>
<br>At the price I can understand that many people would end up dissatisfied with the product. Personally, I think this just depends on what you want to get out of the game. If you want a world to lose yourself in and to play in day after day, then this obviously isn&apos;t for you. But if you&apos;re looking for an evening of fantastic and unique entertainment, then this is something you really should try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6536012">Expand</a></span>

They were classics, they were truly ahead of their time.  However, in 2016, &quot;INSIDE&quot; feels more like a little bit of this and a little bit of that as far as an actual videogame goes- it feels like it doesn&apos;t have its own identity whatsoever.  It has very simple mechanics, the puzzles are not difficult and the plot is barely there.  Something about a boy running, or sneaking into some type of facility and some nonsensical science fiction vignettes ensue.  You might even go as far as to say that the entire GAME is a series of vignettes.  One long way from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B.&quot; Its not a rewarding final destination though, it may be in fact the only thing that makes &quot;Inside&quot; totally UN-re-playable.  Its a three hour experience, with lots of vague unexplained &quot;things&quot; that happen or that you&apos;ll see, only to end with no explanation and a very dissatisfying credit roll that might even make you sit there thinking: &quot;Is that really it?&quot;
<br>
<br>I have a very hard time giving this a good score, as it was twenty dollars for a three hour single player 2.5D walking simulator that I couldn&apos;t even justify playing through again.  I was however, riveted on my first playthrough (at least until the terrible ending).  I believe that if a larger studio or developer had worked on something of this caliber, artistically speaking, they would have no doubt invested more time into fleshing out plot ideas and elements into a cohesive story- rather than a cluttered idea soup that it unfortunately came out to be.  That is not to say that their aren&apos;t very good ideas here, quite simply there are, but since they lack structure they aren&apos;t being conveyed to the player correctly.  The games presentation suffers immensely from these poorly constructed ideas that are not even capable of telling a proper story.  Their are so many unrelated, baffling, and pointless things in &quot;Inside&quot; that its a little disconcerting to see people praising it as much as they are.  Its not unwarranted praise though, but its certainly not immune to having its flaws pointed out either.  I hope to see better projects from this studio in the future, however until they offer more to the experience, (beyond a nice visual style, solid atmosphere and a few scattered emotional high points) I wouldn&apos;t spend another penny on one of their products.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6535591">Expand</a></span>

Me and my friends all love LIMBO and when this came out, I bought it day one, we gathered together and completed it in 2-3 hours. Some people would complain about the length, but for me it just was really really good experience and I don&apos;t have much time to spend on video games these days, so I like when they don&apos;t take too much.</span>

<br>I thoroughly enjoyed this game, the puzzles were challenging enough to make you think, but shouldnt get too many people stuck, and the graphics and physics are perfectly done, but it was more about the adventure and unravelling plot for me. I reckon it&apos;s a great game and I&apos;ve already recommended it to several friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6685778">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, the game is short but you won&apos;t get bored and it won&apos;t  feel like a chore to play. The levels always have lots going on and are a testament to storytelling without words or text.
<br>I&apos;m still inclined to give this title a 10/10 despite its brevity; everything in the game is clearly well thought out and a real joy to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6535668">Expand</a></span>

When I got around to playing it, I was slightly disappointed. It was good, but I was left wanting more. Inside has a much more interesting world and characters. Playdead spent more than five years putting together a five hour experience. This development time allowed them to polish every inch of the world to perfection. In a world of glitch filled messes that sell millions of copies, Inside is an extremely refreshing departure from the norm. The new puzzle mechanics, although not too difficult, are unique and fun. Inside&apos;s final twenty minutes can only be described as extraordinary. Give this game a chance, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6582139">Expand</a></span>

Instead of giving answers, it just gives you more questions and gets you thinking why, when,  or what. The graphics are also stunning, they fit very well to the theme of the game. Well, it was created by the same people of Limbo, so what did you expect?</span>

<br>
<br>Story has no beginning and no ending, after 4 hours you know nothing. They say this is is all for your imagination, but real reason: &quot;we just have no plot, sorry&quot;
<br>
<br>Gameplay just poor, graphics are much worse and no plot.

<br>There!!! Here is your story and plot. From now on you can do whatever you want INSIDE. You can make the mouse punk and die from the broken glass or modest guy who died from vengeance cat. WHATEVER! But we have a plot.
<br>You, unlike my little story - do not have one! You are just pretentious. That&apos;s it. Nothing to show just some stupid idea without beginning and end. The &quot;atmosphere&quot; in your game is spreading over 140 km of factory-like levels without end and even slightest effort to be changed. So called puzzles are just padding the game and our time. The end that should explain something or be shocking to us after 30 seconds is hilarious and obnoxiously stupid. We even lost our faceless protagonist in the process with whom we actually have to have relationship...
<br>Ah, it is pointless to tell how terrible this game is. But is not pointless to tell the others to DON&quot;T BUY THIS CRAP.

I get the &apos;deeper&apos; meanings behind the game, but I wouldn&apos;t have payed $20 for this game had I known it was so shallow overall. I felt legitimately scammed by this game considering how easy and short it was. This is a scenario that makes me think Sony should make exceptions with its digital refund policy. Despite the beautiful art and sound in the game, I&apos;d rather own a $20 poster, or have a good dinner, than have played this game only to be disappointed and delete it from my PS4.
<br>
<br>Considering the $20 price-point for this game, I was very disappointed. Especially after reading so many glowing reviews, including journalists who got to play it before its release saying,&quot;holy crap this game is CRAZY&quot;. I was exited to find that moment where my mind would be blown and I&apos;d get some sort of rush, but that never came. The ending was interesting, but most of the game was literally just REALLY slow puzzles that didn&apos;t take SKILL or INTELLIGENCE, but TIME. The game would&apos;ve been  even shorter than it&apos;s 3-4 hour content if we didn&apos;t have to backtrack or wait around standing still to solve 90% of the puzzles. I could go on. In my 4 years as a PlayStation customer this was the first time I ever looked up the refund policy Sony has on digital content (which is basically &apos;no&apos;). I still wish I could get my money back, it took me 3 separate sessions to finish this (REALLY SHORT) game, solely because I got bored after any consecutive hour of playing it, and only completed it since my money was a sunk cost at that point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6713053">Expand</a></span>

History, supposedly for those who like to think, just dull. The game took only 4 hours, but the second half was held for gritting his teeth.</span>

Players are dropped in the middle of a completely unique world that is very reminiscent of George Orwell&apos;s dystopian society in &quot;1984&quot;. There is a clear sense of dread emulated throughout the narrative and this is made to be felt quite vividly throughout game-play. Many times throughout navigating the world, paranoia and fear can be felt as threats are so abundant and the world leaves a lingering vulnerability which only leads to enhance the experience.
<br>
<br>While structurally Inside is linear, the puzzles and direction of storytelling make the game compelling. Inside uses its game-play mechanics to enhance and unravel the narrative in a meaningful way that not many other stories have done. A lack of dialogue and sole reliance on the environment empowers the medium in which this story is delivered. This is rare and should be appreciated for its value as an art form and narrative capability. In conclusion, Inside succeeds as an experience in terms of inspiring world and art direction combined together delivering a truly unique and incredible story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6914750">Expand</a></span>

<br>- the game should not be long - 6-20 hours is perfect. No game should be grindy.
<br>- gameplay - it should be intuitive and clear
<br>I understand there are different games focusing on different points, but as a platformer Inside meets all criteria above. Ori and the Blind Forest, Super Meat Boy, Bindings of Isaac and now Inside - that how the games should be made today. As if you live there playing, when you can feel all what happens to your character on your skin.
<br>As of Inside, this game also reminded me of Portal 2 - humongous abandoned factories, I could really feel all this fear and loneliness of that boy.
<br>To sum it up - 10 of 10, perfect game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6985406">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Presents a beautiful and solemn world that is instantly gripping and immersive.
<br>+ Perhaps an odd positive, but this game offers very unique rendering and physics that feel amazing and are just absolutely delightful to watch, especially in the incredible finale.
<br>? Some will compliment the spartan story that leaves a lot to the viewer&apos;s imagination, but at the end of the day, there is relatively little substance to the story/world and the content that&apos;s there is a lot more obvious than people are apt to let on.
<br>- Significantly easier than the studio&apos;s last title, with fewer mechanics. Feels more like an &quot;interactive experience&quot; than a &quot;game&quot; by the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959607">Expand</a></span>

<br>This time curiosity gave me a reason to &quot;move&quot;, solve puzzles, etc, but in the end none of your questions are answered, you just get more and more questions and not a single answer, you can make some educated guess but in the end there are so many explanations (given the fact you don&apos;t know the rules of this distopian world) that each possible explanation won&apos;t leave you satisfied enough.
<br>
<br>That said, everything else on this game is a piece of art, from graphics to music and (even more) sound effects, controls are just as simple as perfect for this game and mechanics are intriguing and sometimes a bit mind-blowing.
<br>
<br>The setting is some kind of distopian world where I felt Orwell&apos;s Big Brother surveillance (1984) and Otomo&apos;s psychic/human experiments (Akira) as well as Nihei&apos;s megastructures and elusive creatures (BLAME!), in the darkest possible mix. As I said before I would have loved some explanation of this world (how did humanity get to this point, who are you as the player, why are they doing this, etc) because in my opinion that would have risen meaningful questions (instead of meaningless ones), questions on our world and how could our society become something like INSIDE&apos;s distopia.
<br>
<br>All in all this journey was a positive experience, still I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game to many people because it is extremely dark, there&apos;s death in the worst meaning possible, and there&apos;s even worse than that, so, well, I guess people who liked the 3 works I identified as sources for this game (Orwell&apos;s &quot;1984&quot;, Otomo&apos;s &quot;Akira&quot; and Nihei&apos;s &quot;BLAME!&quot;) may enjoy the ride (aside from those unanswered questions...), while everyone else should steer away, nothing to gain for you playing this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7286141">Expand</a></span>

<br>Odd but great
<br>Inside is a puzzle platforming game lasting a little less than 4 hours where you play as a boy trying to escape..
<br>From what I&#x2019;m not sure... a factory of sorts... a communist country&#x2026; from being a test subject&#x2026;
<br>Hews trying to escape... you just go forward hiding in shadows, outsmarting the occasional enemies and doing multiple environmental puzzles&#x2026;
<br>Inside Is from the same studio that made LIMBO, and they feel pretty similar, though INSIDE feels much more polished and varied and to me was a much more enjoyable, and much more confusing experience..
<br>|Confusing because of the story. . Not the puzzles&#x2026;
<br>Every puzzle I ran across in inside had a clever solution&#x2026;
<br>I understood what needed to be done most of the time, but it was up to me figuring out how to accomplish this...
<br>There are many different puzzle types thrown in here, from timing, to pulling items, to distracting, to straight up mind control&#x2026;
<br>I don&#x2019;t have a favorite puzzle type as they were all equally fun to figure out&#x2026;
<br>And the setting here its creepy and eaerie
<br>you feel like there&#x2019;s danger around every corner, really immersing you into its world&#x2026;
<br>as does the delivery of this games campaign as it slows down for a few stealth sections where you&#x2019;re trying to blend in to not die..
<br>As this entire game you&#x2019;re being searched for&#x2026;
<br>so you have to dodge the sight of enemies as well as spot lights...
<br>no sections too frustrating with perfectly placed checkpoints much like limbo&#x2026;
<br>INSIDE is a really special experience with moments I want to talk about but to prevent spoilers&#x2026;I can&#x2019;t
<br>if one things for certain, you&#x2019;ll leave this game wondering exactly what just happened&#x2026;
<br>I wasn&#x2019;t quite blown away by this game as everyone else&#x2026;
<br>but I can still see its magic&#x2026;
<br>I give Inside
<br>an 8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7504123">Expand</a></span>

Narratively interesting, without words or written, and with a shift towards the mystery rather than horror as Limbo. In my opinion, more balanced than the predecessor Limbo, who had some puzzles with a little logical and very annoying solution.</span>

<br>Room for improvement:
<br>- I wish to see some additional aspects (besides of secrets and different ending) in the game that will make me want to complete it once more.

<br>Overall: Great game, will totally recommend, enjoy playing in total darkness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7288568">Expand</a></span>

It has a lot of depth and is overall a well-made game. It&apos;s a combination of puzzle and horror genres. Puzzles are very unique and never failed me to surprise. Puzzles in this game feel differently for some reason, they feel natural and very smooth. There are variety of them, ranging from timing to logic. The way this game achieves the horror feeling is the atmosphere. There are absolutely no cheap jumpscares, which you can find in games like Outlast and Five Nights at Freddy&apos;s. The sound design also adds to this. Graphics and animations are also top-notch and I was shocked when I saw Unity&apos;s logo in the credits - I didn&apos;t expect Unity to be able to create such magnificent picture. The only disadvantage of this game is its length. It took me about 4 hours to complete the game even though it took me a while to complete some of the puzzles. Then another hour to find all collectibles and achievements. Four hours isn&apos;t much for me, I wanted to enjoy the game for a longer period of time. In the end, I highly recommend this game to anybody as there is no difficult gameplay and even people who don&apos;t play video games will surely enjoy this little masterpiece. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7407339">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of - it&apos;s a 2.5D platform game that makes a real good use of the 0.5D aspect incorporating in its puzzles and obstacles. There is no word ever spoken in the entire game and the story is what you make of it. You start out in the woods with what looks like being on the run. While on the run you go through different locations solving different puzzles.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is the strongest point of this game. It gives out an eerie vibe very much reminding of Orwell&apos;s 1984. It&apos;s dark and unsettling. The visuals are amazing, the super smooth animation helps with the atmosphere and the sound design is top notch.
<br>
<br>As you progress trough the game all you can do is avoid enemies - and they do feel very scary. Scarier than most games I&apos;ve played in the recent memory. And you&apos;re always accompanied by the feeling of being small and alone in a very hostile environment.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t really want to go into details as not to spoil the fun. Enough to say - this game is amazing - you should give it a go. Not ver long but definitely worth a play-through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7281170">Expand</a></span>

I really liked it it was so beautiful. The game-play although simple at first becomes really really enjoyable with twists and turns you wont expect. The puzzles are not very challenging but they are still very rewarding to complete.  As a gamer i really recommend you try this out. We cant only play the triple A games like battlefield dota 2 elderscrolls tomb raider etc. These small games can be the best ones if your in the right mood and can get into them. This game was so refreshing from the predictable Triple A games I usually play. Although I will say there is nothing really game changing about this game. Its just the creativity and seeing new ideas and ways to play that make it so refreshing. I recommend you play it 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6894424">Expand</a></span>

Inside keeps the player on the edge of their seats the whole time with constant suspense and puzzles which are done perfectly well to keep the player interest in the game without boredom. Throughout the journey, you play as the boy who is the protagonist of an uncertain story and confusing plot. The ending can be confusing for many people including me, and it will make you cringe, trust me.
<br>
<br>The performance is flawless and locked at 60fps without a single bug, glitch or crash. The performance enhances your experience significantly due to the tense story and challenging puzzles awaiting to be solved. I have a decent gaming laptop, and it runs perfectly so if you&apos;re worried about the performance and unsure of whether you can run it or not, you can put that thought to oblivion.
<br>
<br>Sound and graphics are amazing and also a factor of which this game is amazing and worth its price. The level of detail of the sound and also what you see visually is just shockingly good for a platformer like Inside.
<br>
<br>Just simply, buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6709332">Expand</a></span>

There are several moments during play where I was completely awed and shocked by how innovative and fresh the gameplay felt. Playdead successfully creates a macabre universe for the player to explore, with the horror feeling unsettling at many points inside the game.
<br>
<br>However, at the end of the day, I wasn&apos;t really satisfied. I think it comes back to the idea that I play a game to for primarily fun. Sure, I also appreciate a riveting plot and cast of characters, but Inside really didn&apos;t have too much of a story to offer. There is no exposition whatsoever, leaving the user to piece together almost random pieces of a zombie infested story. As corny as this may sound, I found Inside to be quite lacking in the fun department. It&apos;s a horror game, sure, but it sometimes feels as dry as the inside of the zombie factory itself.
<br>
<br>To conclude, Inside is an interesting game that does many new and innovative things during its rather short gameplay. I&apos;d recommend it to those that are fans of horror games or are really into the indie gaming scene. However, I was overall disappointed after reading such raving reviews online. I found it similar to Valve&apos;s Portal in some ways, but just not as good. Portal was funny and refreshing at times. Although I realize that the developers had no intention to put any humor in the game, I felt like it could have used a laugh during this bizarre journey through the dark and the drab.
<br>
<br>Inside shines through innovative gameplay, but I push back against the unanimous critical acclaim. It&apos;s not as mechanically sound as a platformer like Super Meat Boy, nor is it as intriguing a puzzle game as Portal. The plot is all the time a bit vague, and the ending is, in my opinion, just weird. I stand by my 7/10, and simply wish to warn players not to buy into the hype.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=6919187">Expand</a></span>

The level of detail and heart-pounding action along with some brilliant level design made this an instant classic in the genre.</span>

<br>The story was fine, I will admit that it&apos;s very clever, it does have some interesting themes and meaning and there is a big reveal did shock me... unfortunately the game&apos;s reveal came in the last 30 minutes, I know that the game was just a build up for this reveal but I didn&apos;t think that it was a great payoff.
<br>It did took me by surprise but this final level was boring, annoying and just dragged on and I wanted it to end, so I&apos;m conflicted on the story, it&apos;s really smart but just didn&apos;t think that the payof was worth it.
<br>
<br>The gameplay was just like limbo but it has more fluid animation...and weaker puzzles, I found these puzzles to be boring and repetitive, I found that sad because I loved limbo&apos;s puzzles but they were really underwhelming in inside.
<br>
<br>I heard people say that this game found this game powerful in this story, I don&apos;t necessarily agree but I do see where they are coming from, it touches themes of individualism and I can defenitily see why someone would love this game, I just didn&apos;t thought that the puzzles and boring environnements made the actual payoff worth it, I guess that this game just isn&apos;t for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7280390">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was just disappointed about the story, its delivery and its conclusion. All throughout the game, you will be curious on what on earth is happening yet it is never revealed. Finishing it the first time makes me feel like this game is a demo, incomplete product that is yet to be finished. You will have to play it over and over, doing the same puzzles again to fully understand the game. Basically you have to answer your own questions about the story, it will make you think and develop theories. It was just too ambiguous for my liking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inside/user-reviews?user_review_id=7372820">Expand</a></span>

It is truly a work of art. It is a little too short though and hmm... its ending is not very satisfying. It leaves more questions than answers (that&apos;s not a bad thing), but it also ends rather suddenly.</span>
