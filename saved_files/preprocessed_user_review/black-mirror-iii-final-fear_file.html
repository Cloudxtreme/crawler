In this third installment of Black Mirror, the story is actually more intense and exciting than the previous installments. It absolutely made me keep wanting to progress and see what happens next. The dark environment backgrounds are as spooky as the other installments. Although the final part of the story is not as powerful and intense as I expected, it is acceptable. In my book, the ending was great and satisfying.
<br>
<br>Overall, it is indeed a remarkable and worthwhile experience in playing Black Mirror 2 and 3. I truly recommend this game to any point and click adventure gamers that preferred story filled with horror and mystery. I also suggest to play the previous installment of the game, BM2, before going for this one. In fact, it may be better to play from the first BM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-mirror-iii-final-fear/user-reviews?user_review_id=4722091">Expand</a></span>
