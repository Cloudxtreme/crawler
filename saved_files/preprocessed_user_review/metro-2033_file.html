This game is the most atmospheric and immersive shooter I have ever played. Maybe the most atmospheric game, period. This is like another Bioshock or actually more like Half-Life 2 to me, I could see myself playing through this game multiple times. It is a masterpiece really, it is a game about atmosphere and story and I personally found no issues with the ballistics. Shooting was fun, the game is challenging, and has a very, very good story (based of the book of the same name.) Best graphics of any game released. Yes, better than Crysis, in it&apos;s full glory with DX11 it looks spectacular. The game just has this authentic, realistic feeling and the graphics just add a whole nother layer onto the game. I REALLY felt like I was there in this world, extremely compelling. Must play! 10/10 Will be a cult-hit, possible the most under-rated game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=746939">Expand</a></span>

I preordered it on Steam because I ran into an extra $50 and figured why the hell not...Eastern European developers are really coming into their own, should be good. I was right. A lot of people are probably going to complain about it&apos;s lack of multiplayer or the length of its campaign. I have no idea how long the campaign is yet, so I can&apos;t comment on that. Personally, I think people are way too obsessed with the idea that every game must have multiplayer and it must have a 50-hour campaign. Well, no, they don&apos;t. If a developer is going to take a reasonable amount of time to make a game, they only have so much time and energy to put into all the various aspects of the game. In this case, it may be that 4A has forgone multiplayer and an epic story length to really zero in on the immersion factor. The grapnics in this game are breath-taking. Any fans of Shadow of Chernobyl will no doubt notice similarities, especially when it comes to the really atmospheric indoor/underground parts of the game. The lighting is dramatic, the character modeling, animation and voice acting so far seems superb. You will want to continue playing this game not because you want to unlock multiplayer items or get stupid achievements (though it does have them), but because you&apos;ll find yourself wanting to know what happens next!

The levels are laughably linear, with almost zero chance for exploration; the enemy AI is utterly braindead; the weapons are rubbish; and all the voices sound the same. On top of that, the level of interactivity is terrible: very few things can be opened or searched, and the majority of people you meet are little more than mannequins, who won&apos;t speak or react to you in any way. Probably the worst thing about Metro 2033, though, is that it&apos;s not in the slightest bit optimised. Even at lowest settings, on a decent computer, certain parts of the game are jerky to the point of distraction. As for its atmosphere and narrative, the story is boring and the only thing that makes it feel tense is the heavy breathing sound you hear when you put on your gas mask. That&apos;s pretty much all you&apos;re paying for, then - a sound effect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=747153">Expand</a></span>

The game does a great job of immersing you in the world and making you feel like a part of it.  That is, until you get to the combat.<br><br>The Bad:  The game chews up GPUs on the higher settings, and has some graphical tearing on mid-level systems.  The game is very hard, even on normal difficulty.  This wouldn&apos;t normally be a complaint, as most modern FPS games are not very challenging.  I actually like seeing a game that presents a challenge.  The problem here is that it is too hard due to a lack of realism.  First, your enemies can take a lot of punishment.  Too much in fact.  I shot a guy in the head point-blank with the shotgun three times, and then he turned around and killed me.  I get that the developers wanted you to shoot somewhere else, because they put a helmet on him.  But helmet or no helmet, if you take a 12-guage to the face you&apos;re not going to shrug it off like someone spit on you.  Second, all of the enemies you fight are like navy seals on crack.  They have extremely good accuracy at range, and can even hit you with the shotgun from 40 yards off (if you try to shoot someone with the shotgun from more than 2 feet away they won&apos;t take any damage).  They also have a nasty habit of being able to shoot you through boxes and cover, while your guns cannot pierce cover.  Third, they always know where you are, and they will surround you and wait for you to come out.  If one see&apos;s you, they all have a homing beacon for where you are until you die.  There are several situations in the game where you have no opportunity to flank your enemies, and the only way through is straight ahead.  You better hope you have grenades if you find yourself in this situation, otherwise you&apos;re probably dead, because the navy seals don&apos;t miss.  Another huge flaw unrelated to combat, is that the game chooses questionable times to save checkpoints for you.  At one point I had to restart a level, when the game chose to save a checkpoint for me when I was at no health and bullets were heading toward me.  Load, die instantly, repeat.  The game is very appealing for many reasons.  I tried really hard to like it.  However, the aforementioned flaws make it unplayable.  4/10 for good graphics, good story, good acting, and poor gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1917315">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are obviously amazing, in particular the lighting. I have some gripes with the decisions you make in the game and that they are very slapdash and not particular obvious , given that you have to meet so many subtle goals to achieve a good ending I felt a little bit cheated. The weapon physics are great but the enemies are rediculously powerful and great use of a little kid in a game!<br>All in all a great experience well worth playing and enjoying , just dont expect anything revolutionary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=2122337">Expand</a></span>

This is as good as it gets, and won&apos;t likely be surpassed until Crysis 2 comes out. Even on DX9 this is the prettiest game to date. Sound is amongst the best in a video game ever. Once again top notch. The music is amazingly creepy and depressing which sets the tone great. The voice acting is superb. Gun sounds and bullet deflections are great here as well. I dont want to continue writing things that have already been said so I say buy this game immediately. It is by far the best experience I&apos;ve had in a long time. I&apos;m on my second play through and its just as great as the first. Cant wait for a sequel. It&apos;s like a movie, think Heavy Rain but ten times better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=746812">Expand</a></span>

The sounds and sights of the tunnels and the post apocalyptic surface world are amazingly interesting and beautiful. Stepping out of the metro and into the open world for the first time is stunning. Also, the survival horror feeling is strong, light mechanics and the gas mask fogging up on you adds a very realistic edge.
<br>Despite its excellent delivery, I had a few minor issues with the game. The greatest one being mouse issues. When I make a perfect circle on my mousepad with my mouse, my aim in game is more of a very wide oval. This irritated me very badly, and I was forced to change settings in my Razer software to compensate. Second, the combat was rather simplistic, especially against the human AI. Could have been better is all.
<br>Overall, game loses 2 points from a perfect score for irritating mouse issues I could not change in game, and a combat system that could have been spiced up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177789">Expand</a></span>

The environments and lighting effects are so real that you really do feel like your stuck under a Moscow in a deteriorating, decrepit confined world. Some of the best environmental graphics I&apos;ve seen. The game is not perfect but Im giving it a 9 for the amount of immersion its capable of.</span>

This is the games main selling point; it relentlessly drags you into the game and makes you believe that you are actually trapped underground in the metro locked in a struggle to free your people from the monster known only as the dark ones. Pre-release people where comparing it to the likes of Stalker and Fallout, but a more apt comparison would be to the likes of Half Life and FEAR as it takes place in small liner environments. 4A (the developers) may very well want to hang me for saying that, though, as they have obviously spent a lot of time making alternant routs for you to take to suit different game play styles. If you want to be sneaky and creep past enemy undetected, then you can do so; if, however, you want to charge in guns-a-blazing then there is an option for that as well. It is not perfect, as like any game it has its flaws. Some points I was able to climb up nearly shear walls, I got myself stuck in the scenery a few times, and the AI could do with some advancement, but none of this is enough to spoil your enjoyment of the game.

It&apos;s a lot like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, but has a better feel to the controls, and gameplay is a lot more solid. The graphics (depending on your configuration) can range from average current graphics to beautiful Crysis-like graphics. I got this on sale from Steam for $5, but it&apos;s easily worth $20.</span>

It has an amazing story, fun gameplay, and cool weapons. However i still want the DLC for PC. It&apos;s been a few weeks and still nothing.</span>

If u have name u have min score min. 9 on IGN, UP1, Gamespy, GameSpot.</span>

The gunplay is great, the story is well presented, the pacing is great, and it&apos;s actually fairly challenging. Also, the game presents its &apos;universe&apos; exceptionally well. The atmosphere in the stations/&apos;cities&apos; is especially strong; you get the impression you&apos;re in a place where people actually live, although your ability to interact with the world itself is fairly limited. Although the STALKER comparisons are pretty much inevitable, Metro really isn&apos;t particularly similar to stalker outside of the post-apocalyptic setting and similar visual style. The game is a highly scripted on-rails(pun not intended) affair similar to CoD, or HL2, with some very limited RPG elements similar to Bioshock. That said, the closed world and limited player freedom makes for better pacing, and the scripted sequences are for the most part very compelling and well executed. The game is good, but if you go in expecting a free-roaming sandbox/rpg game you&apos;re going to be dissapointed. The game isn&apos;t perfect though. It&apos;s fairly short and not especially replayable (I finished in just over 6 hours). Also, the voice acting is at times slightly questionable, although it&apos;s never especially bad, and besides it&apos;s pretty hard to pull off a believable world full of heavily accented english-speaking Russians.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=746737">Expand</a></span>

Mixing the strange stylish first person cutscene action from Bioshock, with the creepy post-apocalyptic atmosphere of stalker, this is simply a must buy for anyone into Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R or Fallout 3. It won&apos;t win any game of year awards, but it&apos;s a damn good game.</span>

Play with Russian voices and English subtitles for the best authentic feel. Pros and cons pretty much as the others have said, though for me a 8-10 hr single player experience beats on the head the 4 hr long throwaway campaigns of COD or Bad Company 2. Don&apos;t care for multi and still for me it was a great value purchase. Would love for this developer to make a REAL Fallout style RPG, as the believability of the dank, squalid metro station existance is far better than the ridiculous world created by Bethesda. Oh and don&apos;t believe the people that say you need a supercomputer to run this. It still looks great with everything on high at a resolution of 1280x1024 on my almost 4 year old Core2 2.13 ghz, 2gb RAM and budget ATI 4770. Obviously on a better rig it will look even better, but even with the compromise I&apos;ve made it looks fantastic, particularly the interiors. Outside, the textures don&apos;t seem as good, so that&apos;s why I feel that Crysis still has a graphic edge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=747017">Expand</a></span>

For you who are reading this and considering downloading it on bittorrent, don&apos;t. Just go BUY a copy from the store. There are almost close to no developers dedicated to making exclusive-quality content for the PC anymore. TO THE PEOPLE AT A4 FROM UKRAINE, I will get Metro 2034 when you develop it and I hope you do, but please don&apos;t use proprietary technology like PhysX, it hurts the experience for non-nvidia users.

Be it due to the close-mindedness of the reviewers, of the public, it hurts this great game. Alas, all these &quot;western&quot; (I don&apos;t mean western as in wild west, but as in western hemisphere) shooters have given a lot of people a &quot;template&quot; of what a shooter should be, and they are disappointed when they see some game trying to break the various taboos. It surprises me that a brainless and common shooter that is Modern Warfare 2 could ever have a score close to Metro 2033, a unique and truly original game. What many people don&apos;t realise is that in these &quot;eastern&quot; shooters (STALKER and Metro 2033 being the most important representatives of this group), you are not a killing-machine, these games strive for realism. And realism means shooting a person wearing heavy armor with a shotgun having no effect (&quot;real&quot; shotguns are *very* weak against armor, let alone makeshift ones). Realism means that enemies don&apos;t just &quot;forget&quot; you&apos;re there if they don&apos;t find you in a certain period of time after they have seen you. In real life, if you screw up in stealth, there&apos;s no going back.<br><br><br>And all the original features this  game adds to the world of mainstream gaming - the gas masks, the pneumatic weapons, the use of ammunition as a currency, a morality system based on pretty much all of your actions, all combined with a truly fantastic engine with graphics that impresses you even if you&apos;re unable to play on anything but &quot;low&quot;. To do all this deserves praise.<br><br>Now, to address some of the negative critiques this game has been getting:<br><br>1. The only way to go about things is run&apos;n&apos;gun, and since that&apos;s very hard you&apos;ll die a lot - Completely and utterly false. This game is meant for a tactical approach, not running and gunning. 2. All the weapons are underpowered - Not true. These are makeshift weapons we&apos;re talking about, and even if you get a pre-apocalyptic weapon, the ammo you use is still makeshift (except if you go for military grade which is also used as currency). If you use an AK47 with military grade rounds, trust me, it won&apos;t be underpowered.<br><br>3. The levels are very linear - this one is partially correct. But for a story-based game, that&apos;s not a big issue. And not all the levels are linear, but you often won&apos;t have the will to go and risk getting killed for the sake of exploration. Why do so many people complain about linearity here, and nobody complains about it in games like Call of Duty.<br><br>Since I&apos;m tired of writing, I&apos;ll just finish with this. Metro 2033 is a pioneer of a new sort of games, just like STALKER is. And while it will be somewhat underrated now, I believe that people will eventually realise it&apos;s true potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462152">Expand</a></span>

That being said, the rest of the game is pretty damn good.  The atmosphere is spot on, you really feel like you&apos;re part of an underground society sheltering not just from mutants, but a lethal, poisonous world as well.  The weapons and gadgets fit the theme as well, particularly the gas mask sections which add a sense of urgency to your time topside.  You&apos;ll probably like this game if you enjoy STALKER or other post-apocalyptic games, though this is more linear and story driven than most.  I struggled on scoring this because I really enjoyed Metro 2033, but the technical issues are pretty bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=2294082">Expand</a></span>

I did find that it was nice to have the choice between using stealth in some areas or just going in guns blazing (the later was often the more difficult option). I see most of the low review scores are from people with performance complaints, so people should keep in mind this is a Direct X 11 game and is meant for Next Gen hardware so a 2+ year old computer is going to struggle especially if you have a lower end CPU.<br><br>If you have a mid to high end computer and are after a good Single player FPS with a fantastic story and beautiful engine then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1448740">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is comprised of tense firefights with stellar combat and stealth AI, exploration that is always rewarded, resource management, vehicle combat (fortunately you don&apos;t have to control railcars), and frantic monster survival. When not in the full gameplay experience, characters are realistic and entertaining, complete with dialogue that isn&apos;t always the boring exposition you get in brainless first person shooters, atmosphere so thick you can cut it with a bayonet, and stuff that&apos;s REALLY pretty. A bonus is that you can also use the original Russian dialog for more immersion, and it&apos;s also acted better than what you find in English.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=746872">Expand</a></span>

Has a few glitches, but nothing ever game breaking, and the graphics are simply amazing, (if somewhat hard on my computer). Only real negatives I can think of, as I said, are a few glitches, and stupid A.I. Throwing a knife into a wall by someone&apos;s head, for example, won&apos;t alert them, which is quite ridiculous. I think, however, 4A Games was stressing on non-omniscient A.I., unlike a certain other post-nuclear disaster game, so it&apos;s somewhat forgivable. Being linear and short was kind of disappointing, too, but better finishing wanting for more than never ending because you got sick of it, eh?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=746899">Expand</a></span>

AI squad mates are sometimes incredibly stupid and dont attack sometimes. overall this game keeps u guessing and u need to use the tools the game has given you. final thing there is no exploration and once u leave a station u never go back no matter what.

If you can get past some serious bugs (that are easy to fix mind) I&apos;m confident Metro will impress. This is what FPS games should be -a totally unique brilliantly paced (I never found a section or gimmick over stayed its welcome) FPS With plenty of diversity in action and locales combined with solid, well crafted FPS action. Metro has been made in the tradition of classics like STALKER, Half Life and System Shock - metro is definately a must for any fan of atmospheric, absorbing shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=747435">Expand</a></span>

Mind!!<br><br>Dark Tone, a great story tighter than a chestnut corset, deep immersion, crushing loneliness - a beautiful story and campaign crafted wonderfully and excecuted expertly. Having said that, one must always control their **** shooting libido when you play such a good game. For instance if you intend to get this game for PC (which I whole-heartedly recommend): get a powerful PC - this game maxed out will eat your GPU for breakfast. I have a powerful gaming laptop built by the proud albeit sloppy hands of the caring folk of PCSpecialists, sporting a gtx580m and I&apos;ve had to put on a significant over-clock to get this game to run properly. Also stealth is pretty buggy as well, along with a lot of elements in the game. But hey these are easy to overlook with an otherwise functional game which does such a great job of pulling you into its story and atmosphere.

I thought the game deserved it. :)  I&apos;m going to keep this short and to the point.  Metro 2033 isn&apos;t quite like anything I&apos;ve ever played, this game stands out on it&apos;s own, but for some reason it&apos;s hard to say exactly why.  It does an great job at making you feel like part of this gritty underground in a world that&apos;s gone to hell and the settings you find yourself in are absolutely gorgeously detailed.  The one thing everyone will agree on, Metro 2033 has very impressive graphics.
<br>
<br>The pacing of this game is really well done and there are definitely some scary moments that sent shivers down my spine.  Missions on the surface (above the metro stations) feel dangerous and have a sense of urgency, mainly because of your limited air supply.
<br>
<br>The sneak element of this game is great as well; you can blow out candles and lamps, use silencers to take out enemies so you don&apos;t alert other nearby patrols, or go in guns blazing.  The latter is probably a bad choice as the enemies can be difficult and well fortified.  You have a device on your watch that will show you how well hidden you are, simple enough... but effective and fun for those that  do like to sneak.
<br>
<br>At the time of writing this, the game is on Steam for 20 bones.  I can safely suggest this game to any FPS fan that loves a good post apocalyptic shooter with a survival horror element mixed in.  It&apos;s done well, and I think this is a highly underrated PC game.
<br>
<br>Some people may criticize this game as being too linear, but I&apos;m okay with a game that pushes me along in one direction, as long as it does so with a little style and grace...  and I feel Metro 2033 does just that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=2581826">Expand</a></span>

Game on and kill those radiation monsters.</span>

                                        <span>I admire the gloomy atmosphere of the game. The world of the game combines the relationship with our world and something absolutely alien. It shows how our world could be look alien. The game is just beautiful and art work is great. My score is 9 because I received &quot;PhysX error&quot; at first start of the game, and I had to reinstall PhysX myself.</span>

<br>
<br>AI: The human AI is incredible accurate at spotting and blind at the same time. They can pinpoint me in pitch dark corners but don&apos;t realize if i kill a buddy in front of them. If one enemy gets alerted, everyone is and knows exactly where I am. This is one reason I stopped playing the game after 5 hours.
<br>
<br>In some games auto save helps the story but not in this. It was just annoying!

After I had gotten to play it for a bit i noted how great the atmosphere was. It gave you a realistic feel of life in the metro. The gameplay had it&apos;s ups and its downs but for the most part it was quite enjoyable and challenging. I spent around 19 hours on the game. The visuals were just beautiful as well. Now for the bad part...As often complained about the AI is amazingly...How to put this, Retarded. Sometimes it will give you a good laugh though. You will see an enemy instantly take cover and be watchful and protective, only problem is the take cover at the wall your facing, not even in cover from you, like,  kind of...right in front of you. Also don&apos;t go to it expecting the amazing story the book had, its way off. Some characters aren&apos;t included, some fates are changed....Common stuff like that. Another great thing i forgot to mention is the voice acting, its amazing.Great game to check out and it&apos;s only 20 bucks on steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1703986">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are intense, the story is immersive, the action is brutal. All in all a great game. This survival horror game stands alone on its own. I liked it so much I played in through 8 times and beat all difficulties and got almost all steam achievements. Sadly what lets this game down is the play time is fairly short which is disheartening and it lacks a Multiplayer. I would easily loved to see a Nazi vs Communist multiplayer. Also the human enemy AI is a bit unintelligent at easier difficulties. Metro 2033 definitely deserves and second look and once you play it, you will yearn for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681025">Expand</a></span>

Metro2033 has a interesting take on apocalypse of humanity, and it all takes place in Russia&apos;s underground railways in 2033, where everyone lives deep underground, the surface is poison and former &quot;humans&quot; roam the surface as grotesque mutants... The take on how weapons and items work in a game is simply unique, such as a Pneumatic Rifle in which you have to pump a handle manually every 5-6 shots otherwise its like shooting paintballs at enemies. Or a flashlight you have to handcrank for more power, simply essential to be on top of your game, otherwise you find yourself fighting mutants in the dark because your flashlight ran out of juice.. constant maintenance of your weapons and items could turn a player away, thats only if you&apos;re a baby when it comes to little &quot;quips&quot; that people complain about...people complain way too much that a game is linear, HELL What game isn&apos;t linear and allows 100% exploration???? WHAT GAMES HAVE YOU PLAYED THAT HAD FULLY EXPLORABLE AREA IN which you could do whatever you wanted and change the pace of the game?????? UNLESS YOU&apos;RE PLAYING GTA or MAFIA II, there hasn&apos;t been a fully sandboxed FPS game in a longtime, unless you count Garrys mod but there is no story, just sandbox. The game mechanics has fails in the form of small glitches, faulty AI detection, hiding in shadows is almost useless...also invisible walls, varied bullet penetration in objects, or none whatsoever, like shooting through wood is like shooting kevlar... and hit detection on &quot;human&quot; AI gets annoying unless you have high grade ammo...bullets are almost like rubber when shooting their heads...besides that, Metro2033 is a very unique and engaging single player FPS with a decent story, albeit a short one, but definitely worth playing...I give it an 8 due to some poor game mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1596397">Expand</a></span>

Example: game autsaves before a big battle(there is no quicksave or even regular save option, it does aut saves and that&apos;s all).  Before you start to fight though u might  want to charge your weapon, your light and take your gas mask off.  You go into the fight and get killed.  Every time you die and start the area over you must repeat all the prep work you want before you enter it.  After a number of times doing this(im playing on 2nd to hardest first run thru) it just sucks.  Monster animations while attacking can be bizzare, they can walk right thru you?  Game is choppy even with medium settings on a good computer, there&apos;s no excuse for this crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793759">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty curve is like the EKG meter of someone being revived with a defibrillator. Mostly easy with a few hard spots and one incredibly frustrating escort mission. There&apos;s a stealth element that in some areas simply does not apply where you can be perfectly hidden in shadows and monsters just leap around the corner already attacking you. Managing weapons and ammo is rather awkward and takes a while to get used to because of their hybrid old school-new school weapons system where you can collect and trade weapons like STALKER, but have no inventory. Instead you have dedicated slots that can only hold certain types of weapons kind of like Half-life. The damage balance is completely out of whack. The first weapon you get is a revolver, and it can do more damage at any range than a shotgun can do point blank, as well as reload faster. Also, while you can sneak right up behind someone, you can&apos;t simply take them out with a backstab. You&apos;ll swipe at them with your knife and have to hit them like 4 or 5 more times. However, if someone is shooting at you from 30 feet away, you can chuck a throwing knife at their torso and kill them instantly.<br><br>There&apos;s really not much room for exploring. There&apos;s 2 or 3 sections where you can do a bit of exploring, mostly to find supplies, but the rest of the game is pretty much straight linear. For about 1/3 of the game you&apos;re being towed along by NPCs. And they like to introduce and explain interesting aspects of the game universe that are then chucked into the trash. Like they&apos;ll have a mission where you have to deal with a weird anomaly, or navigate through a room full of ghosts, but you&apos;ll have a guy explaining what&apos;s going on and what to do. You think it&apos;s a tutorial for something later, but the stuff never happens again. The stealth element of the game is nearly as bad as there&apos;s probably only 3 or 4 parts where stealth even helps.<br><br>Finally, there&apos;s no saving other than the autosave. This means that if you start a mission and find that you didn&apos;t bring the proper equipment or enough ammo, you&apos;re pretty much stuck. As mentioned, this is a linear game, and once you load another section you can never go back to where you came from. And because of the awkward weapons management, at some point you might drop your favorite gun when it runs out of ammo in favor of one you have ammo for with the intention of picking it back up, only to walk through an open door and have the screen fade to black and start the next mission, losing that gun forever.<br><br>In conclusion, this game has a lot of problems and limitations for someone spoiled on quality shooters like Fallout, STALKER, Call of Duty, Half-Life, etc... however it has some of the best graphics I&apos;ve ever seen on my computer. If that&apos;s enough to hold your interest, and if you have a system that can play it at high quality it might be worth picking up if you find it cheap. I just wouldn&apos;t count on ever playing it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462591">Expand</a></span>

Bad AI, outdated feeling controls, various glitches and bugs.  They are flaws that only float on the surface of an amazing experience.  The mission that the game developers set out the accomplish by creating their game is fully realized.  The world is built with painstaking detail to environmental and what most call &quot;atmosphere.&quot;  What I mean about atmosphere is that when I played this game I felt immersed in the world and situations.  Like in a book, in retrospect, I forget that I wasn&apos;t really there and the experience was being feed through a computer screen.  Deep stuff, right?  but really this game will mess with your head with its amazing immersion, awesome art style and graphical power and tense situations.  You can really tell that the creators put a lot of love into their project.  For instance, I was amazed when I beat the game that the credits were less than a minute long.  These guys worked hard and it shows.

If there is an other DLC, I would totally buy it..... overall this game is quite amazing for me. The bad things that I have seen in this game is the Karma, I think most of the people will not understand whats going on for the shining if they are new to Metro 2033... and it too hard to know whats going on, for me, when I saw the first shining, I&apos;m confusing rather i lost life or what. By the way.... there is no reasons for these karmas to bring you to the good ending. Its my feeling so don&apos;t complain....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1442794">Expand</a></span>

<br>[Challenges and Mechanics]
<br>This is an FPS and the opponents are tough - so stick to basics. If you enjoy reloading the game then just run out into the open - the AI has got a good head shot. There is a tiny RPG element which allows for commerce to upgrade weapons and purchase ammo in the cities. However all upgraded weapons can be found eventually and soon after having sufficient purchasing power - Kind of Pointeless ! Ammo is plentiful but limited - just don</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=2611625">Expand</a></span>

A very linear tunnel based shooter where you almost feel the game would be happier as a movie, very little freedom of choice whatsoever.
I could tell the story behind this was probably very good but the game crippled it.

Ammunition and gas mask filters are in short supply which leads to a lot of tense moments as you struggle to complete a level having expended all supplies. Scavenging supplies from corpses and caches is essentially for survival. The gas mask is a bit of a gimmick but it does make for a sense of urgency in the above-ground levels as you struggle to find spare filters whilst choking and nearly blinded by your fogged-up mask. The &quot;ranger&quot; difficulty levels eliminate the HUD so that you have to stop and bring up your inventory screen to check how much ammunition and supplies you have left. This adds to the challenge and immersion.<br><br>The stealth-oriented levels see you infiltrate hostile bases alone. You can choose to avoid detection by taking out enemies with silent weapons and carefully turning off / shooting out every source of light and using night vision goggles to find your way around. You can also choose to mount a frontal assault but this technique often leads to failure as you are quickly swamped by waves of enemies. The stealthy weapons include throwing knives, silenced guns and hand-pumped pneumatic weapons.<br><br>There are just a few gripes I have with this game. Firstly, there are issues of weapon balancing. The availability of a silenced scoped assault rifle early in the game renders the other stealth weapons relatively useless. Also, there is a particularly powerful type of enemy in one of the later levels which barely flinches after twenty shotgun blasts at close range but will drop dead from a couple of arrows fired from one of the pneumatic weapons!<br><br>There are also issues of availability of supplies. Gas mask filters may only be purchased at the first marketplace one comes across in the game. One might reasonably expect that they can replenish their short supply of filters at any of the other markets throughout the game but this is not the case. Another odd thing I noticed is that it is possible to open a supply chest and pick up six magazines to yield only three rounds of ammo. Apparently those who made these stashes only remembered to load half of the magazines they left there - and those that they did remember to load only had a single round in them!<br><br>The lack of a multiplayer mode is a shame. The game would have benefited greatly from a co-op mode similar to Left 4 Dead. Hopefully this will be incorporated into the sequel.<br><br>It pushes the envelope as far as graphics are concerned but I have to say that reports of the game being highly demanding are greatly exaggerrated. By tinkering with the settings the game ought to be playable on any computer less than about three or four years old.<br><br>Overall, the game provides a very rewarding experience for any fan of linear shooters. It also provides many novel gameplay elements to maintain the interest of those who might otherwise be bored by such linearity. I have already put well over thirty hours into this game and I&apos;m not tired of it yet. Given that the game has been on almost perpetual discount since release I&apos;d say it provides excellent value for money compared to most titles out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1470077">Expand</a></span>

The storyline, voice acting and immersion were incredible... and at times I really felt like I was playing the character as intended.... some parts were scary... some parts would have me fight for my life, at times I felt remorse or fear for allies and enemies... and it really painted a realistic picture of a possible future....<br><br>In all that said there were also draw backs to the game as always...<br>easy mode was actually quite hard... I wouldn&apos;t play it on anything higher unless you&apos;ve gone through the game at least once... ammo could sometimes be hard to find.. and gassmasks running out of air was annoying... though besides the dlema it also added a more realistic feel to the game... it wasn&apos;t like a standard FPS where everything was laid out for you on a silver platter...... also I wouldnt even recommend playing this game on xbox or playstation......<br><br>My final thoughts... for $29.99 this game is worth every cent for an immersion and experience you will not forget easily... the biggest draw back to the game is that you really NEED a decent PC to run it in all it&apos;s glory.. and not alot of people can do that.. but if you can max it out your in for one hell of a ride!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1476615">Expand</a></span>

<br>However I have been pleasantly surprised by Metro the controls felt perfectly fine and even though I am not really an FPS player I was able to kill something quite easy.
<br>
<br>My main reason for buying Metro 2033 however was the story and it&apos;s a good one. If we would ever look at a post apocalyptic Moscow it would look like this. The story however is a little too short but the many ways of playing certain levels still calls for a replay once or twice.
<br>
<br>The weapons are responding exactly like you&apos;d expect from a piece of crap constructed with materials lying around (bonus points for that). (un)fortunately the AI is so stupid that it&apos;s still quite easy to wipe a whole army of enemy soldiers with just your AK-47 type weapon.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say this game was worth my time and money for the great atmosphere it had and the great attention to detail both in the weapons and the usage of flashlights/night-vision.
<br>
<br>Bad points were the AI and the short story, but if the developer learns from it&apos;s mistakes in this one, the next may be a brilliant game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1480366">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are beautiful, the levels are intriguing and absorbing, the monsters look creepy and sound great, and the sound all around is just awesome. The only troubles I have found with this game is how long it takes to kill enemies and how annoying it is to find an adequate amount of munition. Doing my Normal difficulty setting play through it would take 10-20 rounds from on weapon to kill an enemy. Maybe I just suck but I think that&apos;s quite ridiculous when it&apos;s only on Normal and there&apos;s more than difficulty settings. Other than that, this is a solid 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541956">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a fine example of a story based game done good. While the story moves you along a general direction, there&apos;s plenty  of room for doing it your way with the weapon choices and tactics. The game requires an extreme efficiency with your items on the hardest difficulty which I love.  The only cons I can think of are: it is quite a resource hog, and I had an issue with my filters disappearing if I would use the load from checkpoint option sometimes, that was frustrating. Overall I really enjoy the setting and game play for Metro 2033 I wish there were more creative and unique titles like this out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1494505">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is realistic and you actually feel like your trying to survive, you will usually run out of ammo in weapons, and if your complete ammo stocks run out then we can say your screwed with your knife. This game actually kind of reminds me of Bioshock without splicers and plasmids. The mutants are primal and aggressive, and they will make you shoot like crazy. The human enemies will send you running to cover and watching your back, and the Dark Ones will send chills up your spine. 4A games outdid themselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1607926">Expand</a></span>

The single most immersive game I have ever played; the graphics are absolutely beautiful, the characters are memorable, the gameplay is a breath of fresh air into the now long suffocating FPS genre (a la: Call of Duty, Halo, etc). The only thing to ward anyone off of this game would be its somewhat unrelenting difficulty at times, or specifically, one part; an escort type mission (If you&apos;ve played it youll know what Im talking about).<br>That single part of the game is the only negative thing I can think of about this game. The shooting mechanics are great, the stealth mechanics, while maybe not at the level of Splinter Cell, are reasonably good for a game not entirely bent around stealth.<br>I love the use of military grade bullets as not only currency, but also as useable ammunition for your weapons, on one hand you can kill 20 enemies with just one magazine, on the other, you might not be able to buy as many new weapons, med packs, or suits the next chance you get.<br><br>I hear alot of complaints about the A.I. I personally never found the A.I. to be particularly smart or dumb, they were just your standard industry A.I. which suffered from all the industry standard issues; intelligence is no easy thing to program, and it shows; not just in Metro, but any game you will play, probably for the next 20 years or so.<br><br>As far as the guns themselves, the lower quality &apos;Metro made&apos; weapons all look exactly that; thrown together with whatever spare scraps of metal are lying around, and pack an accompanying less than satisfactory punch, and even somehow manage to sound as cheap as they look. While the guns you will obtain later on are increasingly powerful and both look, and sound it. I specifically love some of the more creative home-brew guns found later on, the pneumatic rifles and such.<br><br>The story progresses at a perfect pace, allowing both the story and gameplay to unfold simultaneously and without interrupting each other. It keeps you interested, and you feel like there is a reason behind every action you must take, and are given choices throughout the game on which actions to take.<br><br>The graphics are absolutely stunning, given that you&apos;re playing it on PC, and you have a PC capable of running it at its max settings. 4A did a great job of either building the game for PC and porting it to consoles, or porting it from consoles for the PC, as it plays excellent on PC. The world is incredibly atmospheric, both in the Metro and in the destroyed wasteland that lies above.<br><br>Is this game for everyone? No. Absolutely not. People used to more run and gun games like Call of Duty (since 4 at least), Halo, Medal of Honor, etc, will likely not enjoy this type of game, though if played on the lowest difficulty, it could be played similarly. Likewise, people who play ARMAII and Operation Flashpoint type games, will likely consider the game to still be too frantic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1651654">Expand</a></span>

Overall game is good, it&apos;s interesting and has a lot of fun-scary moments. Worth to buy (i&apos;m looking at the steam price now - June 2011) but not expect that Metro 2033 is a kind of a masterpiece. 7 of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-2033/user-reviews?user_review_id=1658460">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game brings vivid imagery of what nuclear warfare could achieve if the mad man pulls the trigger.
<br>
<br>I just love how this game was done with very good attention to detail.
<br>Voice acting is spectacular.
<br>On my good list</span>
