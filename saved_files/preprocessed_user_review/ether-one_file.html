Centered as it is around Alzheimer, this was always going to be a sensitive story but it is pitched perfectly. Like Gone Home, Ether One shows how story telling has a place in the genre of Video Gaming.
<br>As you can surmise from the low 5/10 there is a big &quot;but&quot; coming.
<br>Ether One is also a puzzle game, although the puzzle solving is not essential to finish the game, it does expand the narrative. Within the first hour of playing I encountered some frustration in some puzzle solving, that after some online research became clear were bugs within the game. Even after a new patch I often encountered strange glitches and disappearing inventory items and puzzles that needed certain tweaks in order to reset . So everytime you meet a problem with a given puzzle you are never sure whether it was part of puzzle itself or another glitch/bug. Checking online gives either the disappointment of realising it is indeed another bug or that you have missed a crucial part of puzzle and the joy of solving it yourself has been taken from you.
<br>All of this instantly devalues ANY puzzle game.
<br>This is a game that promised much in its exploring, inventory and game play, but unfortunately falls short
<br>9/10 for storytelling
<br>4/10 for its puzzle elements</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ether-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=4145834">Expand</a></span>

As a &apos;Restorer&apos;, puzzles revolve around this idea of recreating memories based on information in the general vicinity. Most puzzles can be completed with sound logic if you explore carefully and read widely, though there are a handful of puzzles that feel poorly designed and which could use some better signposting. I also feel like the game would&apos;ve benefited if puzzles were self-contained rather than requiring different items from across the map to help minimise the amount of backtracking.
<br>
<br>The 1 item limit is another mechanic I&apos;m not a fan of, as having to teleport back and forth to check previous notes or pick up collected items is an exercise in tedium. It would&apos;ve been much more convenient to simply have a portable inventory for items and notes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ether-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=6910497">Expand</a></span>
