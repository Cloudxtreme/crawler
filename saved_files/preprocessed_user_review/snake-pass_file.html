<br>Testing your patience
<br>Ever think what it would be like to be a snake?
<br>Turns out it&#x2019;s pretty frustrating.
<br>Snake Pass is a puzzle platformer snake simulator&#x2026;
<br>You play as noodle accompanied by a bird companion
<br>Your only task is to collect the 3 gems spread across the different levels&#x2026;
<br>only problem is it&#x2019;s a level of posts.. and you gotta get your snake on to climb them&#x2026;
<br>This game doesn&#x2019;t seem to challenging at first&#x2026;
<br>It isn&#x2019;t until the 2nd world out of 4 that your realize this games gonna have you throwing things&#x2026;
<br>There are 15 levels total that will all take a variety of different times depending on luck and how quickly you adapt to being a snake&#x2026;
<br>I ultimately never did adapt&#x2026;
<br>Your main mechanics are move forward... go side to side for speed, lift your head up to climb, and grip.. that&#x2019;s it&#x2026;
<br>The rest Is up to you and physics&#x2026;
<br>The game took me a little less than 4 and a half hours to get through&#x2026;
<br>Each of the worlds are themed after the different elements&#x2026;
<br>earth, which is the intro&#x2026;
<br>here you&#x2019;ll just be climbing posts.. collecting the blue orbs and gold coins around&#x2026;
<br>Water, which I felts was the hardest of the elements&#x2026;
<br>will introduce the ability to swim under water, this is also where switches are introduced&#x2026;
<br>you&#x2019;ll be over the collectibles by then because of how frustrating climbing the poles that are now moving becomes with hazards such as spikes underneath&#x2026; and the punishment of going over the same obstacles when you fall&#x2026;
<br>Fire which is where you have to deal with lava.. A decently quick chapter&#x2026;
<br>And finally air... youre dealing with the wind blowing, ultra frustrating, and this is when your bird friend comes in handy flying you across the different sections&#x2026;
<br>An after you complete all of the levels for a section you unlock a time trial mode for the levels&#x2026;
<br>I personally have no interest in the time trial mode, but the actual campaign is a great challenge that tested my patience for sure&#x2026;
<br>Ultimately I did feel like most deaths were my fault&#x2026;
<br>The camera doesn&#x2019;t follow you automatically though&#x2026;
<br>So most is the keyword here..
<br>The camera is an issue at times when you can&#x2019;t see where you snake is pointed
<br>thankfully there&#x2019;s a decent amount of checkpoints around to make it less painful&#x2026;
<br>and you&#x2019;ll need them.
<br>I give Snake Pass

The main appeal is mastering the movement of your character, a happy snake that moves and behaves - physically - like a snake. It&apos;s not just a novelty, it&apos;s core to the why the game works. Climbing a bamboo frame, hanging over a precipitous drop to collect that coin is hair-raising stuff, especially as you have to safely make your way back to land again before it really counts (there&apos;s a checkpointing system). It&apos;s compelling! It does take a while to master the snake&apos;s more challenging movement, no doubt, but once you do the entire game opens up and feels hugely satisfying in a way that traditional platformers do not. With 16 levels of increasing size and difficulty, plus lots of non-essential collectibles to grab, the game will keep you going for many hours. Oh, and the music by David Wise is worth the asking price alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/snake-pass/user-reviews?user_review_id=7214798">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A gamepad is required to enjoy this game fully. It&apos;s the first time in a long time that I&apos;ve seen a game reinvent the way stick controllers work. The most recent one I can think of was Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, which used the twin sticks to control two characters at once, or perhaps Grow Home/Grow Up&apos;s use of the triggers to represent its climbing robot&apos;s hands. Snake Pass translates the real movements of a snake to the controller in a remarkably accurate way. If you want to move extra fast, you&apos;ll need to move left and right to generate the S-shaped movement. If you want to climb, you&apos;ll need to coil around an object, grip it, and keep spiralling your way upwards. It requires a constant handover of energy, as you learn when to grip and when to let go, when to raise yourself by craning your neck and when to swing your heavy head with gravity to throw it forwards instead.
<br>
<br>Snake Pass is a radically different take on platformers. It&apos;s also a physics puzzle, underneath it all. It&apos;s also a collect-a-thon, but not in the usual sense. Each object is more like a target you need to reach. Many of them look impossible at first, but you figure out how to manipulate speed, momentum and balance to achieve the grab.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/snake-pass/user-reviews?user_review_id=7208161">Expand</a></span>
