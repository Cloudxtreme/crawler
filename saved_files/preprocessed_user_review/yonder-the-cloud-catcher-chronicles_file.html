<br>
<br>FINALLY a game where I can explore without fighting things. I can play at my own pace and just enjoy the world. Its very relaxing and theres heaps to do. The complaints about some forum below sound pretty petty.</span>

<br>Hmm - a bit like a cheap Zelda Knock off? (just a thought, not a qualified assessment)
<br>
<br>But for real - the look and feel of the game is that of a new toy box with a lot of individual pieces that all seem to be different, new and shiny. Visually - the game is quite stunning ... well... kind of. Artistically, everything is very simplified - so it is not stunning as in &quot;realistic&quot; or &quot;very detailed&quot; but rather in terms of being adorable and full of saturated colours.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise ... the game offers about the average ... nothing epical, nothing mature or complex. They are all fetch quests or simple deliveries. The type of quests do not really go beyond the complexity of your average MMO quests.
<br>
<br>It is a nice game to casually relax a little (emphasis on CASUAL) ... In terms of story, characters, graphics and pretty much everything else - the PC offers countless alternatives that are all better. However as a whole package - it is oddly &quot;nice&quot; to play and look at.
<br>
<br>I can fully recommend this game to casual gamers. I guess that hardcore gamers with more mature demands on their games would get bored quite quickly though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yonder-the-cloud-catcher-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=7411107">Expand</a></span>

<br>The fun in Yonder is the sense of adventure.  The discovery of the unknown.  At first I only followed the story line, but it was once I veered off into the unknown that I really learned what Yonder was about.
<br>For me, Yonder is a place that you come to do whatever it is you want.  I spent quite a bit of time fishing, as it&#x2019;s genuinely a fun thing to do.
<br>I also had a great time befriending the animals &#x2013; especially the Groffles!
<br>My pros:
<br>-	Beautiful world
<br>-	Cute animals
<br>-	Totally open world
<br>
<br>My cons:
<br>-	No player housing
<br>-	Could use more variety in animals
<br>-	Tool swapping &#x2013; tools are not hot bound
<br>
<br>So this game may not be for everyone, as some of the negative reviews have shown.  But I can say this game really is for me and I love it and I think you should give it a go before you let the bad reviews ruin what may be the prefect game for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yonder-the-cloud-catcher-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=7417132">Expand</a></span>

<br>I want to start this review by saying I was hyped for this game, I wanted to love this game - it was promoted as Stardew Valley meets Zelda and that couldn&apos;t have been any further from the truth. It has in depth farming system like Stardew Valley does or even Harvest Moon for that matter where the player is required to try and push themselves to maintain their farm. Zelda was backed by an engaging storyline and a very unique/appealing world which brought the character back time and time again for more - Yonder, unfortunately, has no depth to its storyline and the characters are bland. The game had so much room for potential, but doesn&#x2019;t live up to anything.
<br>
<br>You can honestly skip this game and watch a 2-hour complete playthrough (it&#x2019;s terribly underwhelming). I&#x2019;ll break this review down into a series of sections covering the main topics and features of the game and why it will never be worth the $25 they&apos;re going to be asking for it.
<br>
<br>Exploration
<br>When starting the game, it feels like you are part of a vast, rich world with lots of characters, animals, and biomes to explore then you quickly and sharply realize that the game is pretty repetitive featuring only one real animal in each biome and they&#x2019;re completely optional. The exploration of the game loosely ties into the actual main questline and you can skip a vast majority of the game (objectives, areas, and side quiests) and still complete the main game in less than six to seven hours.
<br>
<br>The game lacks any real puzzles with substance or logic, which would have added a great deal of depth to the environment. The characters, sprites, and animals you&apos;ll meet along your adventure are also amazingly bleak with no background stories or character development to be seen.
<br>
<br>Storyline
<br>There isn&#x2019;t any storyline. There&#x2019;s maybe a single half-page reading to go along with the game-play which was considered the game&#x2019;s storyline. If you&#x2019;re reading reviews thinking this is another wonderful Zelda storyline, you&#x2019;re sadly mistaken. This game is pretty much an objective simulator moving from Point A to Point B, purchasing a few items from a nearby vendor, and then moving onto the next objective in this very, very basic game.
<br>
<br>Combat
<br>There isn&#x2019;t any combat - end of story. Absolutely no nostalgic Zelda 64 dungeons to crawl or Stardew Valley like areas to explore and dig into. Nothing.
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>This is subjective, I enjoyed the game&#x2019;s &#x2018;Zelda&#x2019; inspired graphics, but it&#x2019;s up to you to form your own opinion on it.
<br>
<br>Sound
<br>This is also subjective as graphics are. I found the background insects and other sounds to be overly obnoxious, but not game-breaking.
<br>
<br>Crafting System
<br>The crafting system is a complete joke. A majority of the items are simply placed for sidequest requirements and can be skipped with no hussle or bustle about it. You don&#x2019;t create any armor, weapons, or tools nor can you upgrade any of the tools you have. It&#x2019;s completely passive with no real benefit. Even if you chose to complete the crafting system, you&#x2019;ll be done in 30 minutes due to the lack of depth and game-play.
<br>
<br>Farming System
<br>Again, the farming system is completely optional to the main storyline of the game and doesn&#x2019;t provide any depth or content to the game itself. It feels like a complete waste of time and I only had to tame one animal just to complete the main storyline and it was never mentioned again. If you want a captivating experience like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley then skip this game and go play those.
<br>
<br>Developers
<br>It&apos;s sad to say, but the devs of this game have now taken to filtering out any negative feedback or reviews of this game that they can find - banning users on steam from youtube reviews and more. They&apos;re trying to snuff out any bad publicity about their  game and are going as far as they can to stop anyone from having a voice they don&apos;t agree with. Buyer beware!
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>This game is pretty much a rip off at it&apos;s current price. It&#x2019;s advertised everywhere as a Zelda meets Harvest Moon experience which makes you think you&#x2019;re in for either a unique and fun farming system with goals and objectives or an alluring storyline supported by a farming system &#x2013; this game is neither. It&#x2019;s an under polished, seemingly rushed money vacuum. Wait for this game to go on sale or just rent it for a few dollars, you&apos;ll have plenty of time to finish it in a single day - save your cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/yonder-the-cloud-catcher-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=7413053">Expand</a></span>

<br>The devs have been actively engaging with their forums and directly responding to criticism, often trying to get to the root of people&apos;s issues and asking how they can be fixed. There are more than enough unhappy players and some who are even somewhat aggressive, yet they are still there and receive the same attention as everyone else.
