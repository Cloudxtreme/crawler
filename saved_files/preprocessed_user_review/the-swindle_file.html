It&apos;s infuriating and frustrating to stumble upon a game that could have been great but doesn&apos;t live up to its potential. This game is a nice example what happens when a single person tries to make a big game. Yes, it&apos;s a very coherent mix and all the elements click, but he clearly didn&apos;t test enough. Maybe all the critique and bug reports will help him fix the game. We&apos;ll see. I&apos;d love to increase my rating :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-swindle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5584540">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ The design and setting are beautiful
<br>+ Long-term game and single levels are well balanced
<br>+ A real sense of progression that keeps pulling you back in
<br>
<br>- Very steep difficulty curve
<br>- Loose controls are frustrating at times
<br>- Excruciating loading times on Vita
<br>
<br>I mainly got this game for Pass-the-Controller (or Vita) co-op after we got bored of Rogue Legacy. And just like Legacy the game strikes a very nice balance between the single levels (taking somewhere between 5 and 20 minutes) and the overarching leveling game. The latter is limited to exactly 100 levels, creating a sense of urgency at each level start. At the same time this limit often means that your run can be ruined after the start-up phase. What this means is that it is a game that is made for you to actually beat it -  you will fail often. To add to this, the game is separated into several different subsections of escalating difficulty.
<br>
<br>This all seems like sound rogue-lite game design. But one of the core concepts is that you should keep your thief alive as long as possible because he gets a multiplier for each successful heist. Again, this sounds great - it creates the dilemma between keeping your thief alive to keep your multiplier and collecting more money each level to get more perks. But the truth of the matter is that this decision is often not up to you. The procedural level generation means that you quite often encounter levels that you cannot complete successfully. Additionally the reason for my thieves demise was most often not my greed - or pure panic after being detected - but the floatiness of the control scheme. Most often you will find yourself dead because you came up short on a jump you would normally make or because it seems somewhat arbitrary whether your thief will stick to a wall or simply fall to his death - and with him your multiplier. This ruins not just your level but can potentially ruin your entire run. Something that is already frustrating when it is your own fault but is just downright infuriating when it happens because of imprecise controls.
<br>
<br>To the game&apos;s credit: despite my frustrations with this I keep coming back to it because it enrages me in such a way that I want to beat it. I want to show it that despite all the curveballs it throws at me I can beat it - something that is a must for any successful rogue-lite in my opinion. Also, does not hurt that it&apos;s easy on the eyes with its beautifully hand-drawn steam punk art. At 14.99&#x20AC; with PS4/Vita Cross-Buy it think you might want to give it a try if you&apos;re very resistant to frustrations and can adapt your play-style to floaty controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-swindle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5403976">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;d like it better if the controls weren&apos;t so &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing abhoral. As it stands, I am THIS close to getting a refund. I think that if Dan gets off his &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;, plays Mark of the Ninja and thinks to himself &quot;Gee, THIS is how you make a stealth platformer! I was doing EVERYTHING wrong!&quot;, it&apos;s possible that The Swindle will be good. Until then, buying this is just swindling yourself of 15 bucks that could be used to get Mark of the Ninja, which is superior in every. single. way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-swindle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5400279">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a great little game for the price and far better than some of the review scores it&apos;s getting. Yes, it can be infuriating at times but it&apos;s designed that way so I don&apos;t see that as a bad point. Great graphics and sound and moreish gameplay.
<br>
<br>I thought my 16 yr old nephew would think it was rubbish as he&apos;s been brought up with 3D and doesn&apos;t want to play much else other than FIFA, F1 (sorry mate) - but he loved it and we had a great afternoon playing it, laughing at each others pathetic attempts and greedy misfortunes.
<br>
<br>Glad to see steam users rating is mostly positive!! The majority are correct!! BUT it might not be for everyone.
<br>
<br>UPDATE
<br>Played 9 hours now. In that time I&apos;ve really started to see how the game works and how I could beat it. You become more skilled so even when you have to begin again with no upgrades you know the early levels will be a doddle because you have improved and you make better decisions based on past knowledge. Don&apos;t want to give away any more. 100 days hah ha ha!!!!
<br>
<br>Forgot to say - try not to lose over 10 grand when trying to get back to the airship. I only needed one more second.. the amount of &#xA3;notes looked great floating down, but I nearly killed my cat!!
