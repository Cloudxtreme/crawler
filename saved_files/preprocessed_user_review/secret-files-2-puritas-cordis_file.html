Puzzles are better, i.e. there are better hints in the game before you begin a puzzle. In both games, it would be nice to have a bit more character humour, they do their best, but needs a more fun character (e.g. George from Broken Sword). Graphics are simple, so lacking in the imagination of say Syberia settings. Overall a fun game that nicely continues the genre, and definitely worth paying if you enjoy the point-and-click games. Doesn&apos;t get higher than 7 for reasons of simple settings, dialogue needs to be better, find+combine options sometimes annoying, but the solid 7 is for nice game play, nice music, some nice puzzles, and when character dialogue goes well, it is enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secret-files-2-puritas-cordis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2127004">Expand</a></span>

<br>The amount of stupidity I witnessed per minute is simply breathtaking, from the get go and it never ends. Idiocy culminates in the dialogues and behaviours. I physically brought my hands to my head many times, with a mix of incredulity and sadness, amazed that there exist, somewhere, people who  can and do write such drivel. At this level, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s even worth mentioning that there is absolutely zero research in the portrayed cultures and locations.
<br>
<br>The game still manages to be slightly better than its predecessor : First, in the puzzles, where cretinism is replaced with the nonsense we are used to since we have seen it in many point n&apos; click adventures, some of the gameplay is pretty good. Second, if the voice acting is as bad as ever, the protagonists are much, much less annoying.
<br>
<br>The technical quality is very good (despite some sound level issues), and the interface impeccable. Apart from that, most of the flaws of the game&apos;s predecessor are still present (reported here for convenience: acting, accents, asinine to infantile dialogues, logorrhea, 100% failed humour, generic plot, moronic motivations, B.S. science, plot-holes...)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/secret-files-2-puritas-cordis/user-reviews?user_review_id=6978445">Expand</a></span>
