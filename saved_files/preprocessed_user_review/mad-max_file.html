I still have not played metal gear a day later. This mad max game besides being beautufl graphically is so much fun, there is so much stuff to do in the game. My one little grip is that you cannot collect scrap metal by driving over it</span>

<br>Mad Max has a great pace and is pure fun. Wonderful graphics, a cast of utterly insane characters that fit greatly into the Mad Max universe, a depraved mutant that accompanies you while uttering ridiculous remarks, tons of stuff to do, things to upgrade, places to discover. Most of the mechanics have already been seen, but all of them are crafted with care (except for the fighting, which emulates Batman but is not as fun - but it&apos;s still cool - and has some camera issues), and every nook of the world has something different to offer in terms of exploration, so that collecting stuff never feels boring.
<br>Plus, there is a screenshot mode that allows to apply filters, blur, move the camera around and a lot more, which in itself is a beauty to play with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5498533">Expand</a></span>

All of the available upgrades keep both hand to hand and car combat interesting. The wasteland is beautiful to drive around and seeing an approaching storm is exhilarating. Don&apos;t listen to the negatives reviews and give this one a go!</span>

The game starts out a little slow, but if you&apos;re a fan of vehicle to vehicle combat and customizing cars to be anything from a racer to a small tank you need to check this game out. I have heard a lot of complaints about this game usually from people who have not played it or people that are blind because this game is great.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Great car combat and the ability to customize your car. Eg. Harpooning an enemy inside of his vehicle and pulling him through the windshield.
<br>-RPG elements that let Max himself become a better &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; kicker
<br>-The hand to hand combat system is not incredibly deep but it can be challenging at times and watching Mad Max pummel some one against a wall or cut them up with a well timed shiv is a lot more satisfying then any fighting game I&apos;ve played...not a fan of Down,A,X,B,A,Y,X,Left,A to make your fighter spin and shoot a fire ball? Me neither.
<br>-The story starts a little slow after the opening cinematic but it picks up and turns into a pretty epic story. Complete with a dream sequence with a talking dog head on a human body...
<br>-I have a GTX660ti and I have all graphics options maxed out. No lag, No hitching, No Freezing.
<br>-I have seen very few if any bugs so far.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-There is some repetitiveness and some grinding involved with the game but I feel the rewards and story are a pretty good pay off.
<br>-The physics can get a bit wonky at times. Eg. I got hit by a car once and instead of getting knocked away I got shot straight up in the air spinning like I was caught in a tornado. Another time the same thing happened to my car when I hit a large rock that an enemy shoved me into.
<br>-Darn Aussies their steering wheel is on the wrong side...
<br>
<br>I am sure I have some other minor issues with the game but I have been having so much fun I can&apos;t remember what they were...all in all this is an excellent game that well polished and a lot of fun. If you like vehicle combat and at all are interested in Mad Max or post apocalyptic settings then this game is for you.
<br>
<br>9.5/10 Would harpoon a man and pull him out of his car again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5806482">Expand</a></span>

<br>Although it&apos;s not perfect i have not had any frustration, gamebreaking bugs, boredom or perfmance issues. Not regretted this purchase at all.</span>

However, it&apos;s one of those games that you play once and then uninstall. I personally don&apos;t think such games are worth full price, not when the content is so repetitive, so I&apos;d wait for a sale.</span>

<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>-Overall, the game has beautiful graphics, with some exceptions (more on that later).
<br>-It runs like butter.
<br>-Like the rest of WB games I&apos;ve played (Batman saga, Shadow of Mordor), it&apos;s very stable and has very few bugs.
<br>It still has a couple of clamorous bugs, though (more on that later)
<br>-Pretty decent voice acting, Chumbucket is pretty hilarious sometimes.
<br>-Pretty decent progression mechanics, vehicle and character upgrades, stronghold upgrades, etc.
<br>-Driving through the wasteland with the Magnum Opus, laying waste to enemy camps and chasing convoys is pretty sick. But, as I said, I missed certain things (more on that later).
<br>-Combat is savage and enjoyable, although with certain limitations (more on that later)
<br>-The game has very nice touches like massive and deadly sandstorms, survival elements which include eating worms from corpses, keeping your canteen and fuel tank filled, etc. Thunderpoons are also sick.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>-The main story is perhaps too short. So much important stuff happens so fast, without really giving the story time to build up for the big moments.
<br>
<br>-Repetitive grind. This isn&apos;t an issue for me, since I don&apos;t mind grinding in games that I like. However, you might get tired of clearing enemy camps and collecting loot in repetitive ways. Personally, I didn&apos;t get tired since I took it as part of the experience.
<br>
<br>-This game lacks those huge concentrations of enemy vehicles from the movies, it&apos;s pretty scarcely populated, overall. &quot;Large&quot; concentrations of enemy vehicles are limited to convoys and war parties, and even then, those are pretty small (less than 10 vehicles).
<br>
<br>-The game is way too easy. Very little challenge overall, plus the Magnum Opus is essentially indestructible.
<br>Combat is pretty straightforward, it&apos;s essentially the same combat system fround in other WB games like the Batman saga and Shadow of Mordor. This isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing, since I quite like to keep it simple sometimes, it&apos;s just too easy, that&apos;s all.
<br>At least in the Batman saga there was challenge introduced by the sheer number of enemies. In this game you&apos;ll find concentrations of up to 12 enemies, with some variation, that&apos;s about all the challenge you&apos;ll get...
<br>
<br>-The game lacks combat gore for my taste. No dismemberment, beheadings, etc. There are plenty of gore elements scattered around the map, tons of corpses impaled on scarecrows, rotten corpses pretty much everywhere, truly disgusting body piles, etc., but there&apos;s almost no gore in combat. Just painful combos.
<br>
<br>-Absence of fear effects in combat. Enemy cars do run away after getting overpowered by the player, but that doesn&apos;t happen in combat, which is a real pity. In Shadow of Mordor, it was delicious to make orcs panic by massacring their mates...in this game, you can only do that when riding the Magnum Opus.
<br>
<br>-I&apos;ve found a couple of game breaking bugs, sadly.
<br>There&apos;s a camp in Pink Eye&apos;s territory called Havoc Point. This camp can&apos;t be cleared in the usual way because the door is bugged. So you have to find a workaround for it.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s another bug that makes one of the scarecrows disappear as you approach it, so it can&apos;t be destroyed. I think it&apos;s located in Pink Eye&apos;s  too, on top of a destroyed highway overpass.
<br>
<br>The Ugly:
<br>
<br>-Low polygon rock models in several places, which are masked with dark textures, in order to give the impression of grooves where there are none. Well, I NOTICED! And I don&apos;t approve of lousy 3D modelling work! XD.
<br>-Low polygon chains, which basically consist of two lines of flat chain textures, arranged in a cross pattern. This was common practice in the 90s and early 2000s, but it&apos;s 2016 already, chains must be modelled with the same level of detail as the rest of stuff, otherwise what&apos;s the point?
<br>
<br>-Most npcs that you encounter throughout the game are basically clones of three or four character models.
<br>This is common practice in a lot of games, but it&apos;s still ridiculous and detracts from the experience.
<br>Also, most enemies are clones too. Sure there are different kinds of enemies, with different weapons, skills and armors, but they are all based on the same few models, making the game suck when it shouldn&apos;t.
<br>It&apos;s like Shadow of Mordor, where all slaves were basically clones, unlike the orcs, which were pretty diverse and well modelled. It&apos;s sad to see games with so much potential being ruined by npc cloning.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s pretty much all the stuff I could think of.
<br>Overall, I definitely recommend this game to all Mad Max fans and people looking to have a savage time raiding the post-apocalyptic wastelands in a sick Magnum Opus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6531073">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The 2 big problems are car collision physics can be unforgiving in the driving missions as one bump can spin you which can be very frustrating and also there isn&apos;t much to do other than collect scrap, they could have done more with the exploration. All in all a very fun and playable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5865281">Expand</a></span>

Howver for me personally, I have absolutely loved this game and I have only scratched the surface. The characters are fantastically insane, and the history snipets of the various enemies are brilliant to read. They really stay true to the Mad Max universe in this respect. I like how upgrading and doing all of the various tasks are all tied to the story, rather than meaningless things to do just for the sake of doing them.
<br>
<br>Graphically it is a tourde force, it is incredibly well optimised for PC (considering WB have their name on it...) and runs at a consistent 120-150+ fps on my rig, never dipping below 100. The atmospheric effects really help to drive home the desperate nature of the world.
<br>
<br>Overall, for a movie adaptation game, it is very solid and I highly recommend it to those who are a fan of open world games. Probably one of my favourite games so far this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5459030">Expand</a></span>

Very like Shadows of Mordor, but while that game didn&apos;t feel like Lord of the Rings at all, this one does capture the feel of the Mad Max movies. Critical to the whole thing is the car, the Magnum Opus - it drives great, as a rusty old muscle car should, and it&apos;s great fun to skewer humans and vehicles with the harpoon. I&apos;d say the car combat is way up with the best (which is probably Just Cause 2, from the same developer). In some ways it is a bit simplistic compared to other recent open-worlders, but I don&apos;t mind that - Batman and many others end up with a map festooned with hundreds of icons for make-work tasks that I will simply never complete. This one has enough to do without being over cluttered. It looks great with, about as much variety in the environment as a blasted desert wasteland allows, and there are some lovely little animation details. The combat is a more brutal version of Batman and SoM, but  Max is a brawler, not a ninja, so no backflips or batarangs, just fists, shiv and shotgun, I&apos;m finding  it quite satisfactory. There is a bit of repetition, but that&apos;s part of the open-world game design - the issue is whether the the activities you do are fun. I probably haven&apos;t made as much progress on the story missions as I should because i just get engrossed blasting around, ripping the wheels off enemy cars with the harpoon. Did I mention it runs smooth as butter even on my ratty old PC? Well it does, and looks great doing it.

The game has a great feel and look to how Mad Max is. There is so much to do in this open world game, you get side tracked from the main mission, he&apos;ll iv fully ranked up max and iv just left jeets fort...the negative thing about this game is its very repetitive for the side missions, and a pain getting out of the car collecting scraps from fallen cars... EDIT(when you upgrade your fort scraps is collected automatically) what you will like about Max is the sheer fun factor of driving around in the waste lands taking down convoys, running into a sand storm and upgrading the car.. Iv just unlocked the side flames and it&apos;s a blast.. The sound is truly amazing of the vehicles . and the explosions are a joy to stop and take a screen shot while it&apos;s all going on.. As they have a very nice editor option where you can record and take snaps.
<br>
<br>My highlight is going into first person when driving and taking down a convoy it&apos;s epic..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5484356">Expand</a></span>

<br>Visuals are *stunning*. Yes, even if it&apos;s a desert. In some of the high-ground camps there&apos;s always a &quot;lookout&quot; point. You can find a couch or an armchair with a view on painstakingly beautiful panoramas (go to Crow&apos;s Nest at night and tell me i&apos;m wrong, i dare you). Fire is almost hypnotizing to look at. Explosions would make Mr. Torgue proud.

<br>Max: but they don&apos;t see me landing.
<br>
<br>and pros: Stunning scenarios, a lot of options to customize cars, the details and the main story
<br>Cons: fights with the bosses are almost the same, secondary missions and a poor participation of the leaders of the factions.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: A very fun game with a few weaks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6151755">Expand</a></span>

Normally being able to get that price on a game before its even released would have thrown up red flags for me, but there were hours of gameplay footage to look at, and I love the universe, so I decided I&apos;d take the deal and I haven&apos;t regretted it one bit.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll start by saying that many mainstream game reviewers have just completely gotten this game wrong, and honestly, I think that most of the reviewers barely even played the game, and instead were still pissed from the horrendous PC release of Batman Arkham Night that WB put out and used their mad max reviews as a way to grind their axe.  This game is a solid 85% in my book, and may even make it up to 90% depending on how it plays out (I&apos;m only about 15 hours in).
<br>
<br>There are a few annoying things like not being able to skip certain interaction sequences, and sometimes the game play can be a bit repetitive, but overall, I think this is a fantastic game that does exactly what it sets out to do; Let you play as Mad Max driving a badass car through the wasteland.
<br>
<br>I found the hand to hand combat to be quite satisfying, and every time it starts to get a little stale, I&apos;ll unlock some new combat abilities that breath fresh life into it.  I also think that the vehicle combat is entertaining as well, although it would be nice if they had polecats and motorcycles, but hey, they could add it with some DLC.  I love the customization that&apos;s available for your vehicle, and between the variety of different chassis and archetypes/upgrade paths to choose from, I actually see a lot more replay-ability from this game than I initially thought there would be.
<br>
<br>Plus, the cars have a great feel to them, and if for some reason you don&apos;t quite like the way things handle, then you can tweak pretty much any aspect of your car to suit it more towards your liking.
<br>
<br>The audio in the game is top notch, and I&apos;ve actually come to like Chumbucket after a while.  He&apos;ll occasionally utter some fairly funny lines when he&apos;s left alone.
<br>
<br>The graphics in this game are also top notch.  I&apos;m not sure exactly what they did under the hood with the game engine, but this game runs beautifully on max settings at 60-100fps even on my GTX670, which is a solid mid-range card.
<br>
<br>If it weren&apos;t for the impending fallout 4 release, I think that this game could actually put up a decent fight for single player GOTY.  With the average amount of time to complete the game at 50-60 hours, this is probably one of the largest and longest games you&apos;ll be able to play that&apos;s based of a major motion picture.  Even at full retail price of 60 dollars, I&apos;d still say this game was worth it, but for a 27 dollar pre-order this game was the best purchase I&apos;ve made all year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5469874">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I try and just do missions but end up doing or trying to complete every side quest/discovery.

<br>graphics are nice, hardly any hiccups reacts nicely.</span>

However, due to forums and user reviews I ended up picking this game up on a Black Friday for a nice discount. What a steal. Glad I didn&apos;t believe the biased reviews.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Atmoshpere- this game is through and through Mad Max. The wasteland is beautiful and the weather effects are amazing. This game has a great immersion factor for the most part. I like how when you scout out a new area, you actually have to scout with the binoculars from a hot air balloon. It&apos;s not like other games where you just press a button and everything is revealed. This also applies to scouting strongholds, which reveals info like secret passages and whatnot.
<br>
<br>Driving/Car Combat- The best part of the game. It&apos;s a joy to whip around the wasteland taking on convoys, ripping down sniper posts, and completing the various challenges.
<br>
<br>Graphics - Great effects, especially storms. The graphics on high settings are as good as any new gen game. The wasteland is rendered beatifically and believably. It&apos;s a joy driving around and taking in the world. There are not many extravagant colors, but it&apos;s a wasteland, and is rendered appropriately as bleak and desolate place.
<br>
<br>Combat - This is ripped straight from Batman, no two ways about it. Many games now use this system. I like how the finishing moves are nice and brutal. Not on par with BatmanAK, but good enough to be enjoyable. You can find some weapons lying around, but it&apos;s nothing too crazy and really by the numbers, but get&apos;s the job done.
<br>
<br>Rpg Lite- the upgrading is pretty robust with a wealth of options for your car, Max, and Strongholds.
<br>
<br>There are some minuses like a lot of wonky control decisions. Sometimes the camera is bad during a fight. Having to get out of the car to pick up scrap is terribly annoying in the beginning, but later on an upgrade does this for you automatically. The story is not great but definitely on part with the movies, which didn&apos;t really feature anything extraordinary. Also, there are some under developed survival elements which could have been really great if fleshed out. You need to scavenge for water and gas, but it&apos;s honestly so prevalent in the world you&apos;ll never really be bothered by it. I don&apos;t think I ever ran out of fuel. This could have been developed to make it a more survival type experience or just been thrown out altogether. Great concept though.
<br>
<br>Well I don&apos;t know if I can ever trust professional critic reviews every again after witnessing the hypocrisy of the scores and review content between this game and MGSV, which released on the same day. Honestly, WB did themselves no favors trying to compete with one of the all time franchises by releasing at the same time. Anyway, that doesn&apos;t mean Mad Max deserved to be crapped on. What a disservice to an excellent open world game. Definitely a great tribute to the Max franchise overall. I would recommend reading the PC Gamer review, 77/100, which I found to be the most unbiased of the bunch, although I disagree on the overall score, but who cares. It&apos;s all arbitrary. I&apos;ve played both games BTW. Some of the reasons Mad Max got panned include:
<br>
<br>Boring wasteland environment that feels empty. Lol, same as MGSV. There was literally nothing but outposts in MGS with no NPCs save for the soldiers who did not stray from said outposts. At least that makes sense in Mad Mas. Still,  Mgsv 10/10
<br>
<br>Weak Story in Mad Max. MGSV had possibly the weakest story of the entire Metal Gear franchise, but it&apos;s no problem, still 10/10. Max&apos;s story is on par with the movies. All action and crazy ass characters, but not deep by any means. It fits the spirit of the franchise just fine.
<br>
<br>Repetivie missions. You literally do the same thing over and over again in MGSV. It&apos;&apos;s a grind.
<br>
<br>You have to hold a button  to pick stuff up. LOL, same as in MGSV!
<br>
<br>Mad Max has map clutter. They actually complained there was too much to do. MGSV on the other hand repeats side missions ad nausea. And it&apos;s always eliminate or extract. There is nothing else to do in the world and no NPC characters anywhere. You will visit the same bases at least 3 or 4 times.10/10.
<br>
<br>They also go off on how foot combat is repetitive and unlocking things is a grind. This is the same as in every other acclaimed open world game. You go to an area, scout things out, and lower the enemy control by completeing side mission stuff. Far Cry 3+4, Batman AK, Shadow of Mordor, Etc. If you enjoyed any of these games, you will also this. Yes it gets repetitive after a while, what open world game has not suffered from this? You play the game long enough it gets boring. This is true of every game. I even got bored of MGSV after many hours.
<br>
<br>Anyway, sorry about the rant, I just hate seeing a good game panned for sloppy reasons. Bad journalism.The game is a very solid 8.5/10 for me but no such split on Metacritic. Better to me than Far Cry,Shadow of Mordor, and AC series, which are comparable open world games. Also, it runs great on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6180910">Expand</a></span>

This game is best enjoyed if you take your time with it and do what ever is close to you ....Most of the idiot on line low score game reviews have come from people rushing the main missions like headless chickens and not taking in the great atmospheric surrounding the wasteland as to offer...1 on line reviewer only played 6 hours what a joke

<br>
<br>One reviewer slated it for the barren and not much is visuals ...WTF do you want neon lights its the waste land which is mostly where the sea once was and its done spot on and is very varied too....
<br>
<br>Would i recommend it yes i would.
<br>edit .....also to add this is unbelievably optimized and scales very well from low end to high end systems ...avalanche studios have delivered 100% on this other studios need to take note and follow suite ......
<br>
<br>For me the first hour game play was ok but after 2 hours and upgrades done the game really does shine again if you are thinking of purchasing and like anything post apocalyptic then its worth the buy ....
<br>
<br>Good work avalanche studios about time there was a great wasteland game sure loot could be more in depth and car combat more in depth too but this would have been too complicated for some so i assume was dumbed down a little ......
<br>
<br>I was hoping more the car combat style in game mechanics of interstate 76
<br>
<br>But all in its a great game BUY IT.....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5459962">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are awesome, the gameplay is awesome. I&apos;ve been playing for 13 hours and I&apos;m at 12% so it&apos;s a truly huge game. Go buy it!!</span>

The voice acting is great, the story isnt the best but its not so bad that you want to skip all the cutscenes. The characters are pretty funny, i think they did a decent job on taking the feel of the movie and putting it in the game. Some of the upgrading is a bit grindy, but that doesn&apos;t bother me. The fighting is alot like batmans (which when came out everyone was like omg this combat so fun) but some people dont like it too much. I wish there were some more different animations in the ground fighting but either way its still spam left click and right click. The car combat is where things are the most fun for me. Overall the game wasnt too hard, but it wasnt too easy. They did well by not letting you run around like you had adamantium bones and driving a tank. The different zones were a nice change. I dont necessarily like how the whole zone looked so similar, but it was a good job on giving each zone a new look and still fitting within the wasteland feel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5856619">Expand</a></span>

If you liked the game Rage, If you like muscle cars, If you liked Twisted Metal from Play Station, if you like the fighting style from Batman, if you like feeling OP and crushing your enemies with fast cars with the ability to blow them up at will, if you like 8 vs 1 fights where you get to destroy them time and time again playing as Mad Max who is one Angry man on a mission, if you like a good story, if you like the mad max movies.  If you answered yes to many of my points above then you have to play this game!  I finished the game and I want more.  It did not feel linear like some games do as though they are trying to guide your gameplay.  There honestly is nothing I did not like about this game, which is rare for me to say.  Thanks to all involved in making this game, please do another!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6017868">Expand</a></span>

The world is huge, the references to the movie series are great, the ambiance is fantastic (you actually feel like in a apocalyptic environment), car combat is awesome, fighting combat is good, most of the main and side missions are fun, the story is ok.
<br>But if you try to complete your stats the game becomes boring and repetitive.
<br>The story starts great but it get&#xB4;s lost for most of the game, there isn&#xB4;t a clear goal on most of the missions besides gaining new stats or equipment improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6242624">Expand</a></span>

Max has lost his signature V8 Pursuit Special to thieving Warboys led by the unfortunately named Scabrous Scrotus, and teams up with a crippled but gifted mechanic named Chumbucket, who has a vision from on high to create the perfect car: the Magnum Opus. Journey with the pair across the dried shores of a forgotten land, doing a handful of story missions and a whole heaping load of optional content. The driving physics are excellent. Those complaining about stubborn handling don&apos;t realize that the cars in Mad Max handle like actual cars- they have weight, friction, impact. You can customize the Magnum Opus to your liking, unlocking new internals and offensive attachments as you gather scrap, the game&apos;s currency, and reduce the threat level of the Warboys in each of the four major regions by destroying convoys, scarecrow markers, sniper nests and war camps. Where the Opus doesn&apos;t fit, Max can lay into his enemies with brutal hand-to-hand maneuvers, in a system not unlike the Batman: Arkham games but far less in-depth. While simply mashing attack will get you through the early fights, good use of blocks, counters and dodges will be needed later. I found the game oddly similar to Star Trek Online in this regard: while you spend much more time driving, the on foot segments will quickly make you wish you were back in the Opus. On the road, your combat options are far more powerful, and diverse: in addition to ramming enemies, with the option of using boost to enhance damage, you have a side-slam move identical to that seen in Sleeping Dogs, though it is far less effective here when compared to your other options: side flamethrowers, a harpoon that can rip wheels off cars or drivers out of the cars completely, explosive-tipped harpoons that annihilate cars outright, and of course, Max&apos;s trusty shotgun- capable of blowing a wheel off a car just as easily as it will one-shot any normal enemy while on foot. The sound quality is incredible. The shotgun makes just about the loudest bang I&apos;ve ever heard in a game and when you FINALLY get your hands on the coveted &quot;Big Chief&quot; V8 engine near the endgame, you will hear its sublime roar and feel blessed. Dotted throughout the game are callbacks to the films, including the much-beloved Thunderdome. I cruised around the wastes for hours, only wishing the game had some better music. Mad Max succeeds where it needed to the most: Putting you in the driver&apos;s seat of the most deadly, awe-inspiring metal machine left on earth. Where it falls short is in a similar area to other &quot;open-world&quot; games- It is, in fact, TOO big a game. I clocked in over 60 hours and, if i were to be generous, perhaps 5 hours of that are actual story missions. Most of the game, as with Avalanche&apos;s flagship series Just Cause, is made up of optional content and there are only so many types of these activities, though the Death Run race events stand out. I found myself tuning out during long stretches of collectible farming, eventually resorting to binge-watching tv shows on netflix with the game volume turned down while I knocked activity icons off my map one by one. However, whenever I got back in the Opus, heard that engine, hit the boost, watched that blinding blue flame issue from my chrome pipes and slammed right into some unsuspecting warboy&apos;s pathetic scrapheap of a car, I remembered what I was playing and why. Mad Max is not a boring game by any stretch of the imagination, but it&apos;s a loooong one, and it has some slow stretches. Regardless, I enjoyed the better part of it- and the better part of it made me feel like I was in a world gone Mad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507830">Expand</a></span>

Games based on movie franchises &amp; also ones developed for as many platforms possible, are more often than not lackluster at most and as a sad fact are expected to be so. On the positive they initially remain free from the pestilent hype, which in this pre apocalyptic era serves us a platter of maggots promised as gourmet a-la-king.This is one of the few games which not only controls
<br>well but performs flawlessly, with almost non existant loading screens on all platforms and most of
<br>all is a whole grease ball full of open-world carnage.
<br>
<br>You start out as Max, and he is kind of Mad after losing everything recently including his iconic gas guzzler the black on black as well! The characters he initially meets shares a common familiarity with the protagonist and that&apos;s one of being forsaken and scrounging around in the dunes creating their
<br>own reasons to make life worth clinging on to.Like a dog who is left astray named after a can of dog food
<br>named Dink-Di, witch sole purpose is sniffing out landmines after being left crippled. The characters all
<br>seem to fit and are initially well developed considering the theme. If you are playing the game expecting a blockbuster story you would be sorely missing the point, watch the first Mad Max &amp; Mad Max : Fury Road movies for that. The main quests wont leave you laboring for weeks, yet there is so much more
<br>to do in this game if you choose to do so and you are well rewarded for it. Npc interactions are few yet
<br>alleviated by your mechanic companion which is one of the most interestingly developed and easily
<br>creeps into ones heart with his black fingers.
<br>
<br>You start out with a rusty frame with some wheels and an engine, from their on out its up to you how
<br>you want to create your new ride.Everything from choosing the chassis to the particular specs are left
<br>up to the player. Would you like to soar over the dunes in a lightweight speed demon or command a
<br>heavily armored bulldozer leaving burning wrecks of metal &amp; fuel in its wake? The deep &amp; meaningful customization is a very nice touch and to me is where the game design excels.Survival elements also
<br>play a part via the scarcity of health &amp; ammo yet it&apos;s so rewarding to not die when one survives a seemingly hopeless encounter with pure skill and a tad of luck. Preparations is key but no matter of preparation can save you from a sandstorm in the middle of infiltrating an enemy encampment and one
<br>is often forced to think on your feet. Enemy types does seem a bit lacking but I cant say that about the vehicles I encountered which is varied.Some innovative mechanics such as enemy vehicles that can be and can be commandeered and then salvaged for a large scrap reward by shooting an harpoon into the driver and safely &quot;extracting&apos; him from his vehicle.The game is well optimized and has some of the best day/night cycles ive ever sawn.Not to mention the variations in terrain and added little details like fuel dripping burningly onto the ground from your exhaust, tracks &amp; dust clouds left imprinted on the dunes, whirlwinds and sandstorms throwing a wrench into your plans when you least expect it.This game is full of such details &amp; random little moments of great fun which acts as quicksand of immersion.
<br>
<br>Some minor stomach aches may exist with the controls like press this button to climb &amp; whatnot, yet its a minor setback for the control&apos;s being so well done for PC as well as Controllers. I&apos;m also aware of
<br>of some negativity surrounding the plethora of task&apos;s becoming repetitive yet the game never forces you to do so as its completely optional, but I understand the struggle a completionist would &quot;enjoy&apos; in this world as it quite large witch is a plus for me.
<br>
<br>Pants of to Warner Brothers which created epic property&apos;s that so loved that it inspires developers creative wings to no end, as proven by releases such as the Batman Arkham series, Shadow of Mordor and now Mad max.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=6678250">Expand</a></span>

However, it is somewhat repetitive, formulaic and all about the grind. You know, I don&apos;t constantly want to have to get out of the car to go collect four bits of scrap. Why can I only carry one can of fuel in the car, there is clearly space for more, especially if the pig ugly bloke who hangs onto the back all the time did one.  And the combat, press Y, then X a bit. No you can&apos;t take melee weapons with you in the car. I am frequently levelling up apparently but I can&apos;t see that is making much difference to anything. And finally, the premise of the game makes no sense, apparently Max wants to find peace but also have a V8 muscle car, whilst apparently living on an oil rich sea bed complete with roads and a surprisingly high population density. I have heard this compared to Skyrim. It really isn&apos;t anything like that at all. More like a rehearsal of Far Cry, it even has towers to climb (sorry baloons to fly up in), Ubisoft style. Ultimately a bit flat and a bit dull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5472537">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;d list pros and cons but the other reviewers already did so go see those, they are pretty much the same.
<br>
<br>Some of the criticisms of Gamespot:
<br>-You are able to carry large stuff in the inventory
<br>-Getting hit by a car doesn&apos;t instantly kill you (seems like this dude never played a game)
<br>-The combat is simple (but batman&apos;s combat is a masterpiece despite being similar)
<br>
<br>Take that the way you want but IMO that&apos;s straight BS.
<br>
<br>BTW it&apos;s a great PC version just in-case you were wondering.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455220">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m not gonna dwell on the story cause it&apos;s just there to be there and to give you a purpose. Nothing special to it
<br>
<br>The gameplay is where this game shines, you have a car with a massive list of parts that you can upgrade you have three main aspects to it: Speed, handling and strength. You can either have a car that is good at all of them or a car that is great at two and weak at the other. the customization is also complex and fun, it&apos;s not just you trying to max out every category, you also have to keep in mind the down side to every upgrade.
<br>
<br>Upgrading Max himself is also just as fun. Learning new combat moves never felt like I&apos;m wasting scrap (the currency in the game). Each move felt unique and useful from reversals to wall slamming to limb breaking. The game is also VERY violent and gory which makes it even better for me. You&apos;ll face different types of enemies that will require you to use most of you moves along the game.
<br>
<br>The open worlds of this game is one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen in any video game. All the roads connect to each other and it&apos;s extremely nonrestrictive which is a huge plus. Each area has a big balloon where you can spot landmarks and &quot;Threats&quot; that you need to lower in order to unlock new upgrades for you and your car
<br>
<br>The graphics in this are superb, especially when it comes to lights, shadows, tire and footstep trails. The game looks pretty colorful and well done. Can&apos;t ask for much more than this
<br>
<br>The sound isn&apos;t up to the game&apos;s standard. I often found myself not being able to precisely pinpoint where the sound is coming from, but overall it&apos;s serviceable.
<br>
<br>For the most part this game is bug free, though I did find myself getting stuck on minute objects but there isn&apos;t a persistent bug worth mentioning.
<br>
<br>Overall this game is one of the best games I have played this year and it baffles me that it&apos;s getting these low scores. I definitely recommend you purchase this game at full price, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5518957">Expand</a></span>

The game is fun for a couple hours but it is by no means &quot;game of the year&quot;. The missions are incredibly grindy and repetitive. The combat is as easy as &quot;block, then strike&quot;, the bosses are cookie cutter and the world is bland. The driving sucks. Just not feeling it.</span>

<br>Ah, yes the game runs so smooth on my mid-range rig (high settings on 1080 [35-59 fps]). Great work there avalanche!</span>

The voice acting and plot are good, and it definately takes its lore from a mix of not only the new movie, but the old movies as well. The driving and controls feel fine, took a bit of getting use to with a Keyboard and mouse. The graphics are pretty damn good and the combat is basically Batman/Assassins creed style. You can even upgrade your character and level him up. And unlike that terrible Polygon review, I dont find the world lifeless at all, it has great character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5457731">Expand</a></span>

Destroy x oil tanks, kill all enemies, collect x this, etc. The combat is a watered down version of the Batman games with not much variety even when you&apos;ve unlocked all the skills. This is basically just a jack of all trades, master of none type of game. They just put together gameplay from GTA, Assassin&apos;s Creed, Batman, and Farcry, but it doesn&apos;t do anything necessarily extraordinary. I would say the only thing I commend them on is the car battles.

<br>Don&apos;t even get me started on the poor optimization of the PC port. Seems like they only tested the game on a few different hardware configurations. I have a clean install of Windows 10, all drivers upated and latest BIOS firmware, but the game crashes randomly. I&apos;ve installed 4 different versions of the Nvidia drivers and even lowered my settings to normal, but the crashes still occur. I know my video card (GTX570) can handle this on high settings because it runs smoothly on high up to the time it crashes. I can run MGS V on high with no problem. I think I&apos;ve just come to the conclusion that WB Games doesn&apos;t have a good QA team for their PC ports. I mean look at the debacle with Arkham Knight. They had to take the game off the Steam store and push it back due to the technical problems.
<br>
<br>(Update 9/29/15) - The latest patch has resolved the random crashing I was experiencing so I&apos;ve bumped my score up from a 6 to a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5499210">Expand</a></span>

Yes it has the same combat as batman arkham but I like that style so no lost points here. The driving is very fun also.

<br>
<br>that said, I looked at the worst magazine/online review from a &quot;professional&quot; publication, which was IGN. read the thing and thought that all the cons listed would be things I could generally cope with, IF ONLY THE VEHICULAR COMBAT WERE ANY GOOD!
<br>
<br>after that, I checked, whether the PC port were okay, thought it and quickly came to realize my favourite youtuber, &quot;TotalBiscuit&quot;, had just uploaded a &quot;port report&quot; and it said it were an exceptionally great port!
<br>
<br>last, but not least, I searched for a cheaper key and found one without any hassle. for the small price of only 17&#x20AC; ($19) I immediately took the deal. it&apos;s not even some ominous RUssian key, which would require using a VPN to install and play, but an ordinary worldwide accepted key. I don&apos;t do RU keys anymore!
<br>
<br>so, what to expect abnout the game? dunno what YOU should expect - I for once was just wishing for decent vehicular combat, or &quot;car fights&quot;, for my idiotic friends from America. ;)
<br>the last, perhaps even the ONLY game, which had pulled those off adequately, is
<br>
<br>&quot;INTERSTATE &apos;76&quot;
<br>
<br>and that game had been released in 1997 or &apos;96, if I remember correctly. I think it was spring 1997. anyway, until that game was released, there hadn&apos;t been any games pulling vehicular combat right. also, it was the dawning age of &quot;3D accellerator cards&quot;. :) (Diamond Monster anyone?)
<br>unfortunately, after &quot;Interstate &apos;76&quot;, there hasn&apos;t been ANY games even trying to implement vehicular combat - not counting tanks!
<br>
<br>&quot;Mad Max&quot; at least tries it and where it tries, it succeeds. the graphics and performance, as well as the sound design and art style are VERY good; the melee combat is just the same &quot;dumbed down&quot; bullcrap that everybody knows from the &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot; franchise, nothing special, but not too bad. it fulfills its purpose. thze biggest strengths of the game are the driving and the vehicular combat. also, its graphical fidelity, which is really high and the port is one of the best ever!
<br>you can check my other reviews on metacritic and you will see, I am not one to give out praise easily!
<br>
<br>where the game is lacking is the story!
<br>side missions are quickly becomming boring and the main quest is sub par as well, then again, all the &quot;Mad Max&quot; movies NEVER had a particularly great story and this title clearly is no gamechanger.

<br>I give it 8/10 points and recommend either waiting for a sale, or searching a key shop, where you buy it for around 20 $/&#x20AC;.
<br>if I would have had paid 50 or even 60 $/&#x20AC;, I would have been a bit disapointed, I have to admit. but just a little, better say, I would be &quot;underwhelmed&quot;, maybe,..
<br>
<br>summarizing it up, long story short: if you search for VEHICULAR COMBAT, this game pulls it off quite nicely!
<br>fans of the &quot;Mad Max&quot; franchis will probably be satisfied as well, I guess... (?);
<br>people, who always thought, &quot;if my Ass. Creed only had cars to drive around...(and onto towers)&quot;will be happy with it, I guess - even though I haven&apos;t found ANY towers in Mad Max yet... so they might hate it for that reason... I have no idea how Assassin&apos;s Creed fanboys/MORONS think, so who can tell.
<br>
<br>I give it 8/10 - if they patch in some more things, put even more focus on the vehicular combat in the future,. and/or release some actually GOOD story DLC, I might revise my review and give it even more than these innitial 8/10 points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5459726">Expand</a></span>

<br>The world is Epic and it fits right in with the mad max world.
<br>The explosions are awesome , you even have sandstorms that you can see approaching in the distance.
<br>Ok the story might not be amazing but the GAME play &amp; Fighting is EPIC. Best game for me this year hands down , its so much fun.</span>

If it&apos;s a narrative worthy of a best selling piece of literature you&apos;re after, then please look elsewhere (try books). Can never understand all this BS over the value on stories in games. HINT: Its crap, all the time. Mad Max does it right with so many things- played with 360 pad as it should, car mechanics are fine, combat is simple but fun to look at, exploration and immersion into this desperate world is top notch. The power fantasy of  upgrading your Max feels good, as does upgrading your car. But I feel it can end a bit too early. Other then that great. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5482232">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s plenty of cut-scene incompetence, and a story that in addition to not being there, is propped up only by the time spent roaming around - otherwise, it&apos;d be a very short game indeed. It gets repetitive quickly and there&apos;s no replay value.

Here you go. Graphics are stunning (including the most beautiful, realistic sky I have seen so far, dynamic day-and-night-cycle), controls are easy (fighting mechanics are the same as in Batman, SOM), driving is.. well you can get used to it pretty fast. Upgrading your Magnum Opus from the very start is amazingly motivating: Beginning with nothing else than a steel-skeleton with a tiny V6-engine, you soon upgrade it to something big and beautiful- EVERY SINGLE ENGINE UPGRADE IS (not only) visible, but AUDIBLE! I got my goosebumps when I finally mounted the V8-engine. The sound alone makes it worth trying the game. The story is 10/10 (not as bad as I expected). Even though Max is keeping his unsocial, rough manners through the whole story, he still is very believable. His mind and soul are broken and nothing can change this.
<br>
<br>Sidequests are mostly repetetive and boring, but the main quests are gold.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5479780">Expand</a></span>

<br>To my mind the game is underestimated. Despite the fact i bought MGS V:PP i won&apos;t even touch it before i finish Mad Max.
<br>
<br>Oh, what a game! WHAT A LOVELY GAME!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5452257">Expand</a></span>

Great framerate, good tracking of progress and collectibles, unique and diverse locations. It was a bit light on story but it didn&apos;t bother me much; I enjoyed the driving around and collecting stuff. There were, however, a few minor annoyances. It was hard to see anything in dark locations even with the flashlight and the hand-to-hand combat was tedious after halfway through. In addition, many upgrades to the car and Max are gated behind main story progress so one can&apos;t really prepare itself by doing side-quests or collecting stuff upfront. The cars handled relatively well with keyboard and mouse, except in races were I found it difficult to make small adjustments and ended up facing backwards too many times. In conclusion, this is a good game and was worth its cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5501429">Expand</a></span>

The narrative and story</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Gorgeously crafted post-apocalyptic thriller, finely produced by clear fans of the films and genre. Part open world, part on-the-rails, with some fabulously fluid game play.
<br>
<br>The attention to detail in the graphics and animations are nothing short of superb, with some real jaw dropping moments, which I dreamed, as a child, I could play in a video game one day.
<br>
<br>The narrative and story are both well paced and fitting to the characters, and are both refreshingly simple in design. The dialogue is only sometimes spoiled by the awful voice acting of the main character - but others are so well voiced and acted, that they could be recordings from unmade movies.
<br>
<br>The game play itself is largely what you make it. It does have some annoying DA: Inquisition-type task orientated side-quests, but then compliments that with a freely open world fun, where you can do what you want. Sure, the options are limited, but what do you expect in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? The constant focus on collecting scrap grates a little, but no more than in a Borderlands-find-the-cash-type way.
<br>
<br>I have thoroughly enjoyed playing Mad Max, and strangely, look forward to parting with my cash on future DLCs and sequels. It is a real pleasure to play, and that is what recent games of this caliber have been missing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5490173">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Truth be told, I never would have bought it save that it was on sale on steam.  For the first hour or two, I was seriously considering returning the game before my Steam trial period was up.   The fighting felt overly simplistic, and at the same time, the timing of the fighting was annoying.
<br>
<br>It still roughly amounts to little more than block, slam slam, block slam, dodge slam slam slam.
<br>
<br>But it&apos;s those SLAMS that really satisfy.
<br>
<br>You see, Max doesn&apos;t just flail around, dealing damage to whatever polygon is in the way of his attack. Instead, those fists are guided, almost every attack in the game is programmed to look REAL. When you block, you don&apos;t stand their with your arms crossed in a half crouch like so many other games, No... you literally intercept the opponents attack, and only if you really mess up the timing does your block turn into the old school braced arms.
<br>
<br>In other words, you intercept punches, kicks, even body slams and either reverse them, or otherwise counter them in really brutal ways.
<br>
<br>The visceral nature of the brawling is hard to find below that simplistic surface, but once you find it... you will REVEL in it.
<br>
<br>I went from being disappointed that I can&apos;t equip weapons long term, use knives, guns etc. To being glad the game is a knock down drag out fury fueled slug fest. The brutality of the fighting, combined with the &quot;survival&quot; nature of health regen etc, means no fight is really trivial.  Any enemy in the game can still ruin your day if you are not on top of your game.
<br>
<br>To be fair, once you get a grasp of the mechanics and timing, it&apos;s actually not super challenging, I do still die on occasion to even low level enemies.
<br>
<br>All this combines to create such a feeling of satisfaction after a fight that I RELISH and basque in the afterglow of a good brawl.
<br>
<br>The exact same brutality and satisfaction applies to the driving and demolition derby game play of the open wasteland.
<br>
<br>The first time I chased down a convoy, It was so much like a scene out of Road Warrior, it was mind bending, I had to pause the game, call my wife over, and we sat on the edge of our seat as I chased down the lead car, battling my way through the escort... when it was all over, I stopped to collect my prize, and my wife was like &quot;Hurry the **** up before more of those bastards come!&quot;
<br>
<br>It was so exhilarating.
<br>
<br>So, I guess I&apos;m one of those people who &quot;get&quot; this game, and I&apos;m sad that it&apos;s not doing better, because it makes me doubt ever seeing another one with a bigger budget.
<br>
<br>This game won&apos;t appeal to everyone, this game is far more than a combination of it&apos;s parts.  The whole entity is an organic open world that begs you to explore it, the visuals, the sounds... Even the dust storms.
<br>
<br>If you are a Mad Max fan, don&apos;t mind the fact that it&apos;s not really part of the timeline, but gets the look and feel and brutality right on point, I would suggest ignoring the negative reviews, and try it. Make sure you REALLY try to look past the surface simplicity of the fighting, look for the deeper joy it allows.
<br>
<br>I am actually enjoying this game as much if not more than Fallout 4... There I said it.  Flame away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5951646">Expand</a></span>

<br>A generally good game, with a large open world, lots of vehicular combat, and many features to make said combat fun.
<br>Pros:
+ Lots of customization
+ Large open world
+ Car handles nicely (Note: I play with a controller)
+ Slow Time when aiming from a car
+ Runs very well on my ancient GTX 680 Graphics card
Neutral:
&#xA7; Alright story so far

<br>&#xA7; Boss Fights are actually a challenge
<br>Cons:
<br>- Melee Combat isn&apos;t good
<br>- Very little ammo(seriously. Don&apos;t waste it on normal opponents)
<br>- Very unforgiving off the bat.
<br>I&apos;d give it an 8/10 due the cons, but it&apos;s still worth giving a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5450966">Expand</a></span>

I would agree it is a little bit repetitive but I find myself wanting more. For me personally, I havent felt this way about a game since Assassins Creed Black Flag.
<br>
<br>Satisfying gameplay, imo the best graphics yet (maybe not from a technical standpoint, I couldn&apos;t tell, but the design of the open world, and the way they&apos;ve pushed the viewing distance) and a pretty good system for levelling up makes this a really good game.
<br>
<br>What I would have wanted: A more punishing difficulty,regarding fighting and making gas/food/water more valuable.
<br>
<br>My mind is blown everytime i see the critic scores though.

<br>To get it back.
<br>Maybe a hunchback with magical black fingers will help since he believes you&#x2019;re essentially the Dragonborn.
<br>You set out on your journey for redemption with the entire world full of scrap metal at your disposal.
<br>Having to live off of small water pumps, maggots, lizards, and dog food.
<br>Offering yourself to stronghold leaders in return of some help to continue your quest.
<br>Mad Max is a massive open world with well over 50 hours of content.
<br>The good or the bad is that this massive world is just that.. a massive world that stays the same, keeps the same rules from beginning all the way til the end.
<br>By the rules of the game staying the same since the start, the world feels even more as one,
<br>you&#x2019;re introduced to everything that the game is going to throw at you very early on
<br>but the downside of this is that it&#x2019;s easy to feel repetitive&#x2026;. After a while you&#x2019;ll realize, wait a minute&#x2026;
<br>No matter what I do, I&#x2019;m really just going to location after location and picking up its collectibles and killing all of the bad guys there and doing it over and over and over until the credits roll.
<br>A side mission, a main mission, scavenge locations, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, it&#x2019;s the same thing.. collect scrap, kill everything there.
<br>Luckily though, you have to really concentrate on the repetitiveness to notice it, because while the world of mad max is one giant collectathon, the locations are surprisingly unique considering the game takes place in a desert.
<br>I actually loved exploring the open world, it never felt to me like the design team got lazy.
<br>If you stop to just soak in your surroundings, you may actually find them to be quite beautiful.
<br>Even the devastation and destruction is beautiful.
<br>Without warning you&#x2019;ll see a dark cloud approaching you, and you know you have to find shelter fast,
<br>The skies are about to get dark, the wind is about to pick up, and lighting is going strike the ground around you.
<br>The storms are terrifying, but bring so much excitement to the game, really adding a layer of immersion to an already super immersive game.
<br>After a storm has passed you can set out into the world to find scrap crates it blew around or get back to looting.
<br>While this really is just a game about map cleaning like assassins creed has become, there is reason to the mad maxness.
<br>The scrap is used for upgrades.
<br>You get scraps from exploding enemy cars, from scavenging, upgrading strongholds, and constantly like a bank system by claiming enemy camps, which is done by clearing them of their leader, fighters, or by destroying their pumps or tanks inside.
<br>You can freely upgrade max, your weapons, or your car as you level up and decrease the threat in each territory.
<br>You decrease threat by eliminating snipers, claiming camps, pulling down scarecrows, taking out convoys, and defusing landmines.
<br>and You level up by completing combat, environmental, and car based challenges.
<br>Leveling up really happens for the most part naturally.
<br>Car combat is surprisingly fun, you can rip off doors, tires, explode tanks, or just ram into opponents until they explode or run away.
<br>Hand to hand combat is a less satisfying version of the arkham games.
<br>Mad max on foot and in combat feels very stiff. So think skyrim in 3rd person but with batman style prompts. The camera doesn&#x2019;t pull out like in batman, which can lead to some hits that feel pretty cheap since the enemy is off camera.
<br>enemies do die quickly in hand to hand, so weapons aren&#x2019;t all too necessary outside of completing challenges and luckily neither is your shotgun.
<br>And I say luckily because you can only hold 2 shotgun shells with you in the beginning until you upgrade yourself to being able to carry a whopping 7
<br>Making the shotgun really only useful for hard to reach collectibles.
<br>But then there&#x2019;s the racing, the sections that if you&#x2019;re like me you&#x2019;re not going to enjoy even a little.
<br>They&#x2019;re cheap, luck based, physics don&#x2019;t exist, your car seemingly has no weight, and handling in this game sucks, there&#x2019;s a particular spot in the game where you die almost instantly from the never ending enemy cars in this quote unquote race that seem to do nothing but hinder you and are given a laughable 6 minute time limit to try and take out a larger truck.
<br>And for some reason when you&#x2019;re about to deal the killing blow, you will start locking on enemies behind you instead.
<br>Mad Max breaks in the spots it needs to work most.
<br>The racing in general and this section sprinkled into the main story really ruin what otherwise is a decently fun and relaxing experience.
<br>It becomes a frustratingly cheap ps2 era time trial out of nowhere.
<br>Luckily races are optional&#x2026;but the one I had issue with the most unfortunately isn&#x2019;t
<br>While mad max stays the same game from hour 1 until hour 80, you&#x2019;ll find yourself enjoying every second lost in this desert world claiming it for your own as you set out for a bit of revenge.
<br>The racing sections though, not so much.

It&apos;s a frustrating game and I recommend you stay away. Constant crashes aside, the game doesn&apos;t seem to respect your time by having you backtrack from one side to the other of the map in case of failure. Often times, dying is due to unpredictable physics, and very loose car controls. You will hit this one rock corner that will send you spinning and fail the mission. You will be of course punished, by having to head back on the other side of the map, only to reset the mission multiple times. Also, the game doesn&apos;t seem to know how to challenge you when on foot other than overwhelming you with a stupid amount of enemies. Boss fights are repetitive and lack depth. Combat in fact, lacks depth. The best tools and game mechanics are hidden away under a significant amount of grinding and that is a shame, because the road raids can be fun when it allows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5534703">Expand</a></span>

I would compare the general game elements and open world to an Assassin&apos;s Creed title. The way the protagonist moves and behaves between bright yellow scripted elements like ladders and ledges left a bad taste in my mouth. The constant &quot;press E to interact&quot; is downright obnoxious and about as far from my expectations of gameplay could possibly be. Press E to kick down gate, press E rapidly to open chest, hold E to loot contents of chest... you get the idea.
<br>
<br>As far as hand to hand combat goes, it&apos;s a direct replica from the recent Batman games. Light attack, Heavy attack, Counter attack when enemy glows. There&apos;s a skill system for gaining a few special abilities, but they really add next to nothing to what I would consider a bland and shallow system. The combat is so extremely boring immersion is directly effected, and as a result I feel like I&apos;m not actually playing a video game at all.
<br>
<br>If you aren&apos;t concerned yet, surely this next bit will raise some red flags. The worst thing about the Mad Max game by a long shot is the driving. It is a completely vanilla, bare-bones arcade driving experience. Vehicular physics should have been the main focus of the game, instead it&apos;s just another card in a deck of clones. I&apos;m not looking for a racing simulator with tire pressure and a realistic suspension deformation system, but when I was told there was going to be a game based on a series renowned for its vehicular combat, I expected more than the driving physics tech demo for the Havoc physics engine. If you have played the recently released Metal Gear Solid V, you know the driving physics in that game aren&apos;t particularly impressive. The sad thing is, they are better than what is available in Mad Max.
<br>
<br>Enemy AI makes the bad driving physics laughable, of course when you&apos;re speeding along and playing &quot;how the game is meant to be played&quot; the illusion of decent gameplay is there. Anything outside of this is just not fleshed out. If you slow down to a near stop the enemy AI gets extremely confused, and starts to bump into you slowly over and over again which I can only compare to the way a puppy tries to entice its siblings into a playfight.
<br>
<br>The vehicle upgrade system is pretty darn cool though, and I was happy to see how each level of upgrade actually changed the look of the car. Actually, while we&apos;re talking about visuals, I should say the majority of the game&apos;s visuals are quite impressive. I am absolutely blown away by how incredible the wasteland looks, I have no doubt the majority of time was spent setting the scene and making sure the game had that &quot;dead&quot; post apocalyptic feel. Even though the game takes place in a desert, the developers did a good job giving each area its own personality to stand out from the previous one. Unfortunately this just makes the game that much more disappointing, like we&apos;re given a sneak peek of incredible places we will never feel like we&apos;re part of.
<br>
<br>All-in-all you&apos;re going to be stuck looking at a beautiful game through a glass window, because no matter how hard you try you just can&apos;t connect with any of the gameplay, no fun allowed. Press E to eat, press E to drink, press E to refill gasoline... press E to climb ladder... press E to immerse yourself into wasteland... if only. The overwhelmingly positive reviews for this title absolutely blow my mind, I don&apos;t see how anyone could be entertained by this game for more than an afternoon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mad-max/user-reviews?user_review_id=5477362">Expand</a></span>

It has a bit of a last of us feel with really fun vehicles and more of a brawler feel to the combat. it is which is very very nice indeed.I like how you aim have a really awesome car.Its really not a boring game at all. The graphics are stunning and the game is so well optimised.</span>
