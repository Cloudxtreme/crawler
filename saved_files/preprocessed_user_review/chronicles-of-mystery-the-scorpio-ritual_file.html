The voice work is uneven but the main characters are done well. The story is yet another riff on the Knight of the Templar and remains serviceable until the ridiculous ending. The biggest problem is that the game is excessively linear even for the genre. You simply cannot do any actions until some prior action has been done and the game informs you of this bluntly. If you haven&apos;t got all the objects from a map, you can&apos;t leave.  The game is plagued with do random event X in Random location Y and then get a phone call to make the story progress. It&apos;s nonsense. Then there is the problem of the voice acting getting clipped, and the fact that the voice acting often is vastly different from the text, and random objects you need lying around in random locations, and you have a mess.  It&apos;s too bad because there are some parts of this game done well and other parts are done poorly. It has potential but just never lives up to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chronicles-of-mystery-the-scorpio-ritual/user-reviews?user_review_id=2106309">Expand</a></span>

It is unfortunate it is let down by having some odd and nonsensical dialogue to bring you along, the terrible ending (though that bothers me less if the journey to the ending is nice, which it is, but still, it is a very lazy ending), and that it is very short. If you get it for $5 or less it is worth it, and you will enjoy the experience for 4-5 hours, I know I did. You just also may wish afterwards that with such nice music and graphics, it could have been much more and much bigger. If you liked Syberia or Broken Sword, you will like the diversion this gives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chronicles-of-mystery-the-scorpio-ritual/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557354">Expand</a></span>
