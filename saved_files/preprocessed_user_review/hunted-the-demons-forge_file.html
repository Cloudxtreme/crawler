Those criticizing the game are either playing on systems below specs or with outdated drivers.  With even a semblance of a decent rig, the game will be playable with little/no FPS lag.  That being said, this game is definitely not for everyone, and there are some problems with CoOp.  If you&apos;re looking for the loot-driven randomness of Diablo or Torchlight, this game will disappoint.  For what the game is, which is a hack-n-slash based in an RPG setting, Hunted delivers on several fronts.  Battles are challenging and exciting, especially on higher difficulties.  The dark mood and setting have been very eerie.  Do NOT play this game in a dark room at night!  The ability system is somewhat simplistic, so it may disappoint &quot;true roleplayers&quot; who are used to games like Dragon Age: Origins or KotOR.  This isn&apos;t really a drawback, though, since, if you&apos;re playing this game, you just want to smash things to bits anyway.  For the PC version, I did not find the graphics &quot;dated&quot;, as some users have implied, but there can be some texture tearing even when there shouldn&apos;t be.  To summarize, if you want a game that will help you let off some steam, challenge you (and a friend!) with epic battles, and make you feel like a hero, pick this one up.  Just realize that it may not be what you expect it to be, and that there might be some problems which, hopefully, can be solved with some updates in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1653538">Expand</a></span>

Postponed the purchase because of the mixed critiques, but I was disappointed positively. This game is not for everyone, I think some expected more from it. It is what it is, a dungeon crawler as it was advertised, no more, no less. Great action mixed with some puzzles and exploration. The story is decent, even if you get to know the most of it from the dead. It feels a bit like reading a book, there are plenty of things left for your imagination, but you&apos;ll never feel cheated. These little personal stories only enrich the universe of Hunted.<br>The design of the game overall is decent, you won&apos;t run into the same setting twice. You really feel the space even if you mostly go through linear sections. The graphic is nice and I definitely would not call it dated. The puzzles are not particularly hard, you will have to rely on your perception mostly to get them done. If you tired when you play, there&apos;s a bigger chance you miss secret areas and otherwise obvious solutions to riddles.<br>I think the gameplay is decent too. The action has good dynamics. It&apos;s a bit repetitive, but I never got bored of slaying hundreds of ugly beasts. It&apos;s simply fun! Recently I felt disappointed by big over-hyped titles which look good, but have very little to offer in terms of entertaining gameplay. Hunted restored my faith.<br>The only downsides are the bugs. They are not as nearly as annoying as some say, but they are there. But I have seen much worse cases recently, so I think it&apos;s forgivable.<br>Overall it&apos;s a 9. And I think this game is underrated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1789131">Expand</a></span>

People need to judge this for what it is: a dungeon exploring game focused on combat. This is not an RPG or a loot-fest. I found the exploration to be extremely fun and immersive. Likewise, the combat, especially the archery, was so precise and rewarding. And the story was actually very intriguing. The way it was told through the flashbacks from the dead citizens of the empires was ingenious. Learning the whole sad tale kept me greatly interested! After one playthrough, I only found 1/2 the secrets, so time to go back and explore. Anyway, Hunted isn&apos;t perfect but it was very enjoyable and left me wanting more. That&apos;s high praise considering how many bland games come out. So Hunted is a refreshingly pure dungeon crawler that deserves to be experienced, critics be danged. Real score: 8; score of 10 to balance out all the 0 noob scores.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1689700">Expand</a></span>

Looking at E&apos;lara is much more than 5 minutes satisfaction :-)<br>Okay serious now: compared to Gears of War or Resident Evil 5 - you coop-partner (AI) is not worse.<br>When you&apos;re playing E&apos;lara, Caddoc makes his job pretty good.<br>He fights in the first line, he revives you immediately (usually), and he gives you magical boosts just in time.<br><br>But much more fun, this game is in coop-play with your friend. I have to mention, that some people have here problems, too: matchmaking via gamespy or something is not working, they say.<br>Well - i play via hamachi (LAN-client) and its working perfect !!!<br><br>Playing with a buddy is something special. Its working perfect, we hat no lost connection or something else. But its a little bit harder, because both players are always looking for potions and armory :-)<br><br>After a playthrough it&apos;s recommended to try the crucible editor.

<br>I decided to stick with it and Im glad i did.
<br>Although the character textures could be better the banter between the two as they work their way through is amusing and real enough to make up for it.
<br>I have no issue with long loading times and infact they are well within reasonable,perhaps some people need an upgrade.
<br>Graphics run on max with shadow on medium with Geforce gtx 250 and gameplay is perfectly smooth.
<br>Out in the open world you can see a lot of effort was put into making a beautiful land.
<br>I havn&apos;t tried online co&apos;op as I feel trying to work with a stranger would probably be frustrating.
<br>Single player is fun as it is,your partner does an above average job of helping out and I even found when playing as Caddoc that Elara was not so squishy in big fights despite her lack of armour.
<br>Hell she had to come rescue me quite a few times.
<br>Controls work well despite it being a console port according to some reviewers(havn&apos;t checked if its true)infact I couldn&apos;t tell.
<br>The combat is challenging enough to make it fun and not so hard as to be frustrating.
<br>So far I have about six hours into the game and find it pretty hard to stop and go to bed and it feels like ther is a long way to go before reaching the end.Thats a good thing.
<br>If or when a sequel to this comes out it will definitly be on my shopping list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1774516">Expand</a></span>

I played most of the HALO&apos;s and all 3 gears of war.  This game has a good story and the difference in the two characters make this game so much more fun and engaging then any other fps-ish game out there.  I will admit having a real life friend to play this game with rather then strangers makes a big difference.  I bought the game at full price and have no regrets, now you can get it for as cheap as 20$!  Do yourself a favor and get this amazing game and hopefully they&apos;ll be a sequel or a game similar to Hunted&apos;s unique, innovative, and incredibly fun style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1783872">Expand</a></span>

My wife and I saw a game play trailer, took a chance, and LOVED IT! Seriously brought back memories of Heretic II, one of the first games we played together. Gorgeous graphics, visceral combat, wonderful exploration bonuses and great co-op feel and tactics, I can&apos;t recommend this one enough. Nice story and cut-scenes as well. Some caveats though that kept it from being a 10:<br>1. Save points are ridiculous, leading to multiple plays of the harder fights. There should be more or manual saves. 2. Interface has some issues in some areas, we&apos;re playing it on PC and it feels like the game was designed for console, so maybe that&apos;s the issue, but the menu UI could&apos;ve been polished more. Not really a criticism but an overall comment. We&apos;re playing only co-op. You do have to play the tutorial solo and that didn&apos;t seem too distracting, but I&apos;ve no idea how it plays overall single-player. I wouldn&apos;t even bother to try it that way. We&apos;re buying this for friends as gifts after a couple hours of play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981546">Expand</a></span>

For console players it&apos;s worth a weekend rent to play with your buddies or even just to grind through the solo campaign if you&apos;re into quick games. At this point in time the multiplayer community is dead so don&apos;t go into it expecting to be able to join an online co-op game. For PC players it&apos;s not really worth the 20$ price tag that steam is asking for but if you can find a cheap copy on Ebay or something then you should def try the game. The graphics for the game aren&apos;t the best but it makes up for it with a somewhat decent story line and decent game play. The skill system is very simple and easy to understand so veteran gamers and casual gamers alike will find it very quick to get into and the controls are just as easy to learn as eating and breathing. For what it&apos;s worth the game is def worth at least one play through with a friend and some beers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1988448">Expand</a></span>

Besides the obvious 6 skills that your characters can acquire each of the 6 skills have 3 upgrades ..making it 18 + 3 modifiers for each of those 18 skills. The AI is nowhere near dumb as i initially thought. Barely reaching chapter 2 and playing on the 2nd difficulty there have been times when we died in coop. Considering most of the time you can even ressurect your partner (1 res for each vial you possess) that&apos;s quite a few deaths. Graphically speaking, the tutorial does no justice to this game. It was horrible and totally uninspired. However once chapter 1 started everything got better. Also the game&apos;s visuals can ba vastly improved if you have an nvidia card by forcing AA and Ambient Occlusion. With a 8xAA + performance AO in 1080p gtx 560 ti i stayed in the 60 fps range. And the graphics got way better. Only issue i had with this is once i tried to play coop with AA and AO forced the game crashed. Singleplayer was fine however so im not quite sure what to make of it. To finish this off : if you&apos;re expecting a loot-driven hack&amp;slash similar to diablo/titan quest don&apos;t bother. However if you want to play a fun coop dark-fantasy setting game similar to gears-of-war system then this might be for you. I&apos;ll be giving it a 9 BUT ONLY AS COOP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1650691">Expand</a></span>

Like saying there are several other games with &quot;elves and dragons&quot; better than this. There&apos;s nothing like that, especially with co-op, and MMOs don&apos;t count since you have to group with a bunch of losers &amp; grind on lame quests. Hunted is good and the characters have really detailed personalities, and good voice actors backing them (BloodRayne and Dante (fron Dante&apos;s Inferno). Big and small choices matter in this, and some interesting game mechanics are put to use in relation to those choices. Sure there are some bugs and some things that could have been done a little better, but this is the case with all games. Art in general is never perfect and games never are. If you buy this for singleplayer you won&apos;t be happy though. Definitely needs a co-op partner to take advantage of the game.<br><br>Oh and people who say this is like Gears or something are wrong. It&apos;s nothing like any of those games. There is a lot of thought put into this game and how combat works for each character.  There are a lot of touching moments in the cutscenes too and the story is excellent. The only thing that bothered me was the bad ending. if you go for the good ending this game&apos;s story ties up nicely, but it definitely needs a sequel. I hope despite all the negative people that don&apos;t know what they are talking about, that this game gets a sequel. It&apos;s on my top 10 now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1650635">Expand</a></span>

The easiest thing to do is download Tunngle (similar to Hamachi) and play with a bunch of other people over LAN. It worked instantly for my friend and I. Pro: I have played through the single-player and Coop single-player campaign and loved it. I do not think the melee is clunky or awkward at all. It takes a kind of skill to do melee combat, just because you&apos;re not good does not mean the game sucks. I enjoy fantasy stories, I love the story of this game. Very simple in the beginning and deeper towards the end. I like the personality of the main characters and their snippy remarks, it adds character depth which you can see the developers wanted to do. I bought the game on a whim and really like what the developers were trying to do. I buy games to support the developers and the movement to which what I want to see the direction of the industry go. It is a fun Linear game, I like linear, it&apos;s foolish to think that just because a game is Linear that it has no depth and it sucks. Each game is intended to please a different type of gamer, not all gamers. And this one does the niche, linear Action/Adventure small RPG elements - BIG coop options and map editor - very well. There are few games like this one out and I commend the company for making it. CON: Price was to steep for this game. I do think $30 would be more appropriate, though I split it with a buddy of mine and $25 each is fine for LAN playing and you only need 1 CD for LAN<br><br>~Tinye</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1651554">Expand</a></span>

Most of the &apos;puzzles&apos; are fairly straightforward, but there are secret areas/quests that can easily be overlooked.  This along with the ease at which it is to jump in and play in my opinion give it good replay value.<br><br>I haven&apos;t been able to get an online game going which is admittedly disappointing, but fortunately even with the single player campaign the computer AI handling your ally does pretty well.  I&apos;m not going to ruin the game score over that element as I believe that is dishonest, but I do hope that this gets resolved fairly soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1652392">Expand</a></span>

I managed to spend four or so hours playing co-op (using Tuungle) as E&apos;Lara last night, and I have mixed feelings. As others have stated, performance is all over the place. Even starting the game can range from 10 seconds to over a minute. Checkpoints can freeze your game up (causing the person with the faster computer to wait for you), but if you&apos;re patient it comes back.<br><br>Hunted is BRUTAL. Some balance issues definitely need to get some attention. Taking cover (at least from E&apos;Lara&apos;s perspective) is essential, and if you get in melee range you&apos;re as good as elfburger. The real problem is that the cover system is quite clunky - the controls are clunky in general. It&apos;s definitely apparent this was a console port, and keybindings were counter-intuitive to any other FPS game I&apos;ve played. The one saving grace in combat is the assisted targeting -- if you are behind cover and pop out to take a shot, your &apos;crosshair&apos; will line up with a mob. This can sometimes point you right at a wall, but it&apos;s the only way to successfully survive as E&apos;Lara. Pop out, fire an hour or two, pop down. Enemies fail to miss, and it only takes 4 or 5 hits to down you.<br><br>Which leads me to health/mana potions and rez potions (I forget what they&apos;re called). The drop rates for potions REALLY needs balance, as there are at least 5 mana for every 1 health potion dropped. You can hold more potions (up to 3) at a time as you progress through the game, but you rarely have more than 1 health potion. And that leads me to the whole &apos;partner down&apos; problem.<br><br>Given that it is so easy to die, using one of your health or rez potions is critical in the middle of combat. There are two flaws with this system, the first being you only get (roughly) ten seconds before your partner bleeds out. The second is if you&apos;re in the middle of an attack or not facing the person you can&apos;t revive them. This can be extremely difficult to overcome if you&apos;re under fire or you&apos;re the melee character and can&apos;t turn around, as the controls are finicky. My friend and I died more from clunky controls than actually having &quot;oops&quot; moments. Checkpoint placement is decent, but not great. We had to replay large firefights we had already finished 2 or 3 times, but for the most part they are placed somewhat okay. Instead of placing checkpoints at the various &apos;loading&apos; points in the game, they really should have placed them whenever your journal was updated.<br><br>I cannot comment on the graphics as I have a 4 year old laptop and I was running on minimum settings. My framerate would drop to 15-20 during firefights, which is manageable and no fault of the game, but graphics still looked fairly good. I&apos;ll agree with other people here and say they did a poor job of utilizing the U3 engine. There are quite a few invisible walls and areas you should be able to access but cannot.  The game promotes exploration through text while loading areas, but my friend and I have yet to find access to a huge deal of areas with hidden objects. The game is also very inconsistent about objects and level design - you can break a barrel here, but not on the other side of the pathway. You can break this wall, but not that one.<br><br>The sound design, especially the soundtrack and voice acting, were probably the most impressive parts of the game. I can&apos;t comment too much on them right now, but they did stand out.<br><br>My overall experience was a mixed bag. The experience felt like Army of Two mixed with Too Human, both on the 360. It&apos;s fairly fun and we will continue playing because there are too few co-op FPS games for the PC right now, but at the end of the night my final thought was, &quot;they really should&apos;ve beta tested this game before it was released.&quot; I&apos;m sure it was, but it REALLY needs a lot of work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1652199">Expand</a></span>

Hunted is one such 3rd person shooter and fantasy-themed dungeon crawl. Its plot and characters are hammy but compared to Gears it is a literary epic. Hunted&apos;s textures are merely OK, but overall art design is good. More resources are in its AI and light particle effects; The use of light for exploration and puzzles which take place in dark caverns and corridors is fun and makes for a great atmosphere. Epic loot is important to fantasy and the fun of a new drop is in its unique inventory system. Hunted&apos;s huge problem is a lack of polish. On the PC controls suffer terribly from being a console port and bad collision detection has the game feeling clunky and unresponsive, which will cripple a shooter. My friend &amp; I played through most of the game but requested a refund when bugs made the game too frustrating to continue near the end of chapter 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1652813">Expand</a></span>

But so far I&apos;ve found quite a few stupid things that exist in this game like where you might see 3 nearly identical barrels in the corner and all look really weak and old, yet only one of them can be broken. I mean either make all of them breakable or none of them, 1 out of 3 just makes it really weird. I&apos;m slightly confused by the weapons system too, my UI says I can equip a bow or a backup bow, and yet when I find another bow on the ground, I can only replace my existing bow, not take both??? I heard that the second bow slot is actually something that will be unlocked later, but in that case why not somehow show that it is a locked slot/ability? There are many other small things as well, like not being able to jump. On the plus side, voice acting is pretty good so far both in terms of fit and delivery. Overall, not a horrible game, but not a great game either, I got mine as part of a pack, so no big loss for me. But definitely not worth it to buy at full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1783091">Expand</a></span>

Skyrim it is not...at least I hope it isn&apos;t! LOL  I don&apos;t believe it&apos;s worth the $50.00 price tag, so if you can get it at a discount, do so.  If not, wait until you can buy it in the $35 - $40 range.

<br>I thing I really did not like is the graphics and the palette they used. I understand they were trying to make gritty but it looks like mush to me. The gameplay is really repetitive but there are some neat fights here and there. You must play co-op in this game. It is so much better in everyway and the time can go past quite quickly sometimes. I give this game two ratings. 4/10 for Single player and 6.5/10 for Co-op, overall a 5/10.
<br>+Fun co-op
<br>-Too gritty and too muck. -Repetitive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693679">Expand</a></span>

Haven&apos;t experienced the load times that some users are complaining about and so far I&apos;ve been playing solo as I&apos;m the only one of my friends that has been following this game. My impressions? Damn fun game. Wanted to play for a half hour or so to test it out, but got sucked in to a four hours session. Graphically beautiful, engaging story, easy controls, and a innovative inventory system that requires no maintenance.  The side quests blend seamlessly into the main story, and I was sitting at work thinking about playing more of it today instead of Dirt 3.  Haven&apos;t tried the multi-player yet, but the single player is beautiful and engaging.  Haven&apos;t finished Dragon Age 2 yet, and it seems like I&apos;ll be finishing this one first. Playing on Highest Graphics settings w/ a 580gtx, I7 2600K. I repeat, NO NOTICEABLE LOAD TIMES. Enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1651591">Expand</a></span>

After you get use to that the game becomes smooth, fun and you start enjoying the little things like the animations of the combat and the moves your character does.  Even though I say that,  SOME of the animations and powers don&apos;t look very well done as you will notice. You do get stuck in stupid places sometimes like behind a very small step and u can&apos;t jump over it because there is no jumping but it can easily be overlooked in single player.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer: The worst player search system and by far the worst connection I have ever seen on a co-op orientated game. Multiplayer is not working well (if at all), checked online for fixes and eventually found out that I have to do port forwarding and create new firewall rules etc. After I did this (INCLUDING, phoning my ISP to double check if my ports are open, which weren&apos;t) my ports were still not open that was my ISP&apos;s fault I guess. I had to find different means of playing this with friends. I struggled for about 3 days to get it working, my god when co-op works its awesome, its nothing really ground breaking but its really really fun. If you are ready to waste a lot of time and tear your hair out to get the co-op working and if you can ignore some of the bugs you will enjoy this unpolished and incomplete game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1655346">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are not as bad a s people are saying, it looks pretty good on high settings. Overall this game is a diamond in the rough, overshadowed by games like the witcher 2, dragon age etc. All in all it is a fun game, flawed but fun, the story and gameplay improve as the story progresses and you will find yourself enjoying an underrated game, you just need to give it a chance.<br><br>pros- interesting concept mixing action/rpg, enjoyable game play, graphics look good on high, sound quality is good, underated game overshadowed by its more successful predecessors cons- melee combat can be a bit monotonous, bugs, awkdard camera at points, steep price wait until it comes down to 20-30 before getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1711812">Expand</a></span>

If you can play more than 10 minutes at a time without getting a migrane because of graphics issues, you&apos;re lucky(sadly, I am not exagerating).  Nothing about the game makes me feel compelled to play it longer than ten minutes on occassion, anyway.  The voice over banter is kind of lame, and gameplay gets repetative fast.  Finding a partner to hook up with seemed fairly impossable, so I never played the game at that level.  Many reviews say the game is good when played with a partner, so maybe if you are sure you are going to always have a buddy to play with, go for it.  If you think you are going to end up playing Hunted alone most of the time(which is my experience), I would not recomend buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1807411">Expand</a></span>

One complaint there is that with only 4 slots for powers per character, I had all 4 slots filled with maxed-out level 2 powers by the middle of the 3rd chapter. And the game unlocks level 3 powers only at the 5th chapter. So you&apos;ll be collecting crystals for a long time before you can spend them again.<br><br>The RPG/Fantasy fans with a decent system will have a good amount of fun on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1980773">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game brings a mix of RPG with action, the producers made a very fun coop, and the difficulty of the game is quite varied, in a positive sense.

<br>PS: I hope that people who evaluate this game or something on that level as 0 get banned from this site.

<br>
<br>Cons:-simple things that would make a game Game of the Year such as: the lack of a map, can not change the character without an obelisk, moving action Cadocc more realistic graphics with more filtering capabilities.
<br>
<br>I honestly do not regret having bought this game, I think unfair to give such a low note, if we compare many games in this genre Hunted manages to stand out, I recommend it to fans of Hack n Slash and medieval fantasy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=4172243">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hunted, es un juego de acci&#xF3;n con peque&#xF1;os elementos de rol y muy simplificado. Se trata de algo as&#xED; como acci&#xF3;n con dungeon crawler, donde atravesaras grandes escenarios oscuros en gran parte, derrotando enemigos, juntando coleccionables y adquiriendo versiones mejoradas de tus armas.
<br>La historia se centra en dos mercenarios; Caddoc el humano y E&apos;lara la elfa. Tal y como se da en los juegos de fantasias, el humano ser&#xE1; un fuerte guerrero y la elfa, una excelente arquera. La cosa que puedes usar a cualquiera de estos dos personajes, pudiendo cambiar en ciertas partes del escenario(hay a cada rato asi que no es problema).
<br>Sin ser nada del otro mundo, el juego nuestra el viaje que emprenden estos dos codiciosos mercenarios para obtener riquezas, pero se ven inmersos en un problema mayor y terminan sin quererlo, siendo los h&#xE9;roes que salvaran el mundo. Una historia t&#xED;pica de este tipo, pero que te mantiene expectante durante el transcurso del juego.
<br>Lejos lo mejor son los di&#xE1;logos de nuestros &quot;H&#xE9;roes&quot;, muy divertidos, a veces muy ego&#xED;stas o vulgares. Recuerdo cuando rescatas a una persona y le dicen &quot;ya vuelve a tu pueblo no tendr&#xE1;s problemas porque ya matamos a los enemigos&quot; con tanta indiferencia que el salvado dice: &quot;eso es todo?, vaya estos son los peores heroes que he visto&quot;.
<br>La jugabilidad es simple, entretiene bastante el sistema de combate, pero hay poca variedad de enemigos, y en general es super repetitivo y lineal el juego.
<br>Lo mejor de las estapas, son las quests secundarias de resolver acertijos, son simples. pero le dan m&#xED;stica al juego, l&#xE1;stima que en los &#xFA;ltimos cap&#xED;tulos ya no hay de esto.
<br>El final es abrupto, los escenarios son tan prolijos, que no me hab&#xED;a dado cuenta que ya habia llegado al final boss. Un final amargo, pero interesante, eso si tiene 3 finales, 2 malos y uno bueno ;)
<br>
<br>Lo bueno:
<br>- Los protagonistas son muy divertidos, los di&#xE1;logos que tienen pueden sacarte risas.
<br>- Jugabilidad de pelea r&#xE1;pida y divertida.
<br>- Historia simple que cumple bien.
<br>
<br>Lo malo:
<br>
<br>- Mucha linealidad.
<br>- Armas muy iguales.
<br>- Poca variedad de enemigos.
<br>
<br>Lo recomiendo, pero cuando est&#xE9; en oferta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hunted-the-demons-forge/user-reviews?user_review_id=6296744">Expand</a></span>

Production values are high &#x2013; voice-acting, music, and graphics quality (Unreal 3) are good &#x2013; but can&#x2019;t make up for how boring the game becomes. Travel by corridor, enter an arena, fight a horde of enemies, rinse, repeat. There are a few side-dungeons and puzzles which add much-needed variety (and are well-designed). The story is your standard snarky-adventurers-battle-orcs affair, but it never goes into too much depth, almost as though it&#x2019;s only there as an excuse for the gameplay. Never a good sign. Oh, and if bikini warriors are something you like, one of the player-characters easily qualifies. If that&#x2019;s the kind of thing that annoys you, well, prepare to be annoyed.
<br>
<br>Designed to be &#x201C;king of co-op games,&#x201D; co-op unfortunately doesn&#x2019;t work since Gamespy was shut down. I&#x2019;ve read in the forums that third-party apps will still enable cooperative play, but this seems hit-or-miss, and I haven&#x2019;t tested it myself. Played solo, the campaign works well enough; your companion has plenty of health (though not invincible), and if powers are used consistently, the combat is easy. There is one tomb that bugs unless you play as the elf, as I discovered, and you can only switch between characters at specified points, and not at will (something that other co-op games manage without trouble). Magic feels a little cumbersome to use. Select the desired power using numbers 1-4 on your keyboard, and press Q to use the selected power. Why not have the number keys also use the power? It&#x2019;s an extra key-stroke that isn&#x2019;t appreciated in the heat of combat. There&#x2019;s a rudimentary skill set set and level-up system, but I collected so many points that upgrading was never something I thought much about.
<br>
<br>A word about the final boss. The archer-player needs to shoot the boss in the heart, while the sword &amp; shield player protects the archer from spawning enemies. When the heart-bar is depleted, the archer-player needs to shoot the enemy spawns, while the sword &amp; shield player pushes on some columns. This will need to be done three or four times. Played in co-op, I don&#x2019;t doubt it would work fine. Played solo, there is no way to issue orders to your companion, making victory rely on luck as much as skill. Frustrating.
<br>
<br>Hunted: The Demon&#x2019;s Forge is easily a $20 game if everything works as advertised. That it is for sale at a list price of $5 on Steam indicates to me that Bethesda is aware of the issues but can&#x2019;t be bothered to fix them, so the game is sold at a perpetual 75% discount. Worth a purchase IF you can get the co-op to work. For most of us, though, the time of Hunted: The Demon&#x2019;s Forge has passed, and it&#x2019;s not worth the asking price. Get it as cheap as possible if it tempts you, but be prepared to quickly move on to something else.
