I&apos;m not a huge Batman fan, but this game was so polished that I could see myself getting into the Batman world. As the name suggests, your Batman at the Arkham Asylum, returning the Joker for the umpteenth time, when he breaks free and all hell breaks loose. The inmates are released and you need to work your way through several notable characters before facing the Joker and his intricate plot. Some of the popular characters like the Penguin, Catwoman, Twoface, and Mr. Freeze are not in the game at all, but this was a great decision as to separate the game from the not so great movies.  The story flows and is interesting and I never felt like I was doing meaningless tasks just to advance the story. Everything was connected. The graphics look great and run smoothly, I never got any stuttering even when entering a new level. Audio was just what you would expect from a Batman game, everything sounded in place. From the whiz of the grapple gun to the swish of the cape. They even got some great voice actors for the cast. Batman is Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill as the Joker, and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn. These actors were from the animated cartoon series I watched from the early to mid 90&apos;s and to recognize and hear their voices just as they sounded almost 20 years ago really took me back. Those are the ones that stand out, but all of the voice acting was done well. The gameplay focuses on mostly taking down inmates but there is also a search and explore aspect. When attacking you chain together combo hits as well as countering incoming attacks. You also have several scenarios where you will have to use stealth to incapacitate thugs with guns. You can sneak up from behind and do a silent takedown as well as hang from a statue and do an inverted takedown. The combo system works well and as you gain experience you gain the abilities of an instant takedown or picking up a prisoner and using him as a projectile after connecting 5 combo hits. The controls are a bit of an issue here. When throwing a enemy you have to use the wasd controls to direct him instead of the mouse. So even if you have a shot lined up you have to direct it and it just gets confusing when your in the heat of battle. I wound up not using the throw for most of the game because of this. For the takedown you press shift and right click but you have a pretty short window of opportunity to do so and the right click is also bound as an aiming mechanism for your gadgets. So I when trying to do a takedown or contering a punch, sometimes I would be aiming my batarang for a second and then getting hit messing up my combos. These problems might be solved by using a controller but I don&apos;t have the Xbox360 controller listed in the control config and I didn&apos;t want to go through the hassle of setting up one with a PS2 controller with an adapter. The explore and collect part of the game is initiated by The Riddler who has hidden question mark trophies and puzzles across the island. The puzzles come in the form of riddles that you take &quot;pictures&quot; of using the detective mode to have a high tech look at your surroundings Collecting these will unlock character bios and detailed character trophies that you can look at from the main menu. There are also Arkham plaques that tell more of the history of the island and how it came to be an institution. All in all, this was a fantastic game and I highly recommend it. Even at full price you get your monies worth which is not something I felt like I have gotten in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716312">Expand</a></span>

A 10 is a perfect game that hits all the buttons and while Batman: Arkham Asylum is a really great game it does have its drawbacks. The combat is fluid and smooth, as well as the movement, grapple and gliding. The Graphics are great, the combos are excellently scripted and executed and the boss battles are unique. The game has tons of minigamers to enjoy, including riddler challenges and extra fight content as well as other stuff. Now for my small criticisms and why the game doesnt deserve a 10. One, the use of the detective skill is somewhat demeaning. They arent mysteries, more like follow this here, take picture, move on, Batman thinks through the rest. My 2nd qualm is the xray type vision you get. This is the single most exploitative and useful piece of equipment in the game. I love it and I hate it. It makes those beautiful takedowns too easy and I am always aware of everyone else&apos;s presence in a room. This really diminishes from the feectiveness of the challenge. Most people would say &quot;Wlel just dont use it&quot;, but its there. I dont agree with the assessment on the voice acting as the cold comments made by Batman and the great liners made by Joker and Harley were amusing. As well, I must defend this game from the idea of no-multiplayer. What doyou want, Joker fighting Batman in 1v1? Team plays? A multiplayer for this game would have been no more then a cheesy gimmick. My only other qualm was that the storyline was somewhat short. However, this isnt the fallback of the game, its more the experience of the gamer. People new to games or whom like to take this time could easily rack up 6-12 hours of gameplay while the traditional and experienced gamer could probably navigate the game in one sitting of 4-5 hours. However, thats only a minor drawback but it would have been fun to see more content. I hope that the sequel will be of as good quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=743219">Expand</a></span>

The porting is most obvious in the boss fights, when Mr. B. just doesn&apos;t do what you want him to do, standing/walking etc. when he is supposed to jump away.</span>

It&apos; so obvious that this game has created with batman love. Graphics are extraordinary and voices are brilliant. And game is long enough &quot;of course it&apos;s always not enough if you like this game&quot; and you want to play it again. Combat system is different from the arcade games we are used to. It&apos; so fun to kick 8 henchmen&apos;s ass at the same time. Beating them in the hard mode without getting a single hit satisfies the player. And this game has given the needed worth to the gadgets. Predator rooms may be boring at the beginning but after some time it complicates and it becomes interesting and fun to play. Riddles expands the games playing time of course and they can become really challenging. Atmosphere of the game can lessen in the middle of the game but the game is interesting enough and something takes your interest somewhere else for sure. And the only downside of the game that i can find are cut-scenes. This game offers you to become batman himself. I can easily say this is the best hero game ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=1358416">Expand</a></span>

However, I would recommend Arkham City, its successor, over this because it surpasses it on nearly every level.
<br>I am hardly the world&apos;s greatest Batman fan, so I was cautious at first, but I found the game absolutely stunning. It has a very solid overall feel to it in that it is very polished and the gameplay is tight. It simply never lets itself up at any point. The story is engaging (though I personally preferred Arkham City&apos;s), the stealth mechanics are excellent, the missions are designed very well, and the voice acting is top notch (Star Wars fans should take note that Mark Hamill seems to be speaking half the time you&apos;re playing). More importantly, though, it makes you feel like Batman. You can take on loads of enemies in a brawl, use a small variety of gadgets to help you through the levels, yet you are not invincible - this means you have to use Batman&apos;s traditional stealth in order to take on armed enemies.
<br>The combat system, though good, can be frustrating at times, because the counter mechanic feels very broken. Thankfully, it is fixed in Arkham City and your problems of failing to counter when clicking the button are all gone. Another problem I found in this game - though many may not care - is that it is very linear. Another combat problem is that taking on enemies from a high point, or from underground, is broken as a result of this being a PC port - I have the game on PS3 as well, and it works fine on that. Again, this is all fixed in Arkham City, so the cool takedowns where you pop up from underground and grab an enemy, or when you hang an enemy from a ledge, are back in the sequel. There are no side missions at all and there is no open world feel, despite you having the ability to wander around the island as you wish. I guess I&apos;m just a fan of non-linear games, so Arkham City&apos;s sidequests and exploration are of much appeal to me.
<br>Ultimately, this is a fantastic game but has a few important flaws. All is solved in the sequel, so if you must choose between the two I&apos;d go for the second one. Regardless, this game is top quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868132">Expand</a></span>

The villains are really well developed and the combat is very fun. The Riddle quests are really challenging too, and  is a good thing to go out of the primary campaign objectives. Besides that is a huge evolution in the games of super-heroes in general.</span>

The only people who would say such a thing are those who just don&apos;t like Batman or the game for some reason. I was never really a huge Batman fan, I don&apos;t read comics, and thought the movies are really good. Well this game is amazing. Even if you don&apos;t like Batman, give it a go. It&apos;s tons of fun, and addicting. I love the Joker in this as well, while it&apos;s no Heath Ledger, he IS played by Mark Hamil from Star Wars, and he does a FANTASTIC job. I use caps there because he really does. There is no excuse, at least get the demo. And also get the PC version, the PhysX are incredible. Dynamic Paper, Dynamic Fog... you can throw your Baterang at hanging banners and piece by piece shred it apart and make pieces fall down. Dynamic Bat Cape, destructible objects etc.... it makes the 360 version look last gen. Conclusion: BUY THIS GAME. 10/10 in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370220">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are great wish the story was longer but it makes me want the next one even more, the boss battles are pretty sweet. I highly recommend getting this game.</span>

I played this on PC because there was a sale on Steam but the graphics aren&apos;t quite good enough to justify PC vs console since the controls definitely suit a controller better than a mouse and keyboard.

Combat controls are very elegant and simple to grasp, but it is challenging because it is all about timing.  It is not a button masher by any means, you have to see your next move, then with one click or key stroke -- execute, then move onto the next.  I though it was brilliant and natural.  I wish more games approached melee and hand to hand combat in the manner that rockstar did with this game.  Graphics were amazing, voice acting was incredible and the art direction added to the atmosphere.  I don&apos;t usually give out 10&apos;s, but this one earned it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=1521785">Expand</a></span>

The controls and overall quality far overshadow any gripes though.</span>

                                        <span>One of the best games I&apos;ve played in a long time.  The story is fun, expansive, in-depth, and well crafted.  You come in with many encounters from many of DC&apos;s most infamous, and unique super villains.  The story took me about 12 hours to complete, and I still am having fun beating my scores in challenge mode and finding more secrets.  I would defiantly recommend this game to anyone.</span>

The characters are captivating and have benefited from 50 or so years of festering in the Batman universe. I am far from being a Batman fan but this is simply a great game in too many ways to ignore. Using the myriad of gadgets is fun as is the combat that is very responsive and allows you to string together combos with many moves. The stealth sequences where you have to take down armed thugs strategically especially impressed me. The game was however quite short (10 hours), there is DRM in the form of Windows Live, and progressing through the game&apos;s &quot;puzzles&quot; (i.e. rooms) is too easy. An all around extremely polished game that sets the bar high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2889891">Expand</a></span>

It truly makes the player feel like Batman, and brings out everything good about his character. The supervillians, so often portrayed as ridiculous parodies, feel like real people, tragically transformed into horrendous monsters that you must defeat. The gameplay is also amazing, smartly alternating between stealth, brawling, and other paradigms so that the game never gets boring. Fighting feels completely natural and looks beautiful. The game is extremely challenging on the highest difficulty, yet I never felt like I was cheated whenever I died; I only failed when I made a mistake. The game&apos;s only two faults are repetitive boss fights and the Windows Live requirement. Besides those two minor gripes, I cannot imagine a better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2554758">Expand</a></span>

An excellently atmospheric Assassin&apos;s Creed-esque adventure game held back by cookie cutter play-by-the-numbers recycled boss fights and a predictable game structure. Its a real shame that the bosses are so phoned in because its the only thing keeping this game from being excellent. I&apos;d highly recommend picking this up as long as you don&apos;t expect anything from the bosses going into them (I actually yelled at my computer at how lazily they were designed at one point).
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+Incredible attention to detail in all aspects of the game
<br>+Non-linear world that feels packed with things to do
<br>+Very fluid combat that is actually challenging on Hard
<br>+&quot;Puzzle rooms&quot; that don&apos;t involve pushing boxes
<br>+Balances stealth, combat, and platforming enjoyably
<br>+Crams in as much Batman lore as possible while keeping enough of it optional
<br>+Everything with Scarecrow
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Incredibly bad (lazy) bosses
<br>-Sometimes feels like &quot;Adventures in Crawling in Vents &amp; Kicking Grates: Batman Edition&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=6523535">Expand</a></span>

The freeflow combat system, originated from the AC series, is already perfected in this first game. You also get some gadgets for personalised fighting styles. Scripted stealth events and investigations are more emphasised in the first game during which you have to use the Detective Mode for clues, but the Mode is so powerful (you can see through all obstacles, find all the thugs in the room and the clues are highlighted) that I think all players spend most of time in it. It is tuned down in the sequel fortunately. Graphics and controls are very nicely optimised for PC.
<br>
<br>This game might not be as polished as its sequel Arkham City, but it is just as fun and as good in a different way. The way I see it, Asylum is made for hardcore Batman fans while City is made for mainstream gamers. You get a bunch of references of the Arkham Asylum comic. It is darker and is designed to make you feel isolated and helpless in a locked down Asylum. City is more about exploration and war on an epic scale (and personal struggles of Bruce Wayne). If you ask me which game is better, I&apos;d just ask you to play them both.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=6539991">Expand</a></span>

The game play however is good, but inflexible and linear. Once youve played the game for a few hours, you get the idea. The setup with its central area and riddler clues to pick up is a bit like Tony Hawks skating for Batman fans. Its good, but its not Half-life 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=739683">Expand</a></span>

And not to be a critic of a critic but I found the controls to be very simple from the start and the scarecrow area of the game may have been found tedious by some but I thought it gave it a classic feel in overcoming an old foe of batman. Also remarks about the AI in terms of the enemy not being able to see batman when hes right in front of them at times, but really? It&apos;s the Dark Knight and when combined with I don&apos;t know darkness he shouldnt be to easy to spot. Another possibility to such a minor complaint could possibly be to an easy gameplay setting, the AI will tend to look like an idiot in such cases.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=85745">Expand</a></span>

My complaints with the game, however, are that it focuses to much on boring, repetative collection side-quests (that are often ridiculously difficult to solve), some of the boss fights are unfair and unbalanced (and often tricks aren&apos;t explained until you miraculously figure them out after dying 20 times), and regular combat is reptative and you are forced into VERY unbalanced fights with no weapons other than your fists against 5 or more enemies. There are a number of choke points I ran into where I simply couldn&apos;t get past 5 to 8 enemies that all attacked me at once because mastering the fighting system is a challenge for all but the most veteran of players with all but the fastest reflexes. Difficulty curve was, simply, a little to challenging. I also really, really, really hate completing a section and being forced to revisit it for an old gadget that was impossible to access the first time through, or simply to try and track down a boss for a third time. Revisiting old sections is really boring, and you have to do it ALOT with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=743305">Expand</a></span>

I have played this game 4 times because its that good. The only flaw that people would say is Games For Windows Live, as always. A problem that needs to not excist anymore.</span>

PC is the definitive platform and the gameplay is smooth and satisfying.  You&apos;ll replay it at least twice.  What started as a $10 whim is now on my all time best list and I&apos;ve pre-ordered Arkham City.</span>

The game play is fairly fun but eventually becomes too much of a button masher, while it does look cool to bash the crap out of a mob of bad dudes it unfortunately runs on autopilot most of the time. The story is pretty basic but works decently, the main problem I have with it is the same problem I have with most comic book &apos;franchises&apos; in that as it is a franchise there never seems to be an end, we know that batman is never going to die (if he did they will just bring him back to life), he will never totally defeat his enemies either, they will always come back again and again which does water down the story&apos;s significance.

<br>
<br>Bottom line, even as a marginal batman fan (only batman I ever liked was Frank Millers The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel) you are going to get something out of this.  The force that is Batman is communicated here but mostly graphically.  For those of us who enjoy sandbox the gameplay is incredibly claustrophobic.  But in a puzzle-like way which is why it works.  At least for the gazillion people who gave it a 10 here.  You get strung along in extremely linear fashion with some gratifying puzzle-like play in your attempts to complete level challenges and bosses.  I can&apos;t really stress how claustrophobic progression is though.  The gratification for completing this game is equivalent to reading a book.  You want to complete the story rather than experience the awesome gameplay.  And I guess thats what divides us gamers, those who want a mild challenge with more story and those who want an insane challenge with no story.  So to sum up my review, if you know what type of gamer you are you should definitively know whether you  will enjoy this game to the fullest, or not.  If you are man enough to admit you are a softcore gamer and would enjoy this go for it.  Otherwise steer clear because you will be filled with mostly, contempt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=3299444">Expand</a></span>

Everything from Freeflow combat to Silent takedowns makes you feel like you are in the dark knights boots. The replay value in this game is probably one of the best reasons to have this game. Silent Predator, and Freeflow combat challenges makes this game very replayable especially with leaderboards. Also the most recent free download content made it even better with an infinite freeflow combat challenge and an extra silent predator map. The only reason i didn&apos;t give this a perfect score is, 1. the A.I. isn&apos;t too bright. You could take someone out while you&apos;re in their peripheral vision and their partner would completely ignore you. 2. No manual save point. I would like to go back and fight bosses just for fun, but with the auto save feature once you&apos;re done a boss you won&apos;t see them until you run through the game again. If you are a fan of action, or even espionage games Batman: Arkham Asylum is definitely a must buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=85470">Expand</a></span>

While the combat system appears simple at first, and is very accesible, it has a hidden depth. As you learn and gain experience in using it, you will find Batman&apos;s combat abilities increase substantially. If you love comic books, martial arts, or first person sneaker games generally, don&apos;t miss this one!</span>

I had bad expectations I was just very bored. But the game surprised me. Environment is interactive, boss fights are VERY well made, I loved how could I use the behemoths on my side. It was really-really fun. Voiceacting is good, graphics are extremely good BUT (and this is what is the biggest pain for me) in the 90% of the game I had to use detective mode so I couldn&apos;t enjoy the fantastic visual world. Another thing: Batman is a pussy. :S It was very annoying when 3 armed thugs could shred me to bits if I confront them in the open. I wished I had an AK47 or something like that. OK Batman does not kill anyone but a tranqulizer gun would be very handy. All in all it was a nice game with a fair length. It was also enough, 2 last fights exhausted me completely. Nice game, I recommend it to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=746694">Expand</a></span>

Even after the story was finished, as it were, collecting the Riddler&apos;s riddles and trophies added the fun. But the game had a few flaws in my eyes. The actual story mode including the riddles was very short and while this isn&apos;t too unbearable, the challenge modes are. While the stealth was fun, you feel you don&apos;t want to do it again because it would be too samey, but challenge mode is just redoing all the major stealth and combat scenes and I found it quite tedious. In summary, gameplay is great, graphics are good, storyline is OK due to its length. But for &#xA3;30, I&apos;m not sure if it was such a great idea to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=737762">Expand</a></span>

Extremely well balanced gameplay between adventure, action and strategy with well designed camera angles, control schemes and in-game displays. One can actually feel that he&apos;s not playing Batman, but IS batman. Combat is top notch, the plot is linear in a scripted sense, but really open in the way one can choose to approach it via multiple paths and playing with different tactics. Inclusion of the multiple foes from the Batman&apos;s Rogues Gallery into a single game does great, and does not upset the pacing and balance in the game, especially in contrast with most superhero movies that contains multiple villains. Lots of in-game references to the Batman mythology for the fans. There are even some Easter eggs for the acute observer. The overall experience this game has provided me is unmatched by anything I have played so far. In my opinion, easily the best game of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=85099">Expand</a></span>

Yes the game is only single player but its a quality game and a lot of shops are already marking down the price of the game. SO end story if you are interested in Batman its worth buying for sure. P.S. The graphics are awesome but for ATI people out there you cant use the PhyX Engine by Nvidia.

Of all the games I&apos;ve played in 2009 this one stands above them all, especially on the PC with all the disappointing console ports that has been manufactured lately. The whole game is a piece of art and is very fun to play. Highly recommended.</span>

I&apos;ve finished playing through the story mode (Normal difficulty), all the riddles and I&apos;m still engaged in the challenge mode. Am I bored? Not even a little bit. Will I play it a second time? Certainly YES (want to try Hard mode) and maybe even a 3rd or 4th. Everyone in game industry should learn how to treat a license and a fan-base with the same respect the developers treated this game. No true game player or Batman fan should miss this game. Graphics: Very good graphics, using the Unreal Engine 3 (same from Bioshock and Gears of War). Very detailed environments and excellent character designs. Sound: I loved the sound effects for Batman&apos;s gadgets. The music is not the theme from the movies or the animated series, but is very good and atmospheric. Gameplay: Very easy to pick up but somewhat difficult to master. What I liked is how the game constantly forces you to change tactics. (Ex: when you get used to engage enemies silently by jumping over gargoyles in the walls they plant some bombs on them). I never got bored playing it. Replay: You will want to play through it again the very moment you get to the end. Extras: The characters profiles, interviews, trophies, the riddles, puzzles, challenge mode, etc. Very entertaining. The developers really put a lot of effort in making this title. I played the PC version (the game requirements are very reasonable for an average gamer) but I&apos;m sure the PS3 and X360 owners won&apos;t be disappointed buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=738240">Expand</a></span>

Although the combat is a bit of a button masher it has enough complexity to it to make it entertaining, challenging, rewarding. Totally worth every cent; go but it, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span>

But Rocksteady might be as big Batman fans as we are, and this game is a proof of it. The atmosphere, storytelling, combat-system, stealth elements, gameplay and overall presentation is top notch. Look forward to this masterpiece.</span>

Stunning combat featuring unique camera angles giving it that all important super hero theme. It portrays an epic storyline and features the greatest Batman villain of all time, the Joker. Not usually my style of game, yet it seems to have that truly great feel to it.</span>

I have to say that this is a good game because of the stealth sections and memorable scarecrow sections. The combat flows smoothly and is kept interesting with having  a few different guards with varying weapons and ways to deal with them. However, I felt that the bosses were poor as most of them just looked down from their ivory tower while you just deal with more guards. Only one of them didn&apos;t follow this trend, which is disappointing as I would have liked more variety.  At the games current price it is worth a try, but I would have been hesitant to recommend it at full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557320">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Best superhero game ever, there was a lot of gameplay variety, and it was not too difficult. it was fun to try to get all challenges. the graphics were not the best I&apos;ve ever seen, but it was not very bad to see. I think the bigger monsters / bosses were the best since a long time in game everytime. Now I expect many of the successor of this game.

The combat is not deprived of depth but it is definitely repetitive. The stealth sessions are solid . The platforming and puzzles are shallow but do a descent job of breaking the monotony of combat . The story is serviceable and the visuals are immersive. This is a pretty good game, nothing more. Arkham Asylum is longer than its sequel, and sports superior pacing and narrative. Definitely play it if you enjoy Batman and give it a try if you are curious. That said, if you were not interested in the first place, you haven&apos;t missed much. This game is vastly overrated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=5900422">Expand</a></span>

I just recently got around to it, and frankly I am dumbfounded looking at some of the ratings it&apos;s gotten. I wanted to like it, I really did but it&apos;s been quite some time since a video game has left me so bored, and I don&apos;t think I have ever played anything more overrated. (Except maybe the Halo series or Borderlands)
<br>
<br>The level design is bland and uninspired. The combat system is oversimplified. The enemy AI is utterly braindead. Many of the early fights you can win even if you close your eyes and just start tapping the strike and counter buttons randomly, and I&apos;m not exaggerating. Try it and you&apos;ll see what I mean.
<br>
<br>All we have here in Batman Arkham Asylum is painfully linear button-masher that has very little real substance. It&apos;s a game that younger, casual console gamers will have a blast with. You get non-stop action with no thought required whatsoever. If that&apos;s your thing, go for it.
<br>
<br>In all fairness I need to point out that for a 2009 game, most of the visuals are pretty decent. Some of the character models are not that well done, but overall it is not a bad looking game. The voice acting for Batman and Joker are excellent, but most of the other voices aren&apos;t anything special.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m glad I was able to get my copy of this for free, I would have been pretty upset if I had to spend money on this turd. Like I said, I wanted to like it and I really tried but it&apos;s just not a very good game IMHO. I ended up deleting it to save some hard drive space, because I know for sure that I will never be playing this one again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=3153356">Expand</a></span>

The game has alot of interesting concepts like the whole enemy blood pressure and fear levels, but they don&apos;t really affect the gameplay. The whole gliding system is great, as well as the grapple system. The gme isn&apos;t fluid enough in my opinion though, whenever you fight the venom soldiers, you are in an arena type place, and you always kill them the same way, whenever you are fighting armed enemies, you are in a large room with gargoyles on the roof. Whenever you fight unarmed enemies, it becomes more of a button masher than a gadget game. The storyline is total garbage. It uses GFWL, but has no multiplayer, which is just retarded. They tried to use the scarecrow to add a FEAR, type gameplay, but then they just turned the scarecrow levels into a minigame which is really boring. The game could have been aot better if they had thought it through a little more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=85191">Expand</a></span>

Some weird design decisions drag this game down for me.The story is not egaging enough to hide just how linear the game play is. Graphics are ok with out being anything special. The fight animations are fantastic. I am uninstalling it at 43% as I am finding it tedious.</span>

This Batman game takes the implausibility and inaccuracy of the cartoon and does it up in the &quot;adult&quot; visuals of the new Batman movies. In the most contrived story yet, Joker springs many of the major supervillains from Arkham, forcing Batman to pit himself against the Joker, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Bane (whom he hardly landed a successful punch on in the comic), Zsasz, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and hundreds of muscular armed thugs and men pumped up with super soldier serum all in the same night. Never mind the fact that Bruce Wayne nearly died after putting the same number of petty criminals away over the course of 3 weeks back in 1993 (when his back was broken by Bane, who is more like 6&apos;2&quot; and 250 pounds than the 5&apos;6&quot; 140 pounds the game lists him as). Gameplay consists of Assassin&apos;s Creed in a Batman setting with limited God of War upgrades and boss battles. In other words it&apos;s like every other beat &apos;em up/adventure game in the past 5 years. The graphics are okay, not pressing the envelope by any circumstances, since its development was stunted by multi-console development. Lip synching is truly terrible and many of the models look like they stepped out of Doom 3 (2004). Music consists of orchestral hits and people thrumming back and forth on string ensemble constantly. The story is terrible, the gameplay is derivative, the graphics are nothing special, the music is boring, but throughout it all Eidos has managed to put together an actual functional Batman game and let hype and tasteless masses fill in the blanks. There is fun to be had here... For about 12 hours. I got the game this morning and beat it this evening, 75% complete. I could probably spend about 5 or 6 more hours collecting the remaining Riddler trophies and challenges, but micromanagement for &quot;achievements&quot; is not my idea of fun (especially on PC where &quot;gamer point&quot; systems are less visible). Your mileage may vary if you enjoy running around empty landscapes and watching the same animations over and over in an attempt to gain virtual credentials. Overall, the experience was not completely awful, and made today barely more entertaining, but it was nothing groundbreaking, hardly worthy of the hype it&apos;s receiving, and I probably won&apos;t pick it up again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-asylum/user-reviews?user_review_id=84723">Expand</a></span>
