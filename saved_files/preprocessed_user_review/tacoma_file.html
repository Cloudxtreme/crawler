<br>
<br>That this is not a game is quite aparent from the very start. It is a &quot;kind of&quot; novel unfolding progressively as you progress the very limited environment. A space station (just like a family home) is a limited space by nature - so i never really felt like really exploring freely - but rather trying to &quot;fondle&quot; every single object that i was allowed to manipulate .. a bit like older point and click adventures.
<br>
<br>Now here is my problem with the game. Like Gone Home - this game is based on a natural environment - and extremely HIGH detail (not as in shaders or normal mapping or such - but in terms of content) ... I want furniture to be accessible - and not just empty - but filled with &quot;stuff&quot; - anything else would feel staged and sterile.
<br>
<br>And sterile is about the core of the problem. The game feels empty - and not lived in at all to me. I can see the recordings of the previous inhabitants ... but they felts empty... . Maybe it was just me, but i never got the feeling of an actual living being. Gone Home did it better - but had to focus on fewer characters of course ... and a much more relatable story. But even small games like Orwell or even Papers Please manage to stir up the imagination about &quot;what kind of person we are dealing with&quot; better than Tacoma.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>Is that a bad game? no .... well aside from rather being a novel than a game anyway (and i actually do enjoy such games) ... does it stand out in any way? .. sadly no. It is completely average. Neither the visuals, nor the story or storytelling is outstanding.
<br>
<br>I find it hard to pin point it - maybe it is the novelty or the more familiar setting. I had a lot of fun going through the countless cupboards and drawers of Gone Home - but felt almost annoyed clicking on stuff in Tacoma.
<br>It somehow misses the mark - maybe because there are so many &quot;abandoned space station&quot; settings around - while there were actually not too many &quot;abandoned suburban home&quot; settings around (at least none without ghosts or zombies ... )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tacoma/user-reviews?user_review_id=7445852">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I also normally do not care who makes the video games, but I have an issue when their politics affects the games that are made. Which is an issue I have with this game, and it isn&apos;t surprising if you know the personality of the creator of The Fullbright Company, Steve Gaynor. Both Tacoma and Gone Home are terrible, not by design, but by the intent behind them: to push a political agenda. It wasn&apos;t as bad in Gone Home (the problem with that game was that it was marketed and sold as a horror game, obviously it&apos;s not), but judging by Tacoma, the company&apos;s future games will only be worse.
<br>
<br>Do not support video game companies like this one and Beamdog, who care more about agendas than making good video games. (Beamdog&apos;s baldur&apos;s gate siege of dragonspear is absolutely terrible, even worse than Tacoma in pushing an agenda. Not to mention the content they added to an already amazing game (Baldur&apos;s Gate 2) is trash-tier fan fiction)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tacoma/user-reviews?user_review_id=7446619">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. The FOV slider doesn&apos;t go far enough, making the game very difficult to play when sitting up close to my monitor. Additionally, the in game menus you can access are way too close to the players face, and they do not scale accordingly when you change the FOV.
<br>
<br>As for the game itself, I think it depends on if you actually like the &apos;walking simulator&apos; genre. If you already hate the genre, then there&apos;s no point in buying this game, but if you like these sort of games, then you&apos;ll probably end up liking it. I don&apos;t want to spoil the game in any way, so I won&apos;t go into more detail about the plot.
<br>
<br>I was planning on giving this game a 7/10, however it&apos;s clear that people are metabombing this title, so I bumped it up to a 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tacoma/user-reviews?user_review_id=7447505">Expand</a></span>

My only issue with the game (and I know many have this debate) is that I feel it should have been $15 instead of $20.
<br>
<br>I hate the idea that a video game should be as long as possible, or packed full of as many meaningless menial tasks as possible, so as to arbitrarily justify the dollar value. However, This is a game that clocks in at under 2 hours, and while in my opinion it ran well, was nice to look at, good voice acting, and had a very interesting story to tell. I just find it hard to say it was an amazing experience at that price point. I feel it is a nice 8-8.5 game, that could have been a must buy, if you just cut the price in half.
<br>
<br>I do hope that Fullbright continue their quest to provide very intriguing story based mystery titles at a length that is easily digestible. However, I also feel they need to possibly find a way to speed up their creation time and nail a slightly lower price for their offerings.
<br>
<br>As is, I still feel the game was very very good. I enjoyed every second playing it, where I honestly only felt that I became more interested as it went on. However, I was sad when it ended, because it felt like the tale would be a bit longer, and the &quot;twist&quot; ending was not really the most interesting left turn (almost feeling like it was supposed to leave room for a sequel or expansion).
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even want to get into the discussion of what constitutes a &quot;game&quot;, because it is dumb. Everything from story, to acting (if included), to production design, style, mise en scene, everything, they are all considered alongside gameplay as to what a video game is. So, yes, this is a video game, a very good one at that.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, the story is great, the character development and mystery hooked me, and I loved what I played. However, I would have loved another 15 or 20 minutes, or just some other spin before the ending that could have really pulled the game up into the 9&apos;s for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tacoma/user-reviews?user_review_id=7446330">Expand</a></span>
