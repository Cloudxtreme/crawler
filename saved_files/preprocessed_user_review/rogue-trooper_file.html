Picking this up on budget last week (it&apos;s Feb 2009 as I type this) I realised that I&apos;d made a huge mistake! Yes it&apos;s showing its age now even when ramped up to the max with lots of AA and AF, but Rogue Trooper is one of the most fun games I&apos;ve played in years. It just oozes playability! Rogue Trooper is a real no-nonsense shooter with plenty of options on how to approach the game and nothing (yes nothing!) but really nicely designed levels. The biochip banter made me contantly smile as it&apos;s so well realised from the comics. I laughed out loud when I&apos;d placed gunner on his own and he was cheerily gunning Norts down whilst I was creeping about stealthily knifing my way through the rest. As a 3rd person game I experienced no problems with the camera at all and Rogue fades in and out so you can always see what you&apos;re doing no bother. Yes it contains an on rails section but you know what, it was bl**dy good fun and I say that as someone who normally hates on rails sections with a passion! Finally onto the music. I play games with my Sony MDR V6 headphones on and the film style soundtrack is incredible! Seriously the detail and atmosphere that provides the game with was just jaw dropping. All in all it&apos;s just one incredibly fun game that you&apos;ll find yourself replaying time and time again trying to beat it in different ways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-trooper/user-reviews?user_review_id=422144">Expand</a></span>

The inventory system is superb and a lot less &apos;arcade&apos; like than the usual health pacs and power pills.

I decided to pick it up anyway, being an on-off fan of the comic. I was resolved to an average shooter, marked out from the crowd only by its setting. It was a pleasant surprise, then, to find that Rogue Trooper offers a very polished, fun blast through one of the most popular 2000AD battlefields. Lifting itself nicely above the average in the process. The intro cutscene and Quartz Zone Massacre level really bring to life the Rogue Trooper universe. Helm, Gunnar and Bagman are introduced, and find their way to each bio-chip slot in your kit (pleasingly blas&#xE9; about their predicament post-mortem). The mechanics of each buddy&apos;s contribution to your Nort-killing power are well realised and integrated into the genre of the game, though there&apos;s a feeling more could&apos;ve been done to really bring out this angle. The close-combat stealth kills are nicely visceral, varied enough, and pay homage to the brutal antics of the Rogue from the comics. Graphics are nice&apos;n&apos;shiny. The game looks lovely with a bit of anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering; and the look is a good balance between stylised comicbook and a more realist approach. Sound is pleasingly chunky, the chattering of Rogue&apos;s GI rifle providing a thought of &quot;yeah, THIS is how I imagined it would sound&quot; when first heard. The voice actors give solid performances throughout, playing their roles with a healthy dose of melodrama and caricature. The soundtrack is a good, quirky techno affair; very atomspheric. All this adds up to a quality product that Rebellion can certainly be proud of (doubly-so considering the seemingly tiny team that worked on the game). Inevitably we move on to the negatives though. Level design suffers a fair bit from linearity. One or two alternative routes are offered here and there, but you&apos;ll find yourself funnelled most of the time. Gameplay can become a little repetitive in the latter stages, though this is broken up a little by a couple of on-rails sections (which work pretty well, those of you groaning at their mere mention). Neveretheless you can find yourself defaulting to a standard style of run-and-gun, rendering Helm&apos;s holographic distraction, Bagman&apos;s micro-mine ambushes and the like somewhat redundant. So, what we have is a fine offering to fans of the comic (certainly head and shoulders above Dredd vs Death), and a commendable action game for those to whom things like &quot;The Scheme&apos;s The Thing!&quot; and &quot;Venus Bluegenes&quot; hold no meaning. Let&apos;s hope it does well enough to justify an expansion pack or sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-trooper/user-reviews?user_review_id=387383">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is a mix of third person stealth and action, and in most situations you can make that choice yourself (though I found stealth to be the path of least resistance most of the time). It has one of the best cover systems I&apos;ve seen - dirt simple to use, but it behaves exactly as you&apos;d expect whether you are sneaking along obstacles, shooting around them, or shoulder-rolling from one to the next. The levels tend to feel like linear segments connecting very dynamic &quot;encounters,&quot; where the real action happens. Most of these encounters feel organic, allowing for a variety of tactics which complement your refreshingly varied bag of tricks. Rarely do you feel as though you are &quot;supposed to&quot; use a particular strategy to defeat a given challenge. Finding something that works for you in the heat of the moment is a very rewarding experience, and facilitating this situation is what this game does better than most. The graphics look good, with a unique stylization, and the audio is top-notch. The voice acting in particular is very good, and if you can get into the kitschyness of the story it&apos;s a lot of fun. I&apos;ve heard many complain that the game is too short, but it was actually about right for me, and the pacing was solid throughout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-trooper/user-reviews?user_review_id=414769">Expand</a></span>

In summary: PROS - Faithful to story - I followed Rogue in the late 1980&apos;s QC reprint. CONS - 1) The 3rd person perspective takes a bit of getting used to when you were raised on CastleWolfenstein 3D/Doom 2) The graphics are not on par with HL2 or FC 3) It feels like a console game.... 4) Far too short - quick development cycle no doubt - game to market. Overall great fun - worth a purchase on eBay and a must for 2000AD fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-trooper/user-reviews?user_review_id=393335">Expand</a></span>

Rogue Trooper is still a great play for the money and is available for a very good price on Steam.</span>

Rogue&apos;s different from other protagonists. Implemented next gen features such as: A slick cover system, solid controls, and a mighty fine AI. It&apos;s his dynamic, and I&apos;ll be if it isn&apos;t one of the most original, and creative I&apos;ve ever seen.</span>

While the new mechanics make it fun the first time through, I never had the patience to sit through the game again. The story is not bad, though.</span>
