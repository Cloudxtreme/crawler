If you like it rough, bloody, real, sexy and combo system that puts ypu into the fight like no other MMO. THis is the MMO which takes a bit of skill to play. Some of the reviews here are old as hell and do not reflect the game as it istands today. The game has been massively over hauled. Population ios going up and up due to the recent massive changes to make the combat more skill based by making CC combos also. This making the combat more fluid and let crowd control going on. I cannot think of any other MMO that makes you feel combat like AoC and on top of that. The graphic are hands down the best in the genre. No other MMO comes close though its recommended to have at least 3-4gb of ram. I don&apos;t want to spend all day wrioting reviews but it makes me sick to see all the negative reviews here from people  from years ago who have helped to keep this ORIGINAL MMO down. Nothing offers what AoC offers. In a sea of boring MMO&apos;s this MMO has the most imortant element in spades, and that is Gameplay. My Official Score is 9 but I am giving it a 10 on the board! If you are sitting on the fence go and buy RISE OF THE GODSLAYER and enjoy this game. No one should miss playing through to level 80 on  at least one class of the 12 AoC offers. They are all uniue and far superiour to the hollow versions to get in cheap games like WoW and Rift. Whats on offer? Necro Mancers with 8 pets! .. Demonologists with demon slaves... Assassins with duel daggers, Rangers, Barbarians, Bear Shaman (Twi hander hammer Priest), Tempest of Set, Priest of Mitra, Heral of Xotli, Dark Templars, Guardians and Conqeurors.  When you reach the level cap in AoC you will find plenty to do also, and that also goes for solo content. There are T1 T2 T3 T4 dungeons but you can also do hard Mode Khitain dungeons for Epic loot (Best Epic Loot in the game) or you can solo grond for a faction Set. There are 5 PvP arenas, and servers offer full world PvP or PvE servers. I think I have covered most things. Simply the best MMO in MMO history bar none!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-rise-of-the-godslayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=1623711">Expand</a></span>

Will keep you entertained for quite a while and offers some interesting features. Age of Conan always had a ton of potential in my opinion, but today it feels like the devs don&apos;t care about it anymore. Today I had to delete one of my chars because of a bug. I was trapped in a chamber and the mob that was supposed to drop the key, did not drop it. So I was stuck there, couldn&apos;t teleport out, re-logging didn&apos;t help. I sent a ticket and even brought up enough patience to wait 6 hours (while doing some other stuff). I never got a response. Worst of all, I cannot even post on the forums to inform FunCom of this, for whatever reason, I do not have the authority to create or post in an existing thread. I had to delete my character, because there was nothing I could do, honestly. That did it for me. I&apos;m not touching this game anymore, knowing that it is perfectly possible to lose everything you&apos;ve achieved. Neither are my friends, now that I had to delete my char, they didn&apos;t feel like continuing playing without me. A good game, with potential, but the devs don&apos;t care anymore. Zero dedication.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-conan-rise-of-the-godslayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=2843816">Expand</a></span>
