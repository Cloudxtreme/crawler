The big additions to the game are mega towers (their answer to not expanding the city size). Omega. An addictive substance that causes mass pollution and The Academy; a place for research.  Really, once you have tried those, there is not much else. Omega is especially one of those things you need to dedicate most of a city to. The footprints for the mega towers are so enourmous that they become hard to find spaces for. Especially in some of Sim City&apos;s already cramped maps. And there are the bugs. Bugs that have existed since release are still around. Despite it supposedly being patched, I still watch various trucks try to deliver to the same place. Mega towers seem to cause everything to wildly fluctuate in a way that doesn&apos;t make sense. Even if you have enough to support it.  Overall not enough was fixed or added for me to want to play with what the majority of this expansion adds on a regular basis.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877938">Expand</a></span>

If had the pleasure of playing SimCity when Maxis and Will were in charge you will feel the same way too. I love all the simcites prior to Socieities and Simicty 5.  They ruined the Sims. To them its more about money than it is having people enjoy a good quality game. We love simcity for the sheer enjoyment of allowing our imaginations and design run wild. Well they nerfed that in this game.

<br>
<br>That being said lets head over to this game bearing the name Sim City. They managed to destroy one of the best gaming franchises in existence of gaming history. City size plots no bigger than a couple of football pitches, they should call it Sim Neighborhood (of a small town). Broken game mechanics and trying to hide it with all kinds of in-game lies. Well I guess I can go into extreme detail but I&apos;m not in the mood to even bother with this one to much. You&apos;ll see enough reviews and extended comments around the net.
<br>
<br>O and one other tip, don&apos;t EVER buy a game from EA EVER again. EA, known for bringing out utterly broken money leaching games for the last couple of years, throws in over a dozen DLC&apos;s for ridiculous prices only to fix an already broken game to a tat less broken.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=4426298">Expand</a></span>

There are still no bigger cities possible, no terraforming etc. Those supertowers are bugged as hell (at least here shows Maxis/EA consequent &quot;design&quot;). The Sims living in the tower complain about no jobs and no shopping. Right above them is a shopping complex which complains about having no customers. And right above the shopping complex is an office complex which complain about not having any employees. Those 3 problems are in one single building. This was only one example. The AI in this game is so pathetic that Maxis/EA obviously chose the greedy easy way to squeeze even more money out of a completely ruined franchise. The game that Klimax32 must be a different one than SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow (better title: SimCity: now even worse), or he is paid by EA.

All the restrictions are still in place  tiny cities and always on DRM that is  to say the very least  temperamental  then this expansion pack (ahem really  calling it an expansion pack with this little content?) is  to coin a phrase &quot;polishing a turd&quot;.
<br>
<br>It does help balance the game for single players (i.e 95% of the community) by making cities viable as specialists meaning you could consider some of the larger worlds with multiple cities as dispersed &quot;city like2 structures as opposed to  playing in the small villages the game offers as standard.
<br>
<br>But this is a patch worth of improvement  barely worth $4.99 as a download only DLC. The pretty new graphics are incongruous to say the least and I would rather they weren&apos;t there at all. They don&apos;t overlay every structure and are so stylized and &quot;niche&quot;. A 50&apos;s style view of the future maybe? Don&apos;t know  but I don&apos;t like it.
<br>
<br>Very poor. For the game to now be over 9 months old with the same main issues it had at launch day speaks volumes for how much EA give a damn about this franchise&apos;s loyal player base. Back to Cities in Motion 2 and Sim City 4 for me.
<br>
<br>This is overpriced. Too little too late and leaves the major errors firmly in place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3869553">Expand</a></span>

I buy the expansion, then I have to restart my launcher twice, then I get a horrible unskippable cutscene (their terrible promotional trailer is actually an unskippable intro cutscene, too!), only to find it&apos;s the same horrible, dreadful, nearly unplayable game with a few extra building types that don&apos;t do much.</span>

On the surface you would be forgiven for thinking the additions were just cosmetic, but in fact they add new dimensions to building up your city and are somewhat interdependent. Transitioning my vanilla city to megatowers was not as easy as I thought it would be and there were some precarious moments where my economy went into a freefall deathspiral requiring quick intervention. You have to carefully plan your towers because once you have built a level you cannot change it unless you demolish all the levels above it, and you are limited to 8 megatowers with 8 levels each on a given map. There are lots of choices as to what you can put in a megatower which gets you thinking in a new dimension other than planning zones.
<br>
<br>At the same time you can convert your industry to OmegaCo, however this requires expensive Oil, Ore and Processors to keep running, and unless you have a strong industry a venture into this project can quickly sink your city but the potential profits make you want to try nonetheless.
<br>
<br>The Academy gives you a good reason to have wealthy residents (which you could almost make do without before), as you need them to keep your ControlNet running and you can unlock lots of research projects that improve the things you can do with Omega and Megatowers.
<br>
<br>The downside to all this is that before you really had to think about what the &apos;character&apos; of your city was going to be. Was it going to be an industry-heavy city, or a research city or just a suburb for the wealthy, whereas now your city wants to be all those things. Sure you can have your cake and you can eat it, but the problem is that once you have built your first super-city of the future you are unlikely going to want to do it all over again just to get the same outcome.
<br>
<br>Overall this does what an expansion pack should do, it will bring you back to the game for a while and breathe some new life into it. Unfortunately the patient is still frail, and I doubt I will still be playing this in two weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3769674">Expand</a></span>

<br>All inn all a good buy, but if you want to keep your morals intact steer clear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773190">Expand</a></span>

After a fascinating and informative cutscene that cleverly explains the new features clearly, (AND IS ALWAYS SKIPPABLE, not sure why GwionBach provides that misinformation) I was ingame creating &quot;New Vegas&quot; with zero server instability whatsover. NO VANILLA NIGHTMARES haha!
<br>
<br>With a fresh city, you&apos;ll quickly discover the futuristic parks transform all nearby territory including buildings and roads, making them look neon and sweet. Maxis once again did a stellar job with the futuristic art concepts and graphics. Updates abound and traffic is less of a problem, your sims seem to sleep at night, leaving the roads available for whatever service trucks you having running around.
<br>
<br>The expansion feels more mission and morality based this time around, greed is actually technologically advantageous and fuels your cities with profit, but at some insidious costs later on. Green technology is the other avenue you&apos;re invited to explore, but at the burdon of being expensive and timely to research. Play this Yin/Yang correctly and the possibility is there to create a sim Utopia. Worth mentioning is this expansions feels MORE DIFFICULT, I&apos;ve failed my first few cities so far on the desert-schemed Desolation map, but am still hopeful because of regional benefits of the failed cities!
<br>
<br>The mega-towers are sweet, you can customize them to suite your current sim needs. All the futuristic upgrades are satisfying always with that Maxis charm since playing SimCity on the Super Nintendo.
<br>
<br>Awesome graphics, enhanced futuristic sound track, smart and applicable future concepts, stable servers, and a more cerebral experience overall, this game is worth the money, and forces you to think strategically, and resourcefully. Good luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3770908">Expand</a></span>

You can add residents, offices, malls, parks, a school, and other things. Commuters come and go from the tower which is fun to watch. There are some bugs or confusion on different aspects of the towers, but nothing game breaking. The graphics got a nice upgrade. You can even carry the new monorail looking thing (train tracks above the ground) to non COT cities if you own the expansion by buying control net from your COT cities.

This really helps getting a higher population because of smaller maps which they said can&apos;t be fixed. The mag train is kinda nice as well to help alleviate some traffic issues. Unfortunately you are limited to 8 (i think) towers per city. There are other advancements as well to power, sewer, trade port, police and such.

<br>I think this expansion pack is must for all SimCity owners. It diffidently makes the game more playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3769160">Expand</a></span>

They have solved some of the issues like having police/fire drones which don&apos;t have to sit in traffic.  Mega Towers create a much easier way to manage your population/jobs numbers.  Overall it was definitely worth the price of the expansion.  Now granted, I am one of those people that would love to see bigger cities but the lead developer did post and say that they had a team working on it and it wasn&apos;t feasible because the majority of peoples computers wouldn&apos;t be able to run it.  I can understand that because there is a LOT of animation in the game for each building.  So, I&apos;m chalking the smaller city thing up to a design choice and deciding to accept it.  Additionally, there are a few bugs that I&apos;ve encountered.  I&apos;m not marking off for those bugs because the developers have been very responsive in resolving those issues since launch and like almost all video game content some bugs are expected.  Hopefully they will be resolved very soon but even with the bugs they&apos;re not deal breakers.  The game is still a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/simcity-cities-of-tomorrow-expansion-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=3778762">Expand</a></span>

In the 90&apos;s we got used to big cities in sim city, then they take several steps back and produce this junk. What a shame.</span>
