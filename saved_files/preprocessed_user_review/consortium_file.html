This game isn&apos;t as great as some AAA FPS/RPG hybrids out there but it&apos;s not a bad effort by an indie development house.</span>

<br>
<br>In particular the first time through is quite exciting. Although you&apos;re on rails, of course, it&apos;s not always obvious where the rails are. Replaying the game to find the ways in which scenes can be altered is fun, but also bittersweet because you&apos;ll see the limits of what was possible.
<br>
<br>The voice acting and direction are both excellent, and are critical to the experience (this game would not be nearly as interesting without the voice acting).
<br>
<br>I feel it deserves a 10 not because it&apos;s perfect (it isn&apos;t, not even close), but because it really is a &quot;must-play&quot; for fans of the genre. Play CONSORTIUM, and wonder about what&apos;s possible for this medium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383762">Expand</a></span>

In this game, you don&apos;t play as another person but you play as yourself controlling an unknowing real-life person from an alternate version of reality set in the year 2024.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a story-driven sci-fi rpg with fps elements. How the story unfolds is dependent on how you choose to play. The game is very similar to the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Mass Effect&apos;s (to name the big ones) take on plot progression by interacting with NPCs through a conversation tree. The conversation tree is the core game mechanic and it is done really well. Fully voiced conversations have many possible choices and feels very natural. The voice acting is great and the character development is superb.
<br>
<br>The graphics are very cartooney and  I honestly think the shadow textures are some of the worst I&apos;ve seen, ever. Performance isn&apos;t where it should be, either. Despite these issues, Consortium is still one of the most immersive games I have played in a long time. That says a lot. I was very impressed at how encompassing the world is and the backstory is super fleshed-out.
<br>
<br>The shooting mechanics are also sub-par. I only had to use my weapon once in my story, but your story will most definitely be different and you may choose to use your weapon more. Don&apos;t get this game if you are looking for a shooter, that isn&apos;t what this game is about.
<br>
<br>The story is pretty short in length, but rich with substance and a high replayabilty value. All-around I have really enjoyed this game. The story is captivating and impactful. I want to give it 10/10 but I have to take off something for the gun mechanics and performance issues. For what this game set out to do, I think has gone beyond.
<br>
<br>I really hope the sequel gets funded because I really want to finish the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=6191060">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But, yeah, if you&apos;re looking for another generic COD-like stupid shooter - Don&apos;t buy it. You&apos;ll be disappointed. Not much combat here, and you can talk your way out of any fight if you are smart.

<br>COD-lovers gonna hate, but i didn&apos;t have such fun playing video game since first Deus Ex.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=3940261">Expand</a></span>

<br>Maybe because I have a story and some real charachters in front of me, maybe because I am not having only GRAPHICS to rule the price of the game. I like Consortium. I honestly felt to be myself on the ship, and I forced myself to act as I would in similar situations.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a game not for everyone I fear though. Nowadays everyone wants graphics, loot, violence, action, shooting... this game turns the tide and focus entirely on the story. Damn for the first time after Mass Effect saga I felt that what I decided, no... what I said ! was worth something different in the story arch.
<br>
<br>If you like a game with a story and you want to be part of it , buy it. Otherwise, if you search something action oriented and to not face the consequences of your actions, go elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=3911648">Expand</a></span>

This game has that &quot;your actions care in story-progressing&quot; thing, like in Mass Effect of Star Wars: Knights of Old Republic. You can choose who you want to make friends with and who are the people you don&apos;t like in your universe. These mecanics are awesome! Don&apos;t play if you are lookin for a Call of Duty shotting stuff though. Consortium has its shotting moments, but they are not as complex and well made as in the big shotters games. You should play it for the story and new mechanics. It&apos;s graphics are not good and it has some major bugs/glitches issues, but these negative aspects should not make you avoid it. Give it a chance!!

Lets ignore the game breaking bugs and the fact that most people seem incapable of finishing the game. Lets ignore the peculiar graphics choices since they&apos;re functional and graphics arent important as long as they perform all the tasks you need them to in the game.
<br>
<br>Here be spoilers.
<br>
<br>This entire &apos;game&apos; is the intro sequence to a game they havent made yet! You&apos;re told bishops are essentially a warrior class, you&apos;re given a powerful suit of armour, several weapons and several pieces of equipment that you plug into your armour for various effects...and there is no combat in the game. The combat takes place in a virtual reality suite, there is one opportunity for actual physical combat in the game and it only happens if you screw everything up. Also, the special equipment you get for plugging into your suit that gives you different abilities? that is only given to you AS THE GAME ENDS! Meaning they put work into coding items you are physically incapable of using in the game at any point. They constantly talk about the combat system, the equipment system, your role as a warrior in this alternate society...and before you actually engage in any combat the game ends. This game would have been perfectly fine as an interactive story game. If they had included none of the taunting allusions to combat, none of the equipment and several guns you will never use in any situation (they&apos;re even locked down during the game with the safety on, I never even fired them) and focused on the one thing the game delivers, a good narrative and great voice acting, it would have been a good game. But constantly promising that this is a first person shooter with role playing aspects when it is in fact a socialization simulator is misleading and a direct attempt to lull in a different audience.
<br>
<br>In short it&apos;s 2014 and having a dialogue tree in a game is not a selling point, we&apos;ve had those functioning at this level since the 90s. You cant sell a game entirely on the point it has a dialogue tree in it, so they clumsily tacked on some pretend first person shooter aspects to use guns to sell it. The entire &apos;game&apos; is a sham. It&apos;s an interactive movie, which would be fine if they marketed it that way. Including features it isnt possible to use anywhere in the &apos;game&apos; whilst constantly leading you to believe the game is a first person shooter in the advertising and in the game itself is dishonest and frankly insulting. I&apos;ll be asking for a refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913095">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But the game is riddled with bugs. Sometimes there are characters talking over each other and you don&apos;t know who to focus on. The combat is really not great and most of it will be done in a virtual reality simulator. The game tends to lock you out or in certain areas you need access to, if you want to continue the game. And the game&apos;s crown jewel bug is when the game doesn&apos;t let you play further. I don&apos;t know if this happens to others, but this is a blocker, and it needs to be fixed.
<br>
<br>I give the game 4 points, for the enjoyment i had out of the dialogues and the idea, but the game is not finished and currently broken. Don&apos;t buy until they fix it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=3918462">Expand</a></span>

Thought the game sounded interesting, but it&apos;s not, this game is boring as it&apos;s just wandering around a ship talking to everyone and hardly knowing what you&apos;re doing. A game with a tiny bit of action and a lot of endless talking. It would be wrong to class it as a fps as there is hardly any shooting.
<br>
<br>The graphics are basic looking and sometimes a bit buggy and weird as NPC eyes seem to look in weird direction or clip and there doesn&apos;t seem to be much gameplay unless you are prepared to continually reload saves to see the different paths you can take. And relaoding is very slow.
<br>
<br>The game is also buggy, I went back in the cabin and am now stuck in there, can&apos;t get out. The door was open but acted like an invisible barrier, no matter how many times I opened and closed the door. Had to reload a previous save.
<br>
<br>Also characters speech timing is terrible making it hard hard to hear what anyone is saying as you&apos;ll be talking to one character and then some other character will come speak at the same time and over each other, I had the knight, Wade and rook 25 all speaking at the same time, making it a garbled mess.
<br>
<br>The game is confusing at times. I don&apos;t know where Iam going or where something is. And not sure what to do sometimes with mission objectives.
<br>I ended up confronted with a traitor and not being able to harm the person in anyway and just die.
<br>
<br>The game is also very short, only taking 3 to 4 hours.(thank god)
<br>
<br>The game is medicore and boring as well as buggy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=6058173">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Quite abstract user interface with useless &quot;tips&quot; like &quot;Use the recycle feature to RECYCLE&quot;. WTF?? Some kind of weird inventory feature where I have to dispose energy to store more stuff? I don&apos;t know what this game tries to tell me.
<br>- Quite unbalanced simulator mission. Far more enemies than ammo. In the end I simply walked out, ignoring dead civilians and enemies. That&apos;s the point that I decided that this was a was of time.
<br>- Game takes very long to load.
<br>
<br>Perhaps this would be really fun if I studied it hard for a few hours and made notes. But I&apos;ll simply play something else instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=4881237">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Inter dimensional Games has created a game made up of two basic systems: a fairly complex set of first person shooter mechanics and a fairly complex branching dialogue based RPG.  The game simply does not seem to have had enough time or money to fully realize the potential of either system.
<br>
<br>The combat is utilized all of 3 times in the game, 2 of which take place in a virtual reality training simulation complete with wireframe environments.  Though there is a complicated limb and vital organ damage system, it doesn&apos;t play much of a factor in actual combat. It&apos;s over-designed.
<br>
<br>The dialogue system is where the games true potential comes to fruition, more than serviceable indie voice acting combines with a well thought out dialogue system with about as many options as a fallout game, along with an alignment system that promised future consequences.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the story was so incredibly short, (it only took me 3 hours on my first try)  that there is no payoff at all, the game ends on a cliffhanger setting up for a direct sequel.
<br>
<br>Consortium was a nice dialogue driven ARPG which showed narrative promise, but its short length and overly complex combat system holds it back from being anything other than an average and fairly unrewarding experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/consortium/user-reviews?user_review_id=6129722">Expand</a></span>
