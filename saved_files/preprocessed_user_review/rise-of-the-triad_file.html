How about with the FPS issues?
<br>Unreal Engine 3 is a very powerful engine, however it does have its issues. Rise of the Triads has had it rough when it comes to optermiseations from both an effects and level design stand point. Many of the weapons have very resource expensive effects that are guaranteed to bring even the most powerful of systems to its knees. I suppose what makes this even worse is the simple fact that the majorty of weapon effects do not even look that impressive... When it comes to level design the mass overuse of high tri static meshes is unforgivable and really seems to point to inexperiance as the main culprit to this games optimisation issues...
<br>
<br>Its the simple things, like opting to have a bridge made out of 100+ resource expensive &quot;Gravity Pads&quot; rather then opting for a simple 12 tri block that could do the exact same job... Please do not take my comments out of context. Like most other people I believe that sometimes graphical improvements are worth the cost of a few frames... However in this circumstance having 12 Tri and 1 collision box replaced by 100,000 Tri bridges with 100s of colision boxes is simply not excusable in a game where even the developers in early press releases and interviews claim the game should be &quot;120 frames or bust..&quot;
<br>
<br>When it comes down to the MP balance... Wow... This could take a while...
<br>Rise of the Triad was designed to be more of a HD Remake of an oldschool arena shooter then a modenisation. I totally understand that but you cannot upgrade certain aspects and expect the game to feel the same. A good example is the Hit Scan weapons. Even ignoring the poor Unreal Engine Netcode and just focusing on the pure basics we will notice a huge difference. By changing the way projectiles are traced in 3d space and increasing the resolution we now have bullets the size of pin pricks. When compared to the 1994 original where you had bullets the size of cannon balls and less objects in the level to obstruct movement and aiming. The result is a feeling that is very much different from the original that was the goal.
<br>
<br>One of the biggest issues with the Multiplayer is not actually the developers fault... Well it kinda is for using the engine in the first place... The Unreal Engine 3 has many issues when it comes to its base Netcode, Optimisation and Input. The lack of native demo recording, first person spectator and many other small issues are going to prevent this game from being the game we all wish it was... Personally I have no idea why the developers would have used UE3 with a game that is supposed to be this fast pace without making huge changes to the core systems. This game would be much better suited to Source or even the old school engines from Quake and CoD. Its a shame because as someone that also maps and mods useing the unreal engine I just wish the current build was better. Hopefully UE4 will make some vast improvements but as it stands this was the time bomb that was always going to limit the potential for Rise of the Triads.
<br>
<br>Finally on the side of the multiplayer... Overall balance is off... Full hp  Full fire armour, no problem just hit them with one of many explosives that will still blow their socks off. I was hoping for a skill based experiance but it turns out due to STUPID choices by the developers the game just ends up being a clunky spam fest filled with childish humor and poor movement.
<br>
<br>I could continue... But this is getting very long and even though I do not want to...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3390202">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t lie to us and tell us the game runs 120fps, dont lie and say you can make your own weapons, don&apos;t lie and say weapon fov can be adjusted, don&apos;t lie and say your first patch will fix our major problems, when all you did was remove the debug commands. I mean REALLY? they claimed to be optimising the game and polishing it for months, this is the result of all their hard work? Boy, I can&apos;t wait to see what they have left in store! /sarcasm Even one of the developers commented on forum &apos;WE&apos;RE SORRY GUYS, WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD LOVE IT!&quot; meaning this is their best work. Nope, cash grab, cash grab, cash grab. You have my money, you&apos;re probably laughing, but I hope you choke on it, because I&apos;m never buying one of your games ever again. Even if it&apos;s free, I don&apos;t want your stinking trash on my computer. Game died in 1 day, not even 500 people playing compared to 2000 on day one. R.I.P. ROTT IN PIECES.

<br>Its a great game, and its hard, fans of the original will enjoy this one, everyone else will have frustrating moments but you might still enjoy it, especially if you&apos;re tired of the casual games or especially the casual shooters that pretend to be hardcore and fail at being either.

That isn&apos;t fun, it&apos;s frustrating and the lack of being able to save your game spoils what could otherwise be a fun game.

It is also very hard to tell where you are getting shot from, and the damage indicator is not always pointed in the right direction. This is basic stuff that should have been fixed in testing. This game is nearly impossible and one of the most frustrating games I&apos;ve ever played on the hardest difficulty, not because of the fps skill that it involves, but because of the memorization involved in learning the positions of enemies and traps in the huge areas between checkpoints.
<br>
<br>This game definitely does have style, and the gameplay is similar to Serious Sam, but without the balance. Stuff like mowing down enemies with the smg and having their body parts go all over the floor is something I would love to see in more games. It&apos;s too bad this game could not fix the easily-fixable major problems it has that make it nearly unplayable.
<br>
<br>Also, the multiplayer seems fun, with Unreal Tournament style arena shooter gameplay, but too bad there&apos;s no one online, ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3602249">Expand</a></span>

This was one of my favorite games of that era. I was excited to see a remake on the horizon. The trailers looked great. It looked like everything one could want in a remake of the classic Rise of the Triad. That was until you loaded the game. Many people had game-breaking frame rate isses, I luckily did not have *much* issue. The fps are rather unstable, even on an extremely powerful system. This first issue that I encountered, was the inability to map the entire keyboard, this is a PC game allegedly made by PC gamers...they should have known better. The game relies heavily on poorly placed checkpoints and there is no option to manually save. This is a large departure from the original. It is rather lame to have to repeat large portions of a map from a previous checkpoint because some sort of insta-kill trap or poorly designed jump puzzle resulted in you dying just short of the next checkpoint. Additionally, and even more damningly, the map locks behind you after each checkpoint, so if you happen to mistakenly bumble through one of the invisible checkpoint triggers with 5% health, there is no going back. Absolutely terrible design for a PC game, and it is absolutely inexcusable to close the map behind the player. Parts of the maps are very glitchy and clipping issues are commonplace. Overall, the gameplay itself could be fun and the game has to potential to be fun, but the poorly designed platforming puzzles coupled with the terribly done checkpoints move what had potential to be a good game faithful to its original to the fail category. The developers are allegedly working on patches for performance and perhaps the save game system. If they address those issues the game is quite possibly 8 out of 10, but, in absence of those fixes the game stands at a paltry 2 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3412553">Expand</a></span>

Make sure to remove your previous .INI file in &quot;...(backslash)Documents(backslash)my games(backslash)Rise Of The Triad&quot; and restart your PC.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the launch has been a bit rocky with various technical issues (for example, I can&apos;t change the graphical settings, music volume is very low and steam integration doesn&apos;t work, which means no achievements). So I won&apos;t lie and say my experience has been perfectly flawless.
<br>What is under all the temporary problems is a damn good game that fulfills its goals almost perfectly. This is as good as old-school fps remakes get, really.
<br>
<br>You might think that Serious Sam is THE old-school experience to date, but it does not properly feature the level design, gameplay, Enemy AI and etc. that lovers of the old school FPS&apos;s are so familiar with. Rise of the Triad does. (I&apos;m not saying Serious Sam sucks, It is indeed awesome)
<br>This game hasn&apos;t even begun to show its promises yet, with level editors and future updates on the horizon.
<br>The little multiplayer that I have played is really fun, but as of now, I can&apos;t say too much about it. It is pretty much what you&apos;d expect. If you&apos;re looking for a great multiplayer twitch shooter, look no further.
<br>
<br>So in conclusion, It&apos;s a great old-school shooter with a fresh coat of painting including satisfying gameplay both in multiplayer and singleplayer that is very worthy for its low price tag. Go get it!

Especially when I see dozens of 10/10 and 9/10 reviews. It smells funny. First let me just say that I grew up original ROTT as well as many other oldschool FPS (wolfenstein, doom, doom 2, quake)  so I get what they were going for. I gave the game 4  not a 0, virtually no game deserves a 0. The gore is pretty entertaining and levels have lots of secrets which is nice. However, the game, as it stands, is unplayable. You constantly get caught on the map in both singleplayer and multipalyer, lots of clipping, just downright poor graphics (dont gimme that oldschool crap, it can still look polished, I mean honestly the game is UGLY). Also, it crashes constantly, at least for me (others report this as well) and stutters, skips and lags (do you really have to ask? I&apos;m a gamer writing reviews on metacritic, of course I have a kickass rig). The game feels lazy, like it was thrown together by a bunch of stoners who may have had a few good ideas but were too unmotivated to put the time or work into the game. I&apos;d say this was just a cash grab for people of my generation who had fond memories of the shocking brutality of the first game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3391431">Expand</a></span>

But this feeling of ecstasy and excitement were soon dashed as soon as I started playing this miserable  of a game.
<br>
<br>It seems the common thing to do these days is to reboot an old school franchise, like the did with Duke3D. What a travesty that was... and the reboot of ROTT is no different. In fact, I dare say it is worse.
<br>
<br>Where to begin?... The graphics are utterly foul. It feels like my graphics card is throwing up on me, and its insulting my monitor. I get that they wanted the whole &quot;nostalgia&quot; feel, but the game genuinely looks god awful and has a seriously unfinished feel to it. It is also plagued with clipping problems. In many instances my character became stuck in a wall or part of the map and I had to reset the level. But that&apos;s just the beginning.
<br>
<br>The game play is an affront to what brain cells I have left after playing this piece of  as the graphics are to my poor eyes. I don&apos;t think I have experienced such mind-numbingly boring game-play in the last fifteen years of my life. You literally go through the levels with no sense of purpose at all, travel in uninspired environments, shoot at uninspired enemies and avoid uninspired pitfalls, all while running at approximately mach 4.
<br>
<br>Maybe the weapons, then, will save ROTT? Unfortunately not I&apos;m afraid. The weapons are also dreadfully boring and took little to no  imagination at all to come up with. You have 4 choices: (1) a pistol, (2) two pistols, (3) a machine gun or (4) some form of a rocket launcher. The pistols and machine gun have infinite ammo, but for some reason have a reload option that serves no purpose, to my knowledge anyhow.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the challenges one will face in this game have 2 levels of difficulty. Either the challenge will be easy as  or hard as  There is no middle ground. And the frustration level is through the roof in many situations, especially when a player is expected to perform tedious platform maneuvering all while dashing around like a rabid squirrel on cocaine.
<br>
<br>It simply staggering how bad this game is. They had a great idea to work from, but someone they ****ed it up. The bottom line is this: it seems the developers of this game were just a bunch of lazy windowlickers that thought they could try their hand at making a game.
<br>
<br>If this is the result of resurrecting Apogee as a company, I say put it back in the ground and let it rest in piece. And, on a personal note to the developers of this travesty of a game, shame on you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466771">Expand</a></span>

I get that it&apos;s supposed to be a remake of an old 1994 shooter, but it still is lacking.  While I didn&apos;t mind the graphics or crazy effects, the game was riddled with glitches and quite boring AI.  You&apos;d be better off playing something like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon if you want a comical,fast shooter.</span>

<br>THE GOOD:
<br>Very, very challenging.  Oldschool level design including keycard hunts and deadly obstacles.  Super fast movement speed.  No regenerating health.  Unlimited ammo, no reloading required (just like in the original).  Collectables and hidden areas.  Gore galore.  Awesome remakes of old songs, including the ability to listen to the classic versions.  Tons of graphics options.
<br>
<br>THE BAD:
<br>No manual saving.  Poor A.I. that doesn&apos;t always react to your presence.  Small enemies that blend in too well with the environments.  Widespread performance issues (frame rate drops and stuttering).  Mouse smoothing that can&apos;t be disabled through the menus (plus when it&apos;s disabled via config edits, the movement still doesn&apos;t feel quite right).
<br>
<br>OVERALL:
<br>A fun game that stays true to the original in many ways but also lacks polish.  It&apos;s fast, furious, and challenging, but makes one wonder just how great it could have been had the developers spent more time optimizing the performance and kept a classic &quot;save anywhere, anytime&quot; system.  Thankfully, for $15 it isn&apos;t much of a gamble and if you&apos;re a fan of shooters from the &quot;good old days,&quot; go for it.  Just expect your moments of glee to occasionally be interrupted by those of disappointment or thoughts of &quot;what could have been.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3385539">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is truly a FPS we&apos;ve been waiting for, and personally one of the better games of 2013. With such a low price, how the bloody hell could you refuse this ludicrous, bloody game?
<br>
<br>It runs very smoothly on machines, and it well optimized. It can run on lower hardware, but can still look stunning graphically.
<br>
<br>The game-play is amazing. Classic FPS at its best. I felt like I was playing Quake or Doom once again.
<br>
<br>But sadly this game DOES come with some bugs  Rocket-jumping at certain areas will make you fall out of the map and die  but I am sure it will e patched later on. Its usually not buggy or game breaking.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is great. Pick it up or be ashamed. Do NOT pirate this masterpiece of a game. The developers more than deserve the money  Plus its only 15 bucks!  Interceptor Entertainment has proven they are worthy of being in the game industry.
<br>
<br>This game WILL bury you in a lunch box.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3383313">Expand</a></span>

The level design is okay and the graphics are fairly good. They made some good changes to weapons but I got a little irritated with the checkpoint system.</span>

It features some of the best music that I&apos;ve ever heard in a video game and the sound design isn&apos;t that bad at all either. Game play is what&apos;s truly spot on in this game, though. It&apos;s simple and best kept that way for Rise of the Triad. It&apos;s supposed to be arcadey and fun instead of including dozen of complex and unnecessary functions that only piss you off when you&apos;re trying to get things done.
<br>
<br>If you loved games such as Wolf 3D and Doom, maybe feel a little nostalgic, I&apos;d suggest you pick this game up. It&apos;s only 13&#x20AC; and features a lot of bang for your buck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639129">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ofcourse this game isn&apos;t perfect, and it&apos;s likely the CoD generation doesn&apos;t like it.
<br>But for oldschool shooter lovers, I can highly recommend it. Especially seeing it&apos;s low pricepoint.</span>

<br>You actually feel like playing levels. There&apos;s a  ton of secrets and short cuts, there&apos;s collectibles like coins, there&apos;s all sorts of crazy weapons. Not only that, but it&apos;s actually a fair challenge. And it actually has some replayability unlike today&apos;s &quot;movie games&quot;.
<br>What&apos;s great about this game is that although this is a remake, it features updated shooter mechanics which make this game actually play differently. The Unreal Engine also makes this game look better than most triple A games now a days. And all of that for 15 bucks. Not to mention that there&apos;s also multiplayer.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s still some bugs and glitches here and there but for the price you&apos;re paying, you&apos;re getting more than a complete package. If you want to actually have a fun time while playing a game, pick this one up immediately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3385623">Expand</a></span>

It definitely doesn&apos;t disappoint with that  the levels have a ton of secrets, branching paths, keys for doors halfway across the map, and a lot of gameplay choices that died out since the 90s  for example, reloading literally does nothing, and was just included for kicks. Ironsights were also thrown in, but outside of singleplayer you&apos;ll get destroyed if you use them. Multiplayer is a rocketfest, which can be frustrating at times, but once you learn your way around that&apos;s when it gets fun. The devs are the best part of the game, honestly  there&apos;s lots of jokes thrown in, like the AI telling you to stick with a controller and text-to-speech in multiplayer (John Madden! John Madden!). However, it is a bit buggy on launch day, as I found myself getting stuck in walls a lot in singleplayer. I also can&apos;t really see a competitive future. But for what it is and what it tries to be, it&apos;s perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3383252">Expand</a></span>

Released today via Steam, RoTT is as ludicrous as ever, but it&apos;s not without several caveats and it remains an acquired taste...kind of like Monk Meal.
<br>
<br>In pretty much every way that matters, this reboot/remake  is a 90s shooter with all the expected pros and cons. It&#x2019;s lightning fast, and 90% of your arsenal is pinpoint-precise. Realism is thrown out the window, so levels are less &#x201C;brown corridors&#x201D; and more &#x201C;big rooms full of spinning blades of death rolling past collectible coins&#x201D;, or &#x201C;tiny platforms floating above giant lava rivers&#x201D;, or &#x201C;ascent up a pair of physically impossible towers&#x201D;, or &#x201C;pedestals containing heavy weapons that rise out of reach when you approach, as secret walls open and enemies attack.&#x201D; Or all of the above, on the same map.
<br>
<br>Before you buy your copy of Rise of the Triad  and you should  you need to first ask yourself how easily you can live without gradual healing. Or cover mechanics. Or auto-aim. Or a HUD. If these things are to your FPS enjoyment what water is to not dying from thirst, then Rise of the Triad is going to destroy you. As difficult as trying to explain the popularity of Stone Temple Pilots hard. Rise of the Triad requires a lot of patience to complete, and that&#x2019;s by design. In fact, Interceptor CEO Fred Schreiber said during a multiplayer session that the gaming system he keeps coming back to (besides PC, he was quick to make clear) is the NES, precisely because NES games can be so difficult to complete.
<br>
<br>From start to finish, Rise of the Triad is obstinately dedicated to being as difficult as possible. Enemies are pattern-based. In-game interactive elements are difficult to precisely interact with. You have to find health when you get damaged, and you take damage excessively. Checkpoints are absolutely brutal  make it to one and you&#x2019;ll still find yourself grinding through waves of enemies again and again, often making it nearly to the end of a segment, and having to do it all over again when you&#x2019;re blown up by your own missile.
<br>
<br>But it&#x2019;s hard to dislike Rise of the Triad for this sort of thing, because&#x2013; no, I take that back. It&#x2019;s very, very easy to get massively frustrated with Rise of the Triad and quit out of it because of this sort of thing, but the frustrations are somewhat forgiven when you wander into basically anything else. This is a game that makes shooting feel good, and it has enough heavy weaponry and things to shoot with that heavy weaponry that you&#x2019;re doing stuff that feels good pretty much 90% of the time.
<br>
<br>The single player campaign is much like the original game&#x2019;s (and many shooters from that era) in that it functions largely as a chance to practice for the multiplayer. The plot is simple: A UN special ops team called H.U.N.T. is sent to San Nicholas Island (part of California&#x2019;s Channel Islands) to investigate a strange cult based there. The team is attacked, their landing craft destroyed, and they must now fight their way through the cult&#x2019;s labyrinthine fortresses and stop them before they execute their plan to blow up Los Angeles
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is a scream. At launch, it has Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag modes, and more are promised. Interceptor is providing dedicated servers, but the game also allows LAN, Direct IP and player-hosted games as well. That&#x2019;s good, because you&#x2019;ll need to practice with friends a lot before testing your mettle against strangers who will almost certainly destroy you.
<br>
<br>If you have played the original ROTT, and were a fan, you will be astounded how &#x201C;extremely faithful&#x201D; this reboot really is. While Interceptor has certainly added new elements to the game and created something pretty unique, they do this with so much reverence and respect to the original, you sometimes have to remind yourself you aren&#x2019;t actually playing the 1993 classic. Every little detail is replicated and recreated here: the hovering discs, the coins, the injured enemies begging for mercy  it&#x2019;s quite incredible how seamlessly Interceptor has merged the old and the new to create what can simply be described as a reboot masterpiece.
<br>It was a real pleasure to play (replay) Rise of the Triad, and Interceptor deserves every bit of credit they get for rebooting an all-time classic in the FPS genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3384413">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Rise of the Triad is a good old-school shooter. When I played it, I felt as if I play in something very old and very cool. I like this levels, I like this stupid enemies, I like this BIG COINS &amp; BIG GUNS.
<br>Of course, the game is eerily hardcore that only reinforces my interest in it, as opposed to the heap of modern shooters without gameplay.</span>

<br>This game would be fun if their was actual shooting in it. There is more jumping and platforming than shooting. Also, the explosions from your own weapons are more likely to kill you than from enemy fire because the blast radius is ridiculous, especially since most fighting is done in small spaces.
<br>This game is all the reasons I hated old school shooters  no shooting, only crappy frustrating  platforming and dumb level design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3636573">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s been almost a year now and they still have not patched this HORRIBLE performance issue. I re-installed this game to see if it finally would work without me having to manually mess with the .ini files to get good performance but no. I dropped everything to Low on that game launcher and it did just as terribly as if i had the settings on Ludicrious. I cannot beleive this and that is why i quit and uninstalled it. Rise of the Triad is exaclty the kind of game i would want, but i cannot beleive how they don&apos;t bother to freakin fix the game. it&apos;s great how we have lierally zero Arcade FPS nowadays, and this one that is actually Arcade FPS, wont be fixed. I cannot do anything else but give a zero to this game because i am so furious right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327489">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only points where i found it lacking that it does look a lad outdated, and i attribute that to the lowish quality of the texturing. The voice acting is just, well, bad even though the game is a parody of itself. And the game is stupidly fast. I know the original was as well but not this fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3388961">Expand</a></span>

It started off really good and I thought I could get into it, but after a while the problems start surfacing when the platforming decides to require really precise jumping when the game&apos;s controls are so damn sensitive. On episode 2 level 4 there is a part where you have to jump into this doorway with a broken floor beneath it. I&apos;ve tried to jump in about 5 times now from different angles and nothing works, I just keep sliding into the lava. To make it even more annoying, you have to do the whole level again up to that point if you&apos;re that one pixel off. Still haven&apos;t gotten past it and I feel like it&apos;s such a waste of my time trying to do this one jump that should be so simple. In most cases during the game so far, about half the time I don&apos;t feel like it&apos;s my fault for dieing. The vast majority of the weapons are rocket launchers of some sort and all the objects, pillars and railings have hit barriers larger than you would think, so getting damaged by your own weapons happens all the friggin time. Much of the time the damage that traps do to you is extremely inconsistent. One time I got blasted by fire dead on and it only did like 20 damage. Another time I barely touched the edge of the fire and I practically exploded at full health. That&apos;s just scratching the surface but when the game decides to stop being unfair, it can be fun. The shooting for the most part is satisfying and the humor at some parts has made me laugh out loud.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3388651">Expand</a></span>

Rise of The Triad (ROTT) is an updated Quake/Arena style shooter, bringing the original &apos;94 ROTT game as well as old school Quake style shooters back into gamers&apos; hands.  The game retails for $14.99 which in this opinion is a bit under-priced.  The folks at Apogee have created an extremely *fun* shooter that embodies a lot of what the modern shooters no longer have, namely: wackiness, imagination, ludicrous gibs and a lots and lots of speed.  The current best selling shooters are all about trying to create a sense of realism, they try to put you on the battlefield, and while they are clearly still tops, ROTT is not trying to copy that model, and Apogee never said that they were.  Instead they have created a fast paced and unrealistic (haha it is powered by Unreal 3 after all) shooter that is incredibly enjoyable to play.  I am giving it 9/10 due to its one minor flaw, the inability to save when desired, as the current check-point system does not work well with game, and was not a part of the original.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for an extremely fun, fast paced shooter, you can&apos;t go wrong with this game and should buy it.  If you are looking for another battlefield simulator, you also should buy it so you can see what another shooter is like.  Once you get used to it, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3431631">Expand</a></span>

This game is such a refreshing change from slow easy hand holding experiences such as CoD. The level design is reasonably complex, the game is not linear and encourages exploration.  The movement speed is fast and strafe jumping adds a bit of extra pace to the game.
<br>
<br>The weapons are really cool, essentially you have a whole series of rocket launchers with varying characteristics which are the most used weapons which is very original, there is a machine gun and single or dual pistols and then there are 2 supernatural weapons with quite unique effects. Rocket jumping is present though its not as refined as quake but it allows entry to higher areas.
<br>
<br>The graphics are good, they are not exceptional but imo the game looks quite pretty. There are some optimization issues though I haven&apos;t found this to be a major issue plus a patch is due to deal with that.
<br>
<br>The main thing I like about this game is that its challenging and fun, on the hardest difficulty the game is really hard at certain points. The boss battles also stand out as very clever and well designed, the 3rd boss being very impressive and complex.
<br>
<br>I would highly recommend this game especially at the price point its at, it has provided me with many hours of entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427993">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I see a lot of people crying about performance issues... all seem to be running AMD based rigs.... the truth is you get what you pay for.  You can&apos;t really buy budget gear and expect top shelf performance.
<br>
<br>I am running intel i7 and   nvidia, no performance problems here... never are.
<br>
<br>If you like the old school FPS scene, and would like some of that feel with modern graphics, this game is for you!
<br>
<br>And just remember, intel/nvidia rules supreme in terms of performance and general compatibility, even if you have to go with gear that is a  generation or two older, or used... it&apos;s still a better investment then going with AMD.. in my humble opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4351908">Expand</a></span>

<br>It can play well on outdated hardware, but to max it out you need to have a very high-end computer, so don&apos;t be upset your 760gtx can&apos;t get 60fps on ultra, be happy your 460gtx can get 30 on medium.</span>

<br>It&apos;s more of a try and error death-maze with edges and trip-hazards waiting for you at every corner.
<br>Could sound like some challenging experience, but you already know how much fun jumping puzzles in an egoshooter are? exactly: No fun at all.
<br>
<br>So, every speed and &quot;fast paced gunplay&quot; that wants to be build up, is instantly squashed by annoying traps that you can&apos;t avoid through skill and will run inevitably into.
<br>Did I mention corners and little bumps that stop your run?
<br>
<br>And don&apos;t forget mandatory bugs and crashes!
<br>
<br>But the Multiplayer-matches have to be fun, don&apos;t they?
<br>They could be, when you would be allowed to host and join a simple match!
<br>Steam -&gt; Rightklick -&gt; Join?
<br>Wrong!
<br>You must use an external RotT-Server-Tool and HOPE there will be something like a connetion (WHY?! The Hell WHY?)!
<br>Get used to the &quot;ludicrous lag ahead&quot;-Screen.

<br>Cons: Multiplayer is empty. And I mean empty.

<br>Performance issues. even with the patches, game is still laggy.
<br>A.I is dumb as bricks.
<br>Enemies blend in with the backgrounds, making it annoying to kill them.
<br>SP and MP both horribly unbalanced.
<br>Final boss battle glitches too often, makes the game almost unbeatable.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game can be fun, but there are so many poor design choices, which you&apos;ll see. It makes me wonder sometimes, how some things could be screwed up so badly. Wait for a sale on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3783440">Expand</a></span>

On the highest setting the game constantly keeps crashing, and when it doesn&apos;t crash, it can&apos;t get me invested enough to want to play it. The sense of humor is childish (an that&apos;s coming from someone who really likes Shadow Warrior), exasperating rather than funny. The gameplay doesn&apos;t make the situation better: enemies hit you from great distances, and goo like finding them: they might even be three pixels of a forehead peeking out from behind a wall. Weapons are uninspired, as is the action.
<br>
<br>The game is challenging, but not as a result of the AI, which is awful. Some enemies stand there, not noticing you, despite the fact that you&apos;re shooting at their buddies in the same room. The graphics glitches make the whole thing frustrating: sometimes an enemy will suddenly appear right by you, in-your-face, and the next second he&apos;s at the other corner of the room. The collectible coins make the situation worse, as the enemies can see you through them. Now, if the damage indicator only worked as it as supposed too... Some glitches make this game play like an early beta, for example when aiming through your sights you sometimes get smooth animation, at others it just skips the animation.
<br>
<br>You also have other low-budget production issues such as a gibbed enemy, who continues screaming three seconds after being blown into oblivion, but that&apos;s a non-issue in light of all the others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=6917084">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Compared to any modern shooter reviving an old title, this one doesn&apos;t look or feel Old School (TM) but certainly brain-damaged, incapable of having the courage or intelligence to make the necessary tough but right design decisions.
<br>
<br>Oh yes, the levels looks &quot;realistic&quot; thanks to pile of polygons crunched by the GPU. But this is not enough
<br>- some places looks out-of-proportions (or at least, scaled accordingly to the inflated ego a dictator).
<br>- the buildings layout seems to come from the deranged mind of a aspiring architect (how can you have slicers in an office corridor if you intend to rule the world ?).
<br>- the moving platforms are obviously the most convenient way to go from one place to another (plus, they are solid when you move up and down, but turn vaporous when they move through you),
<br>- the jumpers are the secret weapon of the Triad, no doubt.
<br>Yes, when there is a realistic environments, anything odd suddenly jumps at your face, and ROTT does that with a rare persistence.
<br>
<br>To stay coherent with the environment, the enemies are stiff, ugly and stupid. And since the levels are huge, they are usually located at long range, forcing me to wait until they shoot me to know exactly where they are and gun them down. It&apos;s the first time I had to regularly expose myself and wait for a fireshot to figure out from where the danger comes. And this not what I would call exciting, or old-school. More eyesight-impaired retirement school.
<br>
<br>The more I played, the more I felt that our world is not really threatened by the Triad since all that operation is doomed to fail solely based on its stupidity.
<br>
<br>To be true to the original game, this one still features the collection of oversized coins, and the proverbial secret rooms. If the latter is nice, the former seems out of place. Collecting Nazi gold in Wolfenstein or Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is nice and historically pertinent ; but here it&apos;s ridiculous and superfluous.
<br>
<br>On top of that, the walk-on-that-weapon-to-get-it mechanic creates an unfortunate and meaningless &quot;get/drop&quot; cycle that forces you to carefully dodge some of them - or stay in position and enjoy both the comments and the gong while the game patiently swaps the weapons. Maybe you can use it as a background for you yoga meditation or a foundation loop for you next dance floor remix.
<br>
<br>Eventually, I got fed up of all that non-sense and stopped playing. There are many titles today descending from early shooters that knew how to render the franchise according to both players&apos; expectations of the original title and the evolution of the genre - like Shadow Warrior.
<br>
<br>I think this game should have been titled &quot;Crash &amp; Burn of the Triad&quot; and fall into oblivion along &quot;Duke Nukem Never Again&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4954798">Expand</a></span>

Yet, the game is poorly optimized, and there are some design faults which take away a huge chunk of your pleasure. Shame, this could have been a classic.
<br>
<br>Still, I say it&apos;s a solid FPS with 6.5/10 score. Much better than many other FPS games out there.</span>

<br>
<br>From what I can tell, this game was not a &quot;labor of love&quot; so much as a quick way to cash in on nostalgia.  They tried to modernize a game that needed no modernization to be fun and it turns out to just be a garbled mess of modern physics and classic callbacks.  And that formula just does not work, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>The redone levels -- of which several are missing -- don&apos;t seem all that interesting to me in the slightest.  They only bear a passing resemblance to their MS-DOS counterparts and all the added areas and content really adds nothing to the experience.  You could argue that if the original map designers had a more powerful engine to work with (such as Doom&apos;s engine or the later Build engine), they would have made more intricate levels with even more craziness, but they didn&apos;t.  And they happily worked with what they had, ending up with some absolutely fantastic levels!  But that goes right out the bloody window with this remake.  It&apos;s all about hopping over pits and traps now, or running through catwalks.  It&apos;s prettier, sure, but it&apos;s also far less interesting somehow.
<br>
<br>The graphic style for this game seems... questionable, at best.  Some of the textures seem a bit generic.  The original game had a lot of repeated textures, but you never really got tired of seeing them because they were used in a variety of ways.  Here, it&apos;s just like... &quot;Here&apos;s a cave level.  Here&apos;s a warehouse.  Here&apos;s an active volcano.&quot;  It&apos;s a modern gaming convention sure, but that&apos;s not how the original did it, technical limitations or not.  And it worked very well in the original.
<br>
<br>The gameplay isn&apos;t all that impressive, either.  We&apos;ve seen games where you hop around like a maniac and shoot rockets at things until they die.  We old-school gamers called that &quot;Doom&quot;.  While there were a number of enemies in any given Rise of the Triad level, in this remake, it seems like they just throw wave after wave at you in the action sections of levels, not really caring about the placement too much.  A YouTuber said &quot;it&apos;s non-stop action&quot;.  The original at least gave you the chance to catch your breath.
<br>The original also had better sense about weapon placement.  Given that this is an &quot;old-school-style shooter&quot;, you&apos;d think they&apos;d make you hunt down weapons and think about ammo conservation.  But no.  If what said the YouTuber said is true, if you need a rocket launcher, there&apos;s probably one not five steps back from your current location.
<br>
<br>And now on to what I really wanted to talk about... the thing that upset me the most out of everything...  The music.
<br>The original soundtrack is something I greatly enjoyed from the original.  Here, however...  Every single track is utter garbage.  They had a perfectly good soundtrack they could have just redone to fit the given styles.  But no.  Instead, it&apos;s thunderous electric guitars everywhere you turn!  Every song in this game has them.  Every song!  Even Adagio for Strings and Mist Ache!  How?!
<br>The arrangement of every piece of music is also poorly done.  All my favorites, &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;, &quot;CCCool&quot;, &quot;Goin&apos; Down the Fast Way&quot;... terrible!  Absolutely terrible!  There may be an option to change to the original soundtrack, but why did they bother?  The original soundtrack doesn&apos;t work with what they&apos;ve done at all!
<br>
<br>This absolutely does not feel like Rise of the Triad to me.  It&apos;s almost a hollow parody...  Clearly, they were going for &quot;darker and edgier&quot; here and while they succeeded in both aspects, it also loses pretty much all of what made the original game fun: Great music, curious weapons of mass destruction, simple level design with complex secrets, and above all, humor and inside jokes!  The YouTuber I mentioned said this game has humor, but I sincerely failed to see the humor in sub-bosses named after body parts and innuendo.  That&apos;s the extent of the humor, by the way.  I did not see even the slightest sign of any of the inside jokes from the original game.  At all.
<br>
<br>I were to give the game some credit, I guess I&apos;d have to say they did some mildly interesting stuff with the source material.  Complete redesigns of weapons, characters, and levels make this game completely detached from the original.  Some would say that&apos;s a great thing.  I personally don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>As I said at the start, I just cannot call this game anything other than disappointing.  There was so much potential, but it was utterly wasted here.  At every single opportunity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3915640">Expand</a></span>

What a childhood defining game this was. Cannot recall how many hours I put into this on the family PC running DOS.

<br>
<br>Which is why it pains me to say that this doesn&apos;t quite match up to the original. Unfortunately, it is a game that is designed for two decades ago, with graphics from one decade ago. The quick-paced, rocket-jumping, ludicrous gibs-inducing play-style of this just seems like it doesn&apos;t fit in today&apos;s AAA game library. Enemies often bugged out, you&apos;d glitch into a wall, or take phantom damage and stroll around on 0%. Almost seems rushed.
<br>
<br>However, what does save it for me, are the throwbacks to the original, which I&apos;d imagine is what this game is aiming for above all else. The remixed soundtrack, the ridiculous weapons, the coin collecting, and the throwbacks to classic enemies. And for those die-hard completest, there are heaps of achievements to keep you occupied.
<br>
<br>After beating this game, I learned it does have a spot in Steam, if you&apos;ve played the original. It&apos;ll standard and quick level designs makes it the &quot;McDonalds&quot; of the Steam Library. Cheap, unremarkable, but you get a quick high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4907757">Expand</a></span>

The boss battles are very fun and inventive and the game-play is **** insane (fighting a crippled nerdy nazis with a baseball bat kind of insane thing). The enemies are pretty interesting as some will attempt steal your gun and try to kill you with it, one throws grenades, one does a barrel roll, and one taunts you in hilariously executed Arnold Schwarzenegger puns. There are also loads of secrets and puns (My favorite being dedicated to Full Life Consequences Freedman). The game is easily at least a 7.5 experience... to me almost a 9! :D
<br>
<br>Also if your going to let reviews impact your decision at least ignore IGN. They didn&apos;t mention boss battles which occur at the end of every single chapter (making me wonder if they even got to one considering in their game-play video they didn&apos;t beat the 1st mission.) They said the enemies don&apos;t attempt to dodge your gunshots and that they don&apos;t throw grenades which both are proven false within the 1st level as Heavy&apos;s will throw grenades and officers do dodge your bullets and rockets (makes you wonder if they even beat the 1st level which is about 5-10 minutes long). They trashed this game for glitches and gave it 4.3 saying illogical stuff like &quot;The mechanics are dated (without really explaining how so) and thrashing it for glitches, while giving Skyrim a 9.5 and writing off all of it&apos;s glitches with &quot;Oh yeah theirs some crashes, some things that make it incomplete-able but the game is real epic so 9.5!&quot; Please only pay attention to non Biased reviews and ignore trash reviews like IGN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=6473033">Expand</a></span>

ROTT&apos;s history reads like a &quot;True Hollywood Story&quot; of game development, with origins as a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, and reusing of elements that were cut from the final version of the first Doom, itself originally conceived as a fantasy RPG. You play as one of five members of HUNT, black-shirted, trash-talking secret agents, against the forces of the Triad: a gaggle of demon-worshiping nazi lookalikes with a penchant for leaving rocket launchers lying around- to their detriment and your amusement. They&apos;ve taken over an island off the coast of Los Angeles and have nukes or something. That&apos;s about the extent of the premise. Thankfully, ROTT isn&apos;t the sort of game, or even the sort of FPS, that needs a plot.
<br>
<br>We seem to be experiencing a resurgence of the old-school FPS, what with the amazing Wolfenstein: The New Order (which, I might add, has an excellent plot) and the forthcoming, long-awaited Doom 4. If Quake 5 isn&apos;t announced relatively soon, I&apos;m going to be profoundly disappointed. With that in mind, this version of ROTT is about as old-school as you could possibly get. There is no regenerating health, no cover, no map, and no voice in your ear telling you what to do and where to go (not that I ever minded maps and mission control). You sprint at top speed all the time, enemies come at you from all sides and there are big, garish collectible coins and health pickups scattered about. There are a large number of jumping puzzles as well, thanks to ROTT&apos;s trademark floating platforms and jump pads, a holdover from the original game&apos;s engine limitations preventing things like solid bridges from being made. Pounding buttrock accompanies almost every level, enemies explode into ludicrous clouds of red mist and gibs, and the game even tracks your score and percentage of level completion. Your arsenal is limited, but potent: you can carry two pistols, a submachine gun, a special melee weapon and one launcher, of which there are many: regular rockets, ones that explode in a cross-shaped napalm spread, double rockets, horizontal fire waves that travel forward along the ground, seeking missiles and even a rotary automatic minirocket gun are all to be found, as well as the Doomstick: a triple-barreled, pump-action shotgun with alternate explosive fire. If you pick up a new launcher you drop the one you were holding and can return for it later, if you haven&apos;t passed any points of no return. The game is split up into distinct levels with checkpoints, across five episodes, each culminating in an explosive, shoot-at-it-until-it-dies boss fight, just like the good old days.
<br>
<br>Except not everything about the old days was good. In its anal-retentive effort to mimic the early 90s style of FPS, it also retains the elements that annoyed me about those games. Some of the levels can be a bit maze-like, though not to the extent of Doom, and mission-critical switches and levers can often blend into the background. It&apos;s also relentlessly difficult, even on normal: Enemies hit hard and health pickups aren&apos;t as plentiful as they could be, and if you take more then one or two bad hits from a boss, you might as well reload your quicksave. There&apos;s also the dead horse of color-coded keys and doors, and some of the secret areas are so inane that you&apos;d have better luck nocliping to find them. Many of them all but require you to rocket jump to get them as well, and while I wouldn&apos;t call that a drawback per se, shooting yourself in the foot with one of this game&apos;s launchers is really not a good idea. The game also has a few glaring technical problems: The lighting is either oppresively dark or so bright as to hurt my eyes, and the game is subject to semifrequent crashes, typically on loading a quicksave.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a multiplayer mode I haven&apos;t tried, but I would hope it&apos;s a faithful recreation of the sort of deathmatch play you&apos;d find in Doom or the first ROTT.
<br>
<br>If you grew up playing these sorts of games then ROTT will be a rare treat for you in this day and age, but less hardcore players may want to pass this one up, and I mean that in the nicest way possible: ROTT is not for the casual shooter fan, and it was never intended to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-the-triad/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507799">Expand</a></span>
