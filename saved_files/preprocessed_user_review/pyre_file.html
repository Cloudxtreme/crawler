<br>-Gameplay is very fun and innovative, but higher difficulties become easily frustrating as there are simply too many things to keep in mind to win in a satisfying manner (Complex strategies are counter-productive and hard to pull off!)
<br>-The story is interesting and emotional, but the ending is surprisingly mundane and bittersweet. The story never seems to really climax, which is the biggest issue for me.
<br>-Music is great as it&apos;s customary for Supergiant, but there aren&apos;t enough songs to carry the game on its musical qualities alone.
<br>7/10 is what i&apos;d give all three games from Supergiant to date. More detailed art, more songs, stronger plot climax and simpler, tighter gameplay is what i&apos;d like to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pyre/user-reviews?user_review_id=7455674">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall though, the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive. As a game that demands multiple play-throughs to really experience the full effect, I can&apos;t bring myself to suffer the repetition.
<br>
<br>On its own, this game is well-made, and is unique (albeit repetitive). As the third title from Supergiant Games, it is lacking in the luster and the awe that came after playing Bastion and Transistor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pyre/user-reviews?user_review_id=7437459">Expand</a></span>

Starting out of nowhere, it never really allows the faceless, nameless and voiceless player to find out what is going on, since all the other characters are only available for interaction when the developers allow it and reveal little to no information. There is contextual help in dialogue, but it typically reveals fluff details about the locales or characters, but not the overall setting. The purpose and way of reaching the goal (whatever the goal may be) remain unclear.
<br>
<br>Aside from the VN there&apos;s an aggressive football RPG. However, any RPG actions the player can take can be easily invalidated by the VN part, making freshly empowered characters refuse to participate in a Rite for plot reasons. And those RPG actions rarely change the game drastically. It is possible to make a character faster, bigger or more destructive, but there aren&apos;t any new radical abilities to gain.
<br>
<br>And the biggest problem is the uniqueness of the Rites. It is impossible to predict what lies ahead and every new Rite brings new enemies with new abilities and tactics. Whereas Bastion and Transistor allowed the losing player to reformulate their approach and try again, Pyre simply tells the player &quot;You should have done X, but that information is largely useless until your next playthrough&quot;.
<br>
<br>Made as a mixture of disjointed elements neither of which is entirely engaging in its own right, Pyre feels like a failed experiment at something new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pyre/user-reviews?user_review_id=7433904">Expand</a></span>

This is no RPG, it&apos;s a sports game trying to masquerade itself as something else.</span>

<br>
<br>As much as I love Supergiant Games. I cant finish this game. It was just boring to me.
<br>So repetitive. Too much talking. We used to like Supergiant Games because they always blended dialogue, narrative and story WITH the Gameplay. Now they are completely separate. To be honest im reading dialogue of these characters 90% of the Game. Then i get these abilities that don&apos;t do much. They are really shallow and unrewarding.
<br>
<br>Summary:-
<br>
<br>Posives:
<br>-Great Artwork as always
<br>-Great Soundtrack as always
<br>-Great Gameplay as always
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>-I personally did not care about the story. It didnt make me want to.
<br>-Gameplay does not blend well with the story. (SECOND MOST IMPORTANT POINT)
<br>-90% of the time im reading a story I don&apos;t care about. It gets too repetitive and mundane after a few hours. I really dont give a damn about the story. (MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF ALL)
<br>-SkillTree was boring and did not bring anything really interesting unlike their other games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pyre/user-reviews?user_review_id=7431066">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Pyre is NOT an RPG. It is some sort of basketball game played by cartoon characters that look like villains in a Samurai Jack episode. The story is presented in a visual novel format that is linear, and again has nothing to do with an RPG. If this is an RPG, so is Ninja Gaiden and Doom.  Shame on the developers for misrepresenting this product.</span>

<br>Favorite Thing: I really like the world they built. I wish they would have explored it more.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: While the gameplay was solid and fun it gets repetitive after 15 hours.

<br>
<br>Sound 5/5
<br>The soundtrack is by Darren Korb, so naturally, it&apos;s outstanding. The way it alters based on events is equally outstanding. The voice acting is likewise good. Despise most of the dialogue being non-English, the actors still deliver great emotion to their parts.
<br>
<br>Design 5/5
<br>Yet another aspect Supergiant has under their belt thanks to the amazing art of Jen Zee. Everything stands out. Every character, triumvirate, island, etc. Just a pretty looking game. Despite the ideas of the races being none-too original (eg: Tree people is pretty common), they are all distinguished in nature and design, and are all very beautiful.
<br>
<br>Story 4/5
<br>Difficult to grasp at first, but as it reveals itself, the world shows how absolutely packed with lore it is. It adds up to an immersive experience that left me wanting more.
<br>
<br>Gameplay 3/5
<br>Supergiant usually falls flat in this aspect (though &apos;fall flat&apos; is only in comparison to itself). The rites are simply an ultimate-style ball sport. It looks nice, and plays satisfyingly, but there isn&apos;t much to distinguish it.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>A great story backed by visuals, and soundtrack, and a decent game. If you are searching for Supergiant&apos;s specific old formula, a great sport game, or not much reading, this won&apos;t do it for you. Otherwise, buy it.
<br>
<br>Price worth: 100%

Going in blind may have been a bad idea, but I don&#x2019;t regret it. Supergiant Games&#x2019; new game, Pyre, in the simplest of terms is a mystical 3-on-3 basketball league where everyone is seeking redemption. The creators behind Bastion and Transistor created another intricate world with layers upon layers of backstory; a deeply rich and vibrant world in which Pyre takes place in. Supergiant Games has this amazing ability to immerse you into a completely different world each game with their beautiful art and their powerful music. I was drawn into the world as soon as the music began and set the mood for the story to come. When the first characters appeared on screen, I just kind of stared in awe at the screen. Each character, each expression, and each line was carefully tailored to fully immerse you into the world of Pyre.
<br>
<br>The game revolves around a group of exiles in a purgatory-like world called the Downside. You are found by the Nightwings, a triumvirate that are currently running the rites in the name of a mysterious benefactor. You are known as a Reader, one of the few literate people in the world. In the Commonwealth&#x2014;from where all the exiles were cast out&#x2014;literacy is outlawed. You are quickly thrown into the world of the Rites and the passages presented by the stars. The story focuses on everyone&#x2019;s motive to return to the Commonwealth. Pyre is a story about what freedom means to everyone. It&#x2019;s through the story that each character including the Reader, begin to learn and understand their own definition of freedom.
<br>
<br>Only a single character can be moved at a time and when they pick up the ball, they lose their aura. Each character is able to manipulate their aura in different ways. The most common one is being able to shoot their aura in front of them. If an opponent is hit by any of your auras, they are banished for a short time, only to reappear after a couple of seconds. This goes for the player as well. This is where the intricacies of the gameplay begin to appear. Depending on who you have chosen to represent you in the rite, their abilities change how you play the game. Each pyre has a set health of 100 and certain items/abilities can change that. Depending on how high the Glory stat is per character, they deal damage equal to that number. Once you score with a character, that character remains banished until either you score with another character or if the enemy scores. You can prevent this with character abilities/items and the throwing mechanic. When the character has the ball, they can throw the ball into the pyre or to other players. The distance and number of points scored is determined by how long the player charges the throw. If you score through throwing, no characters will be banished.
<br>
<br>After you play in your first liberation rite, whether win or lose, you begin the cycle again. You begin to challenge the same triumvirates on different maps. The triumvirates become stronger each time you face them with items and abilities being added to their repertoire. Despite, the fact that you are playing the same set of opponents, the map variety changes how you have to play the rite against the opponent. One map has gaps that will propel you in whatever direction you are facing, while another has constantly moving objects.
<br>
<br>Pyre is a visual novel with a compelling story and gameplay that strongly resembles a generic sports game. I felt connected to characters and I genuinely felt happy when they were able to return to the Commonwealth. The character development reflected heavily on the overall message that Supergiant wanted to portray. The gameplay was the most lackluster part. To be fair, I am not a big fan of sports games; I can count the amount of hours I have ever played a sports game on one hand. The gameplay was not bad, it was just not my thing. The eventual repetition of the rites was meant to achieve a closer understanding as to why the other triumvirates were running the rites, but I thought that the repetition added no extra value other than story. Supergiant tried to alleviate the feeling of repetition through scrambling the maps and opponents, but it never felt different enough. I found myself heavily relying on those with faster mobility. I would constantly choose  characters with higher quickness to rush the ball. Once I had the ball in hand, I would maneuver to lure the opponent AI away from their pyre, pass the ball and proceed to score. I cheesed my way through the game. The combat and scoring against the other triumvirates got repetitive quickly and I never really got into it. I still enjoyed playing through the game. I found my rhythm in the matches and quickly burned through them to reach the story parts. My style of play never felt cheap because the reward of progressing in the story was well worth it for me. Pyre&apos;s story drew me in and the rites were just enough fun to keep me interested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pyre/user-reviews?user_review_id=7523391">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>amazing game, i love all of supergiant games work and this was no exception. It has a similar art style, music, and atmosphere to their other games, but brings in a completely new mechanic as well with the 3v3 battle system. I loved the story/atmosphere/music/art, but the gameplay wasn&apos;t as great as transistor or bastion</span>
