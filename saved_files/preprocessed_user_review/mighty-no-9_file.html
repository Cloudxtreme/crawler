<br>Pros:
<br>-Graphics and character design mostly, very cute and well drawn
<br>-Music feels like akin to Mega Man but not as good
<br>-Game ran fine on my system though I understand many have had problems with it so take this with a grain of salt
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Level design feels off for the control set
<br>-The dash has no i-frames, watch gameplay and you&apos;ll understand why this is a problem
<br>-Bosses are annoying due to all attacks having the same wind up, the NES and SNES games did this better
<br>-The platforming is poorly designed
<br>-The level design is full of instant death traps/pits that feel cheap</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6505607">Expand</a></span>

The new absord function works like a charm, the scoreboard encourages more perfectionate play, the music is above average, the list goes on and on! Sure it has many pits and one-shotting traps, but that is what makes it feel like a Megaman Game. Just remember that Megaman was never perfect, after all, you&apos;ve been comparing this to megaman to a near nit-picking manner and therefore considering it Sonic Boom bad, which it is clearly not! It&apos;s as good as Undertale, and I&apos;m leaving it at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6535619">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What makes platformers good even to this day, is a good level design. Mighty No. 9, sadly, has abysmal design when it comes to that; enemies and backgrounds repeat like in a 1940&apos;s cartoon, having to overuse the dash mechanic gets old really fast, unbalanced challenge with difficulty spikes at random, and underwhelming and overplayed (but thankfully skippable) story, horrible English voice acting, questionable boss mechanics, performance hiccups, poor graphics, and average to decent soundtrack.
<br>
<br>My question to Inafune and the team of MN9 would be: What happened? Where did it all go wrong? The mismanagement this title had is insane. This is no way to treat your fans. Countless delays and overall dishonesty was disrespectful to MN9 loyals.
<br>
<br>I backed the original kickstarter and I regret every cent that I put on Mighty No. 9. But look, the reason I am being extra hard on this is because we can&apos;t let companies like comcept keep getting away with pulling a move like this on fans. We&apos;re enthusiasts that might jump early on a specific project, but we&apos;re not zombies that you can mistreat at will and we&apos;ll just invest in your work regardless. We deserve better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6513043">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unlike some people, I&apos;ve been able to launch and play the game without CTDs, freezing, or framerate drops. This has allowed me to fully experience the unresponsive controls, unpredictable hitboxes, and frustrating-as-balls stage design. The bosses are all uniquely horrific in design, but a special shout-out goes to Mighty No. 1, the fire guy, whose instant-kill no-escape grapple attack has me seriously contemplating chucking my PC at the wall.
<br>
<br>In general, there are way too many instant kills scattered about to artificially inflate the difficulty of stages that are otherwise adequately challenging. As a veteran Mega Man gamer (I went on a marathon of the entire Classic, X, and Zero series to get ready for MN9 launch) I had hoped my skill level would be a pretty good match for this game. Sadly, if the normal stage boss fights are anything to go by, I&apos;m apparently nowhere near the target level the game was designed for. Doubly sad, there&apos;s no Easy Mode. I have to wonder, was this mess playtested exclusively by Korean professional gamer cyborgs on meth, or not at all?
<br>
<br>I award this game 2 points: 1 for working at all and 1 for the cute plug-shaped powerup dispenser guy, who is your only friend in the cruel, unforgiving wasteland that is Mighty No. 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6506144">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Art Design is simplistic, and as many will point out the larger explosions are poor. But actual enemy design is good, cartoon-esque and fitting to a mega man spiritual successor.
<br>
<br>Sound-design is very good. Until a &apos;human&apos; character opens their mouth. Ironically the scientists that built beck are more robotic than their creations. But things &apos;pew&apos; as I expect from a mega man game, and when you do defeat multiple enemies, that sounds are proper.
<br>
<br>Game design is complicated. Let me get one thing clear: You will die, a lot. and often it will not be your fault. Instant death spikes and bosses with supposedly easily dodged K-O attacks are in no short supply. But it was never enough for me to throw my control. I just got angry I didn&apos;t give up. And as Ben
<br>&apos;Yahtzee&apos; Croshaw put it, &quot;Angry gets **** down.&quot; You quickly realize your dash is over-powered and can bypass certain sections with ease, and then you realize the developers realized this as well and placed the purple insta-death spikes where you&apos;d dash into. Reset, gnash your teeth and go through the level properly. I know I sound down on it, but if you&apos;ve played Mega Man 9 and 10 you know the frustration leads to immaculate pride upon succeeding.
<br>
<br>There is love in this game, and events can occur that you might actually miss entirely. I had previously met characters show up in the middle of the levels to assist me, I found different paths to take with boosts and health, and for the most part I&apos;ve enjoyed the personality behind each boss. No Shakespearean drama here but something light-hearted and child friendly that I don&apos;t necessarily mind.

The soul of Mega Man is almost completely absent aside from a few design nods like falling down a big sequence of screens dodging instant death walls. Graphics suck, voice acting and writing are abysmal, but really the core gameplay is, well I don&apos;t want to say it&apos;s good but there&apos;s some fun to be had. I guess most of the time it&apos;s inoffensive with some peaks into fun land but also no shortage of dips into crap town.
<br>
<br>I guess if I had to sum it up, if you stripped away all the hype, the kickstarter, the promises, the delays, the budget, and the expectations of a mega man successor, what we have left is a half-decent but ultimately forgettable 2.5D action platformer if it were judged as a $10 release on steam by a random unknown indie dev.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6506353">Expand</a></span>

So what&apos;s my take and issues with the game?
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>The Xel absorption angle does bring something new to an otherwise basic plot and it sets up the game just fine. Could the worldbuilding and character development been done better? Sure, but personally I usually don&apos;t care for stories in my platformers as it usually doesn&#x2019;t add anything to the experience. But I did sit through this one for review purposes, and though I have no issues with it in terms of storytelling, I did find it distracting. For a game that&apos;s practically built around speedrunning, the cutscenes during the stage and in-between just grinds things to a halt. Thankfully you can skip them, but then there&apos;s still audio dialogue that play at certain points of a stage. I was fine with it for the most part and the text dialogue that played with the audio never blocked anything important, but I can imagine a few of you will be wishing for a way to turn it off.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS
<br>Let&apos;s get this out of the way: the graphics are pretty bad.  There are mobile games that look better than this, and it&apos;s not bad enough to consider it to be an homage to platformers of the past.  The 2D drawings for Mighty No 9 are fantastic, but unfortunately do not translate well with the 3D style they have chosen to go with.  They&apos;re all fake and lifeless and look as if they&apos;re made out of rubber of plastic.
<br>
<br>MUSIC
<br>Mega Man has been known for its music, but sadly it&#x2019;s just passable for Mighty No 9. It&#x2019;s not bad, not even close, but I wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily call them good either. Outside of the main theme, none of the songs are memorable nor do they pump you up for what&#x2019;s in store. This is most notable when facing bosses, where in past Mega Man as you meet the end stage boss a song plays that gives you sense of impending doom. As for Mighty No 9? The soothing beginning of the main theme starts to play out when you meet your foe. It totally ruins the mood and the actual boss theme that follows doesn&#x2019;t help to bring you back into the mood.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>Dashing is the main attraction to the game as it helps you to traverse the stages and is needed in order to use his Xel Absorption ability. You can absorb enemies far faster than simply killing them with your arm cannon and doing so grants Beck with power ups that help with taking care of the next wave of enemies. Furthermore, enemy placement and level design practically demands that you use dash every chance you get. And at first I have no issues with this, but the novelty of it all wears out fairly quickly and I grew tired of pressing the dash button far more than the attack button. You also realize an odd conundrum: the ability to dash constantly gives you too much freedom as you can at times just skip past enemies, but dashing to being the best way to take out enemies also feels restrictive. Thankfully getting new weapons from the bosses alleviates some of the monotonousness, but you&#x2019;ll most likely find that only 2 or 3 of them are useful outside of boss battles.
<br>
<br>Level design wise, it can get pretty empty at times. It shares many of the same features of a level you may find in a typical Mega Man game: go through a hallway full of enemies, fight a mini boss, another hallway of enemies and then the boss. However there seems to be something lacking with Mighty No 9&#x2019;s levels as if there&#x2019;s not enough variety of obstacles or enemies spread about the stages. There are instances where things do get hectic as you navigate through obstacles and enemies, but it&#x2019;s few and far between.
<br>
<br>The game is difficult in typical Mega Man fashion, where cheap deaths are plenty and pulling your hair out as you try and figure out a boss&#x2019; attack pattern is the norm. I&#x2019;m fan of that so I&#x2019;m totally ok with all of that!  My main issue with the gameplay are with the controls. They&#x2019;re simply not intuitive enough and pretty inconsistent. I can&#x2019;t count the times where my dash would overshoot me one minute and then have it not push me far enough the next. Anyone who has tried to dash under the turbines in Dynatron&#x2019;s stage can probably relate to this. There have also been numerous occasions where I&#x2019;m hanging off a ledge and drop down when I was trying to jump up. I&#x2019;m all for a game being challenging and punishing me for not being precise, but it&#x2019;s hard for me to find any enjoyment when the game doesn&#x2019;t let me control Beck the way I want to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6511983">Expand</a></span>

<br>the main robot name is &quot;Beck&quot; he plays most like &quot;Megaman 3&quot; simple canon fire, jump and dash. the whole game is a mix of Megaman 3 &amp; Megaman X.. when u get the other mighty robots after every Stage. for me is Mighty #9, Megaman on steroids, its look really good and Clean, had a fast &amp; good gameplay and its like all other megaman games Very Hard !! Pls set the Sounds efects on 8-bit &amp; Japanese voice, than u will get one of the best Megaman Soundtracks ever!!  for me it is not the best megaman but it can hold easy with every other megaman. so i  would give this game  80% from 100%. My review is for the Steam Version, i had never Lags or Slowdowns. i run the 32-bit version Full HD, Highest Settings &amp; V-Sync, if had someone problems, try the 64-bit version. a friend of mine had the Wii U version, and he had only one slowdown, in the  mighty # 4 stage. for me, the bad reviews are from persons they never was a fan of megaman games and try now 2 manipulate with bad reviews this good megaman game &amp; the independent video game developer Comcept Inc.
<br>some last words for the graphics. like i said it before, it looks good &amp; clean for a Megaman game, the Details are average, i now most of the reviewers hate the graphics, the fact is, this game will release for 3ds and all other systems and ComCept Inc. try a way 2 let this game look on every system the same and this is for the most others maybe a disappointment. the question is what people really expect ? GTA 5 graphics ? or Metal Gear Solid 5 Graphics ? can it look same on 3ds &amp; pc than ? asks yourselves..

I have an R9 390 paired to a freesync monitor, and the game runs and plays like butter.  I just finished it.  My son loves watching me play this.  The characters are cool, the game has loads of charm, and it&apos;s hard in all the right ways.  The controls are tight and solid, and the puzzles are clever.  I had to use almost all of the different forms (suits) to get through the game.  There are efficient ways of getting past certain areas/enemies/bosses, then there is also the not-the-best approach which will see you facing considerable resistance, which means you&apos;re probably doing it wrong.  It works out great.  I loved every part of this game and would have loved to see it franchised out into other things like cartoons, movies, action figures, sequels, however, it&apos;s a shame the negativity hype train killed all that.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a gamer that loves good gaming, pick this up.  This is a good game.  It&apos;s even a great one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=7286108">Expand</a></span>

I understand the bad feelings, since I was also upset by all the delays (the rocky launch hasn&apos;t helped perceptions either).  But if you set all those negative feelings aside and evaluate the game just on its own merits, it&apos;s actually quite fun --- not stellar or game-changing by any stretch, but also nowhere near being mediocre.
<br>
<br>People have opined that it looks worse than indie-games or even 3DS titles, and I think they&apos;re a fair bit ways over-exaggerating.  In action the game  looks much better than I thought it did from all the gameplay videos I had originally seen, and the play mechanics work out very well in the final product.
<br>
<br>Some people have also been annoyed by the voiceovers, but I personally found them to be fitting, and lending depth to the atmosphere of the world in ways that past traditional MM games weren&apos;t able to.  Actually, in some ways the game is a mixture of a lot of different MM titles at once --- classic MM, MM Legends with the voiceovers, MMX with some of the game mechanics, etc.  And tbh, for me personally it feels like it borrowed in positive ways that are enjoyable and make the game fun and challenging to play.
<br>
<br>Anyways, overall it&apos;s a fun game that&apos;s better than critics have given it credit, and I think the bad blood (along with the internet hate train) are preventing MN9 from getting as fair a shake as it ought to.  I&apos;m actually pretty satisfied with my purchase, and am a bit disappointed people might not play the game just because of some kneejerk reactions early on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507545">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics aren&#xB4;t very good but that isn&#xB4;t the most important area of a game. The designs of the characters are very nice, the powers feels good and the difficulty is challenging.
<br>
<br>The story is irrelevant, like in any other game of its style. I never see a mario, sonic or megaman game with a good storyline and i really like all of them and i don&#xB4;t see anyone complaining about it.
<br>
<br>The performance is my PC that only have  a GTX 950 is very good. I run it maxed out at 60 FPS without drops, so I don&#xB4;t see any problem here.
<br>
<br>I think that the expectations for it were too damn high and that&#xB4;s what really kill the game for the vast majority. I understand the backers that put their money in, really I do, but give to the game some credit, play a couple of hours and don&#xB4;t pick the hate train without any thinking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6515505">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now on to the actual gameplay.  It feels a lot like playing a megaman X game while trying to speed run.  Some people will probably like the fast paced action and some probably won&apos;t.  I for one have enjoyed it quite a bit.  All of the bosses feel like megaman bosses and all of the stages feel like megaman stages as well, so if that is what you are looking for, you will like this game.  As far as difficulty goes, it is a medium-hard game.  I have played through most of the old megaman games and all of the X series, and I have still had to use a continue on nearly every stage for one reason or another.  I would say overall that the difficulty is probably too high for people who aren&apos;t particularly good at games, but for seasoned gamers is probably just right.
<br>
<br>Looking at the game as a whole (ignoring all of the pushbacks and kickstarter shenanigans), I am definitely enjoying the game so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6506139">Expand</a></span>

This was Inafune testing the waters and trying to see if there was appetite and there was but not an insane amount.
<br>
<br>The gameplay to me feels like a mix between MM8 and MMX, the controls feel tight and the mechanics encourage fast and accurate gameplay which is a hallmark of the MM series.
<br>
<br>I feel like I definitely got my money&apos;s worth and really enjoyed having the opportunity to play something new in the genre.  If Capcom made a good new MM game of course I would play it too, but after killing MM Legends 3 I doubt anything will ever come out of there.
<br>
<br>As for Nostalgia, the original MM games were garbage, yes, we remember them fondly but it seems more likely a case of stockholm syndrome.  They definitely had good elements, but the MMX series was far better designed at it&apos;s high points than MM1-6.  The MMZ games may have been the best of the series ever and maybe as good as you can possibly make.
<br>
<br>I am all to happy to have backed MN9 and would gladly back a sequel having the engine work all done the gameplay, story and voice acting improvements would be a huge opportunity to polish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508825">Expand</a></span>

<br>One, I kickstarted the game because I wanted a new Mega Man game, and I&apos;d prefer one in the vein of X and Zero, not the NES style.
<br>Two, I had read a lot of bad things about the game before I played it, which I&apos;ll to some extent cover.
<br>
<br>So let&apos;s start with technical stuff. The game runs really well, I had solid 60FPS with my old gtx 660 card, and load times are really short. With the game installed on a brand-new 5900 RPM hard drive (not SSD) the load times are for the most part a second or two, allowing leaving and entering levels quickly and easily.
<br>There is, however, one major flaw on the technical side, and that&apos;s the fact that the borderless window mode doesn&apos;t work, at least not for me, not even with the help of external applications. I had to play either in a smaller window or fullscreen, which is unfortunate but ultimately didn&apos;t matter much.
<br>
<br>Next, we have graphics. The graphics are good for what they do, but not impressive in any way. This might be to ensure it runs well on multiple platforms, but it&apos;s a bit sad to see anyway. Some more work on more commonly seen things, like explosions, would have been welcome. Overall, though, as long as you like the style the graphics do their job well. The game runs, as I said, smoothly, and it&apos;s easy to predict hitboxes and such most of the time. There is a tiny issue in one or two places with the 3D graphics causing perspective issues, there was a door I didn&apos;t see because I was too close, and some pits are difficult to see the edge of at some angles, but it works well for the most part.
<br>
<br>So, controls. I played the game with a controller that looks like an X-Box one but is made for the PC. The game responds really well, I couldn&apos;t feel any delay between pushing a button and the character responding. Air control is pretty good, and there are a few really tight squeezes where it&apos;s needed, so I&apos;d say the controls are the best, most well-polished part of the game.
<br>There is, however, a few important things to note for any Mega Man fans; you can dash as many times as you want without landing, and there&apos;s no charge attack.
<br>Also, switching between your extra weapons/forms is a bit awkward until you get used to it, since I at least found no way to do it on the pause menu, instead you have to go through them all while the clock&apos;s running.
<br>
<br>Story is not what I consider Mega Man&apos;s strong point, and Mighty no. 9 follows suit. The voice work is, in my opinion, functional. I would probably prefer to play without it. The story is essentially there to give you an explanation for running through the maps, it&apos;s not really good. It&apos;s not really important though, this game is about the action, not the story.
<br>
<br>Level design is, for the most part, good. There are a few maps with a few too many instant death mechanics (I can recall three, your mileage may vary), and I think I skipped a lot of the water/ice level, but I&apos;m not sure (which should say something). But it&apos;s good at teaching you how to do stuff, it looks great, the music is wonderful, and as long as Avi isn&apos;t talking everything&apos;s really nice.
<br>
<br>Boss design is also, mostly, good. They&apos;re designed with two things in mind, there&apos;s no charge attack and you can dash like a maniac. If you&apos;re not good at pressing buttons fast, this is to your detriment. I didn&apos;t find it a big issue, the most I had to play through one of the &quot;main eight&quot; levels was three times due to a extra nasty boss, but generally their difficulty seems in line with most Mega Man games, which is what we wanted with the Kickstarter. Right?
<br>
<br>As mentioned, the music is great. The rest of the sound design is also spot-on with the exception of the voice work. I doubt it&apos;s the voice actors&apos; fault, though, it seems they went for a very cartoony direction with the story, which I guess is fine, but it means many people are better off skipping most of it.
<br>
<br>Finally, there are several game modes beyond the story mode. I havn&apos;t tried challenges or the boss rush, but if you&apos;re the type who wants to do everything there&apos;s certainly a lot of it compared to your average Mega Man.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: the game is not super impressive in every way. Then again, it&apos;s not bad either. It is pretty much exactly what I wanted from the kickstarter, so I&apos;m very satisfied.
<br>If you didn&apos;t kickstart it, should you buy it? If you&apos;ve played and liked Mega Man after the NES era, especially if you liked the X and Zero and series, this could be exactly what you want.
<br>If you don&apos;t like games that challenge you, or you can&apos;t press buttons really fast for extended periods of time, this probably isn&apos;t for you. It&apos;s designed to be demanding of the player, perhaps slightly more so than its predecessors. And I havn&apos;t even tried higher difficulties yet.
<br>In the end, the game does exactly what it was supposed to. It&apos;s Mega Man but not. And that&apos;s why I liked Mighty no. 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6512362">Expand</a></span>

Still, it is a platformer of moderate to high difficulty with somewhat intuitive controls. Character designs in of themselves are still fun, and the English voice acting is actually of rather good quality.
<br>
<br>That being said, the game does look graphically lazy. It feels like I&apos;m playing a recent 3D rendered game with the graphics settings on low so I can play it on an old computer. Characters barely move around when speaking, which is definitely not the standard these days (though this would be in line with older Mega Man and X titles....).  The promotion for this game has also been somewhat lackluster, and in some cases just terrible, which may not have helped its case. And of course, the development of the game itself has been rocky from the start.
<br>
<br>I still find myself enjoying the game. Sure it&apos;s not the best, but gameplay-wise it still feels solid. Level design is what I&apos;d expect out of a Megaman game. Some people complain about pixel perfect jumps and unintuitive design, but I suspect many of these people only say they&apos;re Megaman fans but really only played a game once or twice. The dash mechanic is certainly a source of controversy, but I do actually like how it forces me to deal with enemies in a way that isn&apos;t just standing from a long distance and shooting them until they&apos;re dead.
<br>
<br>One of the things that did surprise me was defeating bosses means they will help you out in a different stage. That&apos;s definitely retake of the &quot;defeating bosses causes changes in other levels&quot; thing from the Mega Man X series, and one I really like as it does add depth to what would normally be completely one dimensional characters in old Megaman games. Hell, the dialogue between Beck and bosses that happens throughout the level and boss fight are a welcome addition (did I mention the voice acting is pretty good?). The art book released to Kickstarter backers does show that at the very least the team put a lot of thought into the design of characters and bosses for this game (which to me at least is the heart of the old Megaman games).
<br>
<br>If anything, the biggest sin this game commits is being released as-is in the year 2016. If this game came out as-is ten years ago, it would probably receive a lot of praise and be hailed as a successor to Megaman. Instead we get a half-baked product that took 3 years to make. But, y&apos;know, I still like the game, and I don&apos;t see it as something to be crapped all over because it wasn&apos;t the second coming of Megaman. I&apos;m giving this game an 8 out of 10. This is, admittedly, generous, but I feel compelled to tip the score away from reviews that are mostly hot air.
<br>
<br>Disclaimer: this author was a Kickstarter backer, and contributed enough to get physical items (which he still waiting to hear about, and is actually upset, but still doesn&apos;t see this as an excuse to give the game a rating it doesn&apos;t deserve).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6510068">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Best part is &quot;Snap out of it&quot; moment. So take notes...</span>

<br>Mighty No. 9 ha sido uno de los t&#xED;tulos m&#xE1;s pol&#xE9;micos de su a&#xF1;o de lanzamiento, tras diversos retrasos y una campa&#xF1;a de crowfunding detr&#xE1;s no parece haber cumplido con las expectativas de los usuarios lo cual es una l&#xE1;stima. &#xBF;Por qu&#xE9;? Porque posiblemente nos encontremos ante uno de los t&#xED;tulos m&#xE1;s infravalorados de esta generaci&#xF3;n.
<br>Su gameplay es todo lo que cabe esperar de un plataformas cl&#xE1;sico, el personaje responde bien a los movimientos y la mec&#xE1;nica de saltar y disparar es muy sencilla de aprender y usar. A su vez tenemos una habilidad de &quot;Dash&quot; que permite a Beck impulsarse hacia adelante para avanzar m&#xE1;s r&#xE1;pido sobre el terreno (o aire) y absorber a los enemigos debilitados d&#xE1;ndonos la oportunidad de conseguir peque&#xF1;os power-ups que nos suban la velocidad o ataque de forma temporal. Una habilidad que bien usada hace el juego bastante m&#xE1;s din&#xE1;mico y abierto a speedrunners. Como viene siendo habitual en la saga en la que est&#xE1; inspirado al llegar al final de cada nivel nos enfrentaremos a un jefe y al derrotarlo conseguiremos su poder en forma de nueva arma entre la que podremos alternar.
<br>En el &#xE1;mbito de historia no cabe mucho m&#xE1;s que mencionar aparte de lo ya descrito. Tenemos 8 niveles distintos con sus 8 jefes respectivamente, cada uno con sus trampas caracter&#xED;sticas y formas de ser derrotados, tras eso nos veremos las caras con un nivel final. Es decisi&#xF3;n del jugador elegir el orden en el que transcurrir&#xE1;n los niveles de la historia, una elecci&#xF3;n que puede afectar a la dificultad puesto que las armas de algunos jefes son m&#xE1;s eficaces contra otros e incluso los jefes ya derrotados pueden aparecer en mitad de otro nivel para ayudarnos a avanzar desactivando trampas o destruyendo obst&#xE1;culos.
<br>Como a&#xF1;adido Mighty No. 9 cuenta con un modo de desaf&#xED;os individual formado por 30 desaf&#xED;os que van desde desaf&#xED;os para cada arma o por puntos hasta completar la historia entera SIN MORIR UNA SOLA VEZ. Adem&#xE1;s, tambi&#xE9;n posee un modo online en el que se pueden afrontar m&#xE1;s desaf&#xED;os en multijugador cooperativo usando uno de los jugadores a Call, la compa&#xF1;era de Beck, o competir en carreras de puntos a trav&#xE9;s de los niveles de la historia.
<br>Por desgracia, parece que Mighty No. 9 ha sido v&#xED;ctima de la &quot;moda&quot; de cr&#xED;tica que cay&#xF3; sobre &#xE9;l en su lanzamiento, los principales puntos m&#xE1;s utilizados en su contra son el dinero que recaud&#xF3; en su campa&#xF1;a de crowfunding junto a sus numerosos retrasos siendo compar&#xE1;ndos con el resultado del producto final. Pero criticar un producto dando esas &#xFA;nicas dos razones como argumento (&quot;es malo porque han hecho esto con 4 millones de d&#xF3;lares&quot; o &quot;es malo porque tras meses y meses de retraso han obtenido un resultado no esperado&quot;) no es hacer una cr&#xED;tica sobre el producto en s&#xED; sino d&#xE1;rselas de empresario o de desarrollador puesto que no se est&#xE1; juzgando el contenido del juego ni por tanto el juego en s&#xED; sino los medios detr&#xE1;s del desarrollo.
<br>Aclarado esto Mighty No. 9 cumple como juego de plataformas, no es un juego largo pero tampoco excesivamente corto para lo que ofrece, la historia principal se puede completar en apenas unas horas (al igual que cualquier t&#xED;tulo cl&#xE1;sico de Mega Man en los cuales se inspira) lo hacen rejugable y su contenido est&#xE1; adecuado a su precio de salida en PC.
<br>El gameplay cumple en ser entretenido y ofrece al jugador bastante dinamismo una vez se controla la t&#xE9;cnica del &quot;Dash&quot;, no es un juego sumamente dificil pero tampoco es excesivamente f&#xE1;cil avanzar, sin embargo, es bastante inc&#xF3;modo cambiar de arma puesto que no tienen men&#xFA; dedicado y se deben asignar a botones especiales, adem&#xE1;s, en ocasiones el arma m&#xE1;s efectiva y c&#xF3;moda de usar es el buster por defecto.
<br>El dise&#xF1;o de niveles es muy dispar, hay niveles bien detallados que disfrutas de recorrer (Cryo) y otros que se denotan m&#xE1;s vac&#xED;os con la excepci&#xF3;n de varios enemigos para disimular la falta de detalle (Pyro).
<br>En el &#xE1;mbito art&#xED;stico es un juego colorido que por si s&#xF3;lo no es del todo horrible pero combinado con la falta de animaciones en las escenas, la falta de detalle de algunos niveles y efectos y en general el poco acabado que le han dado a los modelos 3D te hace desear que este juego hubiese salido en total 2D como se mostr&#xF3; en su dise&#xF1;o conceptual.
<br>As&#xED; pues, Mighty No. 9 no es un mal juego, es recomendable jugarlo si eres amante de los juegos de plataformas de scroll lateral o de Mega Man siempre y cuando tengas en cuenta que NO est&#xE1;s ante un t&#xED;tulo del bomberdero azul. No es el juego perfecto, pero su falta de &quot;pulido&quot; acompa&#xF1;a bien a su precio y contenido el cual sin lugar a dudas es m&#xE1;s que disfrutable. 6.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=7079823">Expand</a></span>

You play as the titular Mighty No. 9, AKA Beck, who is very blatantly Megaman.
<br>
<br>As is usual in a Megaman game, the robots of the world have gone crazy and you, as Mega-er, I mean, Mighty No. 9, must confront them. You have a handful of allies: Dr. White (really?), Dr. Sanda, and Call, Beck&#x2019;s female counterpart (who is definitely not Roll. And yes, Beck and Call. Like Rock and Roll). You must beat the other Mighty Numbers, #1-8. #7, Brandish, is a red robot with a sword who is definitely, definitely not Zero, and several of the other characters are reminiscent of Mega Man characters as well, at least in terms of the powers they give you.
<br>
<br>Because, yes, when you beat each of the robot bosses, you absorb their powers, and gain a new weapon you can use. And, yes, exactly like in Megaman, each of the bosses is vulnerable to the attacks from one of the other bosses, in a cycle of 8.
<br>
<br>That being said, this is an original game, and the bosses are not copy and paste jobs, and feel somewhat distinct from those in a Megaman game. Indeed, the game itself does have one real distinguishing factors &#x2013; Mighty No. 9&#x2019;s ability to dash through injured enemies to absorb them. While it is possible to kill an enemy simply by shooting them (apart from the bosses), they take a huge number of hits to kill; however, it takes fewer hits to put them into a semi-stunned state, which you can dash through and absorb. This absorption will, in the case of some enemies, give you one of three temporary power-ups (faster speed, better defense, or stronger attacks that go through enemies and walls), and will always slowly fill up a healing tank which, when full, can be used to completely restore Mighty No. 9&#x2019;s life. If you die, however, your tanks all get emptied, and they don&#x2019;t carry over between levels &#x2013; thus, it behooves you to beat a level without dying and without having to spend your healing to have it for the boss.
<br>
<br>This dash can be done on the ground or midair, and gives Mighty No. 9 an even greater amount of mobility than characters like Megaman X; however, it also means that you have to put yourself at risk to absorb enemies. At the end of every stage, you are graded based on, among other things, how fast you absorbed the enemies, and absorbing enemies very quickly or during a continuous air-dash earns you bonus points and extra healing. These points are, ultimately, pointless, but hey, you want a high score, right?
<br>
<br>The biggest catch about the dash comes against the bosses. The bosses, unlike normal enemies, will regenerate out of the hitstun state; the only way to deal them permanent damage is to dash through them quickly. Thus, you want to deal them damage AND be able to dash through them safely all at once, when they are damaged enough to go into a hitstun state. Bosses generally take 3-6 of these states to be killed, and of course, a couple late-game bosses have multiple forms.
<br>
<br>The game itself is fairly standard as far as Megaman games go, but honestly feels slightly uninspired. None of the levels are particularly exciting environments, and none of them feel like they have particularly interesting layouts or mechanics. Most of the difficulty of the game&#x2019;s levels comes from deadly spikes or instant death pits, which some levels have in abundance and other levels have little, if any of. The levels are not necessarily easy (some are, others aren&#x2019;t), but they always feel a bit meh, and the only potentially cool one (one where you are jumping on top of cars in traffic) feels kind of cheap as you &#x201C;go into a tunnel&#x201D; via an area transition rather than actually zooming into one, and then out the other side. There was one level which was a kind of neat idea &#x2013; an enemy sniper robot is attacking you from a distance, and you keep chasing them around the level &#x2013; but the level itself is quite dull.
<br>
<br>The bosses are somewhat more interesting. They are decent enough on average, and have reasonable patterns on the whole. A few of them are a bit boring, and one of them is repeated twice (though the second time, as a midboss), along with a few other midbosses that are kind of mediocre, but the end-level bosses are mostly decent enough, though not especially memorable. One kind of neat thing is that the bosses stick around after you beat them and purge them of the infection, and give you minor assistance in the stage of the boss who is vulnerable to their attack &#x2013; something that the game helpfully marks for the player.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is rather mediocre, though, and never really engaged me; it felt very phoned-in, and the script wasn&#x2019;t anything to write home about, either. It was a pretty generic Megaman-type plotline, and in the end, I doubt I&#x2019;ll remember anything about it.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is a game that is okay, but nothing more. This is a mediocre Megaman game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=7764544">Expand</a></span>

I can understand that the game is underwhelming in some departments (graphics for the most part, and some of the sound design) but I for one found it rather entertaining about 70% of the time (hence the 7/10). There were only a few levels that I did not enjoy (at least partially) and for the most part it&apos;s very fast paced, requiring the player to make great use of the various dashes as well as powerups absorbed from the other mighty numbers. I can only think of two spots where I felt as if I did not know what to do (mechanically, some areas in levels did stump me at times) and those were the regenerative blocks in the final level along with the turbines in number 3&apos;s stage. This was simply from lack of communication and teaching from the game, and it&apos;s something that could have been improved from time to time.
<br>Now for the graphics. They work. That&apos;s kind of it. I haven&apos;t experienced any crashes or anything like that (though I am on PC, and I recommend anyone looking to buy gets it there as it seems to be the most stable build) but there is a considerable bit of slowdown from time to time. Other than that the game runs at 60 with &quot;ultra&quot; settings (ultra in quotes because even though it works and can be rather pleasant sometimes, it often comes off as lazy in its execution).
<br>Essentially, if you want an alright platformer and are willing to drop 20 bucks on it then you might want to consider Mighty No. 9. It isn&apos;t great by any stretch of the imagination but I had fun with it for the most part. I&apos;ve beaten it twice, by the way, and I did this before writing this review as I thought maybe some of the more glaring issues would hit me the second time through. Nothing to note though really. I&apos;d recommend everyone separate themselves from the hype and from the bashing before playing this game and really give it a try. If you like it then good, and if you still hate it... well, that&apos;s fine too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mighty-no-9/user-reviews?user_review_id=6617147">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Honestly it&apos;s better than X6, X7, X8 in terms overall quality. The plot is better than ZX and ZXA and anyone who says the original megaman games didn&apos;t have cheap deaths are deluding themselves. I like it but I feel that it&apos;s flaws are simply being overstated because of how hyped it ended up being and how the developers made too many promises.</span>
