When I went to sleep at 3 AM I felt full of awesomeness, and remembering the disappointment I felt over LotV that felt double great.
<br>
<br>The story felt very logical, realistic and believable. There were no pianos in the bushes, no deus ex, no invulnerable super heroes, just very mortal opponents shooting and hating each other. What I hated in LotV (and SCII in general) was the feeling of kids bedtime story, filled with incognizable gods, unneeded unexplained entities (like the Void, what is that and why do we even need it, good old endless Universe not enigmatic enough?), lack of logic (like where was the Spear of Adun when the zerg sacked Aiur?), all-powerful artifacts that can change your DNA, kill unkillable, ignore laws of nature and probably make you coffee too. The general feeling you are being fed a fairytale with dragons, knights and magic did not leave me through LotV playthrough. But SC is not a fantasy.
<br>
<br>Covert OPs got it all right - I had a feeling I was reading something like Heinlein&apos;s Starship Troopers with black ops twist, it was just so good. I can but only hope that Covert Ops will stick to that style and SCII plot will be redone in the same manner some time. Because in my mind, SCII story stopped just before the assault of Char, when magic started happening.
<br>
<br>The missions, units and Nova&apos;s loadout were simply on a very good level. I would lie to say I was astonished, after hundreds of games I played, but all felt good and solid.
<br>
<br>The game felt a bit short, as many people would agree here. I would definitely prefer awesomeness over length, but well, I did the pack in about two hours, looking up at my steam account I see the games I like have 30 hours of playing at least. Might be the only small flaw I would point out at the moment.
<br>
<br>As a conclusion, I would like to praise Blizzard for their good job. I was highly doubting as to whether to preorder the game or try it from the torrents first. Given that LotV story felt extremely un-starcrafty and out of place, and even though it might be decent by itself, but for sci-fi universe it felt like a disaster. Given that another Blizzard game - Heroes of the Storm - is struggling with basic balance and matchmaking still (and these slikes also keep Nova underpowered and not competitive). I had high doubts that modern Blizzard is able to produce decent product. I am just happy to be proven wrong now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-nova-covert-ops---mission-pack-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6228899">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Five Word Review: RTS good, Nova not so.
<br>Favorite Thing: More Starcraft is always a good thing.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: The story was very bland, generic, unexciting.
<br>
<br>Playtime: ~ 5h
<br>Enjoyment: 7/10
<br>Recommendation: It&apos;ll likely be a long time before you get more Starcraft so yeah.</span>
