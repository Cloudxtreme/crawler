Seems people are reporting an average of 40-60 hour play times if that is of interest though.
<br>
<br>So far it&apos;s great. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, &quot;Oh wow I can do that?&quot; While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, &quot;Oh how was I suppose to think of that?&quot; You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged.
<br>
<br>But don&apos;t be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. Of course I still have much to do so it&apos;s just going to get even more difficult.
<br>
<br>I can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well.
<br>
<br>The developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games. Games I would also recommend checking out. He&apos;s mostly known among devs and people who actually watch out for these lesser known games. But I hope more and more outlets begin to review/cover this game.

<br>Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll deserves it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stephens-sausage-roll/user-reviews?user_review_id=6341294">Expand</a></span>

<br>The rules of the game are completely non-abstract; they are just simplified versions of real-world physics. The rules also never change: they are only revealed, through perfect level design. The sheer number of unique, orthogonal and surprising consequences of these rules that the game manages to pull out of its hat flattens me every time I even think about it. Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll truly is a tour de force in pure level design, and is the strongest case for level design as an art form.
<br>
<br>If you are even remotely tilted towards puzzle games, please, please ignore its low visual fidelity, price tag, and so on, because you may just be missing out on an incredible experience.
<br>
<br>In some sense, it&apos;s like a beautiful work of pixel art: every single pixel is placed exactly where it is, and has the exact colour values it does, for a specific purpose: so that they can all come together to create something truly beautiful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stephens-sausage-roll/user-reviews?user_review_id=7391297">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The basic mechanic is deceptively simple, yet the puzzles are devilishly tricky, despite the fact that many are confined to tight spaces and options are limited. Each area of the world (and it is all set in an unexpectedly coherent world) introduces a new mechanic, cleverly building on what has gone before, so it never feels repetitive (though it can at time feel overwhelming).

<br>If you buy only one sausage rolling adventure this year, make sure it&apos;s this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stephens-sausage-roll/user-reviews?user_review_id=6557189">Expand</a></span>

<br>But that doesn&apos;t matter at all. Stephen&apos;s Sausage Roll is the most challenging puzzle game I ever felt motivated to play to completion. Each level is a piece of art. At various points in the game, new mechanics are introduced that feel natural in regards to the premise of the game (in particular, you will never need more controls than those introduced in the very beginning).
<br>The game has a (completely optional) background story that stems from the games mechanics (rather than the other way around).
<br>The game has a fixed set of rules (some of them might seem a bit odd at first, when compared to real world physics). I cannot remember any other game that explores its rules to the fullest extend possible as much as this game does.
<br>The game is not quite cheap, but considering that I spent ~30 hours enjoying the perfectly designed levels of this puzzle game, it was well worth its money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stephens-sausage-roll/user-reviews?user_review_id=6448556">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yes, for a game about pushing boxes (or sausages in this case) it&apos;s well made. Possibly game of the year for  &quot;Box pushing puzzle games fanatics monthly&quot; Magazine. Outside that narrow niche, next to other games given a perfect 10, it&apos;s laughable. Is it Super Metroid? Is it FF7? Is it even Cave Story?
<br>
<br>There&apos;s not much depth. There&apos;s no story. The levels are all similar. It&apos;s ugly. The feeling of progress and reward isn&apos;t there. Well-designed learning curve aside, it&apos;s nothing special. It&apos;s a good take on something inherently mediocre (.8 x .5 = .4).
<br>
<br>I tried reading other reviews for a taste of what&apos;s going on. What I pulled away with was this games the perfect storm of overrated. It&apos;s an indie developer creates a piece of &quot;art&quot; that appeals to your intellect. Another reviewer even mentioned how smart the game was and how smart he felt for playing along.
<br>
<br>Video game journalism, everyone.
<br>
<br>If you like puzzles games and have hours to devote to intellectual validation, go for it. You&apos;ll get your money worth. Just know I think you&apos;re dumb spending $30 on a back-patting machine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stephens-sausage-roll/user-reviews?user_review_id=6523063">Expand</a></span>
