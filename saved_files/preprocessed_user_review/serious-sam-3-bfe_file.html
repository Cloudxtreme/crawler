However there are other reasons as to why it deserves such a title. I am playing on PC and it is getting quite old so i can&apos;t play on the recommended settings but in comparison with my mate who can the graphics are really good. Not that graphics matter in a game like this, the gameplay is the most important part.<br><br>I&apos;ll mention the previous games here. There has been an upgrade in the game engine since then (you would like to think there has been in a decade!) and the game has modern aspects but it&apos;s very much like the old games which is no bad thing.<br><br>If you have played the first games you will know that the single player consists of basically a briefing screen and then the level which you run and gun through until you reach the levels exit then rinse and repeat. Serious Sam 3 has improved on this which pleases me in that you get briefed on the games story as you play via intercom, there are cutscenes and there are LOADS of one liners. In video games i personally find that jokes generally fall flat on there face with the exception of a few titles (like the ones from valve). It&apos;s early days for me yet in the game but i&apos;ve found myself letting out a good number of laughs already. The game has boss fights with health meters, two relics long since removed from the FPS genre. The first boss is just a standard enemy but when you first encounter it, it is treated like a powerful enemy based on your current weapon load out.<br><br>The weapons are a bit different from the earlier games. I felt that some of the weapons repeated themselves a lot in the earlier games. This has been remedied but there are still plenty of weapons to use. Fists, Sledgehammer, Pistol (which has unlimited ammo but needs reloaded - in the light of modern shooters that may seem weird but if you played old games like Doom and Blood this should make sense :P), Shotgun, Laser gun, Cannon. There is also a new feature which is an action instakill attack where you can e.g. rip enemies heads off, pull their eyes out and then throw them at enemies. It sounds like a cheap move but it really isn&apos;t considering how the game is played.<br><br>If you don&apos;t know anything about the game then basically the easiest way to describe it is think of a generated environment with hundreds (and i mean hundreds!) of enemies spawning and chasing you. It&apos;s a classic FPS game where you kill all the enemies and make your way to the end of the level. There are no objectives, no bombs to be planted, nothing like that. It&apos;s literally run and gun, or circle strafe or whatever you prefer.<br><br>As for the enemies themselves, they are similar to the early games and they keep the pressure on. There are alien bug like creatures, various other alien life forms (bipedal walking creatures with miniguns for arms - think Doom Spiderdemon) then the humanoids, the basic shotgun wielding enemy and then suicide enemies - you will never become more afraid of the words AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH when you look over the hill and see about 50 suicide units which explode on impact running towards you while you have to kill them before they get to you.<br><br>For the gamer who has played games like Call of Duty and Battlefield and wants something similar this game may not be for you. I encourage you to give it a chance but FPS like this are fast paced and do not rely on hiding behind walls. They require accurate movement to flank enemies, the ability to work out enemy patterns (when you meet the Kleer you will know what i mean) and the ability to manage your health, among many other things. I will also say, if you were disappointed by Duke Nukem Forever and you wanted to hark back to the good old days of FPS then GET THIS! This is what DNF should have been.<br><br>I can&apos;t say enough good things about this game, i really recommend you to pick it up, you will not be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1967929">Expand</a></span>

Still, the game offers unparalleled joy of blasting dozens of foes into pieces.<br><br>While modern times got us used to shooters on rails, enforced storyline and support of teammates who can complete the game on their own, Serious Sam poses a real challenge and features nothing but fast-paced action. This is a first person shooter where all you do is run and shoot. While it may not satisfy Skyrim or Minecraft players, it is an obligatory position for any hardcore shooter fan. Game is good at what it is supposed to be and does not distract from its core.<br><br>Although the concept of shooting reckless monsters is older than genre itself, compared to its first episode, Serious Sam has gone mature. Enemies are no longer cartoony fools, there is someting scary in their design. Health pick-ups don&apos;t float anymore in the air, their placement is logical and realistic.Behaviour of foes also has been altered - soldiers can crouch to take cover, bigger foes strafe to dodge upcoming rockets. It does not, however, spoil the game&apos;s concept &quot;No cover, all man&quot;. It&apos;s just harder and doesn&apos;t allow player to stop for a moment. This game will force you to strafe in unimaginable ways, swap weapons every few seconds, aim at surrounding monsters and never feel safe. Don&apos;t expect the comfort of hiding behind an obstacle and waiting for your health to regenerate. Taking excessive damage causes death - a thing not obvious in modern games.New players may find it impossible to win at diffuculty beyond normal. You will reload game many times at hottest moments just to impove your aim and strategy every time, until the challenge is beaten.Oh yes, the strategy. This &apos;silly, brainless&apos; shooter involves more skill and intelligence than recent realistic blockbusters. Every enemy is different and needs alternate approach, every weapon has unique advantages, while the ammo is scarce.<br><br>Weapons, your tools of destruction, ask for separate paragraph. At the beginning you will be playing with familiar handgun, shotgun and assault riffle, which work as usual. An uncommon addition is mighty sledgehammer - close-range weapon which effectively splashes minor enemies in no-time. New thing in SS3 are melee attacks that can quickly gib single enemies - but won&apos;t help against the horde.<br><br>Big hordes need big guns - you will enjoy every new toy which is significantly more powerful than previous weapons and allow to take evergrowing amounts of enemies, which also become towering beasts. But he game starts off relatively slowly, with only a bunch of foes on a screen, located in the slums of Cairo. As you progress further, the areas gradualy become wide-open and can hold over a hundred of enemies in a single battle - there is a couple of levels that contain over a THOUSAND of enemies rach. To take them down, at then end you are given enermous cannon, which shoots huge iron balls that literally roll through enemy ranks. That is something you can witness in no other FPS and makes Serious Sam series outstanding. Still, the gameplay remains smooth and balanced - Croteam just knows how to manage the chaos.<br><br>As yet I didn&apos;t mention the storyline - in fact, it&apos;s just an addition. Sam &apos;Serious&apos; Stone is send to future war-torn Egypt to save the world with a help of ancient artifacts. It&apos;s not necessarily deep or sophisticated, but the plot and short cinematics give a sense to all this endless mayhem. The presence of actual storyline is a significant progress compared to previous games, yet you can ignore it completely just to focus on next group of angry monsters.<br><br>Some things have gone due to mature style shift. No more power-ups, no more rooms with warped gravity or completely ridiculous secrets. As a reward, every new kind of monster gives unique gameplay experience - just as wall-climbing spiders or cave demos jumping out of darkness. This is still enjoyable, but just quite different. As a long-time fan, I missed that craziness, though.<br><br>The game&apos;s engine is impressive - it features an absurd amount of tunable options, which scale well to pretty every modern PC. You can adjust everything to your liking, by setting vivid colors or hippie blood (sic!). Graphics can stand up to the very best competitors, such as Crysis or Modern Warfare. Still, Serious Engine 3.5 can handle dozens of enemies without fps drop. It couldn&apos;t, however, handle empty, narrow streets of Cairo on my machine.<br><br>Oh right, there are some issues I didn&apos;t like. The game, despite heaving 9 gameplay modes, features very little maps for them. What&apos;s the point of trying survival if there are only two locations for it?Another problem is AI - while monsters are not asked for exceptional intelligence, they get stuck at corners from time to time, which spoils the fun.<br><br>The game still can offer more joy than any other title around. If only you like to shoot things, don&apos;t hesitate - get Serious Sam 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1983766">Expand</a></span>

In my mind yes - game mechanics and level design are top notch and that is what SS is about. Croteam brought just enough innovation  to make it fresh without kicking it out of Old School genre. A bit more new stuff and the game would not be old school and as such it would have failed. Great job Croteam! Thanks for staying true to SS style.

New melee moves are fantastic and the iron sites/aiming, contrary to expectations, are well implemented and do not take away the fun.  In fact, many times it would be hazardous to Sam&apos;s health to using the sites.  Much better to run and gun.</span>

Huge environments, truckloads of different and unique enemies to shoot and most importantly tight controls and a fast pace. The new additions to the formula are great and the sound and visuals are better than ever. Highly recommended to any Serious PC shooter fan.</span>

Once you get down the road a bit, the pump shotgun, the pistol, and the assault rifle kind of become obsolete. The devastator still has to be reloaded, but it&apos;s got a 20-shell clip. I welcome sprinting with open arms. It lets you traverse the massive landscapes much quicker. People need to get over themselves regarding these new gameplay additions. I&apos;m tired of people screaming the term &quot;CoDified&quot; and whatnot. This game is HARDLY like CoD. Just because it has iron sights on TWO guns doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s trying to be like CoD.<br><br>Anyway, the humor is toned down quite a bit, at least compared to SS2. That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s not funny though. I found the crappy dialog and the poor choreography to be brilliantly done, which sounds really contradicting, but that&apos;s exactly why I find it hilarious. It&apos;s like a parody of itself. It&apos;s different from Croteam&apos;s usual formula, but I think it&apos;s that way on purpose.<br><br>Anyway, not much else to say. It plays and feels like the other Sam games. I guess the optimization for low-end systems could be a little bit better. I basically run it maxed out on a dated machine because I&apos;m a graphics glutton, but it runs ok in single player. I have to put it on low settings when I play online though, otherwise it lags too much. I still get some stuttering though. Hopefully Croteam will release a patch or two that includes some performance fixes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977823">Expand</a></span>

Serious Sam 2 was ok, but just wasn&apos;t quite the sequel we all expected it to be.<br><br>Then, that fateful day. The day Serious Sam 3 was announced. I s*** my pants. &quot;A new Serious Sam game? Holy crap&quot;, I thought. I couldn&apos;t believe it. My dreams of a sequel had came true. I couldn&apos;t wait.<br><br>Then I bought it. When I started, My first thought was &quot;holy crap these graphics are awesome&quot;. This is truly a game for a monster PC, which I happen to own. As I was drooling over the screen, I heard the sound, the sound of death: AAAAAAAAAAH! I just felt nostalgia soar through me. It was a wonderful feeling! As I continued to play, however, I started to dislike the design of the level. It resembled Modern Warfare&apos;s style, and this was my first sign that SS3 was trying to be something it shouldn&apos;t. The further I played into the game, the more repetitive the gameplay and level design got. There is a level were you slowly navigate dark, foggy, tombs, fighting the same enemy over and over. What happened? Serious Sam games would take longer to become repetitive, like several playthroughs. SS3 got boring around the fourth level.<br><br>My honest opinion is that SS3 is good. It definitely isn&apos;t the sequel I wanted, but it isn&apos;t bad either. The monster redesigns are awesome, and the secrets are sure to give some laughs. Remove all the repetition, and this would be an awesome game.<br><br>*I know People will disagree in some areas, but remember this is my honest opinion. I dont totally dislike the game. Ill probably turn it on every now and then. If you love this game in every way, then go play, and I hope you have fun</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994086">Expand</a></span>

Massive hordes?  Check.  Familiar enemies, and new memorable ones?  Check.  Difficult?  You bet.  Serious Sam 3 succeeds in being a throwback to the golden age of shooters as promised.  Though it brings some contemporary FPS features such as iron sights, and sprinting, these are arguably more acceptable.  Make no mistake, Croteam let those be the only contemporary elements, opting to keep the more unacceptable ones such as regenerating health, out of the formula.<br><br>The result is an old-school shooter, with a touch of modern spice, but not enough to completely overpower the taste with that stale generic feeling that your standard military FPS games have today.  Croteam has created a perfect example of what FPS games should be like in innovation, and game play.  Graphically, BFE is one of the most impressive video game visuals of 2011.  Even the most hardened system may have trouble running with everything at maximum with the amount of action on screen.  These &quot;professional&quot; reviewers who critique the visuals for the game are obviously blind, as the game&apos;s textures, and models are some of the best in 2011. In sounds, BFE also stands flawless.  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, once again created by the same composer who did the previous games.  The score is fantastic, fitting, memorable.  If you like Serious Sam music, you&apos;ll love this addition as well.<br><br>In closing.. BFE?  A masterpiece created by Croteam that definitely deserved to be picked up if you&apos;ve been longing for an FPS that stays true to what the genre should be like.  And to any self-respecting Serious Sam fan out there; this game is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977435">Expand</a></span>

Coming from Serious Sam 2, this definitely holds up to my expectations, and exceeds them. 16 player co-op looks awesome, I just need to round enough people up to play it. On a technical note, I&apos;m very impressed by the Serious Engine 3.5. For example, they&apos;ve managed to do shadows the right way, something that Skyrim couldn&apos;t deliver. By this I mean in the foreground of Skyrim, the shadows are distorted and low quality, where on Serious Sam they are sharp and crisp. Well done Croteam!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977724">Expand</a></span>

What has Croteam done?&quot;, because you see, I pre ordered the digital deluxe of this, and I was worried that I had wasted $40 out of pure nostalgia. I will say this: the first couple of levels are slow, and definitely made me question my purchase. At about the third level, though, things definitely pick up. There were great improvement to combat in this game. I like the open environments, the new weapon set, and the new game engine. The monster designs are cooler than ever. Now, the campaign is fun, but it&apos;s not the best part. Go online and try your hand at some co-op Campaign, or my favorite, co-op Survival. This game has a great atmosphere for co-op. Pros and cons, shall we?<br><br>Pros: -Improvement in every older game element across the board<br>-Excellent new designs<br>-Super fun online<br>-Replay value out the wazoo<br>-Much harder than previous Sam games<br><br>Cons:<br>-Only two Survival maps. This mode is very fun, and the two maps offered can keep me busy for a couple of hours, but there should still be... more. It would be nice if there were an update or content pack that added a few maps.<br>-Digital Deluxe was not worth the extra ten bucks. Sorry, but the player models and sniper scope aren&apos;t that cool, and the soundtrack and bonus art, while good, are not enough to justify the extra $10 I spent. Save yourself some money and just get the base game.<br><br>Overall, a great game. I agree with anyone who pretty much said that this is what Duke Nukem Forever should have been, and I&apos;d say that it&apos;s well worth investing in. If you&apos;re unsure, wait until the price drops to $30 on Steam. I think it&apos;s worth at least that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1980835">Expand</a></span>

Warning: first couple of levels are a little bit dull, and then it picks up. Buy it NOW! Or Sam will have words with you. Very specific words. With a sledgehammer.</span>

                                        <span>seriously? a 69/100? People are giving revivals of classic shooters such as Duke Nukem Forever and Serious Sam 3: BFE scores they don&apos;t deserve. I&apos;ve never even played earlier versions of these games because I was just a baby when Duke Nukem Forever was announced. But seeing the scores of those games, upsets me. People just don&apos;t give games the scores they deserve. So I&apos;m giving this a 11/10.</span>

A fast paced, frantic, fun, unique fps experience, that doesn&apos;t take itself seriously. If you&apos;re looking for an epic, non-linear plot, with realistic weapons, you&apos;ve come to the wrong place.. If you&apos;re looking for an absolute blast of a fps experience, BUY THIS GAME. A genius mix of new and old game mechanics. 10/10.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1979955">Expand</a></span>

Melee combo attack are funny and even helpful when you find a Kleer in your face and only a rocket launcher in hands!<br>Each level has a boss and/or mini-boss, and it&apos;s another good thing that wasn&apos;t there in the last game.<br>Last but not least, the serious engine, really good imho, with bloom, hdr and post-processing effects implemented in the best way. Also useful is the spotlight for ammo/health. The sarcasm of the protagonist is in every sentence he speaks...and it&apos;s also appreciable and funny the new &apos;&apos;ANECA&apos;&apos;.<br>In the end, the best SS since now! If you love the fps and you hate scripts, this is your game...a game of 15+ hrs, not an interactive-movie of about 3 hrs like most of fps today!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1984211">Expand</a></span>

The opposite of a game like RAGE which trolls you for the first 10 mins, in this game you will probably have killed at least 50 enemies by the 10 min mark.  FTW - seriously</span>

All of those levels set in urban environments were only there to ease in people who weren&apos;t used to this breed of shooter, the kind of shooter that could pass as a modern Smash TV or Robotron 2084 if the camera was placed at a top-down perspective. No regenerating health, little cover (that doesn&apos;t last long), and swarms of monsters that want you dead. At the same time you&apos;re given a fighting chance with a variety of weapons such as the stock standard pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher and assault rifle, as well as less conventional weapons like a sledgehammer (great when surrounded by lesser enemies in close range), the devastator (a kind of sniper grenade launcher that is fun to use) and the almighty cannon. This cannon isn&apos;t some sort of science fiction-ey cannon, this is the kind of that would look at home on a pirate ship.

In a Brain dead Shoot em up FPS there is nothing more you can ask for. Any fps or Sam lover must pick this game immediately if you dot already have it, i bought it for 50 but they have it on sales and steam had it for 15 dollars... 15!!!!!! F&apos;N Dollars for such an amazing game, please go and do yourself a favor and pick up this fansamtastic game. There is so much i can say about this game like the game is made for newbies and pros alike, easy to pick up, gorgeous graphics, tons of awesome enemies and weapons, SERIOUS QUOTES, and so much more. Really... what else can you ask for.... not many games like this come out anymore and this is definitely a game worth having in your collection. This game is also mod-able so the more people that play the more mods we can make and make the game ever more fun. This game runs on any PC ranging from 300$ to 10,000$ and will still look good on all low graphics. Plenty of Single Player and Multilayer to take many hours away from your life. Please stop playing awful games COD and expand your horizons. Thank you. That is all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=2330355">Expand</a></span>

Los gr&#xE1;ficos son estupendos, las armas se ven muy bien, gran cantidad de enemigos. La historia es simple pero baaa a quien le importa solo ponte a disparar o aplastar. Para el g&#xE9;nero hardcore shooter es increible.</span>

<br>And it was really fun in the first couple of hours. Maybe even too fun (as the endless enemies thrown at the player was a fresh concept for me).
<br>Can then, somebody explain to me, why this game failed to be engaging really soon?
<br>My own explanation is - because all of those reasons. Quake had frantic action, but it didn&apos;t feel repetitive. Half-life also had epic environments, but they weren&apos;t only for background. The weapons, well they are just &quot;meh&quot;.
<br>
<br>And I would kind want to continue playing, but I know exactly what will happen - I&apos;ll go to a big open space and I&apos;ll have to shoot the hell out of hundreds of the same enemies that I already know and probably fight an occasional boss. Again, and again, and again... Only if the enemies weren&apos;t that much and time-consuming to shoot them all - I would probably want to see all the scenery remaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=5081108">Expand</a></span>

Before you believe the low reviews that say it&apos;s changed, they only played the first level and didn&apos;t look at the options.  All the new stuff like view blob, sprint, iron sights, reticules and other modern stuff can be turned off in the options.  Every level past the first one has huge open spaces and bad ass bosses. Serious Sam 3 is serious.</span>

This to me is pretty firm evidence that game review sites are nothing more than puppies being fed dollar signs by so-called &quot;big buck&quot; game publishers to deliver on a perpetual basis unrealistically hyped-up and base-less reviews of games which are so thought-less and pathetic that they would not be able to sell on their own otherwise. Serious Sam 3 has got to be one of the best games of the year and Croteam deserves so much more than this. This is GOTY content we are looking at. Two very big thumbs up to Croteam for having the nerve to stick to the true, solid and proven roots of classic first person shooting in an era where everyone else is trying to make their games more &quot;realistic&quot; and more &quot;story&quot; and &quot;character&quot; driven. Croteam has delivered to us a reminder of what the true value of fun in gaming is all about. Serious Sam 3 is fun and this to me is the single most important aspect of any game I wish to play. Sure, it may be seen as being overly simplistic to some... after all, Serious Sam 3 is pretty much a &quot;go from Point-A to Point-B and kill everything in between Point-A and Point-B&quot; type of game. But if it works and you are having one heck of an awesome time then Croteam has succeeded where others have failed. Thank you Croteam for this epic masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1973278">Expand</a></span>

This game stays true to the old school &apos;run and gun&apos; style that I loved in the original games and Duke Nukem 3D (looking down the gun scope aside). Definitely a great game for those who stay true to, and love, the chaos and explosions of shooter of the past.</span>

Starting before the events of the First Encounter, Serious Sam 3: BFE will give you the complete picture of what happened before Sam entered the TimeLock device and traveled back in time to ancient Egypt. Beginning the game in half-destroyed modern Cairo you will travel through different environments including modern Karnak, Luxor and finaly you will arrive at Hatshepsut temple where the TimeLock device is located. Serious Sam 3: BFE feels and plays exactly like two previous parts of Serious Sam and if you have played them then you&apos;ll feel like home here. There are a little innovations for some weapons such as the need to periodically reload them and the ability to aim-down-the-sights for the pistol and the assault rifle. In Serious Sam 3 you can also sprint like in most modern shooters. Sprinting in Serious Sam 3 is unlimited however you will not be able to shoot while doing so. It&apos;s very useful feature when, for example you need take a tactical retreat from a group of Headless Kamikazes that are chasing you. Returning to the campaign, someone might say that Serious Sam 3 is short, but it isn&apos;t really short. The campaign has 12 levels and it took me personally about 12 hours to complete it on Easy Difficulty. The are a large variety of enemies in Serious Sam 3 and they are all pretty challenging. I have completed both previous parts on Mental difficulty and while I played Serious Sam 3 on Easy I have died and died a lot. As for the graphics, it may not be Crysis 2, but it&apos;s very beautiful, if you plan on playing this game then you should stop from time to time to look around, because there definitely is what to see. Overall I recommend this game to all Serious Sam fans and to all out there who are looking for a good old-school shooter. You won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1971056">Expand</a></span>

You aren&apos;t thrown into a bad story driven fps and given spurts of action, you are dropped into a mockingly bad story and getting the sink and every other object that isn&apos;t nailed down thrown at you. Much like the first Sam games you are asked to face an army of aliens that not only are very nasty but come at you in numbers so great at times that you can&apos;t help but think &quot;Thats gotta be it&quot; and then another huge wave appears. It&apos;s a simple yet effective and highly entertaining approach that makes Sam games such a treat compared to the psuedo-realist approach of many modern FPS&apos;s. -- Sam 3 also breaks the current trend of fps&apos;s in that it gives you a very lengthy single player campaign. When you finish Sam 3 you will in no way feel like you got half a game, in fact Sam 3&apos;s single player is probably 2-3 times bigger then &quot;modern&quot; shooters and a truley epic experience towards the end. -- Sam 3 has a very nice look but doesn&apos;t quite have jaw dropping visuals, you get a little bit of a cookie cutter feel after playing through the campaign which still while looking good tends to repeat a bit too much.  It does however have one of if not the most robust graphic options menus I have ever seen on any PC game ever, everything from changing blood color to &quot;hippie&quot; to advanced stuff like parallax occlusion, so tweaking settings to get the visual quality and performance are only limited by your understanding of the options. -- Sam 3 also has one of the most badass soundtracks around. Pure adrenaline inducing and just awesome how it picks up when you are in the middle of a heavy firefight or fighting a boss. -- Sam 3 also sports a very strong co-op mode which allows you to play through the entire campaign with a total of 16 players. It sports a survival mode that sends wave after wave of enemies  while you try to beat yours or others best times. Finally to round out the multiplayer it has a traditional deathmatch mode. -- All in all Serious Sam 3:BFE is a just a great throwback PC-centric FPS that could make most of the modern FPS&apos;s it&apos;s ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1984762">Expand</a></span>

I guess that&apos;s getting to be a trend. The little guys can do whatever they want, while the big ones are stuck, having to deliver profits in the billions or get sacked.<br>It&apos;s Possibly the best shooter in the last ... 6-7 years? Requires and rewards skill with the mouse, it&apos;s fast, it&apos;s unrelenting in its pace and its difficulty  on Serious is seriously brutal. Loads of ways to go about doing everything, lots of interesting weapons, seems quite long too, even if some reviews slagged it for being short, my steam timer says I played it 7 hours now and I&apos;m only on the &quot;Unearthing the Sun&quot; level. If the buildup continues like it has so far, I just can&apos;t wait to get further into the game and see more, then play it again in coop with a friend or two, maybe try out 16 player coop at the next LAN. The game starts out slow as a direct parody of the Call of Duty / Battlefield / Medal of Honor games that have gotten so popular recently, complete with &quot;blurry staring at hands&quot;-scene. It then goes on in a series of levels that give you only a pistol, a sledgehammer, and your fists to fight off an increasing amount of baddies. The whole thing looks much like any other modern shooter; a bombed out middle eastern city. But while you&apos;re running around aiming down the sights of your pistol/assault rifle, and pumping out a few with your shotgun, the absurdity just increases evermore. It looks like Call of Duty: Yet Another Game, but you&apos;re shooting some far out monster, and the whole thing is just golden. Sam gets a lot of calls from someone in an earpiece, who he constantly tells to just shut up and then continues with his own thing, acting like the Duke Nukem we&apos;d all hoped to see return in DNF. It&apos;s a hilarious quip at the current trend of high profile shooters where you&apos;re always relegated to being some grunt who just follows the Follow blurb over one of the NPCs and waits patiently for them to open doors.<br><br>The graphics are quite good, everything is sharp and pretty, and the game runs reasonably well too (on a HD5870 + X4 965 I get 30-40 fps most the time at &quot;max&quot; settings without antialiasing at 2560x1440), and everything is quite top-of-the-line for a game that&apos;s developed by an independent studio in Croatia.<br><br>Bad parts I noticed were that the AI has some issues with close quarters, but most of the game takes place in rather open areas so it doesn&apos;t become too evident. The level design is ... weird. It&apos;s basically a return to Serious Sam 1 again, where you have short interludes between large arena style fights. Only this time the arenas are littered with ruins that blow up spectacularly (this is good), but I miss more indoor variety levels. Maybe they&apos;ll pop up later, but so far the parts that are around are not very indoor&apos;ish. But of course, that&apos;s not really what you expect from SS, but hey, they could expand a little :-) Reloading and the inability to do so while sprinting, and the incessant need to do it all the time on the pumpaction shotgun and the assaultrifle is annoying. I wish they&apos;d removed that, as it does take quite a while to get through the game on Serious difficulty. Maybe had it as an option or give upgrades later on that would enable infinite shooting. It would&apos;ve been better if you could reload while sprinting though. But hey, can&apos;t have everything I guess. Gotta relearn how to move again I guess :p since all the last many games have been spent crouching in a single spot while shooting pop-up target baddies.<br><br>Conclusion: Really fun game. Graphics are great, voiceacting is fun, story is total nonsense, locations are spectacular, guns are great and rewarding to use, difficulty is way up there on the higher ones, but it doesn&apos;t become frustrating like 1 hit 1 death shots from invisible enemies. You can always hear what&apos;s around you and you can move to avoid/kill it if you&apos;re clever enough and fast enough.<br><br>Been an FPS fan since I played Wolfenstein 3D the first time in 1992, and this, this is what FPS are all about to me. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=1984768">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a fast paced FPS where you slaughter hordes of aliens in your bid to save the planet. The story is paper thin and not particularly interesting, but it does enough to give you reason to go from level to level. The combat is fluid and very entertaining. The graphics are pretty average and the voice acting  sounds are average as well. If you enjoy mindless shooting then you&apos;ll probably enjoy SS3. It also has campaign co-op and versus multiplayer modes for those of you that enjoy that kind of stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-3-bfe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3166391">Expand</a></span>

Also, do not be persuaded by the first four or so levels which is boring corridor shooting! As if flicking a switch the game returns to it&apos;s roots with big guns and massive environments.
