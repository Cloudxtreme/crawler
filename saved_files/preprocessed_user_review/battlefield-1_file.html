<br>Cons:

<br>The &quot;Rock, paper, scissors&quot; gun scheme has absolutely ruined the game IMO.
<br>(Explained: most guns use a &quot;cone-style&quot; programing for the bullets, just like SW Battlefront, where any/all of the bullets fire in a completely random huge cone whether you are aiming down sights or not.)
<br>Typical Dice engine bugs/glitches.
<br>Campaign is only 4-5 hours to finish.
<br>GPU crashes with up to date GPU and drivers, and re installs.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>While the game was obviously not going to be a realistic portrayal of WWI warfare, they went so far out of reality for the campaign and single player, I honestly wonder why the chose to make this a WWI game. It honestly seems like they wanted to make a WWII game but chose WWI to maybe draw on the centennial
<br>.
<br>The campaign is a cake walk even on hard, with AI who are laughably stupid, and the story while good at parts, is insultingly short and lackluster, with absolutely no grounds in reality what so ever.
<br>
<br>I really wanted to like the game, I love war history and have always loved the BF series. But this game is in my opinion the worst BF game in years, if not ever.
<br>I was bored of the gameplay in 5 hours, and with the GPU crashes every 10 minutes in multiplayer I just refunded it (At least Origin actually has good CS and a fair refund policy).
<br>
<br>If you love the game, that is fine, I am glad you do, but to me this is not a Battlefield game, much less a WWI game.
<br>I have hopes of maybe a good WWII game next, praying for 1944/1945, DONE RIGHT.
<br>
<br>I feel like this is going to pull a hardline and die off in weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6767377">Expand</a></span>

<br>The primary reason: the game engine is watered down garbage. It&apos;s the same one used by Star Wars: Battlefront. The gameplay is surprisingly similar SW:BF. When you shoot, it just doesn&apos;t feel satisfying. The optimal range feature ends up being very frustrating. I.E. You shoot someone with a support machine gun at 50-100 yards, and it does 10-15 damage. Really? Am I shooting a .22lr at them? I wanted the game to be more like the gameplay of Battlefield 4. The bullet physics seem much more realistic. I feel like they could have pulled that off, but went with the super watered down cartoon-ie feel of SW:BF.
<br>
<br>The secondary reason: no joystick support. You can fly planes in single player and multiplayer. But this is yet another Battlefield / Battlefront game that gives the middle finger to joysticks. Judging by the complete lack of joystick support for every BF in the past 10 years, I&apos;m certain they will never add support. It&apos;s super frustrating to super awkwardly try to fly a plane with the keyboard only and make longing glances at the perfectly functional joystick sitting on your desk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6762333">Expand</a></span>

Due to this a lot of people seem to play are snipers or vehicles leaving the game a sniper fest with some vehicles pushing. Tack on Darth Vader style heros with silly amounts of health and extremely powerful weapons, and giving giant farm blimps to the losing team to reward them for sniping from their spawn, once the beauty wears off you&apos;re left with a pretty **** game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6766515">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So why does Battlefield still suck?
<br>
<br>The game has about as much to do with World War I as the Black guy on the poster. There is zero trench warfare, and nearly all the weapons are automatic or semi-automatic. In other words, it&apos;s still a game for the braindead people who don&apos;t have a clue.
<br>
<br>DICE&apos;s philosophy of game design seems to be on the same level as their political philosophy: they want to equalize everything. The game punishes skill and rewards reckless play. Try reviving your teammates and you get instantly killed. Try supporting your teammates with machinegun fire and you get instantly killed. Try doing anything except running around like a chicken on fire, and you get instantly killed.
<br>
<br>If that isn&apos;t enough, the game now rewards the losing team with a giant equalizer in the form of a huge airship that can more or less kill anything at any spot on the map. So we now have 100% equal gameplay with noone being able to be better than the other. Which is pretty boring for someone who wants more than explosions and nifty sound effects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6770258">Expand</a></span>

<br>That&apos;s not to say that I don&apos;t see any positives or don&apos;t think it might be &apos;ok&apos; for some to buy so please read on before making your decision on my review.
<br>
<br>First let&apos;s start with the Positives:
<br>+ Really fantastic graphics.
<br>+ Destructible environments. It&apos;s fun to get a sniper out of that house by blowing it to bits with a tank or mortars!
<br>+ Generally stable servers which will only improve further with some fine tuning.
<br>+ Innovative battle modes where you push enemy back and another map loads and you play that one in a sort of tug of war which makes the game feel like it has bigger picture consequences.
<br>+ Despite what some may say, a pretty wide array of weapons considering it&apos;s WW1 and IRL each country had only one or two bolt action rifles which 95% of soldiers carried. So they did a good job of &apos;digging up&apos; extra realism based weapons to include.
<br>+ A couple decent support roles for those who want to do something besides get kills all the time. Support and Medic can both be very useful to the team.
<br>+ It fills a gap in an otherwise stale genre. Let&apos;s face it COD has been basically the same game for 10 years now with map packs and a few tweaks being sold as new games. And not really much else besides CS which has been the same game for 15+ years.
<br>
<br>Now the Negatives:
<br>- As of game release day 1, the game is absolutely loaded with cheaters. Bring up the chat in any map and just watch a few minutes and you&apos;ll see people getting &apos;banned&apos;. Several per match. Which is quite surprising so early in a game&apos;s release cycle.
<br>- Cheaters are not permanently banned! Why oh why would the developers make the decision not to invalidate a CD key I have no idea. I&apos;ve seen several threads on the topic in the official game forums and the devs feel it would be too &apos;hard&apos; on paying players. Wow! So they&apos;re more concerned with the cash flows from the cheaters than from the paying players?! OK! Anyway, someone gets &apos;banned&apos; and they&apos;ll be right back in a matter of minutes.
<br>- Guns have no stopping power so only the very last bullet which kills them makes any difference whatsoever to their ability to spaztically run all over, evading your last bullet, and shoot back, greatly favoring twitch reflexes over strategy an tactics.
<br>- The most solo unfriendly shooter in history. No FF (Friendly Fire) means mic&apos;d up squads of move in one &apos;mass&apos; and throw out enough lead to mow down any player in their way. As a solo player, you&apos;ll be faced 1v5 most every time you see the enemy (though you do have the option to sit back and play sniper). And arguably this does provide some real value to players who like to buddy up.
<br>- Overall the guns are just &apos;weird&apos; compared to any other shooter. The closest I can compare it to is Planetside which also doesn&apos;t feel like a &apos;real&apos; shooter if classic play style is your preference. Personally I found all the guns except the sniper rifles just lacked an &apos;oomf&apos;, and had no sense of real power or damage when hitting.
<br>- Sound. Though the sounds are generally pretty good. It takes an extremely expensive or extremely loud sound system to be able to hear footsteps. Some say its OK, others have the same complaint. Really depends on your system and config. With my headphones I can&apos;t hear a damn thing until the very last step which doesn&apos;t matter anyway because you&apos;re already knifed.
<br>
<br>Overall: I think the game does a lot right. But more cheaters than I&apos;ve seen in any FPS getting kicked from literally every match, an extreme unfriendliness to solo players, weak feeling guns with no sense of impact, and way too silent footsteps which means more knife deaths from behind than you can count all conspire to bring down what could otherwise be a great game.
<br>
<br>If the developers change their stance on permanently banning cheaters I might have another look. Until then, I&apos;ll pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6768252">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is NOT interesting..at all!
<br>In the 45 minutes i played this game half of my team was running and gunning  pew pewing with LMG&apos;all over the map just ignoring the objectives and the other half was on top of some mountain sniping.Netcode of the game is still FUBAR as you never know who shot you from where and if you rely on the killcam most of the shots/kills are impossible to make ,so in my opinion you would never know is if the player who shot you legit/aimboter/or the killcam is (again)not working properly.
<br>
<br>Refunded after one hour and dissapointed that DICE failed yet again in making an enjoyable game i was hoping for.
<br>Sad as i am that the glorious day&apos;s of 1942,Battlefield 2 and 2142 are long gone i would never recomend this game to anyone.
<br>Teenagers on the other hand seems to like it it and can&apos;t get enough of!
<br>
<br>Refunded and unninstalled ...meh!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6763485">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Finally, I don&apos;t feel that &quot;fat character lag&quot; that I always experience in the past BF.
<br>Now it&apos;s as fluid as a Counter-Strike or COD can be.
<br>
<br>All that with amazing graphic, building destruction, and all the tank etc...
<br>
<br>Finally a game that is polished at launch !
<br>
<br>Feel so great. Thank you</span>

DICE tell us, it was back to old BF1942, sorry DICE, wrong way, game don&apos;t have soul of BF1942 and, this f... cheaters, broke this product. P.s. Look on YT how many people report cheaters and DICE seat silent. Buy or not to buy? well for graphic, yes, for gameplay, i was sad pay my money for it, thanks a GOD I don&apos;t buy premium BF1.

Aweful, I loved playing HC in BF3 and 4 but now they went with &quot;more HC&quot; but it is now way too slow and everyone plays sniper and nothing else. Putting this game on the shelf now because of a really bad implementation of HC.</span>

<br>First up it&apos;s another cash grab by EA.  Frankly the content included in the base game is rubbish.  There is very little weaponry and most of it is a variation of a gun you already have.
<br>
<br>Maps are generally uninteresting and mix CQB and Open fileded warfare, unfortunately iit doesn&apos;t work, Whether you have raw talent or not the map design means your likely to be gibbed travelling from CQB to open warfare you&apos;ll have the wrong class/gear meaning you can&apos;t defend yourself properly, bearing in mind the objectives mean you have to travel or face losing the match.
<br>
<br>Audio is for the most part OK, music is nice.  Weapons to me sound all very similar, nothing as distinctive as the M1 from WW2 with the ping as the clip flys out the receiver.
<br>
<br>Graphics think Star wars Battlefront, set in antique weapons. Nothing really to say here, it looks fine, still suffers the same old problems where you can see a head on top of a wall but you get shot through said wall as the models don&apos;t line up with logic, (long term problem of many FPS)
<br>
<br>Respawn times are far too long in my honest opinion.
<br>Hardcore mode missing.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve gone back to playing BF4 as I think it plays far better than BF1.  If your looking for a new FPS I would recommend Titanfall 2 as soon as the hackers are banned under the new patch coming the 30th Nov,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6832889">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not really appropriate to compare it to call of duty unless you are just talking about how trash it is. Maybe it&apos;s ok on console, but it&apos;s horrible on PC. Sure it plays fine, I didn&apos;t have trouble running the game, but the content is piss poor at best. They took everything that could have been good about a WW1 setting and threw it out the window. If you start talking about bugs it gets even worse. This game is not worth the money even if it worked 100% which it is very far from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6987869">Expand</a></span>

All engagements end up you and the otherguy sidestepping, this doesn&apos;t affect your aim for some reason and lets you matrix bullets. You have to play  for days to get decent weapons ensuring the more you play the more advantage you have. The longer you hold down the mouse the more accurate your machine gun becomes. Cheating is rampant as usual, just look at the videos, you will be head shotted constantly. The anti-cheat mechanism is too slow to catch players and provides no reporting mechanism. I think they&apos;ve destroyed the quality of the product to maximize profit, no surprise here. Because of all these issues, I would not recommend buying the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6856153">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay is meh, All weapons feel same.
<br>Graphic style is totally not mine, i hate that SW Battlefront ripped graphic style.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t really feel like an battlefield game tbh.
<br>
<br>Wouldn&apos;t buy, played beta wasn&apos;t that amazing.
<br>
<br>20&#x20AC; worth, at most.</span>

The game looked like it was going to be an immersive experience taking place in a setting that was very unfamiliar to gamers, World War 1. The story trailer depicted the horrors of combat during the war, and showed the main character visually shaken as they struggled to survive in the bloody conflict around them. The trailer depicted a Battlefield game that would have a meaningful story.  So I purchased it and downloaded it as soon as I could.
<br>The first mission was an awesome experience. The player faced off against waves of German soldiers who continuously encroached further and further. When the player died, instead of respawning, the name of the player character and age at time of death was displayed on the screen. Then the player is transported to the body of another soldier on the front. This continues until an artillery bombardment completely annihilates the battlefield, killing the Germans and player character alike. I was ready for the next mission, this innovative way of dealing with the player death was definitely an interesting innovation.  I started up the next mission and watched as soldiers charge forward ahead of me. I found myself in a slow moving tank taking on hundreds of infantry and a few dozen tanks. It was then that I realized that Battlefield 1 was nothing special.
<br>Battlefield 1 continued the same infuriating trope that has plagued first person military shooters for a long time. It made the player character an almost indestructible badass, who can take out an entire fortress of enemies on their own. Instead of focusing on immersion and making the player character killable like everyone else, as in the first mission, the developers chose to focus on the player and the player alone. Instead of being an individual in a massive charge through no man&apos;s land, the game makes you attack cities and towns by yourself, as if you were some sort of super soldier. I feel like squad based combat like in Battlefield Bad Company 2 would have been a decent compromise. Or a campaign based on the results of multiplayer gameplay like that of Titanfall. Instead the players were given the same formula they had been given in the past two iterations of battlefield, and the countless interactions of Call of Duty.
<br>Battlefield 1&#x2019;s story line is also non-consequential. Every single one of the protagonists is the good guy, the Germans and Ottomans the bad guys. Every single one of the main characters is depicted as moral and heroic while the Germans and Ottomans are portrayed as cowardly. The main characters are the most white-bread characters that I have played as in a video game. None of their character flaws are revealed, probably because the player is only introduced to them for a few missions before switching to another battle halfway across the world, and another copied and pasted character. From the trailers I was expecting a game that&#x2019;s narrative would be as similarly dark and brutal as the fantastic game Spec Ops the Line. In a ferrous attempt to escape from the enemy the player has to make heart wrenching decisions, and commits atrocities in order to survive. Battlefield 1 has none of these moral failings, and the decisions are of minute importance, such as what weapon should I use, and if should I kill the enemy, and even then these decisions mean nothing to the narrative. Infact when I tried to go through a mission without killing or alerting any of the enemies the cutscene still depicted bodies sprawled across the terrain.
<br>Battlefield 1&#x2019;s story and portrayal of Word War 1 is extremely weak, and a testament to Dice&#x2019;s incompetence at crafting singleplayer narratives. Dice should focus their resources on what they do best, multiplayer. Don&#x2019;t be fooled by the single player trailers, this game is not worth purchasing for the single player alone and the multiplayer while fun does not offer an authentic experience. The proliferation of light machine guns and prototype submachine guns completely ruins any immersion that might have existed. The anti-tank rockets that are unlocked at the start of the game completely negate tank use, and the Dreadnaughts, battleship or zeppelins, are not the Goliath challenges as they are depicted in the trailer. The lack of teamwork especially hurts the multiplayer experience and makes it significantly more casual game-play. If you want a multiplayer game to play with a squad of close friends and move tactically this is certainly not the game for you, check out Insurgency instead. In conclusion if you are expecting a chaotic first person shooter to casually kill some times time with your friends and you don&#x2019;t care about story, this game is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6802985">Expand</a></span>

<br>But **** me do the accuracy, bugs ruin this games fun.
<br>
<br>I have NEVER had a single multiplayer match without being ****ing pissed at the games ultimate decisions.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s go over to the bugs:
<br>- Medkit pack not having physics so its just a placeable that ALWAYS bugs out when prone
<br>- When you get revived it says you are holding a gun but in reality its just an equipment (this has ****ed me over multiple times)
<br>- Accuracy system (the bullets never go where I am pointing the gun, it&apos;s literal trash)
<br>- &quot;Teamkilling&quot; when stabbing an enemy turned teammate. This has happened to me just twice but still is stupid as hell
<br>- Terrible collision (Basically when firing the gun it hits an invisible object in front of you, this has happened to me way too many times I can count).
<br>
<br>Now let&apos;s go over to Dice&apos;s terrible decision making:
<br>- Store system, like what the hell. You first have to unlock the damn item, and then you have to buy it. That&apos;s not it, there are DIFFERENT variants of your gun. Why not have simple attachment system like you did in battlefield3/4? This could have been prevented if they had a mastery level system for the gun but nooooo
<br>- Armored trains/Behemoth, are simply the most unbalanced piece of living crap I have ever experienced. IT always goes to the losing team and when they do they turn the battle around till we **** our pants of rage. My team got shredded when the armored train in the desert map arrived, and we lost the entire match because of it&apos;s stupid ass design.
<br>- Accuracy system (again)
<br>- Hitboxes
<br>- The new kit mastery system
<br>- RNG boxes
<br>
<br>I really wanted to like this game but it has a LOT of flaws.
<br>Anyways there are plus sides of this game:
<br>
<br>- Finally a decent World War 1 game.
<br>- Amazing graphics
<br>- NO BATTLELOG?
<br>- Interesting campaign concept</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6831372">Expand</a></span>

Awefull maps, disbalanced and not effective weapons, disbalanced vehicles. The game shoud be called Starwars Battlefield 1, cuz it&apos;s same crapy **** as Battlefront. This game is broken and really disapointing. I will not buy single Dice game ever.</span>

<br>
<br>It also feels very artifically chaotic, and the pacing is just like the previous games, over-the-top and everything-in-you-face-at-once. Michael Bay did this.
<br>
<br>Sound design is wierd. For some reason you can hear battle from far far away, but not the heavly equipped guy running up beside you. Or a tank for that matter, until it&apos;s driving over your corpse..
<br>
<br>You don&apos;t automatically spot someone you shooting at, you have to press another button just to do that. Which honestly is ridiculous, and contributes to that artifical feeling.
<br>
<br>And that naging feeling that what you see is NOT quite what you get, like with previous BF-games, is here as well. You dying long after taking cover, etc, etc. Maybe these games needs to be this chaotic to prevent this from becoming too glaringly appearant.

It is just a casual shooter. If you want rapid action and shot anything that is moving without thinking twice, BF1 is the game for you. If you are a BF4 player, dont waste your money. It is just as bad as hardline.</span>

<br>And now thats the point why i dont like this game. there is absolutely no motivation. Medals are low rewarded. There is nothing thats hard to unlock or worth it. Most weapons are absolutely awful. Especially the support is useless. The aiming feels totally weird and the aiming percentage stuff is just confusing. The maps could also be better. (Monte Grappa is absolutely unplayable in operations, misplaced spots like G on sinai, unbalanced sides (one team reaches the game deciding spot in the middle faster. etc. etc.))
<br>I was a battlefield fan for a long time but I sadly just have no fun with BF1</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871317">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve loved BF4 I hate BF1... IMHAO THE WORST AAA GAME OF 2016!! And don&apos;t bolieve that single player campain is great .... it&apos;s boring ...it&apos;s bad.. it sucks...

<br>
<br>I have played for 200 hours, split between Assault, Support and Medic... (Can&apos;t stand Sniping)
<br>And the game has so many gamebreaking mechanics and flaws that I will no longer play it before they fix all of them.
<br>
<br>1: The game does not even a quit button... They claim it&apos;s there, but it does not work. Every time you click it, the game freezes. I quit and just took a **** for 7 minutes, coming back to the pc, the game has still not exited.. Dice, come on...
<br>
<br>2: Battlepacks... I just spent 8 hours today playing it... 1 battlepack... 1... They say there is a mechanic that makes you get battlepacks once in a while, but I just played 20 maps... I got 1...
<br>Dice, are you proud of this?
<br>
<br>3: You can spawn on a squadmember that is located anywhere on the map.. Gamebreaking mechanic.
<br>There is nothing more soulcrushing than gank 2-3 people, then 6 seconds later during your reload, they run you over again because their 3 man was hiding 4 meters away...  This is the most idiotic system I have ever seen.
<br>
<br>4: Killcam is implemented... What???? So now, even if I do not play sniper, you can not find a good position and start supporting your team, because the first you kill, will see your position and retaliate.
<br>I&apos;ve done it countless times agains them snipersbastards
<br>
<br>5: Spot in game..  You can click a button, and spot your enemies so they appear as a red mark all over the map... This is so broken that its not even funny...  I have no idea how many times I click the button, but nothing happes. Even he is 20-30 meters away from me. This just needs to go.
<br>
<br>6: Medics revive a teammember to full healt... What the acutal f..k?
<br>This needs to be changed to 1 hp only, and the reciepient of a revive can not gain healing or shoot weapon for 10-20 seconds. (Or shoot weapon one time, and then die again from the recoil)
<br>The annoyance of you shooting someone dead, to have them be revived 2 seconds later at full health is utterly bull****.
<br>
<br>These are the top most annoying, gamebreaking, soulcrushing issues that does not make the game what it should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6819342">Expand</a></span>

<br>The whole game is basically one big lie, telling stories of crude armored &quot;knights&quot; marching against machinegun posts, and of soldiers jumping from zeppelin to zeppelin Indiana Jones style. It tells its narrative like these are most authentic memories of our ancestors, yet it&apos;s a pile of grotesque manure. It basically craps on all the people who actually fought in those wars.
<br>
<br>The design philosophy is &quot;if you spend 5 seconds not shooting at something, it&apos;s wrong&quot;. Soldiers run super fast, there are no battle lines, death is meaningless, because you constantly respawn, action is meaningless, because everyone dies constantly. There is no movement to positions, no tactics, no strategy, only mindless, constant, dumb action.

<br>
<br>Not only have the community reached out via the forums to the developers, but also through e-mail, petitions, and support tickets. None of these have yielded results, and the issue remains.
<br>
<br>Support tickets that are sent are simply dismissed, as mine was. So thousands of players are unable to play.

They used to produce such good games but as of late in my opinion the standard has really dropped. Case in question Battlefield 1. This game reproduces many of the flaws found in other Battlefield games, most notably, the lack of real immersion and control on the part of the gamer. This is another Pavlovian game where you are presented with very narrow game sequences, where the gamer is &quot;shoe horned&quot; into doing specific things in a very specific way or no cigar. There&apos;s little ability here to really play the game and influence events in a meaningful and satisfying way. Indeed it feels more like a mildly interactive film where the gamer is more spectator, than player.
<br>
<br>Worse still are the horrible weapon physics, where you can shoot something many many times and it simply does not fall down or blow up. This is married up to impossible scenario&apos;s, where you are bound to loose again and again. Others expect you to loose and just feel like a waste of time. Of course we are getting a moral history lesson about the futility of war but hey its supposed to be a game too right? Chance to have some fun? No such luck.
<br>
<br>Just as annoying is you can not play as the other side. The Germans, Turks, etc are simply targets. If this game wanted to show war in its entirety then why not let the player, play both sides?
<br>
<br>This game is pretty but then so are most modern games. This in itself is in no way enough to justify what is a clumsy effort, that simply lacks the fun and interactive factor gamers want and I believe have a right to expect.

From a historic standpoint it is an absolute joke; the weaponry is so farfetched and so far removed from the reality of WWI that it actually makes me a mixture of sad and mad to have played it. Only one class in the game gets bolt-action rifles, and every other class is carrying submachine guns, semi-auto rifles and hipfiring Lewis machine guns. I understand this from a game pace standpoint, but it just seems so incredibly contrived and stupid to see it in action. This is just Battlefield 4 with a slight orange filter on everything. The campaign is hilarious; the Australian Solid Snake was ridiculous, the Britain vs. Sky Captain from the World of Tomorrow air battle was ludicrous, but the cherry on top was the Italian campaign, in which you put on plate mail and hipfire a huge machine gun all the way up and through a mountain. Unbelievable.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not all bad. It sounds great and looks quite good, and it&apos;s the most stable launch since BFBC2. Sadly, the pace of games is bogged down by the ever-present sniper class, which they have been pandering to since Bad Company 2, who will single-handedly slow the pace of the game to a crawl while each side tries to root out the others&apos; campers. Vehicles are also ridiculous; the tanks are fast, can shrug off enormous damage but only the flamethrower tank feels dangerous to use or go up against. The upgrades are interesting enough, but only the Scout class really gets any fun toys to use. Every other class&apos;s upgrades are just straight-up &quot;now you have a shotgun&quot; or &quot;now you can drop bigger medkits&quot;.
<br>
<br>This game is a disaster, and I genuinely feel real fear that an impressionable young teenager might play this and think it&apos;s even remotely related to actual history. Easily the worst Battlefield yet, and yes, I&apos;m including Hardline in that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=7029863">Expand</a></span>

BF1 is a &apos;Steam Greenlight&apos;, still in Beta/Alpha, in-development game - similar to what Windows 10 is - pay for a full game while the developer gives you a half made release. Here, let me charge you full price for this delicious pie that I say has 10 pieces, but only give you 1.

<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>-Cheaters galore. Wallhackers especially. Fairfight is not enough. The game needs a client-side anti-cheat as well. Battleye maybe. Otherwise, it will suffer the same fate as Rainbow Six Siege.
<br>-Unbalanced weapons. No stopping power. With some weapons, you need to shoot the daylights out some guy to bring him down. The same goes for guys on horseback.
<br>-Bad respawns. On some maps it&apos;s not an issue. On others, it&apos;s terrible.
<br>-Aerial combat is a joke. Poor visibility, poor mechanics.
<br>-No penalties for friendly fire. Ridiculous. Grenades are being lobbied regardless. I&apos;ve seen flamethrowers walking into a building and torching the place with lots of friendlies around. How silly. Same goes for Sentry Bots.
<br>
<br>DICE needs to address ALL these issues with some patch. Otherwise, frustration will drive many players away. I, for one, will stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6779775">Expand</a></span>

Cant compete with 90% of the guns players level 10+ have when you are level 1-5... Battlefield 2, 2142, and 4 never had this issue!!! Stop being dumb with your development! 1 out of 10 cause of the imbalance and lack of thought put into it.</span>

Famous DX 12 i sa joke that if it is enabled sometimes brakes the game and you end up with windows message that searches for solution, support will naturally suggest to you to use DX11. So if you just bought that expensive video card, you are certainly gonna enjoy DX heaven.  There are other things: revive bug, spawn bug , net-code is fishy and so on. Matchmaking works like a charm , you are either winning with all points caped or losing with all points lost, people are leaving in those situations and you end up like a sucker who fights for EA stats while comments are all about GG, easy and cheat hackusations ??? Interface is empty and confusing at first with links to the youtube videos of those gays that sad how the great game is and how to play them, if you visit their twitch channels you can see that they have same problems as i mentioned... Of course , game graphics are beautiful , sound is fantastic but that is all. DICE please, doesn&apos;t work anymore and i&apos;am out of this EA DICE grand scam and half of  this 667 positive comments are certainly a hoax .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6804220">Expand</a></span>

I have been a fan of the Battlefield franchise for years and have played every version from 1942 onward.  I was looking forward to this game for months.  I really enjoyed the Beta, which was actually stable.  When the game was finally released. I enjoyed playing it... when I could.  The game is absolutely garbage unstable, as per usual for the last few releases this game has major net code issues.  I am sure at some point those will be fixed, but the internet stability issues, and the inability to play the game, and the absolutely abysmal stability for the net results in kicks at least 85% of the time I play.  For the amount of money I paid for this game.... and after the absolute crap fiasco Star Wars Battle Front was (and the fact that Battlefield 1 uses this garbage game interface) makes the game unplayable.  I have absolutely no patience of a company that will release a game that will remain stable for 85% of a 1000 ticket game to crash in the last 2 minutes of the game... then not allow me to receive any credit for the game play, any perks or anything else is frankly BULLS***.  That is the last time I pay over 100 dollars for some piece of crap collaboration between Dice and Origin.  I am mad as hell and will not be paying good money for any of this Dice Origin garbage in the future.  Fix your GD game guys, or at least let me get credit for the freaking game play I actually get to do.   You guys SUCK and you net stability page telling me to Open ports on my router A doesn&apos;t work, and B is a lame excuse for your inability to program a game with stable net code, or to protect your customers when you expensive garbage game doesn&apos;t work.  F me once with Battlefront... F me twice with BF1... I will not be paying for any of your crap products in the future..... a BIG TBAG from OverLrdSix</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6807455">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are just simply amazing, the sound really makes it an intense experience, specially with good speakers. The main screen is a nice change to battlelog, and it makes you feel more immersive. The artwork is really fantastic to be true.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Its a pathetic reskin of Star Wars Battlefront, with the same game feel and gun scheme, the bullets have a random dispersion cone, taking all the skill away from shooting, whether you use sights or not, having a good shooting discipline was a major factor in any fight in past BF games: this just ruined the game for me as they took that away.There is no strategy, just people running around and killing each other. MASSIVE frame drops, I have a gtx970 and I was in 60fps in medium settings... to drop to 30fps every 40 seconds or so, absolute garbage.
<br>
<br>(Sighs...) I had high hopes for this game, I will just stick to BF4 which is 10 times the games than this Battle Front reskin. Applied for a refund after 5 hours, I just couldn&apos;t stand it.
<br>
<br>I consider myself a hard core gamer (don&apos;t laugh please)... if you are casual gamer you might like this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6840901">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have played it for maybe 20 or so hours over a couple of weeks with a bunch of different friends but none of us feel the call to go back. Once you had done the maps a few times and experienced the meat grinder game player, there is nothing new or exciting to be found.
<br>So year, its probably worth the money, you will get some fun out of it but you will soon get bored and meh, each Battlefield game just seems to be getting more and more casual. Instant action, less tactics and teamwork.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6919275">Expand</a></span>

And what&apos;s with the black dude? I&apos;m not racist but it feels like Dice shoehorned them in to be PC. It&apos;s kind of insulting to black and white people. Black people didn&apos;t start WWI and a lot more white people died than black. Overall, its just not an entertaining game.</span>

<br>This is a beautiful game.  The sound is the best in the industry, as you would expect from DICE. They know videogame sound. The graphics, everything from shaders to particles are exemplary, and the optimization is fantastic. There is no better optimized game engine on the market than Frostbite and BF1 is the finest example of that.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Battlefield 1 is also the worst entry in the entire franchise. We all remember Battlefield 1942 fondly for its crazy, insane, chaos based gameplay. We remember the ships, the planes, the tanks, the big maps and the hilarious hi-jinks.  Noone remembers that game fondly for its gameplay.
<br>
<br>Battlefield 1 lacks all the charm of 1942, but is loaded to the gills with its janky, unbalanced, and sloppy gameplay.
<br>
<br>BF3 and BF4 for the first time in the franchise, made the actual moment by moment gameplay good. The gunplay, the vehicular combat, and the interaction of those elements were top notch, and finally... FINALLY the gunplay matched up to the scale and quality of everything else.  It did the whole schtick of &quot;modern tactical shooter&quot; better than anything on the market and made the contemporary (and far more widely known and popular) Call of Duty feel like a terrible joke.  Bf3 and BF4 had tight, responsive, and skill based infantry combat that sent a chill down the spine and took serious effort to master.  Noone loaded up BF3 for the first time and went on a killing spree of epic proportions.  No, you loaded the game up and died like a **** for several hours until your body and mind adapted to the gameplay and environment, which were designed to reward skill.  In short, BF3 and BF4 had a &quot;skill cap&quot; that both existed and had a notable and noticeably scale.
<br>
<br>Sure, you could be a 45 minute first time and get in a tank and slaughter some infantry for awhile.  But then again.. your in a tank. That was good. As soon as you came up on a better player in a tank, you died.  As soon as you came up on an engineer with more skill, you died.
<br>
<br>BF1 has none of this.  BF1 has none of the good of BF3/4.
<br>
<br>Remember how you had to &quot;tame&quot; weapons in BF4?  Remember how great your 950RPM AEK-971 was? or your 1000RPM FAMAS?  Remember how you were taken aback by the recoil at first, and died like a moron 20 times in a row until you learned to pull against it, learned that the AEK was better in 4 round bursts, learned to yank to one side, learned to yank down sharply at first and then loosen up a bit on the compensation in full auto situations?  Remember how your slow firing 500-600 RPM weapons required you to have better aim in CQB, required you to pull up to hit the head in order to stand a chance against high RPM weapons in CQB, but at range you could burst fire and out shoot them?
<br>
<br>Remember when it took skill to play the game?
<br>
<br>Those were fond memories.  BF1 has none of that.  In fact, you cannot burst fire any weapon in BF1.  The only rapid fire weapons in the game are the assault SMG&apos;s and the Support LMGs and if you try to burst fire then you miss every shot. The LMG&apos;s are HARDCODED to be mag dumped.  The guns LITERALLY INCREASE IN ACCURACY WHEN YOU HOLD DOWN THE TRIGGER.  It even tells you this in the tooltip when you pick Support.  This means if you want to hit a target midrange, you need to open fire and just randomly loose 20 or 30 rounds until the &quot;spread&quot; starts to visibly tighten up, then actually aim.  Its absolutely moronic and encourages bad, spammy gameplay.
<br>
<br>The SMG&apos;s are no better, but instead of increasing accuracy the more you full-auto, they simply have no accuracy beyond CQB and extremely low bullet range and velocity.  The developers solution to balancing SMG&apos;s (the primary weapon of the assault class) to everything else was to simply make them worthless beyond 30 or so feet.  No matter what you do, be it single shots or careful bursts (which you cant actually do because first-shot accuracy is no longer higher than follow ups like in most FPS games and prior BF titles) you will NEVER hit targets outside the intended combat range. Scouts and Medics now use sniper rifles and DMR&apos;s. Thats it, they are just bolt action sniper rifles or DMR&apos;s, not much else to be said about them. NEVER. Skill plays no factor.
<br>
<br>And thats the killer of this game.  The game is now built around rigid roles for each class.  You cannot deviate from those roles.  You can no longer take a high RPM CQB weapon and simply get really good with it, and use it to soften up targets at further than its optimal range with precise bursts.  You can no longer take longer range, lower RPM weapons and do well with them in CQB by learning to aim for the head/ride the recoil up to the head
<br>
<br>Im at the 5000 character limit. I wanted to go into more detail but i dont have room. But suffice to say, the game has lost everything good about BF3/4 (tight gameplay, powerful but skill-heavy vehicles) and replaced it with bombast that looks great but feels terrible</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873238">Expand</a></span>

I knew that BF1 had no real anticheat when I bought it I guess, but it is really starting to show now, with cheaters brazenly advertising their cheats in game and rage hacking at a breakneck pace, there is currently a rather notorious cheater actively and openly trolling people with his cheats, and advertising for the cheat supplier and he has been in game since the start and still is not banned, despite having an almost 100% accuracy score and his shots fired and kill score almost match.
<br>this will be the last EA product besides Mass Effect Andromeda that I will be buying for the foreseeable future. I can not believe that a game producer actually thinks that making a game with no active cheat detection is a good idea. fair-fight is a joke and it shows in the current state of BF1. do not buy until it is $20-30 &amp; even then for the campaign only, or until EA actually implements a proper anti-cheat (Battleeye for ex:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6852264">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The launch was alot better compared to other battlefield games so a plus for that.
<br>
<br>The thing with the game is that the lack of content and depth in the multiplayer is insane. The Assualt class only has 3 smgs (It has alot of variants of them just to make it look like it has more). Its so clear that the held back alot of content for DLC. The customization is really bad. IMO they should have just had 1 variant of everygun and leave the players to customize the guns the way they want to.
<br>
<br>The lack of character customization is also there but not that severe.
<br>
<br>So if you want to have fun in this game, but the ultimate edition, otherwise its not worth it. I unlocked everything and felt kinda bored on the 20 (one day before the official realese!)
<br>
<br>The rock paper scissor gameplay is kind of breaking the game. its so severe that its next to impossible to compete with anyone outside your range, if you play as the assualt and then meet a medic beyond 40 meters, you are going to loose. If thats the type of gameplay you like, go ahead buy it.
<br>
<br>The support class is probably one of the worst classes in the game as it stands right now. It is supposed to compete on the medic range but due to the &quot;the longer you hold down the trigger, the more accurate your shots will be&quot; its doesnt work, by the time your bullets hit them, you will be long gone by either a sniper or a medic.
<br>
<br>IMO, the game is only worth buying in a year or so with the ultimate edition. so you get the extra &quot;20 weapons and the 20 extra gadget&quot; (probably only 6 guns with variants).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6780973">Expand</a></span>

<br>Multiplayer which is why I purchased this game is quite poor, it gets boring fast. Many have complained of the limited content. But for me it was more the actual game design at fault.
<br>
<br>The game is loaded with snipers, because they can one hit kill you from range. Tanks are so over powered they get boring fast. I tanked a lot on past BF games, was global number 1 tanker on ps3 for over a year. I was disappointed with BF1 tanks. Way too simplified and easy to rack up massive kill streaks with. Tank on tank fights are bland and it&apos;s often a case of who gets the first shot off or who had x amount of repair players.
<br>
<br>With the map layouts in mind. Sniper camping, team spawning, kill cam and grenade spam, horses with massive health pools, over powered tanks etc. Matches are reduced to meat grinders. That or a game more based around a jogging simulator as you race from one objective to another. Then towards the end of the match, the losers get to hammer the winning side with either a battleship, blimp or armored train.
<br>
<br>The game is less about skill, opening up to casual gamer&apos;s wallets, and more random luck and chaos. I enjoyed past BF games for the strategy and tactics but in Bf1 it&apos;s more about spawning and dying and gaming ones reactions as players run around like headless chickens in waves.
<br>
<br>Other things bent towards casuals are random kits off the floor that make you overpowered, an elite hero unit that can soak up bullets while racking up easy kills like out of battlefront.
<br>
<br>Bf1 is a step away from games like BF 1942, Vietnam, 2142, and more towards games like call of duty or battlefront.

It is made for casuals. This is a real review from a real gamer with standards unlike the casuals that continue to give perfect scores to Battlefield 1. This game has way too many flaws to be anything close to an 8 let alone a 10.
<br>
<br>Content:
<br>The game lacks content. No hardcore. I dont care if it&apos;s delivered later. It should be in the game already. That&apos;s lazy and it smells just like the EA MODEL which is $$$$$$$. Progression is very slow and very unrewarding. Lack of customization. These dtails alone remove any 10/10 scores given to the game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>While new mode operations is a fun mix between rush and conquest it is still yet another sniper fest. Every map in almost all game modes encourages sniper play. Snipers are ROLFSTOMPING other players with martini henry. Medic is overpowered. Assault is basically a dummy. Support is completely useless.
<br>
<br>The worse part is that the game get boring VERY FAST. Check out the official forums. Hundreds of players are reporting that they only play 1-2 hours and get bored. They love the game but that&apos;s all they play. That tells you right there the game was made for casuals. People that only put in a small amount of time into the game then get bored and move on.
<br>
<br>Battlefield 1 is the most casual game ever made. For the love of God STOP comparing this game to bad company 2. Bad company 2 was a masterpiece. The best game in the series. The most balanced game in the FPS genre. Battlefield 1 is the most unbalanced, buggy, and casual game in the series.
<br>
<br>Gunplay:
<br>The most terrible gun mechanics I have ever seen. You are more accurate running and  hip firing then you are standing still. Guns give out pathetic damage and soldiers are bullet sponges eating it all up. Some guns have recoil EVEN BEFORE YOU FIRE THE FIRST BULLET. LMGs are completely worthless. I mean the list goes on and on.
<br>
<br>Map design:
<br>Most maps are made for sniper play. Probably to cater to the COD crowd that moved on from call of duty.
<br>
<br>Skill:
<br>Skill has been removed from the game. People are averaging Kill Death Ratios of over 20.00!!!! Unlike previous battlefields, the average player in BF1 will finish the game with a 67-2 kill/death. This game is extremely easy even for someone who just joined. I have been playing since the release of BF2. Battlefield games have always had a nice learning curve. You don&apos;t just walk in this game and are automatically good. That happens in BF1. Players are reporting that they were terrible players before but not they average high KDs. I, for example, have never liked snipers and I finished one game 43-1 as a sniper in BF1. I have always been a terrible sniper. And yet this happens? I doubt that other players suck that badly. No, the game is just too easy.
<br>
<br>Vehicles:
<br>Light tank got nerfed into oblivion. Planes are useless and the AA gun is beyond overpowered. Its range reaches way across the maps!!!! Cavalry is still overpowered. You are shot with almost a full clip and you dont die but you swing your sword and you one shot kill your opponent LMFAO give me a break.
<br>
<br>This game is AT BEST a 6/10. There&apos;s no way this is in the league of bad company 2 or BF2 or BF3 or even BF4. You guys reviewing this game giving it a 10/10 have ZERO standards. You&apos;ve no idea what a good battlefield game is. If you did, you&apos;d know that BF1 is absolute casual trash compared to games like BF2 and Bad Company 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6783865">Expand</a></span>

This game is a good idea held back by coding issues and balancing problems. Let&apos;s be honest for a moment, the netcode for this game is crap, shots don&apos;t register, guns don&apos;t fire, you lose the ability to ADS after being revived randomly. There are collision detection errors left, right and center. Right not the medic class is a little to good. If you need a break from Overwatch, Quake, or COD try this but don&apos;t expect to stay. It&apos;s an RNG for if the physics will work or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6780407">Expand</a></span>

The game is beautiful, the sound is good, and that is all the positive things I have to say about it.  I&apos;ve been playing Battlefield games online since (BF2142; 2006), and I have played everyone since then.  I have a great brand new rig, so that is not the issue.  I found the game to be slow, and I actually got bored a few times in the 1st few hours I played it, I was in awe with the last title for at least a week.
<br>
<br>The game really comes off as lazy, the guns are TERRIBLE, the options are less than before, many of the game features are not explained or maybe nonexistent anymore!?!  The battlefield companion is harder to use than battlelog, the servers didn&apos;t work at launch, and I bought the game a week after launch, and they were still down.  Every gun is spray and pray, and while its WWI only the scout has a bolt action firearm.  Ugh I should have give this game a 0.  the battlepacks now give skins, so in case you love the casual overwatch, now you can have some of that nonsense in your BF as well. Anyway wait for the price to go down and then give it a try.
<br>
<br>Look BF4 had a TON of issues, and it was complete garbage at release, yet I find this game to be less than BF4.  I wonder if it is release issues again or not, thankfully there is now a refund option, and I have already got my money back on this very bad battlefield game.  I guess it&apos;s BF4 until something better comes out, and nothing better came out in 2016.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6789629">Expand</a></span>

Pistols that will kill you from 100 yards away. Tanks that are almost unstoppable and a safe haven for want to be cheaters. I hope that DICE will fix the guns to a more believable range. As of right now it&apos;s a sniper/tank fest! Sad, sad, sad.</span>

<br>
<br>Flags are so close together that this game feels more like COD than Battlefield. The maps - as seems to be the trend - are smaller than ever. Gone are the days of large BF2 and large-ish BF3 maps. Sinai Desert is meant to be a large map, but all the control points are so close, there is no point to the rest of the map. You can no longer stealth your way around the map to take a point as you WILL get seen from somewhere. I would love to see a stat for average time before death. this game is very much spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn, die. Many maps are Metro all over again.
<br>
<br>The UI is TERRIBLE. The main menu is awful. It take sages to spawn as you have to wait for the map to zoom out, centere itself, then choose where to spawn. Game selection is unclear.
<br>
<br>Further, DICE is listening to the loud few again by nerfing mortars when, if anything, they needed a buff. Supression is non-existent, as you can empty 100 rounds from a support gun at a sniper and they will headshot you without blinking.
<br>
<br>And, of course, bugs bugs bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6819631">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Oh, and hackers are rampant despite the adorable little &quot;Fairfight ban&quot; that pops up occasionally - I guess they catch a few of them but it doesn&apos;t feel like it.  The dude going 110 / 10 seems to show up every other game.

<br>Pros:
<br>-The game looks absolutely stunning. This might be the best looking FPS I&apos;ve ever played and if i had to rate the game on the graphics alone it would be a 10 out of 10.
<br>-The gameplay (while incredibly unrealistic) is very fun. It&apos;s your classic battlefield set in WW1. And come on guys stop complaining about the realism. If you want a realistic WW1 game then the biggest enemy to you would be rats and mud. Trench foot simulator 2016
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Now here&apos;s my only but still big con about this game. The singleplayer. I know,i know nobody cares about that but i do. The singleplayer is embarrassingly short...lasting about 5 hours at best. That is inexcusable for 60 dollars.
<br>
<br>So there you go. It&apos;s definetly one of the better battlefields in recent memories but that isn&apos;t saying much. Still...it&apos;s worth a rental at least</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6853376">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really liked the rush and tdm maps from bf3 and bf4, and i don&apos;t find this battlefield to have that level at all. Gun variety has also been reduced and the uniqueness that the guns of the other games had.
<br>
<br>Graphically is fantastic and sound wise is flawless, but it has nothing that I would look for in a shooter at this moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6885665">Expand</a></span>

I understand they want to show the sides of the war not many people know about like the &quot;Harlem hellfighters&quot; and what not but that doesn&apos;t excuse the fact that there are so many blacks mixed in with the German, British and Australian Forces nor should it make up for the black man on the poster.
<br>
<br>Other than that the game is fun at times but the spawns are terrible i&apos;ve spawned right behind enemies and killed like 3 people, fun for me but still. Also the game feels too messy i wanted there to be coordination and you have to charge the enemy all at once to cap a point or something but that was not the case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=7275492">Expand</a></span>

Much weapons and vechiles and a story campaign very surrounding and very good characters! The only thing that i dont like the game it&apos;s because it have no tatics and because it&apos;s an arcade shooter, but i recommend this game for all like shooters and games of the World Wars!</span>

I was also really glad to see the building destruction I hadn&apos;t seen since Bad Company 2, and also the removal of the &quot;gain skill to unlock&quot; system as seen in BF4.
<br>After the novelty wore off, I began to see things. Many times, I&apos;ve shot invisible boundaries while lying prone with my LMG. It is also quite difficult to spot enemies. The spotting range is quite small.
<br>Also I it is extremely irritating that the SMG is more useful than the LMG, since the SMG fires faster and does practically the same damage. The LMG&apos;s purpose is to be able to suppress the enemy, but without realistic damage, the ability to wound and knock the enemy off their feet, LMGs are practically worthless.
<br>I hadn&apos;t noticed until I bought the full game, but there is almost no splash damage. Also, a direct hit with an anti-infantry mortar shell does 65 damage. Mortars were often used like artillery to shell an area. It shouldn&apos;t be that hard to kill with them. Also, what&apos;s with the lack of anti-tank weaponry available to the support class?
<br>Speaking of support, Battlefield 1 does very little to reward the supportive. A normal kill, if kept to yourself, is worth 120 points. The max a spotter can get is 20, and it is very hard to be effective with a mortar without a spotter. And there is no reward for holding down a point. And in the off chance someone does come to attack, you rarely have the opportunity to put enough bullets in them before they grab their rifle and kill you one shot.
<br>Now about the Behemoths. I must say, these monsters are very impressive. Until you try to use them, They are VERY slow. They don&apos;t have enough armor or firepower to go that slow, if you&apos;re talking balance. They last about 3-5 minutes in a game and generally by the time they&apos;re destroyed the your team&apos;s score has gone from 400 points behind to 350 points behind. Hell yeah!
<br>The balance of the game is terrible. I have always been auto assigned to the losing team, which can never turn the tide, by the way, since the enemy team has all the high-ranking players and is also full, compared to our 3/4 full team.
<br>The only part of this game that is any fun is the campaign. Which is also very short.
<br>So overall, there are much better games to spend $60 on. I have standards on how much entertainment or use my money should give me. Didn&apos;t really make the cut.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6960424">Expand</a></span>

Until the find a way to balance teams in this I refuse to play. There are wayyyyyy to many games that actually care about player experience out there on the market for me to waste even one minute of my time trying to find a good game in Battlefield. Its a shame because as i stated it started off really strong. I used to get really competitive games and have a blast playing the game, however because of the experiences I continuously have as of late I can not leave a good review. The game is well designed but the Dev team is horrible as always post release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=7267770">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately can&apos;t say the same for the multiplayer. I couldn&apos;t get any kills at all in this game and I&apos;m generally pretty good at shooters. Then I figured out it&apos;s Star Wars Battlefront code with &apos;ranges&apos; that you have to be in for each weapon, is why the guns feel so bizarre. Once you get used to the ranges you&apos;ll get a lot better but I just don&apos;t like the feel of it. I should never be too close for a sniper rifle to work, and shotguns are absolutely useless at surprisingly short distances (like 30 feet or so and suddenly it does nothing). And support LGMs should take more time to pull up to ironsights and make you run slower but should be devastating as hell when hit. Instead they feel weaker than a little SMG which is too weird to describe. I just don&apos;t like the &apos;feel&apos; of it.
<br>
<br>Also there&apos;s a lot of cheaters you see kicked every round. OMG it&apos;s only been out for three days!
<br>
<br>Anyway I guess it has potential if they fix the cheating and tune the guns a bit. But definitely not my favorite shooter out of the box.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6775819">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am having a lot of fun with it, and the game looks and sounds amazing. Sadly though, the WW1 setting is being done injustice by having too many automatic weapons and having too fast of an infantry movement speed. This makes the gameplay very arcady and COD-like. The weapons and vehicles feel more like WW2 than WW1, and the gameplay is even faster than it was in the good old BF1942 back in the day. Still, it captures a lot of the fun that I used to have with BF1942 in a contemporary game. Just a shame that the developers are compromising the look and feel of WW1 to the mainstream. I wish they would have just made a WW2 game if they were going to put so many automatic weapons in it. Sure, they existed towards the end, but 95% of the war was fought with bolt-action rifles.
<br>
<br>Special shout out to the Operations mode in multiplayer, which is less chaotic than Conquest, and is more of a simulation of real warfare, making you push towards enemy lines. Stringing together multiple maps in a narrative is a nice touch, and makes you actually learn something about the history of some of the WW1 campaigns.
<br>
<br>I have not touched the singleplayer campaign much, but the cinematics and voice acting seem very good. Sadly again, the WW1 setting is being executed poorly in making you an invincible supersoldier (except for the intro sequence). I know its still a video game, but it would have been nice to have you rely more on squad cooperation to complete the missions, rather than gunning down whole armies Rambo-style. A missed opportunity.
<br>
<br>Finally, the game is pretty buggy. Many people experience frequent crashes, judging by the forums, and DirectX12 doesnt work at all for me, and many people. At least it doesnt have major server problems like BF4 had, but it is still not great technically. Hopefully they will issue some major patches soon.
<br>
<br>PRO&apos;S:
<br>- graphically amazing
<br>- sound design is great
<br>- Fun gameplay, Operations mode is great
<br>- Good amount of multiplayer maps
<br>- Campaign cinematics and voice acting are great
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- Buggy! (doesnt work at all in DirectX 12 mode for many people)
<br>- Movement speed is too fast, which makes it too COD-like.
<br>- WW1 is being done injustice by both single player and multiplayer gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6789352">Expand</a></span>

<br>BF1 is not worth $80 they are charging for it in Russia. Whats the use in great graphics if everything else is half assed, buggy and unplayable. Most indie games are better quality and you get them for $10 tops.

<br>
<br>Let me start off by expressing how dumbfounded I am that peopel are saying the single player is good or even decent.  It is horrid, no worse and no better than bf3&apos;s and bf4&apos;s single player, an absolute embarrassment.  The AI is pathetic, the stealth is primitive, but the level design is just bad.  And what a missed opportunity, the single player was a perfect opportunity for some authentic ww1 trench combat, yet you don&apos;t get it in a single mission, not even the intro one.  The entire campaign feels like a 4 hour tutorial.
<br>
<br>Another glaring issue is the mouse input.  It feels like there&apos;s always a tiny delay to moving your mouse.  It&apos;s not enough to stop you from aiming, just from aiming well.  To make matters worse it feels like there&apos;s a tiny bit of acceleration no matter what.
<br>
<br>I found the best way to play the game was to grab a shotgun, zig zag my mouse to dodge bullets with the absurdly high sprint speed, and kill as many people as I could before dying, re spawning and doing it again.
<br>
<br>Doing anything but running around like a chicken with your head cut off is foolish, as movement speeds are high and so is your accuracy whilst moving, even with an lmg.  Even when I&apos;m sniping I never dare crouch or prone, as you seem to die the moment you stand still and try to play the game tactically.
<br>
<br>Behemoths are a joke, especially in operations.  Dice decided that instead of using good map design for balanced attack and defense gameplay like in bc2, they could just give the losing team a **** blimp.  The blimp is basically a low flying ac130.  If their are no tanks planes or aa guns (very likely as the defending side)  you pretty much just have to let if kill you, or sacrifice the objective.
<br>
<br>Speaking of maps, some of them are pretty bad.  All of the desert maps are awful, especially suez, though fao fortress can be fun if you just feel like sniping with one hand and jerking off with the other.  Let me reiterate though, Suez is perhaps one of the worst maps in ANY battlefield game.  A hill placed on only one side of B means the Ottomans will pretty much always win.  Nevertheless, 3 flags in a straight line should never be acceptable for 64 player conquest no matter what.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving this game a 0 even though it deserves a 3, but other reviewers are being far to generous since they immediately give a 10 to any pretty explosions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6780436">Expand</a></span>

Having spent a little more time with the game, I&apos;m downgrading it further to a 2.
<br>
<br>This is not the BF of yore, where vehicle combat meant something to the outcome of a match.  This is basically an infantry game with some sloppily added vehicles.  Depth of play in the infantry role breaks down to one of the four classes and the variations in their weapons. It heavily favors sniping (Scout class).  Most of the infantry roles can carry some form of anti-vehicle weaponry, including snipers that can damage armor from distance with &quot;K bullets&quot; and an anti-tank gun that fires like a sniper rifle.
<br>
<br>Ground vehicles include three variations of tank: from a single seat light tank and  two larger multi-crew tanks, each with three variations that generally &quot;specialize&quot; (or pigeon-hole) the vehicle.  Visibility for all but the driver is terrible in each type, which makes riding in them dull.  They&apos;re all quite slow and easy targets for the broad array of anti-vehicle weapons.
<br>
<br>The planes are the worst aspect of this Battlefield iteration.  Truly, this was a missed opportunity for DICE.  Instead of creating polished air-to-air flight mechanics, it&apos;s mostly biplanes on rails.  The lag in the code is so bad that planes often appear to cartwheel, warp or even fly backwards when pursued.  There is no speed management required, and &quot;dogfights&quot; are just long, boring chases; no cutting, no switching.  This is a shame, because it was in WWI that dogfighting was born.  Unfortunately, it was an afterthought in this game.
<br>
<br>There are three variations of aircraft, each with their own limited variations which force the player to choose air-to-air or air-to-ground.  The former is essentially useless in its role, as the air to ground variants can hold their own against other aircraft. And other than the bomber and the attack plane&apos;s anti-vehicle role, they&apos;re all pretty harmless to the opponent.  This is due in part to the inability to spot or see infantry. The flare mechanic for spotting infantry from the fighter&apos;s &quot;trench fighter&quot; role either doesn&apos;t work or is too watered down to be of use.
<br>
<br>In short, most aircraft are only good for transporting a player across the map quickly.  They have no impact on the ground situation and are easily destroyed by the AA guns sprinkled liberally around the maps.
<br>
<br>If you like vehicles and played previous BF titles, especially 2, 3 and 2142, you&apos;ll be disappointed with DICE&apos;s weak efforts here.  They have taken it a step further than they did with BF4, where widely available auto-guided, low-skill weapons ruined vehicle play.  In this iteration, not only are anti-vehicle weapons widely available, the vehicles themselves have no teeth at all.
<br>
<br>The only positive thing I can say about it is that it&apos;s graphically beautiful.  But DICE has no monopoly on that these days.  I&apos;m so glad I only paid $60 for this; some paid $140 for it.  But then, I learned that lesson in BF4.  Never trust DICE or the so-called &quot;Critcs&quot;.  Save your money and buy something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1/user-reviews?user_review_id=6776794">Expand</a></span>
