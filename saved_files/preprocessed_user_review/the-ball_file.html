The storyline is mysterious and well thought out, with interesting to watch cutscenes. The lighting effects further enhance the overall flavor of the game, and adds an eery feeling as you explore each level. The game mechanics are well implemented, but they do take a bit of getting used to, as initially, the controls may seem clunky. The game rewards you with an achievement for killing innocent bystander monkeys and even keeps track of how many you have killed, which is rather pointless and mean. Regardless of the monkeys, there are plenty of monsters to kill that will come at you relentlessly. With that said, there is not much variety in who your enemies are, but this does not feel too repetitive or boring, since you will be doing all you can to control the ball and attack them with it, and there is a great amount of excitement and fun in the process. This mechanic really isn&apos;t as simple as it sounds, and it does take getting used to and learning the techniques. Killing the monsters makes them splat with some gore and loose body parts. These moments are incredibly tense, exhilarating, and action packed. The Ball manages to put together various aspects from a few genres and implements them quite well. It feels like a first person shooter, adventure, puzzle game, slightly reminiscent of the Portal series. The level design is outstanding, and truly sets out to make an experience that is memorable, tense, edgy, creepy and extremely satisfying. The buildings and other structures are masterfully crafted and placed in the game world for much enjoyment. Simply looking around each level is an absolute delight by itself. In The Ball, there is an overall feeling of loneliness, as you must progress through the dire situation of being lost all by yourself, without anyone helping. It also manages, through its mood, setting, and atmosphere to positively produce emotions of fear, despair, worry, and awe. Being inside the various tombs, caverns, and other structures presenting a theme of ancient Mexican civilizations is truly amazing. Everything has near perfect timing, expert design, wonderful execution and flawless placement. There aren&apos;t that many bosses in The Ball, but the few you will encounter are skilfully crafted, and a joy to watch and fight against. The puzzles are all quite intuitive and requires the perfect amount of thought in conjunction with action dexterity. They are all well developed and enacted, providing much satisfaction as you complete each one. If some of the puzzles may seem a bit complicated, the designers have included a hints system that allows you to get on the right path of puzzle solving without sacrificing the gaming experience and other plot elements. Adding to an already extremely positive overall experience, the ending was thoroughly satisfying. Once you&apos;re done with the campaign, you are also given the option to go through small, new levels not found in the campaign, in the so-called Survival game mode. It is an interesting change from the campaign, but it does not compare, as it is taken from an entirely different context, and has a whole different approach. This has been the best overall experience in a first person game since Half-Life 1. The Ball is that amazing. The environments are beautiful, the game play is rich and interesting, and it never gets boring. It is also perhaps the most fun you will have as a virtual, in-game archeologist. The Ball is a truly magnificent experience. It took me about 8 hours to complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-ball/user-reviews?user_review_id=2337844">Expand</a></span>

There is really no story to speak of, any combat of note is puzzle based, and there is no penalty for dying except picking up from where you left off.  That&apos;s actually a good thing, as you can focus on the puzzles, and admire the level design, rendered beautifully with the Unreal 3 engine.  The levels tend to be huge, and have a retro feel, which made me smile remembering the first time I saw lava in Duke Nukem 3D.  The 4 Survival mini games feel tacked on, but show the same great attention to detail in the level design as the campaign.  Easy to beat if you stay between 2 traps and just swing your ball around..  Almost feels like a testing ground for co-op, which would be awesome with some more interesting, unique monsters...  They did skimp on the beta testing, as there are a lot of places where you can get &quot;Stuck&quot; when secret  hunting.  Given it only takes maybe 30 seconds to reload and get back to where you were, and a $20 price tag, I&apos;ll give a pass.<br><br>The possibilities are endless with the Ball, and I hope to see a sequel soon.

The graphics are nice enough, but nothing to fall on your knees for. The atmosphere might work if there were a decent plot, but it&apos;s basically: you fall in a hole, find a gravity gun and a big ball metal, so &quot;obviously&quot;, these must be used to help you press the glowing blue and orange buttons. Oh, and to crush innocent monkeys. The whole thing just feels contrived and meaningless, so there&apos;s no sense of immersion and you&apos;re left shaking your head and asking, &quot;why would someone have built this place?&quot; You&apos;re always aware that you&apos;re in a game solving some artificial puzzles that are so simple, if sometimes awkward, that you wonder why they didn&apos;t just put the exit right by the entrance. And there&apos;s something missing: a hero/star/protagonist. You&apos;re certainly not it. In this game, you&apos;re nothing more than the guy who&apos;s taking the ball out for a walk. Your ability to interact with the environment is nil, except for the occasional blue button. The ball isn&apos;t it either. It&apos;s just a big, stupid ball that&apos;s in your way half the time. Damn thing isn&apos;t sentient or cuddly like a weighted companion cube. It&apos;s not the gun. All that does is tug at the big stupid ball or push at a handful of things, and usually not the things that you want to push. And it&apos;s not the environment either. It has about as much personality as the ball. It&apos;s not a completely horrible game. It&apos;s pretty and except when you get stuck between two pebbles and are forced to restart a level, it doesn&apos;t feel too badly crafted, but it&apos;s just not much fun or interesting or exciting. Oh, and I was going to give it a charitable 5, but this pet peeve of mine just lost it another point: the strength of a force field, like gravity, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. That means that if you&apos;re half the distance, it&apos;s 4 times stronger. If you&apos;re 100 times the distance, it&apos;s 10,000 times weaker. The gravity gun in this game has a constant strength regardless of distance, so you can tug at the ball from  300 yards as if it were on your lap, but it&apos;s too weak to lift the ball out of a hole if you shoot it point blank. Suspension of disbelief can only go so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-ball/user-reviews?user_review_id=1918439">Expand</a></span>

The Ball whizzing around ancient ruins with some epic 3D graphics and puzzle elements thrown in. Yet when I played the game I found something very different to the generic Super Monkey Ball gameplay that I&apos;m very fond of. A commonly overused and irritating gameplay element is the idea of pushing a ball around, trying to make sure it doesn&apos;t skid off the edge of the map. This is a horrible, gruelling form of gameplay that seemed to be made to be frustrating and stupid. Why anyone would base an entire game off it is beyond me. The Ball is huge, so you can&apos;t see what on earth you&apos;re firing it at. The graphics are poor and inefficient, constantly lagging. Even the screen resolution options are limited as if it was created in 2000, when about 4 screen resolutions were used. The game as a whole is frustrating and excruciating. The only place where this kind of game works is when you&apos;re in direct control of the ball.<br><br>Generally, this game is a complete and miserable failure in most aspects. It had a lot of potential, but the developers almost seemed like they wanted to create a game around awful core gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-ball/user-reviews?user_review_id=1470541">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are all extremely simplistic and you will never get a sense of accomplishment when you finish an area. The graphic style looked interesting at the beginning but repetitive areas make that feeling go away very quickly. The story is non existent unless you go out of your way to find secrets which will reveal some of the history behind what has happened. The ball controls funky, and will often get stuck on nothing when you try to push it and can also end up circling around you when you try to pull it back towards you. The combat is boring as well, the giant hammer you carry around can&apos;t damage them - only push them back a few inches. You&apos;ll have to rely on the ball for that, and even then it gets very repetitive quickly, and the death animations of enemies is very bad as well. This title would have been better suited as an action/adventure game. There is basically nothing in this game that is fun and you can find plenty of other, cheaper games that are much better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-ball/user-reviews?user_review_id=2488758">Expand</a></span>

The combat, platforming and puzzles work quite well and the games visual design gives the game a atmosphere that i really enjoyed. The puzzles could be a little more varied but otherwise is the campaign also quite varied  much more than i would expect from such a cheap game. Some complaints that i should mention is that the puzzles could be little harder, the combat could be little more varied and that a few puzzles-designs were a little strange.  In the end though its still a good game and if you are interested in the genre &quot;the Ball&quot; could be worth checking out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-ball/user-reviews?user_review_id=2678740">Expand</a></span>
