(but again maybe its ME); always after a combat I think &quot;wow thanks god there is a save point-that one was pretty hard&quot;; c) bad things: powers aren&apos;t always easy to use (you have to place the character with extreme care, in THAT place and not two millimetres away!), an open ending (eh eh, space for a sequel-that&apos;s business my friends) and -but that&apos;s MY problem- the language translation in italian (totally sucks, I just play in english). To me, this game rocks: if you read Barker, buy it; if you enjoy a game with a marvellous mood, great characters and great plot and don&apos;t mind little repetitive schemes... buy it! It&apos;s worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=417996">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t buy it expecting something I would go back and play again or anything like that, I bought it to chew through the story and have a good nights (well about eight hours on normal) killing. The story and characters are the best part of the game and I was thoroughly hooked from the start. It&apos;s a bit like a sort of cross between Rainbow Six and the Hellraiser movies, with some top boss fights added for good measure. The graphics and sound are great, not just in their quality of construction but also the artistic concept, and this conceptual intelligence carries on to the powers of the main characters, which are great fun to use. Typically for a Clive Barker game (Undying went the same way) it seems to have been somewhat underrated by journalists but I didn&apos;t think there was much, if anything, really wrong with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=404194">Expand</a></span>

While many people are happy with movies that don&apos;t win awards or treasure books that no literary scholar will ever critique or recommend, every gamer seems incredibly defensive about their favorite games and outright hostile about games they dislike. This is very unfair, for this game excels at what it is. Nothing is broken about the game, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do- create allot of action against Cenobite-like enemies in an interesting setting with a fun squad-based game mechanic. The game feels like a cooperative class based multiplayer game, with the player primarily taking the part of the medic but with the option to play all the other classes- soldier, heavy, sniper, spy etc. It&apos;s as linear as an on-rails shooter, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from being allot of fun- which is the point. The writing is not Shakespeare, it&apos;s Barker, and it feels allot like his fiction in parts, in fact the inventiveness( or you may feel corniness) of the concept is classically Barkerian. Don&apos;t listen to the reviews, try the demo, read some Clive Barker, and think for yourself. This game won&apos;t please all, but for those that it does, it will please allot. Remember to have fun with your games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=404863">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I am enjoying Jericho and think it is one of the better shooters out this year. The characters are interesting and graphics are top-notch. This squad based game is the best i have ever played. I have yet to encounter any bugs which is a rarity in most new releases. Highly recommended.</span>

As you get to know the controls, moving people around and utilising the various team based tricks to complete a mission you start to get into the adult storyline which i found refreshing. I found you really have to gel with the style of game but if you do you&apos;ll be glad and soon find the evenings vanish. The use of in game scripts and cut sequences worked well with the in game as a whole and added to the sense of story, although i&apos;ll admit some area needed a little more work. There is also real use o f team based combat as well as the odd single and sub sets of the team, having said that i did tend to stick to a few members but definately found them all useful along the way. Including that consession i seriously suggest this game, especially at today&apos;s prices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=412914">Expand</a></span>

The game is a bit linear in the sense that it plays out like a movie... but what would you expect from Clive Barker? It&apos;s a very interesting story and the ending wasn&apos;t as disappointing as some folks made it seem. There are definitely some problem solving moments where you must figure out how to take down a specific monster and decide which team member to use. The graphics are amazing as well. The game does a system check and fits the graphics to your system. The &quot;none none&quot; guy who gave it a 1 must not have that great of a system. Dont let the bad reviews discourage you if you were thinking about buying the game. In my opinion it was money well spent and one of the best games Ive played. I hope he makes more games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=405047">Expand</a></span>

Now, place this inside an exhilirating crimson red carnival ride through Hell with Z-Grade scripted events that have the cheesiest one-liners this side of Predator. How the hell could you not have a good time with this game? THIS GAME IS BEYOND QUOTABLE. If you&apos;re a fan of 80s action films, and have the faintest interest in Barker&apos;s gothic creations, do not question a purchase. The imagination present in character design is very impressive. The environments are a little drab and smoldered beneath the dark skies of a hellish landscape, but they still work in the context of Barker&apos;s imagination. The little details in the special fx make this game even more appealing to the eye. Some of the special powers come off weaker than others, but the way they&apos;re executed is excellent across the board. Particularly, the ghost bullet, which allows you to control the trajectory of a bullet through several enemies at once. The variety of weapons at hand is solid, nothing particularly new, but solid. However, special mention needs to go out to the slow motion katana slices and the sniper rifle equipped with grenade rounds. All in all, a highly entertaining ride that ends too abuptly. One point shaved for the ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=408055">Expand</a></span>

I think reasons of such low score is pre-release version of game that most of reviewrs played. Demo of Jericho also was not perfect, but team fixed most of its issues in release.</span>

The squad combat, while non-essential, diverts one&apos;s attention from just how linear the game is.  A small detractor, but the timed button pressing sequences were broken on PC without default controls.  It&apos;s a different kind of game.  The major strength is the atmosphere, similar to games like Amnesia, and Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.  Like these games, there are some serious flaws to the gameplay, but the experience still manages to be highly enjoyable, and unique.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=1466317">Expand</a></span>

I have NO IDEA why some people would pan this game, let alone some of the unforgiving reviews here or a steam meta-score of 63. This was one of my favorite FPS games to come out in a Long time, and I&apos;ve played a lot of them. Got it as a value title on steam and I played it to the hilt in a couple of days, got more than my money&apos;s worth -- it was a STEAL! While It&apos;s not perfect, it doesn&apos;t need to be and I can be truly unforgiving to some games with profound enough flaws. The Good: Interesting and novel elements for FPS&apos;s can be found here. Lots of Abilities and gimmicks that many other games think sufficient to rest on their laurels with one or two of, this game has a whole suite of them thrown in with the kitchen sink (14 total, including bullet-time, Healing, Tele&amp;Pyro Kinesis, bullets you can guide in flight as well as spell-like effects.) You can freely switch between the 7 characters in your squad for most of the game, each accommodating different play-styles, to keep the game fresh, or to overcome specific challenges. Need the whole squad to take something down? Go with your support classes. Just want to mow everything down and don&apos;t overthink it? Go heavy. Puzzle time? Switch to the clairvoyant. Time to get personal? One of the characters is a melee badass. The environments and characters as well as enemies are really immersive and sometimes truly horrifying. There are a few quick time events sprinkled into the game -- but where in most titles this feature is repetitive, punishing or annoying -- they REALLY shine here. I won&apos;t ruin them all but there is one where you have to use quick-time button-mashing to perform an EXORCISM! Very cool. The gore, language and violence are VERY graphic and even disturbing in places -- but appropriately so. The story is historically inspired and TRULY different. What&apos;s cooler? As the game progresses your futuristic squad moves further and further back in time and interacts with folks like 1942 British Occult soldiers (and their nazi counterparts), Corrupted Crusaders, Roman Legionaires... all the way back to Sumerian Priests! There is good character development and achievements unlock info about various heroes and villains -- in most games this is extraneous or cursorily interesting, but for this game I read and examined them all THOROUGHLY. The backbone concept alone is awesome -- Military Occult Warfare team assembled from Witches and Chaplains in the US army? The story is AMAZING. The Bad: Really... I have to work to give equal time for deep criticism, because the game is awesome especially for the price, but here goes... No multiplayer -- and in a squad-based game like this it is TRULY a shame -- if it did it could have potential for amazing multiplayer action akin to games like left 4 dead, because the characters are so different and would mesh SO MUCH BETTER if a variety of people were talking and driving them (though the AI is adequate for single-player) Perhaps dare I say considering the 7 different classes it could have been a great mesh of Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2... sadly, it was not to be. A second gripe would be that once you are able to rapidly switch between the entire squad things can get a little overwhelming at first. They DO try to acquaint you with each character in turn and introduce the powers, but before long you find yourself in situations where 1 or 2 powers are the best (or in a couple of circumstances the only) solutions before you are fully familiar with all the tools at your disposal. Thankfully the game is long enough so that before long you know what you&apos;ve got and can switch it up to handle anything you need to deal with. Also, while the character selection menu uses squad members last names to identify them, in many situations the squad-members voices refer to characters by their first name. Sure, before too long you&apos;ll catch up and learn that you need to switch to Black (the Sniper) when somebody is asking &quot;Simone&quot; to take a critical shot or use telekinetics, or know intuitively that when people are yelling that &quot;Billie is Down!&quot; that you need to go help (Billie) Church as referred to into the menu. I got the idea, they wanted you to have a first-name basis and identification with the characters... but it was a little difficult at first, like being at a dinner party and being nervous about remembering everyone&apos;s name to whom you were introduced... still, by the third mission I assure you I was good friends and on a first name basis with all of them. Lastly, where some games can be annoying or punishing in putting you in situations where there is no obvious way or counter-intuitive way to proceed, it seems the dialogue in this game was almost in a hurry to give things away -- You never get to a point where you want to hit your head on a wall because in some situations the puzzle is telegraphed to you before you know there&apos;s a problem! Beats the alternative though.<br>9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115137">Expand</a></span>

The switching elements were great, as every character plays completely different throughout the game. Yes, some places are a bit repetitive but these demons are mindless ZOMBIE- like characters! What do you want, non-zombie characters? Then we complain it&apos;s too tough! The squad consists of six members; do you want them to be machine-accurate all the time? Then you could just send them ahead and have thme fight for you! If people are complaining that their squad dies too quickly then that&apos;s bad management of the team. The only bad thing about the game is that it doesn&apos;t explicitly teach you how to control the two squads, causing one area in particular with switches on the floor to seem like an impassible glitch. Wverything was great and fun and entertaining. Only downfall: The Ending. Don&apos;t expect anything at all from it. Overall, a solid game that I hope sells well in spite of the horrible, undeserving reviews, so we may get a sequel in this novel, entertaining game that creatively hits new ideas.

Simply put, I have quite a lot of fun playing this game, the hours fly by and I find the characters, setting and gameplay well executed. What on earth went through some reviewers heads when they gave this game scores in the 3 region I will probably never understand. Please people, dont fall into the trap of not buying this game because of these reviews. Expect a fast shooter in the lines of &quot;multiple squad members gone Doom in the realm of 21st century gaming&quot;, and youll be fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=404123">Expand</a></span>

Art direction of the game somehow is impressive, environments are design very nice and they have a dark atmosphere which will definetly creep you out. Enemies designs are one the best i have ever seen, they have much of details in them and truly they look like DEMONIC things. Technically graphics are not that much good. Most of the game is actually dakr and you can see the technical hiccups  lol </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=3076755">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s brown, dull, and disgusting to look at and presents itself with a laughable, tough-guy attitude that sounds like something a fifth-grader would make up when boasting about how violent his older brother&apos;s games are. It&apos;s five or so hours long and is almost entirely a trek through generic dark hallways that lead to more generic hallways, often leaving me turning around without noticing. The plot is a complete throwaway and it cuts to credits before any sort of ending comes about. Your teammates go down constantly and need reviving, often getting you killed and forcing you to restart the whole repetitive segment. While it does have some unique ideas, especially with special powers and character swapping, they&apos;re too poorly implemented for any credit to be gained.
<br>
<br>And yet, I played it through and had a weird kind of fun, revelling in how ridiculous it was and how hard it tried. It&apos;s a big dumb shooter but at least it&apos;s a unique one, leaving a somewhat lasting impression on me and the wish that it was so much better.

The game has it&apos;s bright moments and if you manage to get to the bottom of the story you&apos;ll enjoy most of it. The concept to switch between characters further enhances the experience and is necessary to survive. Well that&apos;s all I can tell and I hope someone finds this helpful.</span>

Graphics were good, plot was good, dialogue was good, voice acting was great, music was good, atmosphere was excellent.   It has excellent replay value.  The team who put out this game had their ducks in a row,  unlike too many of these epic games put out by big name distributors which are buggy as hell.  It&apos;s just too bad a sequel never came out</span>

This game simply lacks action, the enemies are slow and predictable and the interactive cut-scenes are extremely annoying due to incredibly short delays. Not sure why they thought it would be fun for you to watch nearly every possible ending until you can memorize the exact key strokes. The CGI trailers for this game would have you believe that there is intensive and suspenceful action, this is sadly not the case. The puzzels in the game are also extreamly annoying, mainly because they tell you exactly what to do... honestly the hardest thing about any given puzzel is trying to figure out who you are supposed to take control of... this is thanks to them giving you the first name only of the character and the possession menu only having the last name, nice touch. The voice acting is only OK, no standouts here... the lip syncing between the characters is done exceptionally poorly however. As for having 6 characters you can swap betweem... pretty much the only one you will want to use is Black, the other 6 simply are not effective. The other issue going around just playing Black is that none of her weapons require any skill. There are 4 generic enemies in this game, and another 7 boss types. Most of the enemies are annoying and require that certain weak spots be assulted... bosses with the annoying cutscenes are constantly repeated where you play the same annoying cutscene over and over in exactly the same sequence. The graphics were good atleast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=404221">Expand</a></span>

The powers LOOKED awesome, especially the tentacled energy thing (you&apos;d know it if you saw). The characters are balanced, but not so much that you won&apos;t have a favourite.
<br>The bad: I didnt find this game scary at all... the darkness of some parts were more annoying than scary. The flashlight barely helps. The controls are alright but the firing system really pissed me off... you have to hold down the trigger to even fire one shot. It made sniping impossible!! To do so you have to aim at an enemy, hold down the trigger, release and repeat... it would be infinitely better to just click to fire, no hold. You can imagine that I didnt use the sniper after trying that out. Holding down the trigger for automatic weapons isnt bad though. The absolute worst thing in this game was the action-cinematic parts... a la Resident Evil 4. If you dont understand, it is like pressing buttons in a sequence to not die. RE4 did it very well. Jericho did not. You have 1/10th of a second to press a direction or you die...missing one means you miss them all. And by all there are 10 or more in a row. The part of the demo where you fall down the well demonstrates this. I have never been angrier playing a game before... its impossible to beat this part the first time. The only thing to do is die and replay it, anticipating the keys that you missed. Its more like a memory game. It took me 16 tries to get through a 20 second bit. The idea is there but it plays out terribly... just give more time to press the keys! (like .5 of a second even!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=66420">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s liek watchign a movie. The only thing you control is what you shoot and how you shoot it. Infinite ammo ect bleh. But it did have a ok storyline wich was somewhat interesting. This game strogn point is in the eye candy that that is the best part of the game.</span>

Whats with the extra&apos;s ring this phone number now menu!!!! The game is pretty much on rails the entire time with the only freedom being who you use during the fights. I also do not like losing control of my character during some of the scenes as it detach&apos;s you from the action. On the good, the graphics are top notch, i really like the effect of the flashlight on your team mates in the low light areas. Some of the team work can be interesting which is one of your only freedoms in the game so make the most of it. My recommendation is if your interested still, wait until its a budget title, its not worth the full price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=404961">Expand</a></span>

This means you spend about 30 minutes dying around 400 times falling off the ledge before you realise your key mappings dont work. The next time this occurs you are unable to use any keys for left and right (remapped or otherwise). Combined with multple reload bugs where characters get stuck on the environment meaning you cant reach checkpoints and need to reload, this is just about the worst port I have ever seen. Would give it 0, but the graphics are quite good.

Less than average overall - I had high hopes due to Clive Barkers tag on it, but alas it doesnt come close to what I feel it could have with a little more development, and some valid PC testing.</span>

Repeative encounters where enemies spawn 10 times or more from the same spot. Squad AI is simply lacking and merely spray and prays. Bland level design with small pathways from point A to B. Awful reaction mini games where you have to push buttons in sequence to progress through the cut scene. Speaking of which, currently I am STUCK on the crusades (second) level and unable to finish the game since the reaction game is bugged. My options are to either PAY MONEY for a cheat code for my copy of the game which will bypass the reaction event. Or I can possibly tweak my graphics card and hope the event works correctly. I am utterly aghast at this abomination of a game. not only is it a shooter on a rail but it insults you by forcing encounters of kill X enemies until you can pass. Not only does your squad do nothing to protect themselves or avoid splash damage. The biggest gripe is they are trying to milk this filth by forcing you to buy the cheat codes. BUY THE CHEAT CODES, for some people like myself we are having to bypass a infinite loop reaction cut scene or we cant progress. They expect us to pay for a code to bypass this ensuring a couple of dollars extra on top of the price. Remember who made this and remember how bland and bug infested it was. Dont forgot how they try to use buggy scenes and overly hard sections to generate cash through a pay to cheat system. Most of all remember to not support barginware gussied up with a famous persons name. P.S. Why couldn&apos;t this have been more like Undying?

                                        <span> Jericho is more fun than most people give it credit for, I think. The combat may be repetitive and the colors banal, but the unique weapons and abilities of each squad member held my interest through to the end. To be fair, I picked it up at Gamestop for only $10. If you can get a deal like that, Jericho is worth it. Don&apos;t pay more unless you really like occult shooters.</span>

<br>
<br>Theres pretty cool religious and dark premise. A lot of work and detail put into world characters and villains that cause a real disgust and fair amount of fear from their ominous looks. Game just oozes great and unsettling atmosphere in levels which shift from modern setting down to sumerian times 3000 years BC with good detail added to portray each time period as well as possible. The way you can play as 6 characters with seemless jump to one another also was something quite unique that i had simililarly seen only in a 6 years younger game GTA V, not mentioning how it expands gameplay variety with each Jericho soldier having unique guns and magical abilities. All Jericho members also suprisingly are kinda likeable, each feels somewhat unique with their own backstories, they can crack childish, but funny jokes at times.
<br>
<br>On less positive side is the gameplay itself. Game is very linear, nothing wrong with linear games of course, but even good linear games can pull of sense of grander scale, Jericho doesnt do that, its just leads you thru tight corridors and paths to boss encounters which have more arena style layouts. its Gunplay can be a very mixed bag, something like Delgado&apos;s hand cannon can feel pretty beefy and powerful, while his mini gun just feels weak and piss poor to use, much same can be said about other guns other characters have. Not helping that aspect is the very generic sound design guns have, utter majority of them just have no impact and Black&apos;s sniper rifle could be worst offender sounding very poor like ripped from a B action movie generic sound FX library. Also story itself doesnt really do a good impression, there are certain highs and lows, but what really hurts is the damn ending of the game, it just ends without any aftermath explanation and doesnt show what happens with the Jericho squad, just rollis the credits and thats it, no post credits scenes, nada, nothing.
<br>
<br>Good thing is game is very well optimized, it has very dark, brown look to its graphics, but it really suits the game&apos;s style its pulling off, i cant imagine it having actual other vibrant colours, for a 2007 not really a triple A game it looks pretty good and runs very well, i only had 1 weird game crash during my time with it. Plus it takes very little space on storage drive, below 4 GB</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-jericho/user-reviews?user_review_id=7791290">Expand</a></span>
