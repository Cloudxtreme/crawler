However people must not forget the graphics are like that since this is based on a comic book series. I really enjoyed playing this game and am a little gutted there is no sequel :(. Definitely worth the buy.</span>

I can&apos;t remember how many times I had to repeat tedious trial-and-error sneaking levels simply because the next guard &apos;round the corner spotted me. On one occasion an alarm was sounded by a guard who wasn&apos;t even anywhere near my line of sight! Frustration should not overshadow fun in a game; players should not constantly be penalized for a single misstep. (I really do loathe games where you have to sneak around most of the time anyway, unless they have working quicksaves/quickloads, or you can at least blast them with some silenced weapon). The tragedy is this is something that could have easily been fixed by a short afternoon of coding had they cared enough to put forth the effort. And that&apos;s pretty much the impression I get playing this game: lack of effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xiii/user-reviews?user_review_id=386784">Expand</a></span>

Needs patching immediately, but seems to suffer from a severe lack of support as games released since this came out have had patches already, and it&apos;s tech support forums seem to be focused merely on the game&apos;s problems being user-related rather than the obvious flaws that scream for repair, like the broken save-game feature. Too bad, too, as it looks like it could have been fun....I left it installed for 2 weeks but finally got rid of it due to lack of proper support from the publisher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xiii/user-reviews?user_review_id=373120">Expand</a></span>

Now that I have finished it, the question is, is XIII as interesting to play as it is to look at?
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t want to, but I guess I have no other option than to start with the graphics which are, to say the least, very interesting looking. The game is made with cell-shaded technique and has aged very well because of that. It looks almost on par with more modern games, such as Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands. In addition to that, the art style is also pretty good. Even though it is made in a unique comic book style with every conversation written in a speech balloon and every shot accompanied with a written BANG!!!, XIII is, in it&apos;s hearth, a classic First Person Shooter game. True, it tries to add something more to the genre, but it is half successful in doing that. At certain points in the game, you are either forced or allowed to use a grappling hook, in a similar way Batman uses it. This can be fun, but can also be frustrating, as it tends to make you dead from time to time. In most cases, it&apos;s also optional, and in some cases necessary, to go stealth mode. This has the same effect as the grappling hook, as it adds some excitement to the game, but can become frustrating, especially because the game is incredibly linear. Don&apos;t expect to be given any alternate paths in this game. If you see a ventilation shaft, that&apos;s the only way ahead, if you see a corridor, it&apos;s again, the only option to advance. That is a huge shame, as more added freedom would have made this game a lot more interesting. Nevertheless, weapons are interesting to shoot with and they make a unique but satisfying bang. The problem here is though, that you do not get to keep already found weapons and your inventory is rearranged to what the game thinks you&apos;ll need after every mission. This is true for med-packs, ammunition, as well as all special tools, so it&apos;s pointless to save grenades or med-packs for later use. This takes us to the story, which is pretty good for a game of that period and tells about the twenty conspirators who killed the president of the United States and tried to take over the country. The story is presented to the player in graphic novel panels, which is, as we know from the Max Payne games, a good way to tell a story. The story itself is a bit stuck in the sixties though and could have easily been a James Bond movie plot. We do encounter some interesting characters and witness some impressive character development (of the main protagonist). This is definitely a plus, but I think the developers could have gone a bit further and introduced some close romantic/sexual relationship.

<br>XIII is not a superb game and that&apos;s not just because of it&apos;s flaws. It&apos;s mostly because even the best things here are at a very good mark, instead of great. For example, the story is good but it lacks realism to be great, gun-play is good, but again, nothing special. Level design is good overall, but too linear. While worth playing, this game never really amazes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xiii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6782101">Expand</a></span>
