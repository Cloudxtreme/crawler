Its very different from what I&apos;ve ever played on the computer. If your into graphics and want a full HD experience then you might have a bad time with this game.The game is naturally bright and will cause some pixelation problems during cut scenes. Make sure to turn the brightness down just a bit. The gamma setting is tricky to use though. Game might end up too dark or too bright. The controls take awhile to get used to. I recommend playing with a controller. The cover system is interesting. It&apos;s similar to Ghost Recon but more defined and stable. The multiplayer is OK. It&apos;s extremely rare that you will find a match. If you do find one there&apos;s a guarantee that there will be cheating. Only play it if you have nothing better to do after you finish the main story. The main story is raw. There are a few scenes that show a lot of death. As a warning, The &quot;White Phosphorus&quot; mission will make you sick to your stomach and probably make you feel depressed. I made the mistake of getting too attached to the story. It felt is if i was feeling the character&apos;s pain and suffering during that gruesome segment.
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Amazing story. Many twists and turns.
<br>The setting is new. not the same old locations
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Cons:
<br>AI is frustrating at times. AI tends to push you into fire fights.
<br>No revive system for your character in the main story. Controls are clunky. Might accidentally get stuck on the wrong wall for cover
<br>Multiplayer is almost dead already and its only day one.
<br>Way too many exploits on MP maps. Lighting is way too heavy. Reflections and major light sources will cause lag on occasion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2492672">Expand</a></span>

The aiming is imprecise and you often get stuck sticking to cover or flailing about out of cover.

The 3rd-person shooter gameplay is pretty unimpressive: the cover system is temperamental, the aiming sucks, the weapons are boring, and stealth is rarely possible. Moreover, the two squad mates which you are obliged to work with are rarely more than a liability. Thankfully the game makes up for these major shortcomings by placing you in a truly impressive setting: the sand-covered city of Dubai. Not only does this uniquely-opulent city serve as eye-candy (the attention to detail is as impressive as the models themselves), but it creates a truly memorable geography: the sand-dune you&apos;re fighting on might turn out to be on top of a skyscraper, or you might take refuge from a sand storm inside a hotel with a giant aquarium beneath your feet. Finally, the narrative told through the game and the emotional impact of the events as they unfold are very good. Spec Ops does a surprisingly good job of not only telling a compelling story, but of making you empathize with the characters and internalize your actions. It&apos;s a game that will make you question your own actions within the game and by extension, your attitude toward such military/shooter games. Despite its flaws, this is a game which I wholeheartedly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2899708">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is good enough for a military shooter and feels very plausible, as far as that can go in a game. It&apos;s a bit short, &lt; 10 hours on normal / hard. A few nice visuals, but a lot of sand.</span>

The story holds the game together and will have you wanting to play more despite the lackluster game mechanics.  Definitely not worth full price, but should be a future purchase none the least.</span>

Quite honestly I picked up Spec Ops: The Line as a cheap sale on steam, expecting, like I said above, a generic third person shooter in a new environment. Starting off, the game sort of feels like a drag, same sort of characters you might find in a modern military shooter. Soon, though, I became attached to one character in particular: Lugo. No spoilers here, by the way. Anyhow, he seemed to genuinely care about what was going on in the environment. Basically, all the characters soon did. The way you face the problems of war, and soon the even deeper underlying problems that unmask themselves as you move into the 12th and 13th chapters, unlike any other soldier you might have suited up as in any other FPS or TPS, is genuinely refreshing, interesting, and furthermore makes the game a completely unique title. Like many other great titles, it has an awesome ending, and builds up very well in the meantime.
<br>Story-wise, this game is great. Something that&apos;ll keep you thinking, especially after you&apos;ve made your choices. Like so many other games that allow you to make a major choice and influence the ending and development of the story, you begin to wonder: &quot;did I make the right choice?&quot; Often times, this causes you to be involved in the story they&apos;ve placed you in, and furthermore causes you to honestly enjoy (or sometimes, in this case, not enjoy) what you&apos;re playing and watching. 10/10
<br>Graphics-wise, this game is gorgeous, save a few texture effects that seem a tad low budget. Other than that, the engine truly shines, masking the terrible destruction Dubai has undergone. It makes the buildings look wonderful and the destruction look real. 9/10
<br>Sound-wise, this game really knows how to place the music. The soundtrack included in the game is played at all the right moments, especially around the ending. On top of that, the noise and effects are genuinely special, sounding real and effective. Furthermore, the voice acting is top-tier and sounds very real. 9/10
<br>Gameplay-wise, this game could use some help. As I said, when you begin playing, it seems very generic, basically, because it is. It&apos;s a very generic shooter, on top of the fact that the controls are out of place. I mean, &quot;space&quot; to run? Who thought of that? However, the gameplay mechanics orchestrated in each fight are genuinely fun to play with, and tend to bring some originality and light to the otherwise dusty and unoriginal style of play. 7/10
<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t about a war, shooting up bad guys, or being the hero. A lot of times, it&apos;s about you, your team, and the choices you make. Furthermore, it&apos;s a game that looks deeply into being the bad guy at times. It looks into emotional appeal of the gamer, and really hits home. There is a multiplayer inclusion of Spec Ops: The Line, but to put it bluntly, it&apos;s lame, not fun, and might ruin the experience you have with this otherwise legendary game. Stay away from the multiplayer. Only other criticism is: it&apos;s short. I covered the story on &quot;Suicide Mission&quot; difficulty in 4 hours (or so Steam says.) However, I&apos;d say the story is replayable, as long as you don&apos;t mind trudging through the sloppy controls again.
<br>
<br>Overall, I rate this game a 9/10  Legendary game with a great story. Definitely worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255842">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, the graphics aren&apos;t topnotch but they are good, the AI is close to awful and the level-layout is pretty simple yet all this becomes insignificant when you get blown away by stunningly beautiful Levels (speaking of the crafted images not the layout) and a story so dark and moving that I just sat there staring at my monitor for what felt like minutes more than once.

I&apos;m not usually one for first  third person shooters, but solidly enjoyed this. I got it as part of a pre-purchase of XCOM the Bureau, so was effectively free, and was pleasantly surprised. Although the mechanics were sometimes a little rough around the edges (ordering squad mates was not as intuitive or fleshed out as much as I would have liked), the story and dialogue kept me engaged. I really enjoyed the scenario and environment in this game, the sand storms and dunes made things interesting, and the movement between close indoors combat and outdoor combat, as well as lots of vertical movement and engagement, kept things fresh. This was really important to me, as in the end you are mainly fighting the same sort of troop again and again (though knives and shotguns would be pointed out to me by my squad mates  they still just needed a few bullets to take down  the biggest change in type would be heavies, which required a bit of work). The large range of scenarios for engaging these homogenous enemies made it feel fresh up until the end. The story was top notch, and was very happy with the ending I got (1 of 4 or 5 I think), with enough foreshadowing throughout that the twist seems legitimate and not out of the blue. I don&apos;t know if I enjoyed it enough to replay the whole thing through again, but I very much enjoyed the ~5 hours I put into it (again, it was free).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436205">Expand</a></span>

Awesome music (shooting to the disco music FTW)  the music itself makes me want to play it again. I don&apos;t know where the opinion of a mediocre game comes from  Spec Ops should have a place among the best games of this generation, not be pushed aside. I strongly recommend you to play this game if you like TPP shooters and/or games with good plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3713888">Expand</a></span>

The lighting is better than Battlefield 3 (and certainly the best lighting of any third-person game), textures are crisp, facial detail is excellent and it&apos;s not too demanding. Not only does the game look great, it plays well too. Think of it as a military Gears of War with more realistic story, characters &amp; context. This is undoubtedly amongst the greatest third-person shooters on PC. It lacks in innovation and doesn&apos;t do anything particularly interesting or new, but it&apos;s a great game. One thing to be wary of is that although it&apos;s a story-heavy game, it isn&apos;t well-explained and can be hard to follow. Even if you don&apos;t understand what&apos;s going on though, it&apos;s still a good story regardless because of the way it&apos;s presented and paced. Multiplayer is not even worth considering, since there&apos;s nobody playing it online. It&apos;s a good job all achievements for the game are offline!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3095866">Expand</a></span>

The action is well designed and the combat parts are excellent. maybe there are too many cinematic but the game is so well developed that the player enjoys every minute of it. Nice game, I personally don&apos;t recommended for kids under 16, but for the rest it worth the purchase</span>

<br>You don&apos;t believe me?
<br>
<br>Try it.
<br>
<br>...and then come back here to talk...
<br>
<br>The story is something you find once in a hundred of today games.
<br>
<br>The gameplay feels nice and it maybe take some time to settle in but when it does you&apos;ll be poppin heads.
<br>
<br>Visually - great. Graphics can stay shoulder to shoulder with the games from 2014 and style and colors are just swesome.</span>

If you&apos;re in it for the game play and mechanics, well...then this is just your average shooter. Overall, I&apos;d say stick to enjoying the story line. It clearly shows that the devs have put a lot of time and effort into crafting such an intense story. It really hits you in the gut at some points in the game. It is not for the weak hearted because there are a lot of disturbing elements that drive you to the edge of your seat. (I won&apos;t give any spoilers however).
<br>
<br>As for the game play mechanics, it may not be the best engine used in the world, giving it&apos;s only unreal 3, but it is your average low end &apos;Gears of War&apos; or Ghost Recon Future Soldier.&apos; Main guns are typically the ones used in every military shooter, but why else must you complain? It&apos;s post apocalyptic modern military warfare. All in all, great game for what it is. Definitely worth a shot playing it. It will surely leave you questioning, what you just played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3150265">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of all: The Story! What starts like generic war story in Dubai turns out to be a moving history about the bad and awful sides of war that games like Battlefield and CoD tend to forget. We get to see how the protagonists suffer from the terrible events they go through. And let me tell you this, there are plenty!
<br>Secondly : The Atmosphere: The game has a very emerging atmoshpere that draggs you right into to the action.
<br>Thridly: The Sound: The weapons and the screams of your enemies sound all pretty good.
<br>The generell gameplay is pretty standart solid thirdpersone shooter stuff.
<br>
<br>So as I said at the beginning Spec Ops does not revolutionize the genre BUT it tries to go new ways in storytelling and that is its strengh. At the end of the campain I sat in front of my PC staring at the screen and asking myself what I have done. Because there is no good or bad, it&apos;s only bad or worst.
<br>If you want something new try it...and don&apos;t try the demo it&apos;s terrible!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2736255">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay is not god-awful as many say: I love me some third-person shooters and I got a lot of enjoyment from this game.
<br>The replay value is pretty high: you may change some decision in the story, as well as seeing what happens with a different perspective. Plus, there is a co-op mode that is just amazing, with new maps to play with a friend. The multiplayer is okay, too bad not many people play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437484">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My opinion is a little biased because I&apos;ve never played any Call of Duty, Battlefield, Army of Two, or other war simulators so many rehashed mechanics were quite new to me and I couldn&apos;t complain about the graphics either. But the beef of the game is not it&apos;s technical side, it&apos;s the storyline, the atmosphere, and the narrative.
<br>
<br>I can confirm that SO:tL really is quite engaging but often simply not fun, curiously enough. While you explore the beautifully designed environments, the constant slaughter overlaid by a perfectly-fitting yet weirdly presented (via in-game radio broadcasting) soundtrack leaves you with the feeling that something is very off. For a good portion of the game you battle different people but you don&apos;t really know who they are. Then you realize that you don&apos;t really know why you&apos;re fighting them. Everything goes so weird that you don&apos;t really know why you do what you do and start wondering if the choices you make are really there or the game just drags you along to prove a point. Even the loading tips start changing slowly but surely from game hints to... something else.
<br>
<br>The ending is close to flawless. I was not only surprised but also relieved that there really was a good reason for all the weirdness. SO:tL represents an excellent achievement through the combination of its setting, storyline, voice acting, graphics, mechanics, and atmosphere. It will keep you guessing, taking away the fun from the gameplay while holding you until the end. Or at least that happened to me and I fully appreciated it.
<br>
<br>Give this game a shot, it might change your perception of the whole genre more than its technically superior counterparts ever could.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3603151">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>During this story, you&apos;ll face a lot of difficult decisions, which will put your morals in play, &quot;should I kill a civilian over a colleague from the army?&quot; &quot;Should I take revenge?&quot; and it is all up to you, and your choices will decide how each &quot;level&quot; of the game goes, not significantly, but it&apos;ll change depending on your decisions.
<br>
<br>If you like to get completely into a masterly crafted storyline, you definitely must play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670445">Expand</a></span>

Beware that this game has very sad moments and very emotional parts. The game has great graphics that really shows the environment around the player. This the type of game that integrates the third person with run and cover type game. Without cover you are at a disadvantage when in combat. The feature that i love about it is the menu, it changes the further along the game you are. The combat features are well executed.
<br>There are quite a lot of twists.
<br>I recommend this to anyone that loves shooter games.

The multi-player should not be considered a part of the game, it was added by the publishers and is to quote one of the devs: &quot;A cancerous growth&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3830951">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Interesting Story
<br>+ Amazing writing/script
<br>+ Great Characters and Nice Character Development
<br>+ Engaging story that makes you feel emotionally involved
<br>+ You make decisions that affect outcomes
<br>+ Great Twist at the end
<br>+ Nice use of environments in play
<br>+ Different locations throughout Dubai that all are interesting
<br>
<br>- Some &quot;choices&quot; seem like you actually have no control
<br>- Nothing new with gameplay (Generic Third Person Shooter Gameplay)
<br>- Some controls were frustrating (ex. X [Gamepad] was used to get to cover AND to run)
<br>
<br>Overall Spec Ops: The Line was an interesting and engaging interactive cinematic experience. Spec Ops had the story of a big budget Hollywood action movie, but also had the familiar third person shooter in it. The story kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting to know what happens next. At some parts Specs Ops was just another grindfest, but then again what shooter today isn&apos;t? Spec Ops did not have a huge selection of guns, which did not hurt the game at all. Instead of looking for the coolest weapon, you were looking for weapons to help you clear the level so you could find out what happens next.
<br>
<br>In conclusion Spec Ops: The Line is a great game that should not be missed out on due to the new emotional and mental take on war. The game will rank up there with my favorite games that would make me want to play again, to play the many different ending.
<br>
<br>P.S. The graphics for this game was pretty okay, nothing fancy, but nothing terrible. I put this at the end of my review as to not get this confused with pluses and minuses. I would NEVER include graphics as a means of judging a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=4009796">Expand</a></span>

The gunplay just isn&apos;t satisfying as a result.

The character development is very well done, the story is excellent and it is one of the more atmospheric games I have played. The interesting part about the game is that it starts of kinda generic then slowly as you descend deeper into the game it becomes something completely different and memorable.

Also, the game has excellent character progression. The gun gameplay, is simple cover and shoot... Nothing special. The level design, visuals, and AI are mediocre to downright awful. Conclusion: get it for the story, but don&apos;t buy it for full&#x2026;</span>

That may seem quite silly to you but just bare with me. The thing that set&apos;s Spec ops apart from other games is it&apos;s story, it&apos;s so immersive that I actually finished the game in one go.
<br>
<br>But let&apos;s talk about the bad&apos;s first so I can sing it&apos;s praise at the end. The main thing the game get&apos;s criticised for is it&apos;s gameplay and it&apos;s number of cutscenes. The gameplay can feel it bit clumsy and rough around the edges. It&apos;s definetly not your polished third person gears of war experience that we&apos;ve all come to expect from these type of games.
<br>Then second the cutscenes, some people would argue the their are just to much of them, I&apos;m not one of them. I feel like their just their to guide us through the story and never ones felt annoyed by them, but that&apos;s opinion I guess.
<br>
<br>Now the things I did like. First the graphics are okay, but together with some very well designed physics effects you never ones doubt that your in a desert. Then the experience, you do feel like you&apos;re fighting a war, and throughout the game you will grow to resent yourself as much or even more then your enemies. Combat is fun but with some occasionally enemies just rushing your position or running straight through the open, but non of that could drag me out of the fantastic experience I had with the game.
<br>And then thing the ties it all together the story. the story is more compelling and immersive then any other that I&apos;ve encountered before. It drags you through the game just unable to stop playing until you reach it&apos;s climax that will **** with your mind in multiple ways.
<br>
<br>So the main question, should you buy this game? Absolutely!!! Unless your one of those guys who only crave multiplayer and graphics then their is nothing for you here. But if you&apos;re like me, on who demands but story, atmosphere and gameplay, this is the game that will come closer then any other in recent years.
<br>
<br>For me this game gets a 8 out of 10, it has it&apos;s problems and flaws but non of them where able to stop me from enjoying myself with the game.
<br>But then again who am I? Go out and form an opinion of yourself :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366931">Expand</a></span>

As a story-based singleplayer experience, it&apos;s notable for taking what starts as the most generic story imaginable and turning it into a meta-narrative that questions the the nature of video games while the protagonist questions his own heroism. While not perfect in its storytelling, it tries something that flies in the face of current trends and is essentially a giant middle-finger to Call of Duty and its imitators. Either you&apos;ll be on board with the idea and enjoy its ambiguous storyline, or you&apos;ll find it a pretentious attempt at an art game built on the back of a mediocre shooter. If you&apos;re curious, it&apos;s worth the time and money simply because it exists.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666091">Expand</a></span>

It begins exactly like a generic war on terror era third person shooter with americans as heroes rescuing. Then after 1 hour things get a little weird (and much more interesting than any game of this style), as the game narrative, in a terrific turn, starts to critize both senseless war and senseless killing modern video games.

<br>The icing on the cake is the Apocalypse Now-inspired storyline and the superb Dubai dystopian art style. The characters, the voice acting, the narrative are all among the smartest and the best in recent times, making Spec Ops: The Line (a reboot of an PS1 tactical game) even with its 4h and modest gameplay, an obligation to anyone who believes videogames can be important pieces of culture, critcizing not only society but its own medium</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=6754206">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In conclusion if u want a excellent  or at least different  story that would make up for the average gameplay then go for it. Also that aspect alone makes it a 10 for me personally.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2982840">Expand</a></span>

But that&apos;s the point. Spec ops doesn&apos;t try to be a good &quot;shooter&quot;, but rather tries to make a statement, and forces you to face the atrocities of war head on. The main character is Walker, a veteran american soldier, which is sent to Dubai with two other soldiers under his command , to find survivors from the 33rd division of the american fleet. The story shows what happened to the soldiers and citiznes during the war. Walker understands that there is more then meets the eye in the city and that the 33rd division has become corrupted as the enemies they were trying do defeat. During the entire game you wil have to perform morally wrong actions and kill thousands of soldiers, and worse. Many people will not last untill the end, for more then one reason. Some will be sick of the terrible choices that the game forces them to make and just quit. Others will find the gunplay repetitive and decide it&apos;s not worth playing till the end. Oh but it is. The ending is showing everything you would never think of while playing and makes everything seems logical. It explains everything you questioned and will stay in your head long after you see it. This game exists purely to make you see why war should never be taken lightly, and why the addiction to military shooters such as Call of duty brings out the inner beast in us all.  Never before have I played a game that made me feel so bad, and yet made me appreciate it. Only those that will play untill the end will understand the game&apos;s true meaning. You won&apos;t find a triple A shooter here, nor will you find exceptional production values, but you will find something deeper then you might expect. Don&apos;t let the generic shooting fool you, because you won&apos;t find anything else like it, once you finished it. So, how far would you go to complete your mission? When will you feel like you are crossing the line? Play and find out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557364">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now I am on my second round of completing the game  it&apos;s so cool and interesting that I can&apos;t stop playing it. Thx Yager for such a brilliant game!

For this reason more than any other I would highly recommend all military shooter fans to play it. Finishing Spec Ops made me realize how series like Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, and Battlefield have utterly dumbed down the psychological aspect of warfare. Spec Ops puts you through some crazy  and while the gameplay is enjoyable the overall game&apos;s story experience is most definitely one of psychological discomfort. I don&apos;t see this is a failure, since there are already too many feel-good games out there; I am not dissing those games either, just making the point that as serious adult gamers we do need to get an experience like Spec Ops.
<br>
<br>Lately there has been a lot of debate about whether violent games cause real world violence. Again as a veteran gamer I think this is a nonsense argument, it is guns in the hands of insane people who cause the problems. But for anyone who think games glorify killing and violence, they need to have a look at Spec Ops The Line.
<br>
<br>So, story-wise and character-wise the game is extremely good, gunplay-wise I&apos;d rate is good but not great. I generally prefer first-person to third-person combat, but I understand that in a story-focused game the developer may want to present the game from a more cinematic perspective. However I would still have vastly preferred the ability to use ironsights on all the guns, third-person combat at all times (except for the rare scoped guns) made for inaccurate shooting way too often, where you rely on the gun&apos;s random accuracy to hit the enemies. Greater accuracy (that would be afforded through iron-sights coupled with smart burst-firing) would have made the often-tough battles more manageable.
<br>
<br>I would give the game a 10 if the combat were fixed (aiming down ironsights allowed on all guns), so overall its an 9 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2930486">Expand</a></span>

<br>On face value, The Line isn&apos;t much.
<br>A stock standard, overly-macho, cover-based military shooter that will only excite the imagination of those who do not understand what makes a game good.
<br>This is not the case. What is really inside is possibly the most poignant and emotionally affecting plot I have ever experienced in a game. And I love it.
<br>Admittedly, the gameplay isn&apos;t much. On that front is relatively what you expect. Bad guy in front of you, kill him. Lots of bad guys in front of you, duck into cover and kill them, but not before a bit of fiddly negotiating with the cover system. This game is made for controller, but it is still easy enough to play with key board and mouse.
<br>The AI tend to overwhelm you with sheer numbers rather than outthink you, but this only a minor niggle, and if you&apos;re playing at a harder difficulty you&apos;ll be too busy kicking yourself for dying again to criticise their semi-suicidal behaviour.
<br>Graphically speaking, it wasn&apos;t jarring. The lighting was fine and I only spotted the occasional low-res texture (during gameplay that is, the cutscenes were riddled with them). Character detail was mildly fantastic, and Nolan North and Co. did a top-notch job with voices. Level design could have been better, but nothing felt too linear, and there were only a few vehicle sections which were really not too shabby in execution. Overall the gameplay presented about as much depth as one could expect from a linear shooter.
<br>
<br>But were it not for the plot, I probably would not have bothered finishing this game.
<br>The thing that impressed me most about the plot is the connection it creates between the game and the player. Many games choose to have a silent protagonist in order to have the player imprint themselves on the protagonists identity. Yet The Line has an incredibly vocal main character and still I found I started to see a lot of myself in him. This is probably due to responsibility The Line forces you to take. Without giving too much away, I will say the game puts you in a few situations where you may hate yourself for the outcome you chose. The brutality of some of these moments are brilliantly portrayed, and there is one infamous moment in the game that distressed me so much I exited and did not play it again for a few weeks. The gigantic waves of enemies that you will eliminate unthinkingly throughout the game may seem out of place at first, but by the end their purpose is blindingly clear.
<br>The thoughts that The Line will plant in your head are disturbing, exhilarating, and nothing short of a gust of fresh air in terms of plot themes.
<br>And if you are somehow not convinced about the astounding depth of The Line, know this.
<br>A man by the name of Brendan Keogh wrote a 50,000 word critical analysis of the game. 50,000 words.
<br>
<br>And the reason why I have given it 10 is because I do not acknowledge the multiplayer as part of the game. If you don&apos;t know the meaning of the words &quot;tacked-on&quot;, play the multiplayer of The Line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3114147">Expand</a></span>

<br>truly a masterpiece based on the &quot;heart of darkness&quot; book with a very competent multiplayer, that proves that any shooter can have a solid singleplayer even better than the multiplayer (which is also great) and still be engaging and worth buying.
<br>
<br>a punch in the guts of major publishers like activision, ea and ubisoft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509779">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay is fun and I really enjoyed that we finally get to play a new environment for a change. The game really gives you a good feeling about the destructive force of sand. The shooting is mostly fun, but, as always, third person shooters can be frustrating from a camera perspective at times.
<br>What else is there? This is kind of the thinking man of shooters. You have to flank enemy positions a lot and sometimes use different weapons to meet your goals. It is really a lot of fun to play.
<br>The downside? Well, we are normally used to &quot;fun shooters&quot; that hide the tragedy and violence on civilians. Spec Ops is not doing that. You are always aware that civilians are getting killed because of your actions... Furthermore, it shows how senseless war really is. I mean we players typically just enjoy the clean combat aspect and even if entire street blocks go down (e.g. CoD) we never get to see the consequences...
<br>Anyhow, this shooter is well worth your time. If you haven&apos;t picked it up yet, you probably should. Enjoy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2497425">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics(because they seem to be a big part of a players decision to buy a game) are really good, there are a lot of great scenery that you just stay there a little to look at them +for the graphics designers
<br>Overall, yes, it would be a good game to play, it really takes you into it, played it from start to finish in one day without stopping.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544415">Expand</a></span>

The game shines through in its narrative, the great story was the reason I continued to play. As someone who can quickly tire of a single player campaign this one kept me focused until the very end.

If you are looking for a single player game that is completely different from most &quot;Rah! Rah! Go America&quot; shooters, check this out.

Absolutely awesome game and worth the money.  Truly a great surprise.</span>

<br>I like it for it&apos;s big open Dubai maps, story, gameplay, cutscenes, 3rd person view, variety of guns, graphics,  it&apos;s worth for me. Unreal engine is okay, it&apos;s beautiful and fast.
<br>I do not like it for it is very heartbreaking scenes.</span>

<br>To me, this game is one of my highlights from 2012. The mature, provocative nature of the storyline and characters sees you and your team go through some of the most disturbing horrors of war. There are moments in Spec Ops that make you feel hate like nothing I&#x2019;ve experienced before. The feeling of loss and the moments for grieving that last all but minutes are true to the nature of war and the theme is therefore executed brilliantly with attention to details you may not notice on your first play through. The storyline is the stand out feature with it closely following the short novel &#x201C;Heart of Darkness&#x201D; written by Joseph Conrad. If you haven&#x2019;t read or heard of &#x201C;Heart of Darkness&#x201D;, you will be in for a treat playing through the singer player campaign.
<br>
<br>The core mechanics of Spec Ops feature a 3rd person perspective with everything working very well. The cover system which has you popping out and picking off enemies with ease is a joy to use (mainly because it works, unlike RE: Operation Raccoon City). There is also a blind fire option which was valuable during my play through on Fubar difficulty. The guns feel nice with a good selection on offer which all boasts secondary firing options. I felt very at home with the mechanics on offer and felt that, although they were not revolutionary, they worked well and felt tight which therefore lead to no moments of gaming frustration.
<br>
<br>Graphically, the game looks beautiful on the highest settings on PC. Some nice special effects are on offer and you feel fully immersed in the city of Dubai. Although the engine is dated and the game falls short compared to games such as Crysis 3 and Tomb Raider, Spec Ops features impeccable level design that is linear offering only a single pathway to complete levels; but it works because the world you are lead through offers a unique amount of detail and situations that keep it feeling fresh and engaging.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this game is well worth the purchase. The game can be picked up cheaply now and serves as excellent value for money if you can get it for under &#xA3;10. Featuring some of the darkest story telling depicted in games and a conclusion that will stick with you long after playing (this does depend on how engross you are playing games) the game is a must buy for fans of story driven third person shooters looking for something that excites on a very mature level.
<br>
<br>Spec Ops gets a brilliant 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3156026">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay is fantastic and a great story. Do not miss this game.
<br>
<br>However, one major gripe I had for the whole game was the controls. A game should be fun, the difficulty from the challenge on completing the game and each chapter. A game&apos;s challenge should not come from the cumbersome Console controls which Spec Ops The Line is from. Instead of life and death struggles, you&apos;ll have controlitis struggles, because your very life depends on whether you double clicked the same key for various commands. I understand Consoles have limited buttons, but PCs do not. Once again, Developers fail to polish what is probably one of the better games released in 2012. And for that, what would have been a perfect 10 is now an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2498545">Expand</a></span>

A good story line is hard to find these days in shooter games of all types, however Yager have put a great amount of time and effort  into to creating this story masterpiece. From start to finish the story kept me hooked and did something that no other shooter has ever done for me, and that is make me feel what the soldiers are feeling. This is the first shooter which really reveals the true horror of war and what it can do to a human  being. Graphics are amazing, the post-apocalyptic Dubai is astonishing. Gameplay is enjoyable and flows beautifully.  People in the PC community often complain about controls when it comes the third person shooters. Frankly, the mouse and keyboard is not suited for these kinds of games, that is why I bought a controller to use for my computer specifically for these games. In these other reviews people recognize the game as a console port and bring down their scores as a result. I think the PC community should stop complaining and realize that the mouse and keyboard is not the best thing to control great third person shooters. despite this I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a great shooter experience that people have never seen in a war game before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2516514">Expand</a></span>

<br>OK, so all of the idiots are gone now right?
<br>
<br>This game is a narrative masterpiece.  It forces the player to make choices that are not only difficult, but so easy to mistake for the black and white linearity that is found in so many shooters today.  This game is not only highly cerebral and thought-provoking, but it acts as a commentary on current and future gaming culture.  Some of the scenes and images are difficult to stomach, but that&apos;s sort of the point of the game.  Games like Call of Duty and Battlefield don&apos;t expose the player to the true horrors of war.  They try to make a pretty shooting gallery to walk through while the player&apos;s internet service is down.
<br>
<br>Spec Ops will challenge the way you think and the way you play games.  This game was never intended to be &quot;fun&quot; in the traditional sense.  Rather, it was created (IMHO) to force people who play these sort of games to sit down and really think about what it is they want from a game and why they feel the need to make the decisions they make.  Spec Ops is both challenging and rewarding.  Buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=3292826">Expand</a></span>

Competent but Mediocre gameplay, dated but well realized graphics and above average writing and voice acting may be a recipe for a decent time killer, but the narrative as realized through play, and the way that the narrative punches the player right in the gut makes Spec Ops: The Line as different from other Military Shooters as Paintball is from the real life Normandy landings. With very few misses, Spec Ops deals with the idea of war in a way that maybe no other modern military shooter before has: With heart-wrenching, deadly seriousness. That, &quot;Mature&quot; title can be taken literally. This game deserves your time and money, and even a GotY nod.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2593015">Expand</a></span>

But the story is really good, at least when compared to any videogame released in the last ten years, with an ending that lives up to premise. Chuck Palahniuk crossed with Apocalypse now.  What I really liked was the fact that they went with the checkpoint system, which doesn&apos;t allow the player to simply reload and redo their decision.  The first decision you make is the one you have to live with...great stuff.  I just wish the actual gameplay matched the rest.  But what I&apos;m thinking is that if it had a budget of a Mass Effect 3 or COD, they couldn&apos;t have went with the risky story, so maybe the cost of a good story is mediocre gameplay that is limited by budget.  Anyway, no regrets on my purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535524">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an extremely different approach to the &apos;Modern Warfare&apos; archetype that we&apos;ve seen become common in video games. The narrative is well thought out and executed, slowly dragging you in and making you feel disgusted, angry, and confused. The gameplay however is not nearly as polished and enjoyable to sit through. It&apos;s clunky at times, and when it&apos;s not it&apos;s just point and shoot. Very little variety, and it actually manages to take you out of the experience. It&apos;s hard to be preachy about the ruthlessness of war and then have special mechanics that give extra ammo for executions. The A.I is also an issue, it can range from decently boring to very broken. Squadmates can sit around shooting a wall that the target is stuck behind for hours if you let them. In spite of that though, I was able to sit through the bland combat and enjoy the journey it took me on.

<br>immaculately detailed environments draw you in to the game&apos;s world, but its the story that will leave the most lasting impression. it&apos;s a breath of fresh air to encounter a game that approaches modern combat from moral &apos;other side&apos;: examining the horror and confusion - the fog of war - through the eyes of one soldier attempting, and ultimately failing, to make sense of it all from within the thick of it. if call of duty is equivalent to &apos;black hawk down&apos;, then this game is &apos;apocalypse now&apos; (and in fact draws inspiration from the same novel, &apos;heart of darkness&apos;). certainly not a perfect game (enemy AI is weak, gunplay can get a bit repetitive), but it&apos;s so bold, daring and risky an attempt one can&apos;t help but applaud the effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563418">Expand</a></span>

However, the game contains what is quite possibly the most profound story I have EVER experienced in a game. This is story that won&apos;t just make you question the motives your character has for fighting, it will ask you in quite a lot of different ways &quot;Why do you enjoy playing these sort of games? Do you enjoy butchering and slaughtering people on screen?&quot;. It is a game that will ask you, the player &quot;Do you feel like a hero yet?&quot;. Couple this with fantastic environments and you will be in an experience you will NEVER forget. It may not be game of the year, but Spec Ops: The Line might be the most important game of our generation in terms of its story and the questions it asks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2582034">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>By this point, I hate modern shooters. Call of Duty and Battlefield are doing the same thing over and over with knockoffs spawning every year. When I first saw this game I counted it off as another knockoff/clone but I was so incredibly wrong. This game brings so much more to the table. This game tells an emotional story based around Joseph Conrad&apos;s literary masterpiece Heart of Darkness. Yes, the reviews are correct, the FPS shooter mechanics aren&apos;t top notch. The multiplayer feels (and according to the developers was absolutely) tacked on last minute so it could say it had multiplayer, making producers happy. I got frustrated with the 3rd person cover system at times as well. But none of these are the point of the game. The developers even said in interviews they wished in was a standalone campaign without a multiplayer, because it&apos;s the campaign that breaks radically new ground in the games industry.
<br>
<br>The point is the narrative. PAY ATTENTION TO IT.
<br>
<br>After playing FPS clones, we are used to worthless dialogue that doesn&apos;t mean anything or hold any value. This game is different. If you pay attention you might see the massive twists before they are spelled out for you. The game also shines in the little things. There are even creepy highly metaphorical scenes near the end of the campaign that don&apos;t repeat if you die and have to go through the same section again. The overall level design (it doesn&apos;t make sense for a reason), the artwork and the mechanics work together to share an emotional story about PTSD, what war is like and how pathetic we are for wanting to be a part of it.
<br>
<br>Overall this game took me completely by surprise and I couldn&apos;t be happier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2746579">Expand</a></span>

Basicly, the games gameplay is awful. It is a worse version of gears of war, but with tons of massive difficulty spikes that cause frustration. It is the frustrating at points, I ended up shoving a gamepad (gamepad controls ARE worse, the  people are just retarded) and turning aim assist and easy mode on (aim assist seems broken with mouse and keyboard) because even tho I am a good gamer, the difficulty is just BS at points. The story however is great, starting off by appearing to be a generic shooter story, it quickly progresses into a very dark story which constantly makes you second guess your actions. And aside from one point, the main character does not seem to just randomly do something evil to give this feeling, it feels very realistic, and gritty. The story is based loosely off heart of darkness, and I have heard from people that you will guess the shock twist if you have read it. But if you havn&apos;t, it is VERY shocking but makes sense. Basicly, I recomend either rent the console version, or buy it when you can get it for cheap, since the gameplay sucks. Oh, and the multiplayer is god awful, don&apos;t take it into account.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spec-ops-the-line/user-reviews?user_review_id=2964176">Expand</a></span>
