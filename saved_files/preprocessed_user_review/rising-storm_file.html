Having played RO2:HOS from launch and hanging around long enough to see the mess of a release be polished into a hugely enjoyable experience I can safely say that I wont have to &quot;hang around&quot; this time as the polish on this game is already there! As some other reviews may indicate this game isn&apos;t for the tactically faint of heart. If run&amp;gun game-play is what you crave look elsewhere as you will find yourself rage-quitting to &quot;campers&apos; you never see. But if you like joining a team, coordinating a flanking assault on an entrenched enemy position and feeling the satisfaction of a well-placed shot from a bolt action rifle over 150m smack into its target, then get inside! Some may well complain as to &apos;overpowered&apos; flamethrowers, however these weapons are modelled on how they worked in actual conflict and add extra excitement and desperation almost like mini-bosses on the battlefield quickly focused down but able to break an enemy position with some luck. Banzai charges are pure thrill if done right as the Americans fall helplessly beneath the katanas and bayonets of imperial Japan. The core of the game though is teamwork, with a good server (and there are plenty around, shoutout to AU/NZ servers!) and good players you move in squads, coordinate flanking assaults with artillery strikes and charge through your squad leaders smoke cover to overwhelm the opposition! Some of the greatest thrills in gaming have been had in RO2 and Rising Storm only ups the ante. Only reason it wasn&apos;t perfect in my opinion was the lack of &apos;open&apos; maps. These maps are great but are quite linear not allowing for full tactical flanking and freedom. Also the graphics while excellent probably dont hold up to the best new titles, but considering its an older unreal engine running this thing are pretty phenomenal and eye candy enough for me! If you feel like a more realistic playing experience with room for teamwork, gun-play that will leave you feeling a hero or lamenting that slight shift in your mouse as you clicked and a slower more tactical play-style. If not, this probably isn&apos;t your cup of tea (although i would recommend trying ti as you may well be converted)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186163">Expand</a></span>

Granted, the learning curve is high, particularly for those that come from more &quot;arcade-style shooters&quot; like CoD and Battlefield.  But for those that stick with it Rising Storm has the power to terrify.  Even as a player who has poured many hours into Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm I can say that this game still gives me that rush when I barely survive an artillery barrage.  As the bullets fly you can&apos;t help dive for cover and pray you&apos;re not shot because very often, one shot is all it takes.
<br>
<br>This is more than just a few maps as well!  When you buy Rising Storm you also get Red Orchestra 2 rolled into it.  In addition to all the maps in this game there is LOADS of free future content on the way!  So for anyone that would like to play a realistic shooter that&#x2019;s less buggy and more accessible than ARMA, Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is the way to go!
<br>This is not a game for the light hearted.  The weapons are true to life and the loadouts are as realistic as they come (expect to use a bolt-action rifle a lot).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186406">Expand</a></span>

The levels of realism in its Rising Storm is absolutely phenomenon and its approach to the level of details is astonishing. From its spot-on and accurate implementation of the weapons in the game to its tense and heart pounding gameplay, you&apos;re sure to experience a sense of achievement and accomplishment every time when kill an enemy upon  releasing the trigger. All in all, Tripwire Interactive nails the game in every aspects from its sound design, atmosphere and gameplay mechanics. However, the only gripe upon playing the beta was the far respawn points allocated in the game, which was kind of a hassle due to the unnecessary distance. Players who appreciate realism in video game will definitely love this game due to its authenticity. Fret not, action-based players can also have fun and experience its action mode which offers a toned down level of realism, for example, visible crosshairs and a more forgiveable bullet impact.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186974">Expand</a></span>

Rising Storm has still room for improvement though, controls could&apos;ve been better and maybe add in a couple of game modes. However, that being said, combat shines in Rising Storm, gameplay is awesome and addictive, credit to the developers for making such an amazing environment.

Rising Storm just like Red Orchestra does have a learning curb so expect to die a lot, which is perfectly fine, the game takes time to master but is extremely rewarding. The amount of content for the cheap price is just generous on the developers part. The game is also moddable so expect free custom maps in the future and hopefully free content updates.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186179">Expand</a></span>

While some of the annoying things carry over from the earlier series, most notably the infamous is the going prone and unable to deploy your weapon issues.  The teams are asymmetric so you really feel the play-style differences.  This game is brutal on realism servers but that is part of the appeal.  Bullets whizzing by, the strange lighting and shadows on Guadalcanal, the shouts of Banzaii charges, the terror of facing a flame thrower, it&apos;s here.  Notable lack is no functional armored units at all.  One could have expected at least dug in Japanese tanks and Shermans or Stuarts for the Americans.  Perhaps in the future.  A good buy for brutal WW2 combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192919">Expand</a></span>

If you like slow paced, intense gameplay, where one bullet can already cause your death (if you don&apos;t keep your head down), large infantry Assaults/ brutal Banzai charges, nice and thoughtful gameplay features, then this is the game for you. Give it a try, the Devs deserve your support, just for taking risk to make something what&apos;s not casual. The fact that it&apos;s not even a full-prized game makes it even more attractive to me. People are always moaning that there are too many mainstream/casual games, and that they need something completely different, something new. Ladies and gentlemen, here is your game, so give it a chance </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188690">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you enjoyed RO2, you&apos;ll LOVE this, and if the issue with RO2 was its slow pace or the game breaking bugs present on release, fear not, RS delivers in both those areas.
<br>
<br>A must have for fans of high risk  high reward shooters with incredible immersion to boot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3189585">Expand</a></span>

Building upon the solid foundation of RO2, RS has its own unique style, and depth, based around the development team&apos;s pioneering of features that balance out, and funnify asymmetrical warfare. From desperate banzai charges, to Flame-throwers raining hell on Bunkers and trenches, improvised booby traps.. The combat is fierce and filled with mayhem. What&apos;s amazing is that for all the chaos of the battlefield the game remains cogent, balanced and the deep strategical gameplay remains intact.
<br>
<br>Other Note: For players who, understandably ditched RO2&apos;s messy launch and buggy history, Tripwire has really ironed things out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3189385">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s really based more on knowledge than raw skill. You don&apos;t need to have good twitch reflexes (though they can help) to be a good player. You need to know how the maps work, where your team needs you most, when to move, and how to not die. Generally one side attacks and one side defends. It is crucial to coordinate with your team, especially while attacking. There definitely seems to be a strong correlation between how many knowledgeable guys on your team are using microphones and how often your team wins. If somebody says &quot;Everybody needs to bonzai charge the cap zone NOW!&quot; you&apos;ll be surprised how quickly 20 or so Japanese soldiers are screaming into the smoke straight into the cap. You don&apos;t need to use a mic yourself, but you&apos;d be wise to listen at least some of the time to your teammates advice (don&apos;t worry about the crazy guy that is screaming nonsense at his computer).
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a very fun game but has it&apos;s problems. Single player is pretty much non-existent if you care about that, the movement feels a little clunky and can be awkward when a player interacts with the level geometry. They unnecessarily split up the game into &quot;action&quot; and &quot;realism&quot; modes when it&apos;s obvious this game caters to the realism audience. It lacks some polish, but it&apos;s not a $60 huge budget game so that&apos;s to be expected. There could be more maps and more vehicles, especially the latter which have been neglected since the first RO.
<br>
<br>All in all, a good game at a good price. 8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201001">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the learning curve is steep, but a lot of that can be alleviated by bot practice initially via the Steam Workshop to learn the choke points, objective routes and the cover system. Then you can step up to an online server with a few humans and padded out with bots; this will let you make far more mistakes (and believe me, you&apos;ll make a lot) than an all-human server.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a big fan of the Flamethrower; I ran as a pyro in TF2 and the role is very similar. Learning the ins and outs of this particular weapon in training is a must. Both online and off, bots will insta-forgive any teamkills, but human players won&apos;t be so respectful of your noobishness. I learned the range of the flame and how to bunker-bust effectively in Steam Workshop and then went to low player-count servers and finally ones with no bots. Now past Honour Level 50, I&apos;ve unlocked the M12 shotgun which makes the Flamethrower guy a much more effective close combat specialist, as the supply of fuel runs out rapidly once you start inviting the entire Imperial Japanese Army to your barbecue.
<br>
<br>The best map in the entire Rising Storm collection is easily Iwo Jima. Working your way up into gullies from the beach, creeping over ridgelines while dodging sniper fire, suppressing bunkers and snap-shooting enemies as they round rocks in a Banzai charge  It&apos;s an absolute rush. You&apos;ll thank me for my earlier advice re. offline practice when you hit the final Command Bunker. Rush in Pyro style, blindfire or start lobbing grenades in, and Team Chat will rapidly fill with: &quot;WTF???&quot; Or far worse as you cook/frag/shoot your own guys. It&apos;s a killfest, but requires a degree of subtlety and nuance not to rack up as many teamkills as enemy.
<br>
<br>My main gripes with the game are that the asymmetrical weapon balance built into the game is realistic, but still the Japanese knee mortar feels a little nerfed and is no real compensation for an Allied Flamethrower Guy, especially one with a 12 gauge little friend. The unlock system is a little confusing, as by reckoning I should have gotten the Allied tommy gun by now for the Axis Assault soldier but it&apos;s not forthcoming. I&apos;m running the game with all low settings on a 6 year old laptop no problems, which is an indication of how the game can be de-prettied. However, it also reveals its bare functional guts, and it&apos;s oh so 2003.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3236719">Expand</a></span>

Really visceral feeling kills and just the right amount of strategy without feeling too confused and chaotic. The balance is really something to behold as well, I enjoy playing the banzai&apos;ing Japanese just as much as the heavy gunning Americans. I&apos;ve been in a couple of games where one side just completely over powers the other side, but it doesn&apos;t really hurt the experience because deaths don&apos;t feel cheap at all in this game like they do in other shooters; you&apos;ll know why you got shot when you get shot. Definitely recommend this game as a shooter fan and a Tripwire Interactive fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3189007">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Rising Storm is a realistic, multiplayer only, first person shooter set in the pacific theatre. It has set the standard of first person shooters for me. As soon as I entered the game, I was thrown into a immersive world, where artillery shells were being called down near my position, the commander was barking orders to the squad leaders and the Americans were pushing us back.
<br>
<br>There are two opposing factions in this game. The Axis represented by the Japanese and the allied forces represented by the United States of America. Each side has specific classes and features that make their faction good at a specific field. For instance the Japanese can deploy mobile knee mortar units, while the Americans have the flamethrower. The Japanese can banzai charge, bringing the morale of the Americans down while they get rushed. The Americans I believe can do suppressing fire which brings down morale. These are nice differences that when executed correctly can bring victory to either side.
<br>
<br>There are four different squads, each composed of different classes. Each squad has a squad leader, which squad members can spawn on. There is one commander, which can call artillery strikes and recon. The commander is basically playing a strategy game, although it&#x2019;s in first person and other players might not listen to his commands. This leads to a sense of realism, as other players are dealing with their own problems or might be too cowardly to charge a position.
<br>
<br>The game also gave me a sense of importance, because of the emphasis in being in a squad. While you&#x2019;re unable to be a lone wolf, or kill the entire opposing team with ease, the feeling of being important is very much apparent. It&#x2019;s a nice feeling going in, and it&#x2019;s what keeps me coming back for more.
<br>
<br>The emphasis on team work is brutal. You either work as a team, or you lose the match. There is no getting by that. It&#x2019;s one of the best features in the game, but also one of the worst. It&#x2019;s incredibly frustrating when a commander doesn&#x2019;t have a mic, or the squad leaders don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re doing. Even more so annoying is when a commander does not listen to anyone on his team. If you&#x2019;re going to be in a leader position, please have a mic.
<br>
<br>The graphics are some of the most aesthetically pleasing I&apos;ve seen, and even on the lower settings the game is just as functional although bland looking. The game could use some optimization in this area though. I often don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m getting the best experience with my hardware, and sometimes there just seems to be some slow downs. On other computers, the game looks amazing.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is one of the best first person shooters I have played if not the best. It&apos;s for a specific gamer, that values teamwork and realistic gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3268899">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a veteran yet, but I already have around 350 hours of play (counting RO2:HOS and RS), and newcomers must know that the game starts to be very frustrating. You&apos;ll die a lot, most of the times without even knowing what hit you, but if you really give the game a chance, you&apos;ll start getting better and get pleasure from every kill, every successfull run to cover or any other little thing that makes this game different.
<br>
<br>Forget this if you want a no-brainer fast paced shooter, you&apos;ll hate it.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t give it a 10 because I believe it can be even better. It has some occasional bugs and/or glitches that can get you upset in the heat of the action, but those are rare, forgivable and I think Tripwire will get a hand on it sooner or later. Oh, another &quot;con&quot;: with the release of RS, HOS maps are being left behind and I would hate to see that been extended in time, because HOS is equally brilliant.
<br>
<br>Amazing franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3191371">Expand</a></span>

No broken English/Deutsche or English/Russian. Now its Japanese, or broken English/Septic.
<br>
<br>RS is squarely set as a priority multi player unit. Single player is available via a convoluted process of looking for it in the multi player menu. Under STEAM WORKSHOP. with the option to set up bot matches with dull scripted AI. A separate RO2 singleplayer app can be downloaded as well.
<br>
<br>The RS component can be found in your Steam Menu as&quot; Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multi Player. This combine the two so as that RO2 and RS owners can join the same servers with the least fuss. However. Not purchasing RO2 means RS players join with limited options for weapons and classes. And vice versa for those that haven&apos;t bought RS.
<br>
<br>as stated elsewhere. This is not the game for those that enjoy twitch gaming. COD and Battlefield enthusiast be warned. This one involve tactics extra teamwork and patience.
<br>
<br>On the whole. This expansion to Red Orchestra 2. Is a cut down to it&apos;s previous titles. With reason. Armoured combat in the Pacific is less often use compared to the land lock battle of the eastern front. As such thhe scope is smaller, as are the maps.
<br>
<br>Sadly. However much work has gone into these maps. They are extremely dated. Foliage and water and structure barely move, or are affected by the chaos around them.
<br>
<br>Player models are also sadly. Dull.
<br>
<br>If this title were to be judged on merits alone. It would be a worthy 7.5
<br>
<br>But it is marred by it&apos;s production houses lack of ethics.

The game is now this weird frankenstein, with mixed fonts and missing content. I am disappointed in you Tripwire. I expected better from you guys. I thought this was supposed to be a 1.0 release, not a 0.5 release.
<br>
<br>Rising Storm is considered an &quot;add-on&quot; of sorts to RO2. If you own RO2, you can play all the Rising Storm maps, except you are limited to only playing as a Rifleman and can only use either the Springfield M1903, or the Arisaka Type 38. You cannot level up in any way, and no stats are saved.
<br>
<br>There are a ton of issues in the Beta version of Rising storm, and ALL of them are in the &quot;full release&quot;. for example, there are random issues with being considered &quot;out of bounds&quot;, and the out of bounds message will be permanent until it either kills you or you die, even if you run back in bounds. not just that, but there is a ton of text that does not show up correctly either, with all the syntax there.
<br>
<br>Tripwire, what happened to you? Please actually properly finish your projects before releasing them. Also, it seems like Tripwire is almost synonymous to buggy games and releases now.
<br>
<br>Oh, and even though they mashed RO2 and RS together, they are still considered separate games in the Steam store, which will further confuse RO2 and RS players.
<br>
<br>RO2 was a buggy mess, and they never really addressed many major bugs that really kill the enjoyment of the game. TWI promised that they would &quot;fix&quot; the issues with RS along with improve the game... instead we get this even MORE buggy mess that you can tell is a quickly hacked together attempt at shoving more content into the game. At least the majority of game breaking bugs were mostly ironed out in RO2 by this point, and the game is enjoyable as long as the bugs dont act up.
<br>
<br>I thought TWI was more consumer centric than this. They showed a ton of potential with RO1 and Killing Floor, but this... this is just pathetically shameless how little they seem to care about both their products and their customers with this kind of release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186566">Expand</a></span>

Its not one of those &quot;run n gun&quot; games. As I already wrote, TWI wanted to get more COD like, and BF like players in the game, and they changed the game, despite strong NO from the loyal RO community. They added couple game types, which hardly anyone give a  about. The only new players that come to the game, are those who play during the &quot;free weekend&quot;, once its over, players are gone. TWI not only betrayed loyal fans, but also couldnt get more run n gun kids to the game. Then, they realized, that they are in rather bad condition. RO2 had no support, so they focused on something else.. on Rising Storm, which was supposed to be something cool, but it didnt work out. What else can you expect after a company, that fails in everything it does? I dont expect anything. Rising Storm is worth nothing. Couple maps, couple weapons, and new skins, at the price of a new game. Pathetic.

In action mode you get a camshot which indicates the area of the soldier that took you out, but on realism mode you just have to put up with the fact that every few seconds, or minutes if you&apos;re lucky, you WILL DIE! But then again, you can hit back too, and there&apos;s something really fun about only having a few bullets in a bolt-action rifle between you and and a banzai-charging Japanese soldier, trying desperately to defend his little islands. Having not played the original, Stalingrad, I can only really compare this to BF3. It&apos;s a less polished experience, but the maps are fantastic and just totally addictive. I&apos;ve also had no issues with the servers. It&apos;s relatively quick and easy to find a game and lag is there, but not too bad.

Anyway, this game is just as awesome as RO2, and there are a lot of never-seen-before weapons suchas the katana. There are also lots of innovations in this game, such as Bandai charging and planting booby traps. Kills feel very satisfying and rewarding, especially with the katana. I will reccomend this game to CS and battlefield players. Well done Tripwire!

<br>
<br>It plays rather tough, it is actually despite what some people say similar to COD on hardcore modes, like world at wars bolt servers for example, I say this from my perspective, so it is still essentially quite an acradey fps when compared to a slower paced game like Arma 2, which is what I needed really as Arma 2 is a difficult one to get into and rarely offers any PVP (I think these guys are playing DayZ).
<br>
<br>The thing is for enjoyable online ritual, people appreciate a certain level of interaction, so this game offers a lot of fast action, you won&apos;t need to wait long before shooting the enemy, but a stalemate can develop fast causing the pace to slow and present strategic opportunity.
<br>
<br>So compared to RO2, also a masterpiece which I am hard pressed to decide between, the real contrast is the upped power level of all the US weapons mainly, from the get go. The Japanese are actually a bit unfortunate here, indeed even a Jap victory online seems a bit more satisfying.... of course this imbalance is one of the things we enjoy about the series, also the maps themselves are asymmetric.... I find this a bold design decision in the making of the series.
<br>
<br>The satisfaction of role playing from both perspectives is again thrilling. An example of the firepower advantage the Americans have is the flame-thrower and also a tonne of semi automatic rifles (every rifelman the most prolific class has an M1), whereas most of the poor japs have bolt rifles (but they have bayonets from the off!). Also the only light automatic Jap firepower is a rather rare smg simulating the resources. As you can imagine it plays epic, it even gets you thinking about the stark contrast of attitudes when these cultures met.
<br>
<br>My only complaints are some awkward movement issues getting stuck on things again... but essentially what we have and mostly missed by everyone here, is an attempt to really get asymmetric warfare going by controlling classes and equipment, it really works very very well online</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3486271">Expand</a></span>

The asymmetrical warfare between the gun-toting Americans and the banzai-charging Japanese makes for numerous strategies to be deployed by both sides. Unlike usual first-person shooters, Rising Storm, like its predecessor, Red Orchestra 2, boasts an off-center aiming system, non-regenerative health system, and various other features that forces players to play tactically and as a team in order to successfully win. Along with the ability to play the original Red Orchestra 2, free downloadable content, Rising Storm definitely is worth its current $20 price tag. Although it suffers from the occasional glitches, bulky and somewhat unresponsive movement system, and current lack of maps, Rising Storm shouldn&apos;t be deterred much from them. As long as new updates, fixes, and free content continues to come along, Rising Storm will definitely be a worthwhile game for those interested in tactical first-person shooters. Be prepared to die often and wait in somewhat long spawn timers when you start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3813842">Expand</a></span>

World War II has never really been my favorite setting for a video game.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love when video games try to use that setting, but at the same time, it is also kind of unoriginal because there are only SO many WWII games out there.  I decided to try this game out however because it was free on Steam for one day only.  I&apos;d also like to say that before I played this game, I had already played two other games set in WWII: Day of Defeat Source and Forgotten Hope 2 (a mod for Battlefield 2).  I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of either of those, so you can probably see why I am not entirely into World War II as a video game setting.  So, is this finally the game that impressed me enough with the World War II theme for me to recommend it to you, or do I have to keep looking for that game?  Let&apos;s find out.  It&apos;s worth noting that this game is technically two games in one.  The first game is Rising Storm, which shows the second World War as it took place in the Pacific, between America and Japan.  The second is Red Orchestra 2, which is set in Eastern Europe, and shows the battle between the Nazis and the Soviet Union.  Both games play very much the same with no real differences whatsoever (other than the setting and armies).  As for the actual gameplay, all I can say is that for the most part, it&apos;s fantastic.  This game provides a realistic World War II experience, with some elements found in a lot of other shooters as well.  Most of the time, you can be killed in one shot, and you must coordinate your attacks along with your teammates.  There are also multiple gameplay modes.  The first gameplay mode is territories.  This is the game&apos;s main gameplay mode.  It functions very much like attack and defend or control points in Team Fortress 2, or Battlefield&apos;s conquest game mode.  While this mode has been used before as you can see, the game makes up for it with a sense of realism not found in either of those games.  I have never seen another shooter pull off realism quite so well as this game.  This game really succeeds at making you feel like you&apos;re actually a soldier in World War II.  It does this by having you hold your breath to aim better, use cover, and even blind firing.  The other two game modes are countdown and firefight.  Countdown is like conquest, only this time, everyone has only one life, and the focus is on just one control point at a time.  The offense must capture four control points in a row to win.  If the defense stops them even once, then defense automatically wins.  Firefight is basically team deathmatch, and not much else.  As I said, these modes are a lot like those already found in other shooters.  However, because of the sense of realism in this game alone, these experiences suddenly feel fresh and new again.  There are also several maps to play on, so you don&apos;t have to worry about getting bored with only three game modes.  The only other problem with the gameplay I can see are the game&apos;s tanks.  I found piloting tanks in this game confusing and cumbersome.  This can get in the way, but considering very few maps seem to have those, and they are usually optional, they are not much of a problem.  This game is very fun, even with a few hiccups here and there.  As for the graphics, oh my goodness where do I begin?  The graphics of this game are beautiful.  This game manages to capture the look of World War II better than any other WWII game I know.  The character models could use some work, but that&apos;s about it.  As for the presentation, it&apos;s good too.  The A.I. isn&apos;t quite as good as I would want it to be, but it&apos;s still good enough to get the job done.  It is also relatively easy to set up a server with bots if you just want to play by yourself.  The training missions are also good, and allow you to hone your skills against targets, and practice various maneuvers in order to be good on the real field of battle.  Still though, no matter how it tries to make tank driving less confusing, it is still confusing as heck.  Overall, I&apos;d say that this game is well worth your time and money.  The game modes are nothing we haven&apos;t seen before, but the realism of this game more than makes up for it.  The graphics of this game are very beautiful, and use the Unreal Engine to its full potential.  The presentation of the game is nice too.  I just wish the tanks weren&apos;t so confusing to play with.  I can safely say: yes, I have finally found a World War II game that has impressed me enough, and I can indeed recommend it to you.

<br>The soundscape is excellent. Weapons sound very realistic, whether near, far, or inside a building. Weapon handling (accuracy etc) are still the best I have ever seen in any game (much better than ARMA series in my opinion). There are some neat gameplay mechanics that simulate suppression, and reward teamwork and discourage camper score-whoring. This is probably the only game that really models suppression. Don&apos;t bother with the single-player though, its rubbish and the AI is dumb.
<br>
<br>When it was released back in 2011, it was rough around the edges with lots of bugs, but now in 2014, with continuous support from the devs, virtually all the problems have been ironed out, and it now runs very stable.

<br>Being realistic and brutal, this is very unforgiving to noobs (and CoD players). Only 1 rifle bullet is needed to kill. Noobs spawn, run forward, and get killed by enemy artillery, or a tank 300m away, or a sniper 200m away, or a machine gunner 150m away, or a maxed out assault trooper 5m away, and never see it coming. Being realistic, machine guns are almost just as accurate as sniper rifles, but it is slightly harder to spot prone enemies without the scope. I am usually the machine gunner, and by a round&apos;s end (20min) I may have killed over 80 of them and only died 5 times. That&apos;s how ruthless this game is. This is arguably both the game&apos;s biggest strengh, and its biggest problem.
<br>
<br>This game uses a leveling and unlock system, but it is still quite fair on new players. While fully levelled guns will help (with slightly reduced weapon sway, recoil, reload time, magazine size etc) it is still only 20% of your effectiveness and the remaining 80% is down to your tactical awareness, teamwork, and most of all, your individual skill. That is the most important thing. If you are naturally good, you will start out quite well and only get better as you level up, but if you are not so good at aiming with a mouse, you might always struggle.
<br>
<br>The online community is more mature than in most other shooter games. We still get the occasional 12 year old, but not too often. As of Dec-2014 there are still a good range of servers and a good volume of players online (about 1500 sunday night, 300 monday morning). At peak times there are about 5-10 servers with 64 players, and some servers occasionally go over the 64 player limit. The most I have seen is 85, that was epic. In 800 hours of gameplay I have only seen 1 incident of hacking (the artillery hack), and that one was patched out by the devs within days. So, this game has a virtually hack-free environment.
<br>
<br>So, this game is too brutal and realistic for many, but if CoD or Battlefield is not cutting it for you, I recommend you try this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rising-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=4882731">Expand</a></span>
