It somehow reminds me a lot of Beyond Good &amp; Evil and Arx Fatalis and just like them won&apos;t probably get the attention and sales it deserves. The story is nice and personal, and gradually gets you involved in the greater scheme of things, without giving you the feel to be lost in it. The backstory is simple but gripping, no overcontrived lore is needed. The focus stays on a single main character, so no bickering party to (micro)manage, which I think is a breath of relief after recent Bioware games. The environment is great: I&apos;ve recently been to Venice and it surely nails the atmosphere if not the precise layout. Characters look slightly cartoonesque, which paints their personality in a few broad strokes, but the environments are pretty realistic, and looking out over the sprawling multilayered town in can take your breath away. Fights are very visceral, with action oriented blocking and dodging combined with a melee combo system akin to the Witcher but done more intuitively. Secondary powers and spells are done through a standard action bar. Skill gain is slightly less intuitive, with certain skills/trees locked out until unlocked in the storyline or encountering certain trainers. Skills do make a difference though, unlike the other recent German RPG: Divine Divinity 2: Ego Draconis, where level alone make too big a difference. Here, difficult fights can be brought to a successful end by making good use of your skills. Technically (with the 1.02 patch) the only problem I encountered was not being able to alt-tab, but that problem might be specific to my 3D monitor and driver. I&apos;ve been playing for about 6 hours, and am halfway to the second of what I suspect will be 5 bosses, so the game will have a good 30+ hours of gameplay. All in all, a great game, and something I heartily recommend to gamers that find a lot of current RPG&apos;s take themselves so seriously they forget games are about having fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/venetica/user-reviews?user_review_id=744606">Expand</a></span>

There is however an abundance of physical and magical skills you can buy or upgrade to, and also a multitude of weapons of 4 different styles (Swords, Spears, Hammers and Axes and Moonblades).

The packaging&apos;s statement, &quot;vast, open game world&quot; is a marketing fantasy: the game is shortish and linear and has no replay value. It&apos;s the kind of game you resort to when Oblivion, Two Worlds, and The Witcher need a rest. The PC version is a poor console port, and bugs are of all flavors. Installation takes 15 minutes, and because it keeps seeing its own files as being &quot;in use&quot;, you have to sit, repeatedly clicking the &quot;Retry&quot; in a pop-up error window. The controls need adjustment to make it playable. I often turned the sound off. Partly on account of the five second sound loops: the usual lame water crashing, wind blowing, mill grinding, etc. But it was especially on account of the lead&apos;s 20-something voice actor who was inconsistent and impatient when she wasn&apos;t so distant it seemed as if she was about to fall asleep with boredom. In some cut scenes, the sound completely vanishes, anyhow. Add to this .. the same usual lousy feeble trick of incompetent game designers: The fighting technique you&apos;ve been using all along suddenly &quot;doesn&apos;t work&quot; for no reason. Worth playing? For adventure gamers who have played everything else, maybe. Maybe not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/venetica/user-reviews?user_review_id=1534343">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can use them to find treasures or hidden rooms.The problem is the cooldown of the skill.Here too, its sooooooo slow.All in all there is too much time in the game were nothing happens.You run 80 times through empty floors.This is bad today, this was bad in 2008, sorry.Visuals are ok, you can play this game today if you dont mind the textures.The voiceacting is not that great.Solid game i think that i uninstalled because of the time were nothing happens.Im not interested in these things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/venetica/user-reviews?user_review_id=4476345">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Plenty to do and sights to see around Venice in the high middle ages (well, an alternate Earth really).

<br>It&apos;s not open world and doesn&apos;t pretend to be. Combat is relatively simple though it is obvious the controls have been ported from a console version.

<br>Good for a few days of relatively mindless fun.</span>

The plot is foreseeable and there are neither variations nor surprises in it. I refrain from completing the game.</span>
