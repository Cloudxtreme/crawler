Thats not to say that any strategy is missing, you must think hard about tactics and maneuvers you wish to use and it can become very challenging. The current price tag warrants the content, however its releasing on Steam very soon (will probably be on there whilst you read this) and with its steam release comes Multiplayer and delicious new content (not sure if the price will go up at all), which will add hours and hours to an already great experience. Really had fun with it. The only gripe I have with is the flag graphics could be cleaned up a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=4772527">Expand</a></span>
