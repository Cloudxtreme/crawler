<br>
<br>All in all, if you call yourself a roleplayer; you must have tried this game at least once in your life. 
<br>Possibly, you&apos;ll find yourself lost after crossing the first bridge. Take my advice: Don&apos;t give up then. . Play longer and you won&apos;t think of stopping anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=85624">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t played a game this open ended since the classic Ultima games. I have about 20 hours into it so far and I find that.... The graphics are nice, and the details are amazing on characters and scenes. The music is very fitting and never gets tiring. I like the constant forward momentum of this game; if you aren&apos;t busy trying to keep up with all the quests, you are busy planning your character&apos;s growth. There is always plenty to do, sometimes too much. Thankfully there is a decent quest log that can be filtered down a bit so you don&apos;t get too bogged down. The story seems to be building nicely as well, with lots of background thrown in to make it seem that much more immersive. It could be a shame that this great game may get overlooked by many gamers because of its rather quiet release here in the U.S., but who knows.....It is definitely one of the best rpg&apos;s I played in a long while that isn&apos;t a Black Isle or Blizzard product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=370729">Expand</a></span>

I played this a good few years ago closer to when it came out and picked it up recently when it came out on Steam due to nostalgia (and it&apos;s damn cheap!), half expecting it to be crap because of age - like playing one of the first Pokemon games again. On the contrary, I loved every minute of it just like when I first played it through. I don&apos;t usually play games for the story but I found myself reading every line of dialogue and doing every quest. Unlike most games, the side quests are all very-well developed story-wise. Combat can be as complicated and fast paced as you want it to be as your character is pretty much completely customisable. You can pick any spell or skill no matter what &apos;class&apos; you pick so you can be the hybrid stealthy mage-ninja you always wanted to be. The map is huge and exploration is extremely rewarding. There&apos;s always a polymorphed boar or a magic wishing well just around the corner to keep you on your toes. There are tonnes of secrets as well, secret items and quests, treasure maps and hidden areas, allowing this game to cater for casuals and those traditional OCD-completionists. The game falters somewhat in difficultly, to be honest. Generic monsters tend to be hacked down in a few hits but you can easily turn the wrong corner or get to the end of the dungeon only to be completely annhilated by a certain mob. The game isn&apos;t so much about strategy, but building the best character possible to deal as much damage while staying alive as possible. The game feels a bit like what Skyrim should have been, if you take graphics out of the equation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2559088">Expand</a></span>

If this had been a Bioware title in would have been rated in the mid 90s instead of the 80s.  The fact of the matter is that this is a great game.  People nit pick about the title, or call it a Diablo clone, or other such rot because they just need to find something bad to hide the fact that a small unknown group of developers kicked their ass. Make no mistake: this is one of the best RPGs ever done.  It wouldn&apos;t make my top five list but it would make my top ten list.<br><br>What I like about this game so much is, expect for the ending, all the combat has a purpose. One of my complaints is that RPGs too often use combat as a filler or a time sink without it advancing the story in any way.  Some people might say that as a result the story is light in this game.  That&apos;s true if you compare it to something like Planescape.  But the fact of the matter is that the game play in DD gives heft to the story in a way that it doesn&apos;t in a game like Gothic. For me, this game manages to weave the story and the combat into each other in a way that seems light and effortless but is in fact not. This game also has some of the best music ever written for a video game. Don&apos;t expect the characterization you get from Buldar&apos;s Gate or the depth of Planscape.  But this is a solid, well designed and well executed RPG that shouldn&apos;t be overlooked as much as it has been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1539436">Expand</a></span>

<br>I remember quitting the demo 15 minutes in due to my disgust with the graphics.
<br>
<br>12 years after I have received this game for free with divinity original sin, and decided to take this acclaimed game for another spin.
<br>
<br>Its terrible, absolutely terrible, the graphics, the story telling, the clunky combat system.
<br>It&apos;s lack of immersion, lack of atmosphere.
<br>This time I survived a few hours in before I finally hit the delete button. It tried to copy paste diablo style of gaming without innovating and without the multiplayer which really made the diablo game so successful.
<br>It was supposed to be a diablo with an interactive story.
<br>but the story doesn&apos;t even come close to bioware golden era or cd project.
<br>And the gameplay is a pale imitation of the successful diablo 2.
<br>
<br>Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game even if its free.
<br>There are much better stories out there for you to experience and many games which are a lot more fun that this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=4439361">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&apos;t even get through the first dungeon. First of the UI is less than intuitive. I kept having to hunt around for my equipment for my equipment screen. If there was a keyboard shortcut for it it wasn&apos;t obvious. Also the leavers and such in the dungeon were hard to see because they blended into the walls. When asked to find three pentagrams on the floor I spent over half an hour searching for them because they blended into the floor. It also would&apos;ve been nice if they highlighted when I moused over them, but they didn&apos;t. Also a quick select bar would&apos;ve been nice, it sure would&apos;ve saved me from dieing against that first boss. Which brings me to the final straw that killed the game for me. When the afor mentioned boss killed me I kinda expected some sort of Game Over screen to come up or a prompt asking me to retry or reload my last save or something, but nothing of the sort came up. Instead the game just sat there with the Boss dancing around my corpse. I don&apos;t care if this is a smaller developer, this is not performance. I expected better esp. considering all the rave reviews this  game got.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524377">Expand</a></span>

<br>In my opinion it&apos;s a 10/10, you have to consider this is a 12 years old game (it came out in 2002) so I&apos;m basing my judgement on that, but if you want to compare it to a more recent game, I guess we all agree if I say it&apos;s a 2D Skyrim.
<br>The main quest is quite short if you just rush it to the end, but you can&apos;t, the game sidetracks you from everything you are doing with sidequests, exploration and fights. Don&apos;t be mislead by my playing time, it says 16 hrs but I played a lot in offline mode and it doesn&apos;t show, I think it&apos;s 70hrs more or less and I havent finished all sidequests.
<br>
<br>***Graphics - 9/10 Considering the game age I&apos;d say. Your character&apos;s equipment is pretty detailed and so is the environment, you almost never have the feeling of visiting a place already seen, not a single room is like the other, the only exception is for cave dungeons, these have always the same dark rock tiles and walls, and it gets boring after 15 mins, also it&apos;s so dark that you have trouble finding levers to open the doors.
<br>
<br>***Sound - 10/10 The music is just perfect, calm and sweet when you&apos;re travelling the forest but dark and deep when you&apos;re facing demons in the depths of the earth. Voice acting reminds me of theatre plays and maybe someone could dislike it, however it&apos;s really good. I had just one problem with sound, which I couldn&apos;t get rid of, it was like a scratch sound that played randomly at times, hopefully not too often, I guess it&apos;s some conflict due to the game being played on modern machines, but still, nothing to worry about.
<br>
<br>***Story - 10/10 Main quests and sidequests are pretty awesome, there is everything, from monster slaying to the only-talking quests. Some of them are very VERY long and sometimes you find out that completing a quest helps you in another one. There is even room for humor which is quite nice, and this is everywhere in the game, from dialogue answers to stats description, try reading then when values are low. Just once or twice I found myself baffled by the deus ex machina that comes at the right moment to save your skin without a serious explanation.
<br>
<br>***Gameplay &amp; mechanics - 10/10 (unless you break it on purpose) Apart from the chaos of the menus, which is scary at the beginning, everything is just fine, you can build your character the way you like, pick up one of the classes (rogue, mage, warrior) and do whatever you want. The only problem is that there are 2 skill that are game breaking, one is frost and the other one is trap: steel scorpion. The first one makes you godlike by freezing your enemies for a lot of time and the latter one lets you summon minions that inflict an amount of damage that is simply unbelievable, if you also have the ability to charm them so that the scorpions follow you, then you can sit down and let them kill everything. So, don&apos;t do that and enjoy the game without these 2 skills, you have many others.
<br>
<br>***Replayable -YES. First playthrough I built a rougue-warrior, but I&apos;m curious to see what a mage looks like. So this is a plus in the overall score.
<br>
<br>*** BONUS *** Steam version allows you to modify the resolution, otherwise you end up losing your eyes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943608">Expand</a></span>

<br>if you play this game and give it a chance you will love it, it has amazing quests (none of the usual go and get things), the best music score ive ever heard, and played along side an unforgettable world full of hours and hours of exploration. You can interact with everything. not just a pretty window background you can lift up and identify just about everything. There are hundreds of weapons many special weapons, that can be bought , found and sold or used. And many skills to master for warrior, survivor and mage. Every skill is useful in Divine Divinity and you can shape your character any way you want (every skill can be learned by every character type). if you haven&apos;t already been persuaded to buy this, Then heres the icing on the cake. The game is in the top 100 all time best games. Its cheap to buy and on steam. go out and buy it. you&apos;ll love it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divine-divinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=4012912">Expand</a></span>

<br>Combat initially feels turn-based and sometimes you will die when trying to flee because your character has to stop and do a flinch animation.  Your attacks will also miss 50% of the time before you start putting points into agility.
<br>
<br>The strangest part of this game is that if you die there&apos;s no game over message or an option to respawn, you just have to load an earlier save.
<br>
<br>Teleporters must be unlocked with an item and a personal visit, which sometimes makes unlocking the teleporters a waste of time.  There is a LOT of running in this game, even if you use teleporters.
<br>
<br>Otherwise it is a medium-sized world with many quests and good skills to unlock.  It is fun but you have to get past the annoying aspects of it.
