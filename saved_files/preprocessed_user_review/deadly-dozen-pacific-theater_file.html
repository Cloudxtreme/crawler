The missions are somewhat varied, although I became tired of looking at jungle in the first few missions. The levels became more challenging and interesting as the game progressed. Each level starts with an briefing, and the voice actor here does a convincing job. When you switch between characters in the game, each has a catch phrase that he utters. This is cool the first hundred times I heard it, but since you&apos;ll be switch between characters thousands of times, it becomes tiresome and irritating. The graphics are adequate, not breathtaking. Audio is OK and fits the settings depicted in each level. My biggest complaint was the pathfinding. It was horrible, and even with the patch installed, the characters would get caught on rocks, trees, or any number of objects. Since they were stuck, I often walked hundreds of yards before I realized they weren&apos;t with the group. This meant that I would have to switch to the character, walk him up to the rest of the group. The computer players also have a tendency to fall off of cliffs, and in general, ran amok. If I hadn&apos;t been determined to play the entire game, I would have given up on it. But in the end, it turned out to be an OK game. If you can get it cheap ($5 or less), it might be worth picking up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadly-dozen-pacific-theater/user-reviews?user_review_id=384219">Expand</a></span>
