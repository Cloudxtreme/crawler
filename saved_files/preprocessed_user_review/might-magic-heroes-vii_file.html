<br>I find it hard to rate a game so low. Even in the worst games you will find something that saves it from a total disgrace, say some music tracks, maybe graphics, maybe even one little thing, like a loading screen which you find particurarly artsy, or this one voice actor, who saves a day. Anything.

<br>
<br>I find it hard to rate a game so low. Even in the worst games you will find something that saves it from a total disgrace, say some music tracks, maybe graphics, maybe even one little thing, like a loading screen which you find particurarly artsy, or this one voice actor, who saves a day. Anything.
<br>
<br>In case of HOMM7, I&apos;ve never been so close to being a troll hater and give a game a zero.
<br>
<br>As an avid enthusiast of Heroes, I bought VII on the day of its release. And for the last few months I was trying to find in this game something, anything, that would earn it a few points above total nothing. So after some strenuous exercise I found it: let&apos;s say that the new skills wheel is quite neat, that some of the creature design is fine, and that pattern for the campaign - the stories told by some heroes - is interesting. And this is all.
<br>
<br>Now, I had a few gos at VII and I&apos;ve never managed to make myself play for more than a week or two in the game&apos;s terms. It&apos;s boring, as there&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t seen in the previous entries. It&apos;s ugly - there&apos;s no art direction, there&apos;s no balance in the presentation, your eyes literally hurt after 15 minutes of playing. It&apos;s largely unplayable - the number of minor and game-braking bugs is astounding! And even if you plow through all of this, as a heroes-loving person you are, you will soon realize that the story is dumbed down to the level of PG7, the already mediocre music and graphics is recycled so much you don&apos;t even know which game you&apos;re actually playing, and the trademark of the series - the castle screens - look like a cheap browser game.
<br>
<br>The broken &quot;cinematic&quot; cutscenes of ugly rendered people always frozen mid-sentence only confirms it: this game needed at least half a year in development to be decent, and a year to be actually interesting. Someone decided otherwise. But even now, after so many months after the launch, not much has changed.
<br>
<br>I only hope this little monster has not finished off the franchise.
<br>
<br>(Note: if you loved Heroes 3 or 5 - feel free to substract 3 points off my score)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519095">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics: a huge step down from 6, lacking animation, effects, sluggish
<br>Sound: no sound effects for half of combat actions.  reused sound tracks everywhere.
<br>Bugs: amateur and silly bugs that if a team of developers took time to do QA testing at all, they would have caught these bugs.
<br>
<br>Without reiterating all the -ve about this game, I must say that as a long term fan, my heart has been crushed by how poor of a release this game has had.  It is clear that no one put any heart into developing this game.  All they&apos;re looking for is a quick cash grab.  After this 7th try, I will never purchase another heroes game, though I highly doubt they will get a chance to make another one after this sorry development.
<br>
<br>Anyone who says this is the best in the serious ever are either employees/paid ads or they&apos;re saints who tolerates a studio releasing a game in its alpha version stage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5517688">Expand</a></span>

<br>- city build tree: random reallocation of &quot;building buttons &quot;
<br>- after game restart config reset to default
<br>- after finishing mission 1 and exit(seen &quot;video&quot;, back to campaign map), the game forgets, that i finished that map, so i had to load from last turn
<br>
<br>Sad facts:
<br>- no &quot;video&quot; intros, just static pictures (back to 90`s)
<br>- Heroes 6 looks better, more colorful
<br>- Hero leveling: after 20 min game-play, both heroes reached max lvl or the map. The mission took me 2-3 hour to finish.....
<br>- the battles are boring, good thing we have a &quot;fast battle&quot; button
<br>- OP skills and useless skills in skill tree
<br>- units are unbalanced: core units very-very weak compared to elite units; pointless ranged units(so low dmg)
<br>- SLOW and boring
<br>- etc.
<br>
<br>This game is bad. Do not buy it. I`m sad that i pre-purchased it.
<br>I played with all HoMM games. I liked all of them. Even the 4th one.
<br>This game, its current state is bad. Buy HoMM 6 or 5, they are cheaper, nicer and better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519067">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>General Gonzo: &quot;The best of Heroes III and Heroes V combined to a thrilling turn-based strategy-rpg highlight, Heroes VII brings back the great feeling of just one more turn! &quot;
<br>
<br>Lance Upperkill: &quot; There are some bugs in game at the moment but give it time and they will be patched. If your a fan of HOMM3 than you are really going to want to give the game a crack&quot;
<br>
<br>Mothebo: &quot;Heroes VII has become best game on the franchise. After Part 6 I was skeptical, but they have learned from their mistakes. It has good quests, graphics, gameplay and fractions. It is strongly reminiscent of Heroes III&quot;
<br>
<br>JJ Doe: &quot;Heroes 7 really manages create again this awesome feeling of &#x201C;just-one-more-turn&#x201D; to collect, build, fight and explore. ... To sum up, I can say that it definitely is one of the best Heroes games I played (started at H3) and a must buy for people interested in the strategy genre.&quot;
<br>
<br>Nerots: &quot;Heroes VII manages to get back to the roots of the franchise. Simple mechanics, nice synergies for the factions, a strong magic system and a beautiful and smart level design.
<br>I&apos;m glad to say that Heroes VII has finally beaten Heroes III, which since yesterday I thought it will be unbeatable EVER.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519027">Expand</a></span>

<br>The campaign is bugged in a lot of way with some missions that can&apos;t be finished.
<br>The multiplayer is currently not working.
<br>The window 10 support is not here.
<br>
<br>Cherry on the top ?
<br>They cut off the Inferno to sell them as DLC later.
<br>They have no shame.
<br>
<br>These game deserve a big 3, but I&apos;ll give it a big 0 to face the lot of fake 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519184">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Stay away, this game is terrible! Huge step back from HoMM VI. It looks like a low-budget indie title that would be selling on Steam for $10 full price, with mixed reviews.
<br>
<br>If you do want to give it a try, buy it only where you can get a refund. Don&apos;t waste your money.</span>

The game shines in absolutely nothing. The game-play feels very mechanical and tiring. Already in my first map I started to use quick battles because I found myself bored and hating the battles which I used to love in past games. The AI is horrendous in this game, offering no challenge at all even on heroic(hardest difficulty). The battles in general will get harder, but only because they got more enemies which means more EXP so you level faster and after the start it actually becomes easier than easy games.
<br>
<br>H7 skill-system is heavily based on H6 and I personally hate the optimization it brings. Every game you end up building your hero the exact same way(which you know since start of the match). Because how some classes are much superior compared to others it doesn&apos;t help to diversify game either as you will want to pick the good classes and heroes which are clear minority in the game. I loved in pre h6-games how you were forced to analyze and evaluate what skills you should pick for the situation. H7 has none of that because it&apos;s just general build, the game lacks situational abilities completely. The system also doesn&apos;t require you to think what to get because there are no requirements for abilities nor is there limit how many you can take per skill.
<br>
<br>Magic system is yet another h6 feature. You are back to more classic approach on getting spells from magic guilds. Problem is that all schools have little bit of everything and at basic level most spells are just copies of each other. To make them any different you have to specialize in them via abilities. And to get more power to spells you have to learn other spell-schools which you have to do anyway because you can&apos;t master your school because of the new arcane system(learning high level spells requires 8 points and mastering single school only gets you 6). Even in general it doesn&apos;t feel like schools specialize in anything particular which is just sad, not to mention many iconic spells are also dearly missed.
<br>
<br>Hero specializations are currently worst in the series. They are generic boring start bonuses that make you feel like you&apos;re playing nobody/anybody instead of being the mighty Kragh or whatever. The same bonuses are also copy-pasted all over and some copied from other places like buildings. They just simply leave you disappointed..
<br>
<br>Unit abilities don&apos;t really do much better either. There is so much copy-paste mentality there it&apos;s not even funny. That doesn&apos;t get helped by the fact that units have pretty much 1-3 abilities so there being same abilities over and over makes units feel too similar. Which is even further hurting the game because units stats are kept with too small margin. All units cross the battle-field for example at turn two, the unit powers are roughly the same given their growth. Even in h6 units felt more distinctive and that by the way is not a compliment. This is partly because h7 decided to use the hated 3-tier system from h6(core/elite/champion). They did edit it adding powerful version to core and elite, but it&apos;s still a far cry from old 7-tier system which had a lot of variety.
<br>
<br>The battle-system they copied from h6 which wasn&apos;t that good. They also lost many of the good parts like map objects and creature-placing to tower. They added flanking mechanic from Heroes Online to system which was a bad decision. In essence it means you get extra boost to damage when attacking from back/side. The result is that player either plays turtle so you can back-stab them(at least till you get near and then he does that to you first) OR it makes units waltz around each other going for back-stabs which looks absolutely idiotic. The flanking system would have been great addition as ability for some units like assasin, but when every unit just runs past enemy to go for their back it really breaks immersion.
<br>
<br>The graphics of the game are also not top quality. H6 has better graphics, not to mention it had colors that made the game feel like it was placed in fantasy world. H7 uses completely grey washed out colors that make concrete wall look just about interesting. The games styles don&apos;t really mesh together either. There is the general graphics which is rather minimal, then unit designs which are completely over the top with all the extra spikes and decorations that shouldn&apos;t be there. And then there are the 2d town screens which are more like cartoony paintings. The graphics are just a real mish-mash of things(and a lot of the models are copied from h6 btw).
<br>
<br>Overall the game just doesn&apos;t excel in anything. Having played h6 this doesn&apos;t really feel even new game with so much cannibalized from h6. It&apos;s really more like stand alone expansion to h6 kinda like colonization was to Civilization 4. It feels extremely simplified much like h6 and offers very little replayability. Frankly speaking the game just feels cheap and lacking for 2015 game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5517505">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t really understand why some people give this game a 10 even when issues from the Beta (like long AI turns) are still there despite MONTHS of work and still end up in the final release.

There is a real trend in the reviews posted so far that its &quot;The best of Heroes 3&quot;. Look, I love Heroes 3. It was great. At the time. I still go back and play it every now and then. However, that is not what modern gaming should be compared to. The nostalgia glasses are very thick on this one, and it shows. The interface is very busy and clunky. The animations are clunky. It feels like they ran out of time or something because the opening scenes are mostly static images. The intro to each mission is drawn stills, and that&apos;s fine. The problem is the intro to the campaigns and such clearly were meant to be animated.
<br>The whole thing just feels so stiff. I think a good comparison would be the controls of X-com the original, VS the new X-com Enemy Unknown. While the controls on the original were fine for the time, they feel clumsy and difficult (to a modern audience), compared to the new one which are smooth and economical. Again, I love the old games, but lets have some progress!
<br>I&apos;m a 30-something gamer, and have been playing my whole life. I actually enjoyed Heroes 6. Maybe I&apos;m not the right audience for this new one, as I&apos;m not stuck in the past. I hope to revist this entry a year down the road to see if they perhaps patch out some of these issues, but until then I just hope my refund comes in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5518012">Expand</a></span>

It is the homm7 map editor. It seems to be user friendly and you can adjust about anything you can dream off if you got the skills. And if you dont you dont have to learn any coding like LUA in age of wonders 3. You can go a long way.
<br>
<br>You could  sculp the terrain with it. Add and modify your custom heroes, units. With enough skills and determination even whole new factions and townscreans. I spend the last month painting 2 new heroes with waterpaint which will become my main characters in my handwritten scenario map. And written their biography. + a good number of pages already with events and dialogues. I`m that excited about what is about to be released.
<br>
<br>I would give the game a 9 with the map editor alone. When given enough support from the developers and community. Even do i am excited to what the big single player campaign has to offer. And the new maps. I wished there would be more skirmish maps. But i`m hoping the community will ad them whenever i run short of them.
<br>
<br>I know there are a lot of haters among the community. And people who would give this game a 1 out of 10 for minor issues that do not bother me much. Like using Uplay. That`s why i give this game a 10 out of 10. And ad one point to compensate that.
<br>
<br>Some minor issues:
<br>- AI needs some work the next couple of months. Even do it is better at flanking and prioritising targets now. I`m curious about the AI on the world map.
<br>- Some units could use an interesting ability.
<br>- Units like the moon doe (Sylvan) and dire wolf (haven) are not that beloved by the fans and i`ll rather see them replaced with units like a Griffioen or Pegasus/Unicorn.
<br>- Heroes specialisations could be mode more interesting.
<br>- I wish to see a dwarven or demon faction. The game does not feel complete with them. Maybe also a couple more neutral units. But well i`ll expect to see them in one of the next expansions.
<br>
<br>I want to thank the developers who must have been working hard on the game since first beta. As i`ve seen the game develop itself in a good way the last couple of months. Julien. You are the best.
<br>
<br>I`ve seen the overall consensus grew more positive the closer we made it to the release date. I`m positive this game would get a good launch at release day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5516632">Expand</a></span>

<br>With that, my first impressions of the game is positive.  having only spent a few hours with one faction on their first mission, it was a great way to &quot;trial and error&apos; a few things before going after the faction i love playing the most (Haven).
<br>
<br>Gameplay at times can be slightly clunky.  I for one have increased the combat and movement speed, just to hurry things up a little bit without compromising the game.  I love the auto resolve button, however at times it&apos;s calculations seem to be way off and the need for the good old manual intervention is required.
<br>
<br>The skill tree/wheel is a nice change from the HOMM6 family tree where the same pathway in HOMM6 that lead to winning or higher advantages has been curved.
<br>
<br>The additional resources appears to be a wonderful introduction into the game.  Whilst you still require wood and ore for majority of the primary buildings, those unique materials add extra flavour for powerful elite creatures.
<br>
<br>Combat has increased in complexity.  rather than good old might is right where the most numbers wins, flanking and backstabbing, combination of spells and combos can really tilt a battle either to your advantage or disadvantage.  the impact of Luck and Morale has also been tweaked to add a nice well rounded balance.
<br>
<br>Movement on the map seems a lot more limited than previous HOMM&apos;s taking longer turns to move around the map.  Artifacts appear to be a lot more importance, particularly boots that grant additional movements.  Money at times also appears to &quot;never be enough&quot; which can leave a player with tough choices on who to buy/train.
<br>
<br>Overall i&apos;m thoroughly enjoying HOMM7.  There are some things they could have done better, but overall i believe a very solid performance so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5518063">Expand</a></span>

Maybe the backleash wouldn&apos;t be so serious IF IT WASN&apos;T A FULL PRICED release. It should have 20&#x20AC; price tag at best.
<br>The game runs badly, animations lack frames and have strange delay to them, sound effects are poor and the UI functionality is not consistent. Still manages to have quicker AI turns than Heroes 5, though.
<br>
<br>But, the actual gameplay is a great step into right direction. Finally they ditched an awful strategic map&apos;s trumpery where you couldn&apos;t even plan your movement right and they went back to the small environment pieces from pre-HoMM4. Cities are once again a small utility on a strategic map and don&apos;t cover the half of your screen, every utility is greatly stipulated for the sake of strategic layer of the game. Unfortunately the town&apos;s screens are a step back from the Heroes 6 and they&apos;re just an incoherent mess. I&apos;m still to be provided with the classic functional town screens from Heroes 1/2/3/4. Eventually the developer will hire someone who knows what made Heroes 3 towns so great.
<br>The combat is great, heroes&apos; development is way much better than in the previous game, although they need to bring back the random factor of Heroes 3. Every unit can find its use and once again you can merge various towns&apos; units (the convert mechanic from Heroes 6 was just awful in the long run). The flanking mechanic is of little novelty - it would have much more impact if they decided to implement hex fields back.
<br>The in-game Conflux and metaprogression are gone. Good riddance.
<br>The game grants a solid dose of Heroes gameplay, that in theory is way better than two previous installments. Unfortunately it&apos;s an absolute mas from the technical standpoint.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t be disappointed if I bought it for 10&#x20AC;. I would be pissed of if I had to pay 60&#x20AC; for it, and rightfully so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6311776">Expand</a></span>

<br>One year after its release it still have the same GAMEBREAKING bugs that users reported in the beta test. Out of synch won&apos;t let you finnish a single game with your friends, however you may not even get to join a lobby because of its **** connectivity, which still relay strongly on methods from the heroes III or even worse. The single player its also broken and there are several missions which gets **** up and glitched. The content doesn&apos;t seem bad tho, however i can&apos;t really tell xD the game design, mechanics and balance is still very bad.
<br>The sound and music is probably one of its strenght points.
<br>The AI is not, which is something important for TBS games. Some of it has been patched, but its still very dumb in too many aspects (hero management, path findings, economy plans, map control strats, combat...)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6733584">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Cannot do multiplayer on LAN?  Really?  In 2016 this is a challenge?
<br>- Crashes during simple artifact swaps and obviously can&apos;t handle when the world is mature and armies more complex.
<br>
<br>The whole amazing thing about this game is multiplayer...and it just doesn&apos;t work!!!  Uplay also a gigantic bag of crap.
<br>
<br>So ridiculously buggy and slow, for a game that is glorified chess, in 2016 this is so unacceptable as to be pathetic.  I am done for good...after 7 hours on a weekend trying to get multiplayer to work for more than a couple turns at a time.

Heroes of Might &amp; Magic, and I refuse to call you anything else, my old friend. We&apos;ve shared some good times these past 21 years. From the dawn of the new style of game and the continuation of the Might &amp; Magic series, we&apos;ve had a few tumbles. A handful of falls. This being the third offering from Ubisoft and the second from Limbic Entertainment, I&apos;d hoped for something more. Perhaps nothing great, but at least passing for good.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with what I enjoyed from this installment. The core of the gameplay, and the heart of the series, is intact and fun as ever. The new skill system is intriguing and seems to be an evolution from the system used in HoM&amp;M6. While it seems to have become simplified and providing no real variety, I at least liked that something new was attempted.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m rather on the fence concerning spells and combat magic as a whole. While it is impossible to mess with the might portion of &quot;Might &amp; Magic&quot;, the same cannot be said of the other. Magic, under 3DO was always a bit overpowered. HoM&amp;M3 was probably the worst offender of this. Now, magic is too weak to even be bothered with sometimes. &quot;Mass&quot; spells are completely gone, replaced with a 4x4 grid to cast within. That, right there, is wrong. Another thing to note are the classic shrines. A way to easily learn new spells in the older games. This is no longer the case. You must have learned the skill necessary to use the spells offered. World magic is an area that has actually improved. New spells giving interesting bonuses and effects are added.
<br>
<br>The change to the towns is something out of HoM&amp;M4. You are provided with the choice between one monster or another. Alternatively, you are allowed to choose which monster&apos;s growth you want to increase each week. This is a welcome addition that I sorely missed from the series, even if it was introduced in what was once the worst game of the franchise.
<br>
<br>The series has never been renowned for it&apos;s top tier graphics, but this game feels dated even by the standards of 2006 when HoM&amp;M5 was released. Lighting has been improved, but the models are almost identical to those found in HoM&amp;M6. The cutscenes are not animated, which was a terrible choice, and the monster animations are best ignored.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the bugs. Oh lord, the bugs. They are everywhere and range from completely game breaking to simply annoying. The screen will flicker randomly as you scroll around the map. The game will crash on certain campaign maps if you attempt to go into battle. The build screen on the map will decided to either let you choose what to build, choose for you, or not allow you to get your cursor near enough to select &quot;build.&quot;
<br>
<br>All in all, this has to be the worst game offered and that actually makes me less sad for the future of the series and more towards Limbic Entertainment. Might &amp; Magic X and Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 6 were both good games in their own right, despite having issues. Playable, entertaining, and HoM&amp;M6 was innovative and refreshing while M&amp;M10 was a return to the basics of it&apos;s own series. Limbic Entertainment hamstrung themselves by bowing to the wishes of the more conservative fans of the genre who yearn for another HoM&amp;M3. These same fans will be the death of the franchise. I urge Ubisoft to allow Limbic Entertainment to give us a new game in the future and demand that Limbic Entertainment ignore those who would hold back this series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6585636">Expand</a></span>

Luckily Steam offers refund at very reasonable conditions. I leave aside errors with graphics and poor performance, as these are probably well fixable with patches.
<br>
<br>Game experience itself is a crime against HOMM fans. AI combat behavior is foolish beyond imagination. AI does absolutely nothing to win battles, he just runs towards my strong melees like berserked, without using initiative or waiting. Hero casts pointless crap and even mages avoid casting any damage based spells even if they face 100% loss.
<br>
<br>Playing heroic level is like walking in the park. You waste time (mostly to see around and discover what else is wrong with game) and when you finally reach AI, it has nothing onboard. Various idiotic &quot;improvements&quot; of game-ruining spells have been done with HOMM7. Just one sample: frenzy was imba spell even in previous versions, allowing player to abuse AI mega armies that were not supposed to be winnable on certain maps and making multiplayer a spell-hunting race. Now frenzy affects target IMMEDIATELY removes even theoretical chance to counter that spell. It means, human player casts frenzy on your stack, stack acts straight away. In previous versions you had at least theoretical chance to improve your initiative, run away or dispel from that game-ruining stuff.
<br>
<br>Many many many things of this type make HOMM7 a total timewaster for any experienced player. Having played homm series of 15 years I can tell: only novice may find some challange in Homm 7. Its not possible for a fan to write good review towards it:(

Now i understand the reasoning about the very conservative fanbase and the tight limitations of innovation - but even so... the product &quot;feels&quot; very much like a beta - an early beta.
<br>
<br>There is a technical level on which a game can be rated - but also a meta level (like instant immersion, likability of characters or story etc. ) - it is hard to measure the meta level ... but it is much easier to do it for the technical level.
<br>
<br>on a technical level - this game is poorly optimized and poorly designed. Along with fairly long loading times comes a seemingly innate instability with occasional but rather frequent crashes. The game seems to eat memory as if there was an unlimited supply and the overall design is ... surprisingly WORSE than HoMM 6 (in terms of animation quality, meshworks, texture and all that).
<br>
<br>Even the world feels much more lifeless and on some maps - shoddy and empty. And this is a 2015 game.
<br>
<br>The AI is poor - but the AI has never been too clever ... in fact i do not quite know what a really good AI is capable of these days in such turn based games... cause i do not consider any AI a great challenge (unless the AI cheats)
<br>
<br>The UI is in one word - terrible. The sound assets are uninspired.
<br>
<br>And most of all - the tactical combat is dull. Yes - there is flaking and backstabbing now - but what is the point of positioning when it comes down to simply running around the enemy without peril (as in strikes of Opportunity or ... maybe MORE ENVIRONMENT on the combat maps?!)
<br>
<br>Speaking of combat maps - i am a bit at a loss why hardly ANY game makes use of 3D there. Neither HoMM, nor Age of Wonders, Kings Bounty or similar games have elevation or real foliage or objects with actual tactical value (at least at a level similar to X-Com)
<br>
<br>And so - every combat is kind of the same old same old - the only thing that may change is the blurry texture on the ground.
<br>
<br>edit:
<br>
<br>Also - no Inferno faction!! - a sacrilege - but no point deduction for that - i am sure it ll come as a DLC</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5532383">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gave up and just tried some skirmish / scenarios - quite a few of the faction specific (and or char / class) abilities either don&apos;t work at all, or just &quot;sometimes&quot;, I can forgive a lot and I&apos;m a fan of the series but this needed A LOT more polish to be up to snuff.
<br>
<br>To top it all off there are actually pretty decent performance problems, certain battle scenes specifically and I&apos;m positive theres a good ram leak after extended play times, I mean FFS the main menu has a texture pop in (and load times on an SSD&apos;s? come the fk on...).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5543760">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even after patch 1.2.1, game breaking campaign bugs that were clearly reported are not fixed.
<br>Forum posts and constructive criticism were banned and removed due to negativity, and many fans are very angry.

<br>Don&apos;t buy this yet, don&apos;t support Ubisoft&apos;&apos;s bad form and extremely bad customer support.</span>

The facts are that graphics are so-so, gameplay,story, presentation too. Uplay is terrible, many bugs and crashes. Please, stay away from this game.

<br>
<br>Some sound effects are completely missing regardless of speed settings, and many sound effects in combat are lack-luster to say the least.
<br>
<br>Music is nothing special (especially compared to H5 and H4, H7&apos;s music sucks)
<br>
<br>Many people are unable to even start the game
<br>
<br>The game crashes quite often for many people
<br>
<br>Many are getting savegames corrupted, seemingly at random
<br>
<br>Many of the campaign missions are bugged to varying degrees - some of them cannot even be completed by most people
<br>
<br>The &quot;cut scenes&quot; are a joke - just static models staring at eachother with voiceover in the background
<br>
<br>The voice acting varies from OK, to atrocious
<br>
<br>The story is lazy and boring
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s graphics look like something that belongs in 2010, not 2015/2016.
<br>
<br>The aesthetic is mismatched and uneven because of lack of development time and resources
<br>
<br>About 80% of the people cannot even start a multiplayer game because of &quot;time out&quot;. Those who can, often experience disconnects due to &quot;desync&quot; issues.
<br>
<br>In short, the game was rushed out the door in an unfinished, buggy and incomplete state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5527875">Expand</a></span>

Barring the minor annoyances with ubisofts DRM uplay, the multiplayer was virtually unplayable, desync after desync. None of the suggested fixes worked: port forwarding, turning off AV and Firewall, running in win8 compatibility. The load times are forever and honestly the game looks like crap for the resources it demands.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is solid and I did not venture much into the campaign. Made the mistake of preordering and now I&apos;m requesting a refund. Would suggest only buying this when it&apos;s 50% off or more, this is not worth the trouble.

<br>
<br>As for the MMH 7 itself:
<br>A buggy, crashing, slow and ugly MESS. I don&apos;t even blame the devs, as the game shows symptoms of your usual &quot;we didn&apos;t have enough time to finish the game, but the suits above didn&apos;t care&quot; syndrome.
<br>Boring, non-engaging, copy-paste from MMH6. Avoid at all costs.
<br>
<br>It baffles me how can Ubisoft screw up so many times a game with such a simple premise.
<br>I would refund it if I could, but as I bought it from a 3rd party seller, I can&apos;t.
<br>My mistake. I can only assure Ubisoft it was the last time I gave them a chance with this franchise.
<br>
<br>Notice how the people who gave it a 10/10 here have only one review. That&apos;s not suspicious at all.
<br>
<br>(this is also the last time I listen to CD-Action who praised the game as something taking the very best from HoMM3 and 5 and being entirely different from 6 which turned out to be complete and utter lie)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5532170">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing this series for over 20 years now and consider myself as much of an authority as anyone.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s quickly get the few improvements out of the way. They stopped grouping all the tertiary resources into one (blood crystal) and diversified them back again. Thank you for acknowledging we have resource management skills above that of a toddler. Yippee. Letting us pick kingdoms and creatures during the beta was nice, but it was this false sense of we the community thinking we could have a noticeable impact on this game. In reality, this impact is minimal at best. Ubisoft insisted on leaving all the horrendously messed up decisions to themselves.
<br>
<br>The development flaws are just inexcusable for a game released in this era. Why Ubisoft was allowed to sully this great franchise with their touch of death is beyond me. I&apos;ve only played through a few campaigns so far, but the problems are readily visible. Yes many bugs were fixed, but new bugs have taken their place. Some spells still don&apos;t work as their tooltips claim and when a game revolves entirely around battle strategy, this is inexcusable.
<br>
<br>My biggest disappointment is the recycled content and complete and utter laziness from the story writing and animation teams. The character&apos;s do not move in cutscenes at all, and their mouths are stuck open like they&apos;re trying to catch flies. What in the hell is this all about? It looks so lazy and stupid. This is executed so poorly that I am simply at a loss for words.
<br>
<br>The storylines are derivative and obscenely boring. I&apos;ve skipped almost every conversation and cutscene because after 2 full campaigns it showed no signs of improvement. They also completely ripped off characters from George R.R. Martin&apos;s fictional universe and Warcraft. An orc named Thrall? Tell me you&apos;re joking.
<br>
<br>Now, those of you who played HOMM II might say &quot;but wait, they had a map in the second game back in 1996 that was based off A Game of Thrones, what&apos;s the big deal?&quot; Well, that was one customized map not connected to a campaign at all. It was clearly a homage to a great book, put into the game by one of 3DO&apos;s developers who was geeking out about a book he read that year, since none of the other books were written yet. They clearly weren&apos;t trying to gain any favor by leeching off a successful series. In Heroes 7, these are recurring characters in the CAMPAIGN STORYLINE aka the lore. You know, the part of the game that is supposed to be written exclusively for this game.
<br>
<br>In Heroes VII there is a character used in the first set of cutscenes for the Haven campaign that is a blatant ripoff of Tywin Lannister. It might as well be an actual photo of him with an Instagram filter. Then later in the first segment of the Sylvan campaign there is an elven princess named &quot;Danan&quot; and guess who she is coincidentally a carbon copy of? Yep, a certain Targaryen lady perhaps? Everything from the silvery hair with pinned back braids, side curls, and her backstory of being far from home. But Daenarys Targaryen was a dragon lady, oh wait Sylvan&apos;s do get dragons. Nah, I guess it&apos;s just another &quot;coincidence.&quot;
<br>
<br>The utter lack of originality and insipid storyline themes make this one for the preschool nursery. Ubisoft is one sad group of idiots. I can&apos;t wait for the campaign story involving a prince with a physical deformity, shunned by his family for the mother&apos;s death birthing him, and who later is blamed for the assassination of his reigning nephew.
<br>
<br>Why are so many assets recycled? Why can&apos;t you guys write original characters and stories? What the hell did you spend your money on Ubisoft!!!!
<br>
<br>Please sell this to someone like Paradox who can actually do something really good with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6113139">Expand</a></span>

<br>They no longer care about making a quality game. They just want the quick fast buck. Heroes 3 &amp; 5 were by far the best games in the series. When Heroes 6 came out, it was obvious that they didnt care! They regressed!  Some of the BEST features of Heroes 5 were now gone. Most importantly was the 360 degree camera and no sim turns.  Here I was excited for them to actually improve on sim turns and make them better.. I was hoping they would make sim turns so they didnt break at all during game..  But instead of making the game better, they got lazy and just removed it. Same for the 360 camera which is also MISSING from Heroes 7. Again just to lazy to code it back into the game??
<br>
<br>Another disgusting trend they have been doing is only releasing HALF of a game that includes only half the factions, then expecting you to pay  more money to buy the other half of the game to gain access to the rest of the factions.  That is like years ago when I seen trucks on the car lots with no back bumper. And when I asked where the bumper was they said it was not part of the standard package that I had to pay extra to get the bumper????  Are you kidding me???
<br>
<br>Most frustrating part is seeing ANY customers paying for this garbage.  I wish everyone would boycott them and make them wake up and take pride in the games they produce.
<br>
<br>They only ever focus on the stupid campaigns and never put more then 5 mins thought to multiplayer at all.  For years players have been offering ideas and input on how they want to see the Heroes game evolve, and they NEVER listen. They must think they know what is best for a game?  Well obviously they havent got a clue.
<br>
<br>I have no choice but to wait and hope and pray that they care about Heroes 8!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5847543">Expand</a></span>

There are prolly more bugs, that i havent found yet. Game itself is like heroes 5. They changed stuff around improved some, yes pretty nice. The sad thing is, its only scripted maps and fairly boring at that. NO real ai opponents i guess, same as multiplayer. Its like the wrappings you a put gift in but without the gift. Very dissappointing.

<br>Unfinished, full of bugs, whats missing/bad in previous 6 versions of heroes, is thankfully still missing/bad.

<br>
<br>The game elements wouldn&apos;t be so bad after all (the design team, UI elements, castle view are quite good in my opinion) , but unfortunately I have to give a solid 0 score here for a very simple and serious reason: The game IS NOT WORKING. The online multiplayer aspect is still non existent after 5-6 patches, because after the 3-4. fight the game goes out of sync and stuck. Furthermore, the game is FULL of bugs after ~3 months of release. I&apos;m afraid they wont fix it because the developers clearly suck very-very hard.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s absolutely unbelievable that such a huge company releases a piece of crap like this and sell it for ~50$. Advertising it as an online multiplayer game is an intentional misleading of the community. It&apos;s a theft, so don&apos;t let them steal your money as well!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5871776">Expand</a></span>

<br>Other issues:
<br>- animations are terrible
<br>- sound effects are terrible
<br>- camera is a piece of a sh**
<br>- the whole game is a piece of sh**

<br>I seriously want my money back.</span>

Atrociously uncomfortable interface, very buggy gameplay and video graphics of above average resource consumption used to a bare percentage of their full potential. Yes, I once thought that Heroes 6 was overrated for being a pretty averagely-calibrated installment with lesser improvements and large-scale underdevelopment until the release of further patches. But... MOTHER OF ASHA is this one simply ridiculous, making H6 stand out as a fine game in its totality!
<br>
<br>While the story, artwork and music grade well above satisfying for the genre, everything else seems to bring them down with a horrendous blow to the overall experience. Firstly, the introduction characters aren&apos;t animated beyond 5-10 poses for each of them. These guys want each to tell you a story yet their mouths barely move. Before this cerebral palsy party going on we see what appears to be the map of Ashan, except the time and space there are so interweaved that you&apos;d almost shed a tear for those good old times of H6 campaign self-explanatory screens now long gone.
<br>
<br>The interface and the settings are a plethora of tickboxes, buttons, scrollers and what have you... except all they do is giddy up your graphics a bit (and no, tweaking that won&apos;t make the characters move more credibly), regulate the scrolling feature and, to some extend, organize dialogue and popup doohickeys. That&apos;s it. You literally can&apos;t reduce or increase the text size (which, just to give you an idea, on a 1600x900 resolution seems to jump at your face), remove or minimize map objects (you know you have a problem when the faction icon of your playing hero on map appears bigger than the horse they&apos;re riding), et cetera et chetera. I mean the list could just go on, but in H6 I&apos;ve never had to actually search for how to set all those things up because I&apos;ve never had a problem with them in the first place.
<br>
<br>Last but not least are the numerous, omnipresent, abundant, several tiring numbers of bugs and glitches making &apos;Heroes 7&apos; stand out as some kind of late pre-beta stage title. And this goes for map and gamplay issues as well as sheer device management. I won&apos;t claim to have the creme de la creme machine here, but once again, just for the sake of example, on a PC with 4 gig of RAM the game takes 5-10 minutes to get to the main menu, and eats about 2.5 of them for this action alone. It then runs smoothly, yes, but this process could potentially harm other processes being run in the background and requiring RAM (such as your AV, e.g.). Is this really worth it?
<br>
<br>Overall, playing H7 to me felt like remaining unclean for multiple days without the possibility of taking a bath. The level of seriousness one can express for this game surpasses perhaps the game of Angry Birds, with childlike indicators and trajectory traces over a map ridden with hills, overanimated trees and water, shadows everywhere... I swear I was eventually confused as to make sure I was actually playing a &quot;Heroes&quot; installment, and not a &quot;Sims&quot; one. Funny how using exactly the same graphical concept as in H6 over the previous installments, one could astonishing screw up (not to use the F word) about everything about it, and render the overall playing experience from tolerable to ridiculously undesirable.
<br>
<br>Anyway, long story short, I&apos;m giving this game a 3 out of 10, won&apos;t say I&apos;m being generous, but had it been released 5 years ago, when I was a much more avid fan of the M&amp;M universe, I don&apos;t even think I&apos;d have given it a 2. Ubisoft, I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re up to nowadays, but I strongly suggest you get your things together (or sell the franchise to someone more worthy and passionate about the series, for all I care) if you want to keep a good fan base intact.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5525463">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Animated cutscenes

<br>- Progressive campaign
<br>- Character customisation during campaign
<br>
<br>Cutscenes are &quot;animated&quot;, but show frozen models, with speech laid on top.
<br>
<br>Using the game feels clunky, you will often accidentally stop your hero mid stride because you accidentally clicked twice on the target, when you should have clicked once. Or your hero doesn&apos;t move, because you should have clicked twice when you clicked once.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t seem that there has been a User Experience designer involved in the development of this game, there are too many basic usability issues. Such as that you can&apos;t bring up a town screen by clicking on a town. It took me nearly 10 minutes to figure out that you need to double click the little town name on the bottom left to do that. Ridiculous. That&apos;s just one example, expect a lot more like that.
<br>
<br>The character models and animations certainly look dated, and many look like they are reused directly from Hereoes VI. Most of the time, you&apos;ll notice that Heroes VI had much better character models though. Models are small in battles, so you don&apos;t see the details (maybe this is for the best, as the details are not that great). The entire game has a washed, grainy feel to it that takes away from the &quot;Heroes feel&quot;. Heroes should be lush, with powerful colors, to immerse you into this fantasy world with its multitude of colorful, odd beings. This is not the case. You get sort of the same feel as when opening a spreadsheet or something. The delightfulness is clearly missing. There&apos;s a sparse, somewhat empty feeling to it.
<br>
<br>The animations are clearly a step down from Heroes VI. For example, the Centurion will bash his shield at the opponent, then stick his spear in it, and only about half a second after BOTH attacks are completed does the target react and make some kind of motion. Not immersive.
<br>
<br>The campaign is not progressive. I. e., it doesn&apos;t build a story for you to follow, but rather it&apos;s just a few short stories that you can play through in any order you want. Personally, I would be fine with this, if everything else had been good.
<br>
<br>Same with character customisation, you start out with predesigned characters, sometimes at level 0, for other scenarios at level 30, which may annoy some people, but would have been fine if the game was otherwise up to snuff. Of course it isn&apos;t. At this point, you get the feeling that Heroes is like an abandoned kid, crying in a mall, while his alcoholic uncle, who has custody, is off robbing a liquor store.
<br>
<br>The good things are: It&apos;s a new instalment of Heroes! For people like me, who grew up with it and love it, this is great. The maps have depth to them visually, which is fun. Castles can be in valleys and so on (but the washed out, derelict feeling that I mentioned earlier detracts from this). Skills feel slightly more useful than in the last Heroes. They&apos;ve taken some time to groom the skill set. On the other hand, it&apos;s not the glory that was Heroes V.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re fine with all this, then this game might be for you. The truth is however, that Ubisoft again is trying to get away with minimum effort. What I don&apos;t get is, do these people take no pride in what they do? Does it feel good to crank out one half-assed effort after another? Is it a matter of competence, do they not have the right people? Is everyone working on the game too junior? Or is it a conscious strategy from the management?
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t they want praise from the fans? Why aren&apos;t they creating it with &quot;game of the year&quot; firmly fixed in their minds? I simply don&apos;t get how someone could be satisfied with creating something with this level of indifference. That can&apos;t be a satisfying way to live your life. If you don&apos;t like the series, for **** sake, sell it to some studio who DOES love it.
<br>
<br>It comes down to this: those who grow up with this game now, as I grew up with the original series, are NOT going to love it. It is not loved by its developers, and that transmits through to us, loud and clear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5528328">Expand</a></span>

This is another soulless attempt to not revamp the series, but the skim a couple of bucks of a few gamer&apos;s by repacking heroes 6 (which was a repackaged heroes 5 to begin with!!). More mechanics cant make a turd a great game. I can rant about A LOT of things. But lets just start with the obvious. It looks butt ugly to start off with ,in more ways than one lol. The graphics and modeling look dull the colors are even more dull,a very grey palette mixed the graphics just make for a sad atmosphere. The interface is a joke, the font is simply disgusting, its comic sans&apos;s ugly cousin basically, the horror of having to trudge through menu&apos;s loaded with that! . The back story and lore is just generic drivel and one is never really engaged in the campaign. The mechanics are virtually the same that 6 which wasn&apos;t that great but not bad either. In short this game lacks heavily in atmosphere and interface. Your will not be immersed and everything will look ugly and jumbled around.  The fact that every subsequent heroes game after 3 sucks and no one cant realize what made the third installment so great is mind boggling. The music is decent the only alright thing about the game and that&apos;s why i could not give this game a 1 :3</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5530166">Expand</a></span>

The next insane thing is that **** wants full AAA price for this. The campaign is broken some quest wont complete, and game crashes a lot. It feels like early beta.
<br>As whole the game looks worse than heroes 5 (yes 5 not even close to 6) and town screens looks worse than heroes 3. The Cut scenes are a joke, they are not even animated. 70% of visuals ar compy pasted from heroes 6 or 5 (yes 11 years old game looks better in many ways).
<br>The core game play is solid and RPG sklil trees are nice, but this game got so many glitches.
<br>
<br>100% not worth a buy at this price and in this state. If ubisoft patch this mess, add some free DLC (like at least 2 towns as apology for this) and drop price to 20 dolars, I would say ok buy it.
<br>At current state it feels, looks and plays like 5 dolar indie game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5526209">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s such a shame since the lore they created for the new reboot is actually interesting and I was curious to learn more. However there are corrupted saves, crashes, campaign progress lost and glitches that prevents you from winning a map in the campaign. Multi-player isn&apos;t even working at all. Shame on you Ubisoft. If you can&apos;t even fix the single player campaign after almost a month after launch then you don&apos;t deserve any future business from your customer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5624596">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is still in early development state, it is basically an alpha version: there is missing content, there are placeholders, there is no general style, there are lacks in design, some level are just sketches. And bugs... there are so many bugs you can not often play.
<br>This is not a totally new game, it has reused all assets they could from Heroes VI: units, buildings, resources, music, sounds, UI, illustrations - there is not a single moment when you are not watching at least few assets from previous game.
<br>This game has moved the series backward in very bad meaning. All good ideas from Heroes IV to VI are gone, but the game is still nothing like Heroes II or III. They get rid of most units abilities, so most of the differ only by few statistic points. They have limited a role of a hero on a battlefield. They have flatten all strategic layer of the game.
<br>Playing in hot-seat with a friend was annoying because of bugs and boring because there is no depth. Playing campaigns was terrible, because of uneven level of completion of each scenario, really bad voice acting and horrible cutscenes.
<br>If you are a diehard Heroes fan (like me) do not buy this game. If you simply can not resist wait at least for 2 expansions and buy it on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5615678">Expand</a></span>

Combat is fun, but the AI is slightly.... uhm... bad. From a 7th game in the series you can easily expect some better AI. At least make it better than the units running either directly at you or doing some weird &quot;staying out of melee-range&quot; movements while they are being attacked by ranged units only. These are basic AI,-issues which can be fixed relatively easy. I don&apos;t expect it to have in-depth militairy tactics, but come-on... This is not even an AI, this is just following procedure.
<br>
<br>In addition, the release-version has quite a few bugs. While I expected as much from a Ubisoft released game, it is still bad to see them not improving this crap. I am happy I got a pirated version, since I cannot stand uplay and will never ever install it on my PC, not even if I can play games for free. This prevented some issues for me, which legit used actually have.
<br>
<br>Nontheless, the game plays solid and has a lot of variety between units and factions. Combat is fun on harder difficulties (less steamrolling) and the campaign plays nice. If the release wasn&apos;t this buggy the game would have been an 8, but Ubisoft is greedy as always.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519175">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I usually prefer constructive reviews but this game simply is not worth one. It is my worst experience so far in PC gaming ever. I would barely pay 5$ for it. I have always defended the game producer companies, especially EA games and Ubisoft who has gotten so much slack lately, but with this I am speechless. It is that bad.</span>

<br>
<br>And sure, Ubisoft policy - let&apos;s blame the fans. Who cares about bugs, boring story, ruined gameplay. Let&apos;s pretend everything is fine and blame fans. &quot;They are too hardcore&quot;. &quot; They are too conservative&quot;. &quot;We cant improve the game under all this pressure&quot;. Well - if you cant may be you should sell whole HoMM franchise. Cause right now - you are about to bury it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5537094">Expand</a></span>

The balance in this game seems completely out of whack, as if all the play testing was done by people who were expert players in every previous game in the series over the last 20 years.

<br>- texture is a bit too gray, doesnt generate excitement or give a shadowy feel to the atomosphere. just feels unpolished. UI
<br>- some poor typsetting, no consideration given to style, some are just too big.
<br>- skill system unimpressive
<br>- resource system improved but for an old fan like me still doesnt satisfy. only two resource types of special resources - minerals and crystals. the original ones felt better suited to the game world and environment.
<br>- very poor introduction
<br>- no replay function for the intro scenes when you click the campaign button for the very first time. the audio replay for the first scenario brief just flat out didnt work, maybe in a particular circumstances only havent bothered to find out.
<br>
<br>still the core game play is still there. story is probably ok. so its passable. just really nothing spetacular. if you played heroes 6 or 5 this game very likely will feel vastly inferior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5538154">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Top-to-bottom the biggest flaw is a lack of depth in all areas; combat, customization, skills, magic, heroes, story, maps, itemization, resources, and quests. All of the above needed to get about twice as much work as it was given. On top of that, the camera interface is a frustrating mess.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>- Graphics.
<br>- Quantity of gameplay.
<br>- Resource balance
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>- Cookie-cut Heroes/Units/Enemies/Towns
<br>- Bugs &amp; Coding
<br>- Unfriendly Interfaces
<br>- Customization

There&apos;s a good variety of units and some interesting tactical options. Limbic has been cranking out the patches at a rapid pace, and the game is a lot more stable than it was.
<br>
<br>However, I can&apos;t give it more than a 4 right now, largely because of the AI - which is pathetic. Truly, truly pathetic. Playing skirmish mode against the computer, I have literally never lost a game of MMH7, even with the difficulty cranked up to maximum. Every single game goes: I kill a bunch of neutrals. I level up my hero and build my army. The AI players sit around and don&apos;t come near me. I roll over them and win. Rinse and repeat. I&apos;ve quit playing because there&apos;s no challenge.
<br>
<br>I gather that Limbic is trying to avoid giving the AIs cheats. That&apos;s great in principle, but in practice it&apos;s dumb, because no game developer in the history of computer games has ever succeeded in creating AI smart enough to challenge a skilled human player. Smart developers recognize their own limits and provide cheats where necessary to compensate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5845661">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like the over-all look of the game, it&apos;s more similar to Heroes V which makes it easier to understand for me. Levelling the heroes was a bit confusing, but eventually I understood how it works. I like the new town building system. Al turns were very long in the beta version. The music in-between turns is a bit strange, it felt a little bit like circus music, too happy and not dramatic enough. I like the 3D towns in HoMM V, a bit disappointed they didn&apos;t bring it back. But considering all that, the game is better than I expected and I enjoyed playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519662">Expand</a></span>

Hero skillwheel, thats not chance based, is a nice addition. Even though Heroes 6 had a similar system, this is more like Heroes5 and makes more sense. Using Uplay to play this game is not (and should not be) a negative factor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519625">Expand</a></span>

<br>Strategically Heroes 7 has a lot of choices, and you can actually strategize to choose mutually exclusive buildings, or organize your battle to utilize unit abilities to the max.  There are building choices you can make that lock out other buildings, so you can maximize what fits best against your enemy or what fits your hero abilities best.
<br>
<br>Hero leveling is also done very nicely, and the way you can level them up differs a lot... whether you go for exploration, economy, battle, magic, morale, destiny, etc.  You can try to prioritize high morale, and extra mobility, or you can go for normal attack and defense... I personally find it very satisfying playing this game... hands down more than Heroes 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5519490">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Really nice Graphics: The world, creatures and castles look better.
<br>+ New combat elements: Strategic features.
<br>+ Great OST.
<br>
<br>- Some animations look unpolished (not to mention the frozen conversations between characters.. Weird )
<br>- LOT of bugs need fixing.
<br>- Too expensive.
<br>- Combat could be repetitive, but I always had this opinion since heroes V

<br>In conclusion, the game is NOT that bad, is NOT at the level of Heroes 3 but its definitety better than HVI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5520911">Expand</a></span>

<br>I liked ability to flank the enemies in combats, it really adds some depth to them. Adventure maps are different from H3 and I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a bad thing.
