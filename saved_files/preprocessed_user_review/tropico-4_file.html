                                        <span>Tropico 3.2 imo.  Personally I find this game way too easy, there is no question of whether you can make a successful island, it&apos;s just a question of will it be great, or will it be awesome.  Even on some of the hardest settings you can pretty much make a few sugar farms and have infinite money for the rest of the game.</span>

The Modern Times expansion adds tons of new content.  I honestly have no complaints worth mentioning. 10/10</span>

I think this game is fantastic, the missions are diversified and the good old Tropico feeling is back! Personally, I don&apos;t care if there are only minor updates to Tropico 3 because I never owned that.</span>

Tropico is a pretty fun city-building game. It&apos;s not as in-depth as Sim City but still manages to be entertaining. There are campaign missions that change up things and offer you objectives to complete which can be relatively challenging at times and was quite fun to play. There is also a sandbox mode which you can just build your city any way you want. Unfortunately there is a required time limit to all games, even sandbox. So if you were hoping to cover an entire island in buildings like I was, you will be a bit disappointed. Overall I enjoyed it, I recommend trying the demo on Steam if you are interested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3124153">Expand</a></span>

Most of the beauty is lost, though, if your computer can&apos;t handle high settings. The music is in the similar grain to 3 but arguably less tiring(tyhough that could be that I haven&apos;t yet played 4 long enough to get sick of the music as with 3)</span>

It doesn&apos;t improve much from Tropico 3, and I feel like it&apos;s easier somehow, you can easily get both communist and capitalist factions to 100% respect; something impossible in Tropico 3. a good little game, but I think that Tropico 3 is still the best in the series.</span>

I am aware that tons of people hate this game due to the similarities it shares with it&apos;s predecessors - mainly because it is pretty much the same game but with a few upgrades. This however, is completely untrue in my opinion...
<br>
<br>Firstly, there are 20 new diverse, unique missions to explore and conquer while gaining the respect of the population of your island. Random events assist in making the game more interesting, while not being so common to disrupt the fun and immensity of the gameplay. The fun, exciting spokespeople for each nation are hilarious to listen to, each with their own personalities and voices (although at times these stereotypes may be considered slightly racist!).
<br>
<br>The graphics of Tropico 4 are roughly the same as those of Tropico 3, but seem more vivid and alive, making your island feel more real. For me, Tropico 4 runs much more smoothly on the same graphical settings (detail = medium) as Tropico 3. There are many things to do in Tropico 4 including the campaign, challenge mode (where you can create maps and play other people&apos;s!), and sandbox mode. Each of these playing styles are fun in their own way, but for me the campaign is the most enjoyable! Lastly, the actual gameplay of constructing and watching over your country is so great and satisfying (especially when you complete a mission!). The menus are greatly improved since Tropico 3, with ease of access in both finding specific buildings and navigating.
<br>
<br>I honestly cannot think of any downfalls to this games besides maybe the fact the missions usually last at least 1-2 hours, but this increases the overall playing time (so you get more for you money, no?).
<br>
<br>Overall, Tropico 4 is most certainly worth purchasing due to it&apos;s fun gameplay, exciting characters and endless playing time and fun factor...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2538393">Expand</a></span>

I thought hard about why the game was less entertaining, for me it&apos;s the fact that you spend so much time waiting. Rather than instantly building things which have an effect on the game you have to constantly wait for builders to get to the spot, immigrants to get to the island, etc etc. The game is a huge waiting fest that slows down fast paced gamers who know what they want to do and want it done right away. However it&apos;s still an enjoyable game, for the reason that it&apos;s delightfully humoristic, well done and innovative in some ways for a city building game (love the way you can issue laws), complete and quality title. The missions keep you busy enough not to get bored by the repetition. All in all, it&apos;s not the best tycoon to spend time on if you have played better ones, maybe if you are uneducated about games you&apos;ll rate this a 10, because you&apos;re dumb, but as for I, I can fairly rate it a 7, which is actually pretty good, I think this game is definitely worth a try and you will have fun despite not being anything spectacular.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540369">Expand</a></span>

I think it&apos;s stupid people rate this game so low just because it is similar to the previous one even though they love Tropico 3. I get that they are disappointed but it still remains a fun game.</span>

Not a great game but good enough to keep any one interested in city building, economic management and resource collection engaged for hours at a time. The biggest pros of Tropico 4 are its citizens, its political factions and the detailed economic system created by its developers.
<br>
<br>The complexity of the individual citizens that live on your island is quite impressive. Unlike other similar games such as Sim City or Anno, every citizen in Tropico 4 has a unique name, skill set, political inclination, age, home country, job experience, etc. I love the the richness and detail of this element of the game for it makes the micro level of Tropico 4 realistic and engaging. At the macro level the various political factions that must be navigated and addressed hinge upon the preferences and character of your citizens. The balance of this aspect of the game is well developed. For every action in the game, there is an equal an opposite reaction. This keeps the game fun and challenging, and makes it very goal driven which appeals to players such as myself. Perhaps the most important pro is the elaborate and diverse economic system that undergirds the game as a whole. It is refined and intuitive. If it were not the game would suffer greatly and likely be very frustrating to play. Although it is not as extraordinarily complex as some other virtual economies I have seen, it is intricate and realistic enough to suck you in and make you feel like you are accomplishing something meaningful. The resource diversity is exciting, the supply lines are challenging and the financial calculus that stems from all of this resource management is sensible and addictive.
<br>
<br>As a side note I must also compliment the humor of the game, which is apparently a legacy of the series, the unique premise of the game (which also harkens back to its legacy) and the graphics which are a little corny but detailed enough to make the game feel real. Admittedly, what really makes Tropico 4 a pleasure to play are the little things. E.g. the political quotes that pop up between screens, the ability to customize and control yourself as an avatar presidente within the game or to choose from historical characters towards the same ends; The graffiti that appears on the walls of your buildings or the snakes and tapirs that occasionally wander through your jungles, and the resource pallets that pile up at your industrial sites. All of these things give the game character.
<br>
<br>On the cons side of things I must admit that the same little things that make the game so great are also its main shortcoming. There are little things in Tropico 4 which I find very annoying that could be very easily addressed if the developers cared to do so. For instance, there is no North button which aligns the mini map with the onscreen view. This drives me crazy! I spend the first minute or so of every game just trying to line up my view with the mini map. Very frustrating. Also, many of the menus in the game are simple to the point of being primitive. The build menu is a good case in point. First off, accessing the build menu is somewhat counter intuitive for it only appears when you right-click. Then, once you are in the build menu, navigating to buildings is a total pain because the subsets don&apos;t have back buttons. If you click the wrong building subset or are trying to find a new building and don&apos;t know where it is then you have to exit and re-enter the menu every time!  For those new to the game, such as myself, I wish there was an info box option for certain game features. Again, using buildings as an example, when a mission requests that you construct a certain building there is no hint as to where you can find it in your menu so you have to make lucky guesses and go through the whole process of entering and exiting the build menu as mentioned above. Perhaps I am just nitpicking at this point but I really wish there was a shift button option for certain actions such as late game management with air conditioning or upgrades to mines, ranches or manufacturing buildings. Instead of going to each building individually and upgrading it manually, it would be nice to hit the upgrade once while holding down a hot key so that the same action applies to all.
<br>
<br>Besides the little things, the two main cons of the game in my opinion are the campaign which lacks depth and is somewhat monotonous, and the music which although good in quality becomes very repetitive after a while. This is because it is catchy (seemingly a good thing in real life, but not for a computer game) and because it is on a short loop.
<br>
<br>All in all, although there are a lot of little things that I dislike about Tropico 4 because there is so much right with it as a whole that I have to give a favorable review. I give it an 8/10.

The aesthetics and graphical improvements are beautiful. It doesn&apos;t have the same performance issues as Tropico 3, nor is the interface as clunky. The series really hasn&apos;t evolved since the original Tropico release however, but the improvements have been immense. For anyone who played SimCity Societies and was justifiably outraged at the terrible gameplay, I think Tropico 4 is a great place to pick up after SimCity 4. The game is very polished, level design thoughtful, music enjoyable, appropriately absurd (while still encouraging some thought with fantastic quotes), and has fairly balanced mechanics. After essentially using the same formula for decade, I wouldn&apos;t expect any less. Managing building placement is particularly enjoyable, as efficiency can be dramatically reduced if you build too many intersections on your road or try to have a massive hub of activity in the center of the island. Producing an island which efficiently imports, exports, and shuffles around resources feels very rewarding. The only major complaint I have is the game&apos;s too easy. It&apos;s very time-consuming to complete missions, but generally never easy to fail at. You also don&apos;t often have to be at the computer after you&apos;ve planned a huge list of building projects except to choose how to handle random events. The mechanics require some thought, but after you&apos;ve experimented for a couple hours, it&apos;s difficult to continue improving strategy. There&apos;s also no end-game content I found enjoyable, which seems strange for a city management simulator.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782580">Expand</a></span>

They stayed very loyal to the original concept and added a few improvements and additional options, but in some ways it seems like they could have done a lot more and so it feel more like a really good expansion rather than a full-blooded sequel.</span>

If anything, I&apos;d say the graphics are about the same, but they&apos;re optimized. The visuals are cleaner, and don&apos;t lag like they did in three.

New npc&apos;s will issue the will of their faction and will let you know how they will react if you decide to do one thing over the other. Buildings like the Academy of Science can clone you in case of a lethal incident, and weather stations can protect you from natural disasters. Yet despite the changes, it still feels like Tropico 3, and a major complaint many people share is that this game feels like Tropico 3.5. The game certainly does feel more fleshed out, and I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to call it Tropico 3.5, but it still feels like they could have done more. Sure crime is more visible, but it still feels as invisible as pollution. Having the npc criminals run around and actually rob someone would have been a nice touch, for example. It&apos;s the little things that Tropico 4 is still lacking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1738883">Expand</a></span>

There are a few new aspects to the game, which make it even more enjoyable to me. I will recommend this game to everyone who asks about it.</span>

Though do miss certain radio DJs, the new features more than make up for it. For example the new disasters are features you will definitely want to leave turned on, they are just so cool. The fire station is not just eye candy, you actually need it, especially when the volcano erupts. Its never as bad as it sounds but looks pretty awesome in the game. The new features appear to work well and are best described as a nice think layer of coolness that lays over Tropico 3, taking Tropico 4 to a whole new level. I always thought Tropico 3 lacked the buildings to make it an island holiday resort, well there are lots to choose from now. I also thought the islands where a little small in Tropico 3, they are huge now.  There is so much more to Tropico 4 than many here have made out, it is pretty clear to me that the reviews claiming it looks like Tropico 3 are from people who have not played it for more than 2 hours. When I get the chance I&apos;ll make a Youtube video of the game and prove my point to you all. In the mean time, this is worth getting even if you own Tropico 3 and Absolute power, trust me, its cool :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1738968">Expand</a></span>

Contains a nice campaign with 20 missions (but only 10 unique maps). However compared to Tropico 3 this game offers almost nothing new and is more like an expansion. If you own Tropico 3, don&apos;t bother wasting money on this.</span>

But gameplay still awesome, more buildings, tasks are much better organized, performance geatly improved, disasters, ministers. Same good old Tropico, but better and faster.

Tropico 4 is a bit of an oddity in this sense however, as it introduces very little new to the series in terms of both gameplay and style.<br><br>Tropico 4 has added about 15 buildings, larger island sizes, and ministers to the game, and reworked a bit of the graphics to actually look less detailed then it&apos;s predecessor. But for every change they added, there&apos;s a crippling countermeasure for every boasted change. Larger map sizes for example - they have increased the size of maps, yet they still implement rock cliffs on up to 60% of your island so while you may have a larger map, you still cannot build effectively on most of these large maps. The variety is also sadly lackluster still. Recycled textures from Tropico 3, and the lack of variety in buildings is still puzzling at how they can market this as a sequel and not as an expansion pack. For example, houses in the game still have the same old boring texture, and unlike apartments or tenements, don&apos;t have any alternate textures for variety&apos;s sake. Sandbox maps are also sparse, as you get about 3 easy maps, 1 medium map, and 5 or 6 hard maps. It&apos;s almost as if by some crazy edict, El Presidente himself wanted this game to be bland, flat, and to use everything from Tropico 3. Another final point would be the moddability. There&apos;s been significant calls for greater moddability within the Tropico community, and the map editor is still embarrassingly bare bones, and those who want to mod and make the game better for the community still cannot really do so.<br><br>Aside from those flaws, Tropico 4 still has some defining features. A great soundtrack as always, a nicer  user interface, and twitter/facebook integration (if that even matters) are some nicer features of the game. But Haemimont seemed to just wing it on continuing to make the series innovative style and gameplay-wise.<br><br>As a previous user stated, this feels more like Tropico 3.5 then Tropico 4, and for the price, it certainly doesn&apos;t push the envelope on the series. If you&apos;re new to the series; consider this game, but if you&apos;ve played either past Tropico games, stick with Tropico 3 Gold Edition - you won&apos;t feel so cheated by El Presidente.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1738785">Expand</a></span>

Resolving their conflict with your government is your task. Very realistic indeed. On the other hand, the citizen simulation is good, they really have a living place (unless you make them change by your politic means) and working place (will also vary according to your economy and his/her job satisfaction), you can really feel an alive person when observing them close by, i.e. not a random variable just like 1 &quot;famous game&quot;. This game has a good sense of humor and a great simulation, which needs strategic planning. The design of your own avatar is also one key way of your success, depending on your play style. Really worth a try on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3074851">Expand</a></span>

At first I was very pleased with the new layout, music, etc...  However, I was soon disappointed in the graphics.  My CPU is not state of the art and despite what I have read, the graphics on Medium and High settings are more then it can handle.  I can run the game at a custom settings with a lot of the &quot;extras&quot; turned off and it looks okay but Tropico 3 looks better and runs smoother given the same equipment.  On low settings everything looks blurry.
<br>
<br>I actually play the game on Medium speed due to everything going on.  There are A LOT of side quests that pop-up constantly.  Its not bad but I feel it takes away from the actual main mission which you may not know until well into the scenario.  The &quot;Quick Build&quot; option is a nice feature when all of a sudden you realize there are a lot of shacks on the island.  If you don&apos;t watch your population you can easily lose the respect of the Communists due to crappy housing and healthcare.  Make sure you have your ministry set up and a foreign advisor hired.  Then click on the edict for USSR help with half priced Tenements and Apartments.
<br>
<br>Side quests are both fun and annoying.  Sometimes a quest will pop-up and the US or USSR will ask for some money to improve relations.  Not a problem except you can&apos;t (to my knowledge) check to see what your faction rating is at that point...  Kind of annoying when you send the US 5 grand for an improvement in faction when you are already at 100.
<br>
<br>Tropico 4 moves in a direction that unfortunatly a lot of games go now a days.  It tries to cram in as much crap into a shorter scenario.  Its as if they are making games for people with short attention spans.  As an older gamer, I don&apos;t mind if it takes awhile as long as I don&apos;t have to juggle 15 different things at the same.  That gets annoying.
<br>
<br>Maybe when I decide to upgrade my Computer, I will be able to enjoy Tropico 4 to its fullest.  Right now it is average/good at best.  I am still a fan and maybe just need to get acquainted to a faster paced game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742011">Expand</a></span>

But the campaign isn&apos;t that thrilling, very soon it becomes ad un-sharp and chaotic achievement party; they even introduced twitter and facebook plugins to share your results (as if someone care). I believe it&apos;s a little easier than tropico 3 too: i believe the title was subject to some minor rebalancing that eventually made the game more plain: everything could be solved with the same strategy. Even graphics looks a little messier than before. So why a 7 and not a 6? because the game is still fun. I&apos;ve spent some funny hours, and i will spend more. I suggest you not to buy this until drops to something like 20 eurodollars or so (really, this is more a really good expansion than a new game)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1794922">Expand</a></span>

If you were into Tropico 3, I guarantee part 4 will bore you within 10 minutes. The screens tell the truth - and because it looks a lot like Tropico 3, means it&apos;s pretty much the same thing, slightly re-freshened and repacked to make you think it&apos;s brand new.<br>I suppose it&apos;s the limit for the makers. A huge let-down. Hence the zero.

Even when the option is ticked, freeplay games are not autosaved which causes huge frustration. Even then, in challenge mode, autosave saves so far apart that if you crash it feels like restarting anyway. Furthermore the menus including the bottom left controls take up most of the screen. They should be made small on user choice and if the user chooses, be &apos;minimizable&apos; to a small tab on the bottom, similar to the Windows interface. This is really frustrating. How could the developers lack such obvious continuity features, yet make general gameplay pretty good?

The developers have really done the whole el presidente thing quite well and everything from the radio show that talk about your actions and your interactions with the island and your advisers just oozes charm. The management part of the game works alright. There is plenty of buildings, edicts and options to play around with but it lacks depth and i found myself doing most stuff simply for my own amusement than for the good of the island. So i am basically saying that the game could be a bit more challenging. Now the elephant in the room that i really should mention is that the game is quite similar to the previous Tropico 3. This wont matter if you are new to the series but if you have played tropico 3 and are expecting a whole new experience then you will be disappointed. And i should also mention that the builders are still a pain in the ass to deal with. Tropico 4 is a decent little management game that relies heavily on its charm and as long as you dont expect the world out of it (or a game vastly different than tropico 3) then you probably wont be disappointed by this game. You should however consider picking up the tropico 3 instead if you find it for a much cheaper price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2975764">Expand</a></span>

The buildings are mostly the same and the gameplay mechanics haven&apos;t changed. However, the graphics are a bit better and it doesn&apos;t take a top-of-the-line PC to get everything maxed. My PC was about $1000 for the main components (CPU, GPU, mobo, ram, harddrive) when I built it 4 years ago and I can max everything and have a flawless framerate.<br><br>The game does make improvements though, the base of the game is still great and it is asinine for anyone to rate this lower than a 5. Some changes include a more storyline-based campaign. There are not cutscenes or anything, but each island is placed within an overarching vision in the backstory. Also, there are unique events that occur that mix things up more, like feuds between the Communists and Capitalists or specific islands that are, for example, especially rebellious and resistant to rulership with their own unique native characters.<br><br>If you beat Tropico 3, don&apos;t bother with this game- unless you&apos;re extremely into the series like myself. There are plenty of other, more unique games out there to experience. However, if you&apos;ve never played a Tropico game before, this is the one to play. This game would be rated an 8 for people new to the series, a 5 for people who&apos;ve beat Tropico 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2148953">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is a quick rehash of the Tropico series, nothing revolutionary. The campaign feels kinda cheap with islands being reused in different chapters. There are also quite serious traffic issues when you get to higher populations, but the game offers zero tools to influence traffic.</span>

There many missions in the game each leading to an in-depth story. You will find it hard to keep up with the building process at times, while at others it can take a while for things to progress. The game is to similar to Tropico 3 for me to give it a higher rating though.</span>

On the surface it will trick a player that is not paying attention. The more you dig into things you begin to realize how much thought actually went into this. Tropico 3 is of course awesome and I would have been upset had they deviated too far from the original formula. A good example would be my love for Civ IV BTS. When Civ V came out using a new formula I was heart broken. My shock from that fallout led me to this diamond in the rough. Once you really get into this game you&apos;ll need a well built gaming machine. I&apos;m here to tell you folks this game right here is hardcore it is not the candy coated shell that you might believe. The modding community is beginning to form, and El Presidente is taking over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=1972346">Expand</a></span>

This game makes minor changes to the GUI, but in terms of appearance, it&apos;s mostly the same as Tropico 3. However, the game-play has been improved dramatically in my opinion. The road system is much better implemented, the council of ministers works very well, the 20 added buildings are all good for the most part, and to top it off, the radio show in this game is FAR less annoying than Jaunito or Betty ever were. The humor is much improved, and the blandness of parts of Tropico 3 have been done away with; their is always something happening. The addition of advisers for each faction, each with unique personalities and decent advice is also a plus. The biggest addition, however, is the 20 mission campaign, which unlike the previous games, is a single cohesive narrative that is entertaining and quite funny. Overall, this game is a big step up from Tropico 3, even if it might look the same. The only real downside is that the El Presidente voice actor is very lame, and puts emphasis on the entirely wrong parts of sentences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=2078120">Expand</a></span>

This, however is a perfectly crafted game, with addictive gameplay, a great atmosphere, and the best music in any strategy game I&apos;ve ever heard. Highly recommended.</span>

<br>The added help of the map editor allows those who are good with some scripting to make their own missions and upload them for others to play. If you are a die hard RTS player then you will never be put off with this game. Even 3 months after I finished the game, you can still go go back and play and get thoroughly engrossed into the game again.
<br>
<br>Well worth the money....Tropico 5 is in production and Kalypso have said they are start the graphics from scratch.

<br>You must survive after 50 years of tyranny.
<br>In first, the content of the game
<br>The campaign is long, with hard constraints (but we will see after that&apos;s not really hard). And after you can try the community&apos;s challenge. Or a custom sandbox with adjustable difficulty. So the life span as long as your desire to become El presidente.
<br>
<br>Now, the gameplay. The main goal is to survive, against elections (too easy for the fraud), against the rebels, the insurrections, the putsch or survive against USA or URSS. You must satisfy the citizens, they are communist, ecologist, religious.... Because if they angry, they hate presidente. And you must build building or industries for have more and more money, with exports or tourism. Mine, farm, bank, all means are good and after, with the Dollards, you can build a mausoleum (loyalists love that) or invest to your Swiss Counts or a church.....
<br>
<br>The only problem or this game is the fiancial difficulties  absent at the long term (in-game, the 1980&apos;decade).
<br>You win too much money with industry and planting, the only limitation is the lack of labors.
<br>But with money, you can pay everything, 10 hospital or 10 churchs (everyone is satisfied) or cops and military for kill rebels, too easy to survive after 30 years in-game. And the decree destroy opposition (the spy too).
<br>And the requirement of our people doesn&apos;t increase significantly.
<br>After the end of URSS with the miracle of the capitalism, people wants the pretty life and doesn&apos;t want live with 10 Dollards per mouth. This is possible to transcribe this.
<br>
<br>For the conclusion A party in campaign or in sandbox give you the happiness to kill opposants with difficulties, but at the long-term, you have more money than you can spend.
<br>
<br>But the game stay pleasurable and you will enjoy that.

The game itself is very smooth, the objectives add some sort of &quot;Here, try to get this at your leisure&quot; element, and all the construction projects feel that they have some sort of purpose to them. While there are some elements that I wish could be added or changed, such as perhaps a difficulty increase, or an option to set zones instead of actual buildings in some cases (think Sim City vs Sim Town style of construction), but overall, the game has been very enjoyable and it is worth the cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3282250">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics in Tropico 4 are wonderful, the city building is very often limited by landscape but you can do curves, long roads in the nature, and many options to make your city different in each gameplay. It is a city builder with all the classic bits, making money, providing electricity, services, but then there is the background. Tropico happens during the Cold War and you&apos;ll have to bear with it, and make decisions that could end up with your nice peaceful city being invaded by the US army
<br>
<br>Another good point : the happy salsa music. If you don&apos;t like it, you might not enjoy yourself, but it is very entertaining while you&apos;re slowly building your city. Only 12-13 songs though, you might end up dreaming about the songs if you&apos;re not careful
<br>
<br>Now the 3 was already good, the 4 was the same, and the 5 is again.. the same. No improvement justifying buying the 3 versions.
<br>
<br>Conclusion : Genius idea, over-used in the long term, and prepare yourself to a butt-dance session on your chair</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296653">Expand</a></span>

<br>That said, this game is marvelous. Unlike almost every city-builder game out there, your goal is not to build a successful city/country but to do anything you can to rule on it and keep doing it surviving elections, coup d&apos;etat, riots, etc.
<br>
<br>Graphic is really good, music feels like Buena Vista Social Club (which means awesome), actual game mechanics and enjoyment are flawless.
<br>
<br>What this game lacks (and I can&apos;t really say exactly why) is longevity, after 3 cities I felt like I had no reasons to build the 4th one... still I&apos;d like to recommend this game to almost everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5074687">Expand</a></span>
