You are given the false impression of something new and exciting; Unfortunately, it only lasts for about 20 minutes or so before you realize you&apos;re just running on a treadmill of combat and pointless dialogue. Once you wake up to the fact that that the full heath and ammo checkpoints make for an easy and hollow combat experience, you lose interest real fast, and it becomes a boring grind to simply get it over with. The ONLY reason to complete OA is for the indestructible power armour at the very end (or possibly the Chinese stealth armour if you care about stealth gameplay). If it&apos;s experience points you&apos;re after, your time could be much better spent elsewhere. The combat might be a welcomed relief if it weren&apos;t so repetitive. The fact that you can&apos;t take anything you find in the simulator back into the regular game, and the complete lack of karma and dialogue choices completely removes the RPG side of the game (a part that makes FO3 so awesome). In short, there&apos;s really no reason to play this expansion except to say that you did it and retrieve the rewards at the end and move on. Definitely a disappointing experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3---operation-anchorage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1406184">Expand</a></span>

Throw-away DLC nothings, most of which should have been in the game in the FIRST place (you know, letting you play after that crap main quest)? Thank god I pirated it.</span>

The fighting just got really old after a while, I mean the first encounter with the stealthed dragoon guys was pretty cool, but, when you kept running around corners into stealthed snipers just sitting around, it got really old. I didn&apos;t even get 3 hours out of this, I was done in about 30 minutes or so. There was no real excitement after the first few minutes, just walking up to a corner and going &apos;I bet a flamer troop is gonna come around there.........yep&apos;. The only real weapon loadout to use that was any good was the sniper pack as a missle launcher and a pistol was useless since you fight one unit that you really need missles for (actually, the Chimera goes down pretty easy without it); an assalt rifle which is also useless as just about all enemies are all stealthed with snipers sitting on rocks; and close combat was useless for the same reason. It was weird the way enemy stealth units would just sit and watch until you shot them to attack you, even as you were slaughtering their buddies and they had perfect shots lined up. The end was stupid, everyone just gets into a rumble over whether I got to take any of the useless crap in the armory, didn&apos;t even give me a chance to say &apos;no thank you, I&apos;ll just be on my way&apos;. 5/10 for being somewhat enjoyable at the beginning. Though I wonder when Bethesda will let us climb like that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3---operation-anchorage/user-reviews?user_review_id=422833">Expand</a></span>

At first it shows promise by giving you a self-selected team and restricted equipment, then it turns out the game is so short you barely get to use them. The OA missions are boring and linear, even though stealthed enemies are a nice distraction. By itself, it would earn a rating of 3/10. The real value is in the items received after the simulation, however. A weapon that knocks down enemies, a sword that destroys most of them and a steal armour making the required critical hits much easier to get turn you into a killing machine. Being able to simply walk past enemies is also very nice, and gives you more options to play the game (a la Deus Ex). On top of this you get several other goodies, including special power armour and the training to use it which normally happens 2/3rds into the main quest. Nice. In summary, a poor set of missions but a brilliant addition to Fallout 3 itself. 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3---operation-anchorage/user-reviews?user_review_id=424348">Expand</a></span>

It keeps me wondering did the developers know that they are not making a DLC for first person shooter.  Operation anchorage is fallout 3 without any kind of role playing elements, characters or anything else which makes fallout 3 to be fallout. It tries to be some kind of FPS action game based on war against China at Alaska. The story in this DLC is very stupid and unconvincing. I have to say that fallout 3 is not optimal game to turn into FPS. Everything just feels so old and all modern FPS standards are thrown into garbage bin.. After you complete the Operation Anchorage you get some overpowered equipment which makes your character way too powerful against the other enemies. If you can avoid this DLC at any costs, it almost ruins the whole game. I cannot get anything good into my mind about this DLC&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3---operation-anchorage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1695282">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the DLC seems to attempt to emphasize the FPS elements of Fallout 3, which are in my opinion one of its weaknesses. In fact, the DLC overall was very reminiscent to an old-school FPS. Relatively linear, find ammo caches and health pickups, and there&apos;s even 10 collectible &quot;intels&quot;. For FPS gameplay, Fallout 3 is not the game you want to be playing. Still, something kept me coming back. No characters stood out to me as being overly interesting, but I think the overall map and locations within the DLC were interesting and nice to explore, relative to Fallout 3 visuals that is. Still, the DLC was only a few hours total, if it was anymore than that I would probably have a more negative opinion. I wouldn&apos;t really say that this DLC is good or bad, it just is. Give it a play if you are bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3---operation-anchorage/user-reviews?user_review_id=7418394">Expand</a></span>

The story is unique but rather dull and linear, the character development is very poor, and there isn&apos;t much of a challenge whatsoever. The positives are the rewards and that is it, trust me you will forget about this whole DLC and just love the rewards that you receive at the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3---operation-anchorage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938532">Expand</a></span>

<br>Want to know why I don&apos;t rate it 0 ? Because I like the outcasts outpost as my new home, and because at last some opponents use sneaking tactics against me (who sneaks the entire game.)</span>
