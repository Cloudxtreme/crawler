There is a complete lack of checkpoint/save system so when you get to the longer levels later in the game, you may die on the very end of the puzzle and then have to start all the way at the beginning again. You&apos;ll forget one of the tricks you have to do at the beginning because that was five minutes ago, die there, have to start over again, and it just becomes immensely frustrating. There is also quite poor programming on the movement of Hamilton. The puzzles are block based so you can only move 1 block at a time, but if you move onto an elevator, or other moving platform, early enough for the game to think you got on, but late enough that you don&apos;t get fully on, you will clip through the platform and &quot;die.&quot; Just another frustrating bug due to poor programming. The biggest flaw with this game, however, is the AI of your bird companion. It has basically no AI at all. It moves in a direct line to where you click, running into walls, unable to find its way around them. It&apos;s actually quite comical as the game says that your bird is highly intelligent, yet it is actually the furthest thing from intelligent AI. On the other hand, the level design, graphics, and music/sounds are all fantastic. The story is told through comics, which is pretty lame, but nonetheless the game was quite fun at times as long as you take it slow and don&apos;t really care about getting a &quot;gold&quot; rating on all the levels. Pick it up for $2.50 or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hamiltons-great-adventure/user-reviews?user_review_id=3061578">Expand</a></span>

Not only does it have some fun (and hard) platforming puzzles, but it has a very endearing story to boot. Likewise, the art design is fabulous and the 3D graphics are crisp and detailed. I highly recommend this game to all the intellectual explorers out there!</span>

You also get that - when you think about it - awesome feel when you struggle and struggle to get a gold medal, and you finally get it . Trust me, once you start playing this game, you wont  be satisfied with a silver medal, no matter what level.</span>
