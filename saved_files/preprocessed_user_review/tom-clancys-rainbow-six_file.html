Back when I actually had a subscription to a gaming magazine (God, those were the days...) this preview for a game based on a Tom Clancy novel immediately caught my attention. I had gotten plenty bored of Quake 2 and was restless for something different and unique. The ultra-realistic gameplay of Rainbow Six fit to a T. Still, my computer at that time was unable to meet the minimum requirements for R6, so it would take a couple months before I actually got into it. But get into it I did, with a passion that now seems somewhat inhuman. I lovingly outfitted each operative with different weapons, carefully mapped out their mission routes and held my breath as they soldiered out to take down the terrorists and rescue the hapless hostages. Of course, on more then one occasion the entire operation would turn into a fiasco with multiple casualties and hostages gunned down. Alas, back to the drawing board.<br><br>But multiplayer was where Rainbow Six really shined. Freed of the cumbersome AI, it was amazing to encounter a situation where you could be taken out by the opposing team in just one or two bullets. The added lethality of the weapons and the reduced margin of error made for the most amazingly tense multiplayer matches ever. Rogue Spear, the sequel which I bought on opening day was much more of the same. I have to be honest, Rogue Spear multiplayer devoured my life throughout 4 years of high school and doubtless contributed to the fact that my GPA suffered and I never had a girlfriend. Oh well, it seemed worth it, that&apos;s just how obsessed I was with the game. Even outside the game itself, I posted frequently on RSE&apos;s (the maker of R6) forums and made quite a few memorable friends, who later formed their own personal forum at planb3.com. Rainbow Six is truly an immense chunk of my life and I have nothing but fond memories to look back on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/user-reviews?user_review_id=1768300">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Rainbow Six was known for 3 core things in an open-world map.
<br>-Planning
<br>-Pacing
<br>-Executing
<br>
<br>REAL DEAL TAC-SIM
<br>The FPS mechanics are slow and tense. It&apos;s exciting because you will die in one hit. Forcing you to really emphasize upon the unpredictable enemies, and the organization of your team. Planning and teamwork are extremely crucial, but the game does not setup these assets for you. Instead you have to plan everything on your own.
<br>
<br>PLAN OR DIE
<br>90% of the time you&apos;ll be stuck on the drawing board. You&apos;ll be switching back-and-forth between planning and  action. The trial-and-error, and the random deployment of the enemies, makes it a satisfying challenge once you get everything right.
<br>
<br>You setup your team and choose their equipment based on the situation. You manage your own snipers, demolitions experts, assault teams and reconnaissance teams
<br>
<br>You manage their orders in the field through a complex waypoint system. At first glance, the whole planning phase will look like a chore. The maps look outdated and blocky, but if you give it time and patience you&apos;ll learn to appreciate it all.
<br>
<br>TRUE OPEN-WORLD GAME
<br>the non-linearity of the planning phase, gives you endless options on how you want to approach missions. The options are vast , you control when your team shoots, breach, and speed of their movement.
<br>
<br>TEAMMATES ARE LIKE DRONES, BUT THEY GET THE JOB DONE
<br>Your AI mates are drones that follow you everywhere you go. They do everything you say specifically and chronologically execute the orders based on the way-points you setup. Sometimes they&apos;ll come to an ad-hoc and that&apos;s when you know you some re-planning needs to be done.
<br>
<br>For a game that&apos;s decades old the game-play already has more &quot;replayability&quot; than Most triple-A titles these days.
<br>
<br>It takes time to appreciate a game that&apos;s not straightforward and a tad complicated, but once you do, you&apos;ll find that R6 is really something special. If you&apos;re new to the series, this will give you an original perspective on the series. You can then understand why allot of fans aren&apos;t too happy on where the series are heading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/user-reviews?user_review_id=5874592">Expand</a></span>
