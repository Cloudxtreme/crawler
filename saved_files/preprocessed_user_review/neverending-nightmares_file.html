I wanted to like this game, I really did, but despite the amazing art style, the experience was mediocre. The tension that culminates while playing through this game is is unfortunately disrupted by its tedium. A few decent jump scares, and the overall creepy aesthetic of the game really help it to salvage a decent score, but the slow gameplay does nothing but create a sense of boredom that ultimately causes it to lose its suspense. By the end you are bored and ready for the experience to be over, though a playthrough will only take about 90 minutes. It does seem to get on the right track near the end, but with the endless walking through the same hallways, listening to the same looping soundtrack causes something to be lost and half way through, you&apos;re ready for it to be over.
<br>
<br>I really wish this game was better, or even worth it, but with the current $15 price tag, it unfortunately is not. If you&apos;re really set on playing this, I suggest waiting for the price to drop as you may be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=4564891">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Here is what Neverending Nightmares does not do well :
<br>
<br>- No story or character development at all. This was extremely disappointing
<br>- Levels unraveling like on an assembly line making them tediously long and repetitive
<br>- Encounters with enemies are trivial at best, they&apos;re there just to give a tiny bit amount of a challenge, nothing more
<br>- I wasn&apos;t motivated in the least to find the different paths to the branching nightmares, the character walks way too slow
<br>- Overpriced
<br>
<br>The potential was there for a great game. If it had more content, real challenges, a well thought out story, it would be a hit, but this was a huge disappointment for me.
<br>
<br>I was curious about this game, the art really got my attention, but it fails on everything else. 5$ price would be alright, but not more.

If you like fast-paced action, obvious story, open-world exploration, or your sanity, please move on, because you will find none of that here. However, for what this game is - an atmospheric horror game with an ambiguous story open to interpretation - it&apos;s fantastic.
<br>
<br>The game is short. There are 4 possible endings, and as of this review, I&apos;ve completed 2 of them with only 2.4 hours on record, and even then there were a few times when I left the keyboard for a few minutes or would intentionally do something stupid just to see what would happen. Your first playthrough will only take about two hours (maybe less), then you can use a waypoint-like system to revisit earlier chapters to get to the other endings. I&apos;m estimating 4-5 hours for completion of all 4 endings (assuming you use a spoiler-free guide to know where the branching points are, like I did).
<br>
<br>The game is very linear. But that&apos;s not always a bad thing. Not every game needs to be an open-world Bethesda behemoth. Linear works great for this game. It&apos;s high tension, and it manages to encourage exploration while still discouraging you from getting too far off the intended path. I won&apos;t explain how - because spoilers - but that&apos;s a tough act to balance, and this game does it without breaking the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>The art is, put simply, evocative. It holds multiple layers of detail. There were countless times when I took a closer look at a scene or a room I&apos;d walked through before and realized the nuances I hadn&apos;t consciously observed prior, but at some level I know I witnessed them unconsciously and they added to the overall atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t even get me started on the soundtrack. Oh my god the soundtrack. I want the soundtrack as a standalone purchase for my horror-themed events. It&apos;s amazing background ambience, and it&apos;s superbly mixed with haunting sound effects to deliver an experience like none other, especially through headphones (the game highly recommends headphones and utilizes a special audio mixer for that immersive experience).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=5071300">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>30 minutes later - i had to quit. - to be relieved to return to my bright windows desktop and fire up some silly youtube video.....
<br>
<br>yea - i have to admit, i was scared. and i am also the kind of person who grabs my friends arms in a suspension movie and claws into him - and who always get caught by a jump-scare.
<br>
<br>soo - with that in mind, this game totally fulfilled its purpose. it is scary and fulfils the 101 of suspense through sound, music and visuals. - using headphones really does a good job there since the low frequencies involve the entire body.
<br>
<br>other than being tense and scary - it offers a pretty unique graphic style and simple controls
<br>
<br>now - i will give the game a 8, because it does what its meant to do in a very stylish and well done manner. but will i try to play it again? - probably not - at least not as it is meant to be played ( meaning, maybe during the day, without headphones .. because i am a coward )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=4562485">Expand</a></span>

<br>&#xA0;
<br>
<br>Well, I&apos;m here to tell you that this game will horrify you in ways you never thought possible.&#xA0; The &quot;Edward Gorey&quot; Styled Imagery will shake you to the bone in ways that no first-person horror experience ever could.&#xA0; You will look at the world in darker shades after experiencing it.&#xA0; The multiple endings will serve to confuse/disturb/fascinate you.&#xA0; You will be analyzing and interpreting this events of this game long after you finish holding a controller.&#xA0; And you will know just how scary interactive gaming can be.
<br>
<br>&#xA0;
<br>
<br>I was lucky enough to play this game before release.&#xA0; It has been 12 hours since I put the game down...and I am still shaken.&#xA0;
<br>
<br>&#xA0;
<br>
<br>This is one of those games that sticks with you long after you put it down.&#xA0; This game will give you Neverending Nightmares.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542005">Expand</a></span>

<br>I did know it was possible to do a proper horror game with such simple 2D graphics but somehow they pulled it off! The gameplay is pretty simple, you just walk around and explore while being scared s***less, it is more about the atmosphere than anything else. Of course I have not finished it yet and it does get a bit repetitive in one part but overall, it is everything I had hoped it would be. It really makes you question your own sanity: did that doll`s eyes just move? Did the wallpaper on behind me suddenly change?

This is not a horror game in any way, shape, or form. I too have suffered with anxiety issues and depression, yet this game doesn&apos;t say anything to me about any of those issues. I feel like it&apos;s just a ploy to get more people to buy into this game, because it really has nothing to do with any mental illness. There are no puzzles to solve, no enemies to kill (just avoid, and there are only 3 or 4 enemies). I did like the art style, but how anyone gives this a 10 I feel are just supporting the developer more than actually rating the game. If you are still interested in buying it, wait for it to go on sale, don&apos;t spend as much as is being asked for. It&apos;s not worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=4568810">Expand</a></span>

<br>But this game is mostly pointless. You&apos;re in a nightmare after another where all you can do is go forward. And the character you play walks too slowly it gets boring so quickly. There are several jump scares here and there but I wasn&apos;t even slightly freaked out by most of them. There are a few monsters but they&apos;re too easy to fool. It looks like there are several different endings to this game but I didn&apos;t bother checking out the rest of them because there was absolutely nothing interesting about the ending I chose.

<br>On a more serious note: as others have said before me, the artstyle is a more uncommon one - and a good one at that. It really gives the game character it otherwise lacks. Apparently there are multiple endings, but to be honest: I did not have the slightest interest in doing all this again. The game might just be around 60 minutes long, but these 60 minutes consist of &gt;95% walking (very slowly) through slightly changing corridors while hoping something unusual will kill you so you can progress the story.
<br>
<br>If you are interested, I&apos;d recommend watch the whole playthrough on youtube (without commenatry)
<br>
<br>I&apos;d give it at least 5 points for what it is: the art and the obligatory kryptic story you are free to interpret from the bits the game throws your way... but 15 Euro on steam? No, thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=4964014">Expand</a></span>

<br>The art style is like pen drawing. The animations are fluid. Using colours on blood and thing that you can interact with is good. The artwork is unique and detailed. Good job on that part!
<br>The sounds are simple yet effective. Ambient noises. Creepy and makes you feel uneasy. But after a while it feels repetitive, just like the level design. You run through the same rooms over and over. I expected changes and more milestones. More distinctive features would have been nice. Sometimes it felt like a labyrinth. At the beginning, I thought it&apos;s an intentional thing, later it became lame and lazy.
<br>The gameplay is easy. You walk you interact, you run. You can run like for 5 seconds. Your character is asthmatic. You need to walk a lot and avoid in overall three types of enemies. I didn&apos;t like it, at the first enemy encounter, the immersion has suddenly eliminated. I found it out of place.
<br>There are disturbing moments and the environment has creepy elements. Also, the game features some jump scares. There are multiple endings. The story itself is simple.
<br>Not a bad game, but it feels rushed. Too bad, it had a lot of potential. It started well, and ended boring. Also it&apos;s a very short game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=5361922">Expand</a></span>

<br>The 3 different kind of enemies are scary with their unique actions and design.

<br>It&apos;s not a game about fighting, or running away from enemies, but one about an increasing sense of discomfort and tension. A deep sensation of wrongness ebbs from it, while you play, thanks to the maze of similar rooms creating confusion and preventing you from ever feel safe, and the masterfully crafted sound effects and music accompanying your actions.
<br>
<br>The most important aspects of this game are its atmosphere and its tone, and those are certainly excellent.

<br>Not surprisingly feels never ending
<br>Never ending nightmares starts out with a dream of you stabbing a girl
<br>thankfully  this is only a dream,
<br>you wake up..
<br>or do you?
<br>You walk through the creepy hallways and doors to meet an end.. only to wake up
<br>or do you?
<br>you do this same thing and wake up&#x2026;
<br>or.. you get the point
<br>this is a never ending nightmare one end leads to a new beginning, and you basically continue this loop until you reach the credits&#x2026;
<br>This game will definitely give you an anxious feeling.. it sets out to do so..
<br>you feel trapped and frustrated.. and not because the game is difficult, but because of the atmosphere.. because of the whining and wheezing your main character does as you run&#x2026;
<br>the unsettling music&#x2026;
<br>There are some threats in the game.. some roided up babies and creepy dolls that will kill you if they catch you.. but if you die you just wake up in the nearest bed&#x2026;
<br>Basically you open doors with knots in your stomach for an hour and a half straight
<br>just to get to 1 of the 3 endings that answer no questions and leave you even more confused&#x2026;
<br>Seeing these 3 endings will add another 45 minutes if you choose to try and take a different path via nightmare select&#x2026;
<br>but youll find this to be quite a drag and a chore coming back to a nearly identical experience..
<br>This is overall my biggest issue with the game..
<br>I understand the idea of a never ending nightmare that loops&#x2026;
<br>but there is far too little change in environment and setting to keep the player engaged&#x2026;
<br>you see the same handful of rooms over and over to be occasionally interrupted by a psych ward, or a forest&#x2026;
<br>I could&#x2019;ve done without the psych ward, but I wish more was done with the forest to change the monotony of the scenery&#x2026;
<br>While Neverending Nightmares definitely feels never ending along your journey..
<br>its still an unsettling experience horror fans may find an odd enjoyment out of&#x2026;
<br>I give neverending nightmares

The story begins with a young man waking up from a terrible dream - only to find that his nightmare has only begun. The next two hours of gameplay are a brutal confrontation between Thomas and his guilt - but what is the nature of this guilt, we (initially) don&apos;t know. What we do know is that it seems to concern a woman called Gabrielle - whose identity shifts from one dream to another. She&apos;s in turn Thomas sister, therapist, wife - she&apos;s both the demon stalking Thomas&apos; nightmares and his guardian angel. Like any dream-character, she&apos;s in constant flux - but so is the identity of the protagonist himself. The game, in short, captured the tangled logic of dreams in a way none before it did.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, &quot;Neverending Nightmares&quot; are a horror game, and one of the best two I&apos;ve played in 2014 (the other being &quot;Slender: The Arrival&quot;). There are few jumps scares involved; but apart from that, what works for the game is the atmosphere; the one some of us perhaps had encountered when we woke up from a troubled dream to find that things are still not quite right... Thomas goes through such a cycle repeatedly, each apparent awakening taking place in a more surreal and dreadful circumstances.
<br>
<br>&quot;Neverending Nightmares&quot; are both one of the most unusual games to come out lately, a decent horror, and a work of art, showcasing the potential of the medium. In the game Matt Gilgenbach touched upon the very essence of horror: it&apos;s not about the deformed monster lurking in the dark, it&apos;s to be found in the darkness that fills the innermost corners of the human soul.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/neverending-nightmares/user-reviews?user_review_id=4941221">Expand</a></span>
