<br>As you would expect in a game from these devs, it is solid game design, it is excellent writing, it is truely glorious music. The characters have .. character (!) and the story is engaging with choice and consequense. This is a great game, and will be fantastic in a week when it&apos;s been patched a bit more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/expeditions-viking/user-reviews?user_review_id=7268323">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Also, I can&apos;t stress enough how good the user interface for dialog is. In a lot of text-heavy games, the dialog box becomes cluttered and because of that reading becomes boring or tedious. That is not the case in Expeditions: Viking! All the text is neatly formatted and color-coded and all the choices are numbered! The reading in this is just pure joy.

Combat is a lot of fun and the play style reminds me of Temple of Elemental Evil without all the glitches.
<br>Characters are fun.  The game is very polished in most places, but there are a few spots that could use a bit of work (camping, map transitions come to mind).
<br>All in all well worth the money, and I look forward to playing more and to what else this up and coming developer can bring!
<br>Great atmosphere.
<br>Great gameplay.
<br>Fun dialogue and characters.
<br>Story still in progress- I&apos;ll try to get an update here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/expeditions-viking/user-reviews?user_review_id=7277469">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story wise the game is an improvement from their previous works, but it is still very noticeable that it is an indie company that is behind it.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately it is a game that is quickly forgotten once you have played it and completed it. I don&apos;t feel it is worth replaying, so I don&apos;t know if 30$ is the right price for a game without any replay value.
<br>
<br>When that is said. You can&apos;t complain about the graphics and animations, and the music aren&apos;t too annoying either.
<br>
<br>Anyway, if you are a fan of these type of games (and I am usually a huge fan), then get it when it is available at a discount, play the hell out of it, and then forget about it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/expeditions-viking/user-reviews?user_review_id=7306398">Expand</a></span>

If it was a movie then the narrative would actually be good, but as a game it&apos;s just frustrating to play. Also for anyone looking for strategy/tactics in this game, it&apos;s all about luck and the rest is just boring.</span>

<br>This is the first time I&apos;ve agreed with the critics on metacritic more than other users.  It&apos;s an unsettling feeling.

I work under time restraints and for me this is a no-no for an RPG style game. I want to relax and explore at my own pace.
<br>Other than that if you are personally OK with timers, then a great game, needs a few minor bugs, mainly with dialogue, ironing out but overall pleasant and playable even on hardest levels. My friend tried insane and said it is a real challenge but is do-able, He intends to do a full play through soon.
<br>Graphics are good for an isometric/top down, plot is good, combat system takes a little getting used to in terms of upgrading weapons. fights are enjoyable, good tactical combat, X-com style.
<br>Downside is limit of development for named party members, their attributes can never rise so it ends up being better to ditch them and hire fully customisable mercenaries once you reach Ribe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/expeditions-viking/user-reviews?user_review_id=7283489">Expand</a></span>

<br>Considering the game itself it has become my favourite rpg this year. I played (or well at least tried out) practically all western crpgs since the days of Baldur&apos;s Gate and this game here has been the first this year, which managed to get me really invested in it&apos;s world setting, story and characters.
<br>
<br>I would recommend that game to anyone who likes games like Baldur&apos;s Gate, Pillars of Eternity or the new Wasteland games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/expeditions-viking/user-reviews?user_review_id=7327314">Expand</a></span>
