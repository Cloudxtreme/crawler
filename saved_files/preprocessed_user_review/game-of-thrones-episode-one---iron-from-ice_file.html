                                        <span>I think this game&apos;s story is amazing, and even though this episode wasn&apos;t the best, I&apos;m expecting telltale to surprise us with the next ones. In my opinion, I kind of don&apos;t like the thing that telltale lets us play with more than one character in a game. While it&apos;s a nice and original idea, for example Mira&apos;s part in this episode was kinda boring, but Ethan&apos;s and Garden&apos;s one were very good.</span>

Story itself is nowhere near as enticing as the original, but it&apos;s well written enough to keep just the right amount of tension. Also, comparing it to different Telltale games lately, I had a feeling that my choices were of more consequences than in, say, TWD2. The biggest flaw? Once again it&apos;s more of an interactive experience with choices, than a game. You don&apos;t really collect any things, and you don&apos;t solve any puzzles. You just watch the show, and react to it. Not something I&apos;d expect from a &quot;game&quot;, even though I quite enjoyed this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4814800">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting is great from the shows stars to the new characters the game is introducing. The new characters seem interesting so far as does the story and the graphic style they are using for the game is good but could be better done on for the newer consoles.

<br>If you are a GoT fan pick this up and enjoy.</span>

Lets take a look together as this rich narrative unfolds between one of the protagonists and the Forrester Maester (aka keeper of knowledge and family history)...
<br>
<br>Gared - &quot;Why do the Whitehills hate the Forresters&quot;?
<br>Maester - &quot;I don&apos;t doubt someone killed someone, which led to more killings of somesones and then, well... here we are.&quot;
<br>
<br>Oh wow. So story, much deep.
<br>
<br>Anyways, Iron From Ice is a fanfic based on a Song of Ice and Fire. Like all Telltale games your decisions don&apos;t matter, and this fact is magnified given that the game is a non-cannon installment featuring high profile characters from the series. &quot;Ouuu, I wonder what will happen to Ramsey Bolton?&quot; Nothing. Why? Because he needs to show up in the books.
<br>
<br>The port to PC is bad. I gotta force quit to get back to my desktop because exiting the game wasn&apos;t a feature included in my menu settings. I can see environments and characters transition between scenes at the base of my screen. The game seems rushed and sloppy.
<br>
<br>I just wish Winds of Winter would finally come out. After playing Iron From Ice I feel like a smoker searching for cigarette butts on the ground in a desperate attempt for a fix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4803334">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere is great and the story, with the different characters you can play with, catches the feeling of the show and books.
<br>The only thing I was disappointed in, was the fact, that none of my decisions has an effect on the end of ep 1. It is really annoying, that the best part, which surprised me when playing it for the first time,  is unchangeable, and becomes the worst part with that. Because with this, it is only an other TV Show you can watch but not a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799920">Expand</a></span>

Here&apos;s the spoiler free section of the review.
<br>
<br>You play as three characters, Gared Tuttle (Jon Snow&apos;s counterpart), Mira Forrester (Sansa), and Ethan Forrester (Robb/Bran). My personal favorite to play was Ethan Forrester, since he has to rule Ironrath (House Forrester&apos;s seat) in place of his father, Lord Gregor Forrester, and his choices seem to have the most meaning. My least favorite character to play as was Gared Tuttle, because for now at least his story seems rather unimportant other than one action that ended up causing everyone trouble, and his story has quicktime events that are almost a burden in the middle of the conversations. Mira Forrester&apos;s story was pretty uneventful as well other than a few key choices that change the story quite a bit. All in all, it seems as if each character is a separate style of gameplay; Ethan, focusing on my personal favorite, the hard decisions and trying to rule at a young age, Mira, being 25% conversations and the other 75% point and click adventure, and Gared, focusing almost exclusively on quicktime events (with decisions that don&apos;t really change the course of the story). The game never bored me, which is great in my book, and don&apos;t get me wrong, none of the characters were a DRAG to play as, it&apos;s just that some are better than others. The game really left me wanting to play the next episode, and the ending left me gaping at my screen in horror. I wasn&apos;t sure if the final results were my fault or just the game, and that feeling definitely makes the replay value ten times as good. It made me want to go back and try to dodge those mistakes that resulted in the final moments of the game. There is a little teaser for the next episode at the end, which made me all the more eager to continue that story. That&apos;s about all I can say without spoiling anything, so I&apos;ll now make a new section for all of you who have played it or don&apos;t care about learning how I messed up.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------SPOILERS----------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>You have been warned. The beginning of the game immediately grabbed my attention, where I started in some form of army camp celebrating with some of the northern Houses, as well as House Forrester and Lord Gregor. I discover that the character I&apos;m controlling is Gared Tuttle, and then the fun begins. I soon find out why we&apos;re celebrating, and my suspicions continued to grow in chance. Then they&apos;re finally confirmed; we&apos;re marching on Casterly Rock tomorrow. My heart immediately starts beating a little faster, as Gared continues to notice odd happenings such as weapons laying out and even a Frey drawing his crossbow (not to mention The Rains of Castamere booming from the castle). He finally figures out what&apos;s happening and has to either save a fellow squire or warn Lord Forrester. I of course choose my lord and watch the squire (Bowen) get stabbed in the throat. Then follows a slew of quicktime events as I watch the Red Wedding from the outside. I finally get to the lord, and he gets shot and ends up sacrificing his life for me, handing me his giant sword. Then, the iconic intro starts and I realize that that was only the beginning. Later, you play as Mira Forrester in a verbal dance with Cersei and Margaery Tyrell. You must choose your allegiance between the king and Margaery, and try not to piss both of them off. Also appearing is Tyrion, but it seems like he appears purely out of fan service, since he doesn&apos;t really contribute to the conversation. This scene is one of the strongest in the game, as you really have to set up the foundations for Mira&apos;s story in future episodes. Your first impression starts there. Then comes the highlight of Ethan Forrester&apos;s scenes, which as I&apos;ve said are my personal favorite. You have to choose a sentinel (a right hand man), choose whether to invite Ramsey Snow in the hall or make him wait at the gates, then try to convince Ramsey Snow not to decimate your House. This scene is one of the tensest moments in gaming history, as you know that one misstep can get everyone you love killed. Ramsey is a truly terrifying figure in this section, and your life rests in his hands. Here&apos;s what happened to me;
<br>Ramsey is invited into the hall.
<br>He terrifies me in real life and in the game world.
<br>I begin bargaining for my life, offering him ironwood shields and ships, and show him that the Forresters are some badass crafters.
<br>He agrees, and begins talking to my family, in particular my younger brother.
<br>I defend him, and Ramsey lets off for a while.
<br>We talk more politics.
<br>He tries to take my sister.
<br>I grab her.
<br>&quot;I don&apos;t want a bold lord.&quot; I get stabbed in the neck. No game over screen. Just death. This resulted in me feeling something I&apos;ve never felt from a video game. Ever. That&apos;s why this game deserves immense praise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4791306">Expand</a></span>

Seeing the mixed reviews from critics i was skeptical of its quality, but i should not have doubted Telltale Games, not sure why there are mixed reviews from the critics but this episode from Telltales new Game of Thrones series soared above Tales from the Borderlands: Episode 1. If you aren&apos;t sure whether to purchase Tales from the Borderlands or Game of Thrones i strongly recommend this game, with a fantastic story, good characters, fun action, and much more this starting entry into Telltales &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; really hypes me for what comes next. (Please note that if you are not past Season 3 of the Game of Thrones TV show OR have not read the 3rd book in the Song of Ice and Fire books, then there will be heavy spoilers in this game for the main series and i strongly recommend waiting before you purchase this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793405">Expand</a></span>

Each one of them are somehow related to the House Forrester, a house loyal to the Stark Family.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll get to fight (QTE) and use diplomacy in a very satisfactory way, everything you do seems to affect the whole story, even if most or some of it might just be an &quot;illusion&quot;. But I can work with that, especially in Telltale Games, they always handle that in a good way. But there are some options that seem so... big, that there must be quite a big difference between those. And hopefully they will change parts of the story quite a lot.
<br>
<br>This game offers much more walking and inspecting objects and such comparing to let&apos;s say Tales from the Borderlands, which is quite nice since it makes the game feel more like a game than a interactive story. However I&apos;m not sure how the objects will affect the game play, it will probably be shown in the coming episodes.
<br>
<br>One other thing is that to fully enjoy the game you need to have watched the series, because there are things that is connected directly to the show, like characters, voices, places, etc. I myself was really deep into the story, and I don&apos;t think people who haven&apos;t watched the show will feel the same way.
<br>
<br>The story starts at a slow pace for about 5 minutes and after that it has it&apos;s up and downs, which both fits perfectly to the story and the characters, and it&apos;s quite refreshing to switch between these characters, to move the story forward on all fronts.
<br>
<br>And let&apos;s end this review with the end of the first episode, I won&apos;t spoil anything, but it&apos;s worth the Game of Thrones name, I&apos;ll leave it at that!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4786675">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is interesting, with the same intense atmosphere of the TV show and a shocking ending (not so much, since this is Game of Thrones and you know what you&apos;re getting into). You play as 3 different characters, which helps keep things fresh. You get to make some very tough decisions with a big impact on the story&apos;s progression, and play through some exciting action scenes. The characters are great, as is the script and the voice acting (the cast from the show reprise their roles, and give terrific performances).
<br>
<br>Perhaps the only disappointing aspect of the game are the graphics, which were not what i expected. The visual style was less of paint (which is one the things I enjoy most from Telltale).
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a strong start for a new series from a studio I respect. Looking forward to the rest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4789629">Expand</a></span>

I did play it again a second time to see if certain other choices would have an impact. The impact wasn&apos;t as large as I would have liked but enough changes were there.
<br>The story is phenomenal. Even those who criticize the game on other fronts will have to agree unless they are liars that this story lives up to George RR Martins&apos; high standard of writing. The episode ends with a twist that most people will never see coming.
<br>The game has more of the usual gameplay that is found in Telltale Games albeit with a twist that I don&apos;t want to spoil.
<br>The game even has cameos from characters from the show and the characters are voiced by the actors themselves. Its absolutely a thrill to listen to Tyrion&apos;s wit, Cersei&apos;s arrogance and Ramsay Bolton&apos;s malice.
<br>You play as three protagonists in the first episode with Telltale promising by the end of the six episodes you will play as 5 protagonists who are either members or those who serve House Forrester. House Forrester is a vassal house to the Glovers who are bannerman to the Starks of Winterfell. I found every playable character to be charming in their own way. The other characters are also very developed and multi-faceted. The game&apos;s antagonists are also very despicable and hateable in true game of thrones fashion. By the end of the episode, my jaw dropped and I felt the emotional roller coaster that Telltale is known to put players on.
<br>I can&apos;t wait for the next episode.
<br>If you are a fan of Games of Thrones or the books(A song of ice and fire) you owe it to yourself to buy this game.
<br>If you are a fan of Telltale you should still check out the game but be warned that the game starts off with a major spoiler for season 3 of the show and book three.
<br>I would recommend this game to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4791053">Expand</a></span>

All in all it sets the bar quite high from the get-go.
<br>
<br>To see cameos from the TV show performed by the real actors is a treat, one I would never have even hoped we could get, but the performances are as good as in the TV-show, and Peter Dinklage definitely got his redemption here after his lacklustre performance as Ghost in Bungie&apos;s Destiny earlier this year. The new and original characters who are the central element of the story are also well-acted but it is a little jarring to see the design-difference as they are not stylized sculptures of real actors, but instead Telltale&apos;s design-teams own artistically crafted designs, and to be honest this shows, but you will get used to it.
<br>
<br>There are choices to make that all seem to have proper weight to them, and no matter what there are shocking developments you will not see coming just in this first episode, in true GoT fashion. The best thing is, all of it feels properly developed and is not just shocking for the sake of nonsensical shock-value as we&apos;ve seen in earlier franchise adaptations from Telltale. I&apos;m pretty pleased to tell that Game of Thrones under Telltale&apos;s vision is as mature and sophisticated as the real thing. The coming episodes will determine if this quality lasts though, but so far all is good, heck, even better than I hoped it would be!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4786677">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only issue I have with the game is that the decisions once again seen to not ultimately matter.

A rocky, but promising start.</span>

The episode ends with a jaw-dropper ending which makes me want to go and play episode 2, right now!

<br>My final score is 9. The story and world they have created is stunningly good, a clear 10 for me.
<br>The gameplay is, as you&apos;d expect, well done but not groundbreaking, a great 9. Technically I had one small problem which were short freezes at the end of a scene, but nothing serious, a good 8.

<br>The acting and writing is good though... although It is unfortunate that the actors get their names tarnished by this pathetic project.
<br>
<br>Graphics... well... some are good, like the landscape and some part of each characters, but their skin is ugly and inhuman (unless they are all walkers already? lol) and there is no liquid (like wine when poured, water, etc.). So poorly done most of it... probably was made in a haste to make a quick buck.
<br>
<br>Sounds and music, well, half of it comes from the series, so you are hugely lazy Telltales, I understand for the theme of Game of Thrones, but the rest could have been your own design.
<br>
<br>Depth and replayability is equal to ZERO! No matter what choices you take, it changes nothing. For example, whether you choose A or B to be your sentinel changes absolutely NOTHING. Whether you take the wiseman or the reckless warrior, the outcome is the same over and over again, whether you tell Ramsey to get screwed or lick is behind, the end result is the same.... so why bother making all those choices and have that &quot;x will remember that&quot;? especially when the character you control dies... who cares if he remembers if I&apos;m dead! LOL Also, how does my character know he or she will remember this or that? Are my characters telepaths? Telltale is so stupid! Half a brain at most or no heart for work, a lazy bunch.
<br>
<br>Finally, what kind of idiot would pay 30$++ for a 30 min game? I wouldn&apos;t even pay 5$!!! I mean, you can play games that lasts for 20 hours for free on Kongregate and many other websites (some adventure games, action-adventure, and hack&apos;n&apos;slashers just to name a few). Telltale overestimates itself and is pretty presumptuous with their &quot;games.
<br>
<br>Oh, and their &quot;games&quot; are not games, they are built as interactive fiction, and even there they fail miserably at doing such type of game.
<br>
<br>Since their Walking Dead thingy, I&apos;ve always said they should stop making &quot;games&quot; and make animated movies, they would make more money. Face it, who would pay for a 30 min game when you can get 2 or 3 good movies for the same price or a great one (such a star wars (4-6), Avatar, Lord of the rings, Frozen, etc. just to name a few of different genres)?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m boycotting Telltales because they&apos;re not worth a penny when it comes to game design, they&apos;re lazy, stupid and there to make a quick buck only!
<br>
<br>The 2 ou of 10 goes to the writing and the actors, the rest of the crew receives a big nothing, zero, nada, null!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4798005">Expand</a></span>

I assume everyone who has played this game or plans to play has watched the show.
<br>Game of Thrones has always been about survival in the face of treachery and corruption. It has done well to establish a brutal Medieval world where one wrong mistake can bring dire consequences. This game does a great job of bringing that feeling into your own home as you try to save your Noble House from annihilation.
<br>The game puts you in the shoes of several individuals of House Forrester, a Noble House from the North loyal to House Stark. The game starts on the night of the Red Wedding which was the television event that shocked audiences around the world. But more importantly it is the event that saw the fall of House Stark and the Kingdom of the North. These events lead to House Forrester in desperate times as they try to survive with their sworn enemies being allied to the new Warden of the North, House Bolton.
<br>The game has excellent writing and performances from the cast. Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Iwan Rheon, and Natalie Dormer reprise the roles they played in the television show. I would say that Iwan Rheon steals the show in this episode as Ramsay Snow doing a fine job of reinforcing his reputation as a cruel and unpredictable sadist. Overall, the writing and performances are what make this an engaging experience that makes you feel you are actually there.
<br>There are a few complaints I had. The graphics were very glitchy and you see a lot of tearing on the PC version. Also, sometimes the characters words do not coincide with their mouth movements. Also, Ramsay Snow&apos;s character design did not go very well with what he looked like in the show which is strange because Tyrion, Margery, and Cersei all looked like the actors portraying them.
<br>The ending of the episode was brilliant and would definitely make George Martin proud. It ended in true Game of Thrones fashion and I applaud the writers for this.
<br>Overall, the game is great but a lot of graphical issues keep this game from being a masterpiece like The Walking Dead was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4810557">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What would you say if you were called before Cersei? How would you run your estate as a new lord trying to earn the respect of his people? Who can you trust? If you allow yourself to become immersed in this world, the game will take you on an intense emotional journey.
<br>
<br>You will also feel that all too common sense of shock and injustice when bad things happen to the good guys--except this time it feels more personal because you said or did things that feel like they may have made those things happen. But in that traditional GOT way, perhaps there is nothing you could have done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4811013">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The family you play as are Heavily based on the TV show Stark family most of them look like and are clearly based off them which is disappointing to see such lack of effort in character design.
<br>The character models are good with the exception of Margery and Ramsay who are attempts to look like the actors from the show and don&apos;t quite pull it off.  In contrast the Cersei and Tyrion models are quite good.
<br>
<br>the dialogue is poor, its not unbearable but its fairly close.  The choices you choose while speaking have zero impact on the story or the reactionary dialogue you receive in a conversation or after an &quot;event&quot;.  There are some definitive choices mainly the appointment of a sentinel however this has no impact on the story (at least in this episode).  It is also misleading, you have an option towards the end of the game to flex your lordly might and show off your troops in an attempt to intimidate someone, when being presented this option it seems as if you have some power at your disposal ...you have four men.
<br>
<br>The animation is simply horrendous characters movements are jerky and unnatural which is particularly noticeable in the combat setting of the first part of this &quot;game&quot;.  A character dispatches someone trying to kill you only to then stop for 10 seconds to look longingly into your eyes then unsurprisingly get a arrow to the chest.
<br>
<br>Overall this is extremely disappointing and appears to be an abuse of the franchise to sell a sub par product</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862961">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s hard to approach this review because it&apos;s still an overall enjoyable experience, but Telltale games are definitely starting to show their age.
<br>
<br>From start to finish, the story is engaging, as we&apos;ve come to expect from Telltale games. Due to this series being six episodes instead of the more recently used five, the writers are given the time to pace things out more in-line with the show. It&apos;s a slow build for the most part, with the majority of the gameplay being conversations. There&apos;s a couple scenes featuring some quicktime events, but overall this is a very dialogue driven episode. This can be to the gamer&apos;s pleasure or displeasure depending on their patience and preference, but I found it to be great. The episode features set pieces that viewers of the show would recognize and allows the gamer to experience a story in a universe that is alive and complex, which in itself is a joy.
<br>
<br>All this being said, I feel a sense of fatigue when I play Telltale games nowadays. Maybe it&apos;s in part because I&apos;ve grown accustomed to the formula of gameplay and decision making that they&apos;ve now become known for or maybe it&apos;s because I know the majority of my choices won&apos;t have any dire consequences as playthrough will end with very similar results. For example, I knew that with the first major decision given in the game, it wouldn&apos;t truly matter because the opposite of what I picked would ultimately happen regardless. To simplify, in any given binary decision to be made, the outcome will eventually account for both options. This lessens the impact of all the decisions you make and removes you emotionally from the story that&apos;s taking place. This is a problem featured in all the Telltale games I&apos;ve played. It doesn&apos;t really remove any of the enjoyment from an initial playthrough, but it does severely limit replaying the game, especially with Telltale&apos;s continual refusal to remove the ability to skip cutscenes or lines of dialogue on repeat runs.
<br>
<br>Telltale&apos;s Game of Thrones adventure will prove to be another great story to live through, I&apos;m sure. Despite this, Telltale&apos;s inability to evolve from its gaming format prevents the game from truly transcending to what it can be. I just hope they will eventually grow out of their formula before other gamers come to realize their tendencies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4790920">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well I register in Meta just to make this review.

I&apos;m also pretty sure there were people paid to crank the user score up because this so called &quot;Game&quot; is the worst &quot;Game&quot; I ever played, Duke Nuken Forever looks like an amazing game compare to this.

<br>I&apos;m also pretty sure there were people paid to crank the user score up because this so called &quot;Game&quot; is the worst &quot;Game&quot; I ever played, Duke Nuken Forever looks like an amazing game compare to this.
<br>
<br>This Interact(not so much) story is worth a 1$ nothing more... Why??
<br>
<br>- You decisions make absolutely no impact on the game(Ep.1) ZERO! Nada!(I&apos;m not joking), illusion of choice has people said.
<br>- Gameplay is reduced to QTE many of these can be ignored and will have again no effect on the story.
<br>- Animations are really awful especially when characters are running or doing more complex animations.. I Lmao so hard in the beginning when you &quot;Sprint&quot;(Fast walking) with a two-handed sword carrying in one hand you look like a retard.
<br>- The end will always play the same and it seems forced especially  when you do the perfect decisions which have a positive/impressed reaction from the antagonist.
<br>- Games are meant to make you have fun and enjoy the time you spend interacting with it, this games ends in a very bad way, truthfully to GoT but contrary to TV Show or Movie you can&apos;t put this things as the final ending(It&apos;s a big slap to the face to players that basically say fu#$ you you didn&apos;t have any impact playing) just like ME3 except you only found this after having other 2 games with meaningful decisions, fun and lot of gameplay and mechancis this has nothing of this.
<br>
<br>This thing would have been so much better as a 3D TV show like Star Wars Rebels etc... Here as it is you feel like you are eeing rip off, by having a company randomly split a game in 6 pieces without any attention to the player experience.
<br>
<br>This Story because of being label as a game is worth 0/10 and 1/10(for GoT fans still only buy it when all episodes have been release)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4860596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game was awful. The writing and pace of this story was horribly slow and only barely managed to pick up just before the credits rolled. The art style is very pixelated which I wasn&apos;t a fan of and you spend the entire game playing a coward apprentice, a small child, and a selfish, entitled young girl.
<br>
<br>The young boy had easily the most interesting part in the story, which isn&apos;t saying much. The game was full of horrible dialogue and overly dramatic facial animations (mainly frowns) and unnecessarily drawn out conversations.
<br>
<br>I played this, along with two of my friends, one being a female.. All three of us were disappointed and thought it was incredibly boring and weak-written.
<br>
<br>And yet it&apos;s getting praise from just about every media outlet and gaming forum. Normally I consider myself to be with the majority, as far as game opinion is concerned, but I don&apos;t understand why everyone is going so crazy over this game.
<br>
<br>It is easily the weakest of all the Telltale games available currently. Even though it was only a first episode, it doesn&apos;t even compare to the blowout that was the first episode of Tales from the Borderlands and I&apos;m not even a fan of the Borderlands universe. Yet both games are getting 8/10&apos;s as if on the same level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4800062">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is not an episode I would play again, as the choices don&apos;t seem to matter ALL THAT MUCH by the end, but I will definitely be playing the next episode to see how the story progress. Hopefully they can flesh out the story and make it more engaging, as it is a six-part series, whereas the Walking Dead was a five-part series.
<br>
<br>PS: Great cliffhanger, Telltale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4801367">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t know how you&apos;d create a gaming experience more authentic to this particular source material.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to assume you&apos;re familiar with Telltale&apos;s modernized choose-your-won-adventure meets quicktime event format. In this Game of Thrones iteration of it, you play as three different members of the Forrester family in the first episode. Presumably we&apos;ll be playing most or all of the family in future installments. They&apos;re a clan of middling Stark bannermen, trying to survive the continuing fall of House Stark. (The game begins at the Red Wedding.) In their favor, they are the realm&apos;s primary suppliers of Ironwood. In their detriment, their perennial rivals, the Whitehills, are tight with the sadistic and murderous Boltons, who now rule the North. If that made sense to you, great. If it didn&apos;t, welcome to one of this game&apos;s two major... perhaps not problems, but concerns.
<br>
<br>The first concern is the one we just found. This game relies extremely heavily on the player already knowing the kingdom of Westeros. For me, the ten minute conversation with Cersei was the scariest conversation I&apos;ve ever had with an npc in a video game. But I know Cersei. I&apos;ve read all the books and watched all the episodes of the show. If I hadn&apos;t, that same encounter would probably have felt like a brief exchange with a lady who acted like a fussy landlord. As much as I enjoyed this episode of the game, I could not recommend it to anyone who hasn&apos;t seen at least three or four seasons of the show.
<br>
<br>The other concern is a little more adult. The game captures the random, brutal violence of Game of Thrones quite well, but the absence of sexual content is very noticeable. If it&apos;s just a matter of how this opening episode plotted out, then it&apos;s no big deal, but if they&apos;re really planning on doing the entire thing at PG-13 levels, it&apos;s not going to feel like Game of Thrones by the time it&apos;s over. Finally having a fantasy setting that treats its audience like grown ups is so much of the point of George RR Martin&apos;s work, there is simply no way to dial that back and retain the soul of Westeros.
<br>
<br>I look forward to more of this one. With slight reservation. We&apos;re off to a good start, but it&apos;s pretty obvious this whole thing could go from Game of Thrones to Game of Thrones-lite at any moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4789611">Expand</a></span>

<br>Telltale can be compared to a roller-coaster ride, they used to make games that where terrible until they made TWD S1 that game was the start of a whole new genre and it was amazing, all the characters where interesting and so was the story, but after they made TWD S1 they hit a downhill again.
<br>TWAU was the start of the downhill it was pretty good but not as good as TWD S1, then came TWD S2.
<br>Jesus H. Christ what a disappointment that was, none of the characters where interesting or likable except for the ones brought over from TWD S1!
<br>And now they&apos;re getting closer to the bottom with Iron from ice.
<br>First of it doesn&apos;t capture the feel of the show at all, second yet again none of the characters are interesting or likable in any way and yet again except for the ones brought over from the show.
<br>The story is extremely dull apart from some gory scenes.
<br>I think it&apos;s time for Telltale to hire some new writers or at least try and beg the ones that wrote for TWD S1 to come back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785521">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played Tales from the Borderlands last week and it was much better than this. This game is a lazy attempt by HBO to gain more money using Game of Throne&apos;s name. Its like watching an alternate Game of Thrones story created by people who had nothing to do with the show. Animated (poorly). In all fairness, I did laugh 3 or 4 times but that isn&apos;t enough to forgive this unethical practice. This game is enough to make me wish for Telltale&apos;s failure.
<br>
<br>Game of Thrones if my favorite television series and this game is a slap in the face. If you want to watch poorly animated pixels insulting the Game of Thrones series, you should purchase this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4790307">Expand</a></span>

- HORRIBLE mouse smoothing.

- No support for Xbox-controllers.

- Horrible main menu. Play it to see it. Didn&apos;t manage to change settings... took a few hours to figure out how it worked (there is a small arrow that you click, looks like it&apos;s part of the &quot;fluff&quot;).

- The sound engineering is also horrible.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I just finished the game, and here are my pros and cons.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- HORRIBLE mouse smoothing.
<br>
<br>- No support for Xbox-controllers.
<br>
<br>- Horrible main menu. Play it to see it. Didn&apos;t manage to change settings... took a few hours to figure out how it worked (there is a small arrow that you click, looks like it&apos;s part of the &quot;fluff&quot;).
<br>
<br>- The sound engineering is also horrible. Everything sounds weirdly phasey/reverby. There are also lots of part with clicks and such thanks to the min volume going above 0dB.
<br>
<br>- QTE with button mashing. WHO came up with this for an adventure game? If they would just skip the button mashing with QTE crap it would be a much better game. It is NOT interesting to randomly click buttons to solve &quot;puzzles&quot;.
<br>
<br>- The camera angles are horrible. I think this has been the case for most Telltale Games. There are invisible walls everywhere, you can&apos;t see **** and the only time the cameras are good are in some of the conversations. I wish they would just do the dialogues and the rest could just be a movie. Would&apos;ve been more fluid.
<br>
<br>- The technology/graphics feels so aged... textures with ultra low resolutions and other idiotic things that really have no reason.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>- The only thing good with this game is the story and the story driven choices.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>
<br>Really low quality game. If you give this anything above 3/10 you must be a Telltale-fan. I am a Telltale fan and I really love Telltale Games, but they really need to start fixing all these problems before release these games. There is so much promise yet they just **** it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4792338">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m giving episode one a 7, but keep in mind that this easily could change as the rest of the episodes are released.
<br>
<br>First of all, if you don&apos;t know anything about Game of Thrones, and the universe of Westeros, i would not recommend this game. Even if someone knows just a little about the show/books, that won&apos;t cut it i&apos;m afraid. Unless you don&apos;t care about knowing who&apos;s what, and what is happening in the game.
<br>
<br>If you do enjoy GoT, i would recommend this. Especially since it&apos;s the only game in the Game of Thrones world that actually is not a pile of human waste. (God that GoT RPG is horrible)
<br>
<br>The uniqueness of Telltale games i believe make all of their games worth a purchase. Even if i do think 1 and a half hour isn&apos;t really worth the money this first episode costs.
<br>
<br>Being unique can be both a good and a bad thing. In terms of choice, which is one of the key things of telltale games, do they matter? Uuuh, yes and no.
<br>Truth be told, in most cases, the choices in Telltale games are mostly an illusion of choice.
<br>A cosmetic change if you will. The dialogue might change, and in very few instances, some actual changes do occur to the game and the story, however a large portion of the choices you make do not matter. You might disagree, but it&apos;s the truth. The replayability is not as good as say a BioWare game, or a few Bethesda games. (Though that also has to do with different races, classes etc.)
<br>I&apos;m fairly certain there are free visual novels that give you more choices that matter.
<br>
<br>The quality of the story is what makes Telltale great. Not the variety of choice. So far it&apos;s the same with this game. The story is intriguing, and while some of the &quot;plot twists&quot; aren&apos;t really plot twists, (seriously, was i the only one who kinda knew what was likely to happen at the end?) it&apos;s still a good story.
<br>Does it do justice to the source material? That&apos;s honestly too early to tell.
<br>
<br>A thing to keep in mind is, the first episodes of telltale games are usually pretty slow, and mostly serve as an introduction to everything. This was definitely no exception.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Good story, very intriguing plot so far.
<br>-Good voice acting, even from the GoT TV show actors (I knew you had it in you Dinklage)
<br>-Nice transitions between characters.
<br>-The graphics, though simple, are actually full of beautiful details.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Your choices don&apos;t serve any purpose other than a few changes in dialogue. You can&apos;t change any of the major plot points. Whether things in future episodes will change based on your actions remain to be seen.
<br>-While the facial animations are alright, the body animations are often stiff and awkward. This is most obvious doing combat scenes.
<br>-Gameplay is, like all Telltale games, very limited.
<br>
<br>Is it worth picking it up? Like i said, i don&apos;t think the current price is worth it for about 1 and a half hour of gameplay (a term used loosely in this instance) but i would recommend anyone who enjoys the TV show or the books to play this game at some point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4798497">Expand</a></span>

But i must be honest, i almost exited the game within the first 5 minutes, due to unfamiliar events. I stuck through the boring beginning and started feeling more pulled towards the story, proving that the Foresters are Game Of Thrones quality characters.
<br>The female characters later on did not increase interest in the episode, and the scene by the forest with all the kids made the experience a bit boring.
<br>The strongest element of the episode was the small council, the choosing of the sentinel and the decisions that are made up by lord Ethan.
<br>I played it several times, answering everything differently but it seems that either way, the same result comes at place; Very small changes are adjusted, but tend to fade out as the story progresses.
<br>The animations are glitchy from time to time, but nothing to worry about.
<br>Overall, it has a good story, with an imagination that the books provide, an the excitement that the HBO Hit series provides.
<br>The pros outgrow the cons in many ways, and its a series to look forward for every 4-7 weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4836827">Expand</a></span>

Martin&#x2019;s seminal A Song of Ice and Fire book series, HBO&#x2019;s Game of Thrones has been one of the main players in the pop culture of this decade. As any gaming fanatic would realize, Martin&#x2019;s expansive world, with richly detailed lore and intricate plot lines, would be a perfect setting for a Skyrim-like type of open-world video game. We&#x2019;ve yet to get something like that, but in the meantime Telltale Games is giving the series its already traditional choose-your-own-adventure treatment. The result should be pleasant for fans of the show, even if there are pitfalls along the way.
<br>
<br>The game is a point-and-click adventure with some very light exploration aspects. It focuses on the Forresters, a northerner house sworn to the Starks, and its struggles in the aftermath of that family&#x2019;s downfall. You play as three different characters, making choices for them in what amounts to a 2-hour interactive episode that is canon to the TV series (but not the books). The graphics deserve special mention, going for a watercolor aesthetic that works quite well.
<br>
<br>The story takes place between seasons three and four of the series, and features cameos by a few of the main characters, fully voiced by the original actors. Odd stumbles aside (such as when a character somehow manages to go alone, without provisions and on foot from the Riverlands all the way to the Forrester ancient seat up north), it&#x2019;s an effective and well-written story, presenting interesting choices that let players have a taste of the difficult politics required to live in Westeros.
<br>
<br>I must say I have my doubts about how much your choices actually affect the storyline, though. The plot twist that serves as the game&#x2019;s emotional climax, for example, is something that I consciously tried to avoid during my playing time, and the fact that your options are limited in each decision means that I simply didn&#x2019;t have the power to stop it from happening. This left kind of a sour taste in my mouth, making me realize I&#x2019;d probably rather sit back and watch the story unfold instead of pretending to take any actual part on it. Yes, I realize this is just episode one of six, meaning some plot points have to happen for future episodes to even work, but for me this seems more like a sign that perhaps the episodic format doesn&#x2019;t work very well.
<br>
<br>The other aspects of the gameplay are very dispensable. There are quick-time events that annoy more than entertain, while the exploration is so light it&#x2019;s almost pointless, always confined to very tight spaces. As much as those aspects make the final product seem more like an actual game rather than simply a story, they don&#x2019;t feel integral to the experience, often ruining the sense of immersion.
<br>
<br>The best thing about Iron From Ice is, by far, its status as an appetizer for people who are waiting for the next season or the next book. Even if player interaction seems, to use a Westerosi expression, more like a mummer&#x2019;s farce, the game still gives players a taste of the incredible world crafted by Martin. If that&#x2019;s what you expect, you should have quite a good time. If you&#x2019;re looking for a full-fledged game set in Martin&#x2019;s universe, the wait still isn&#x2019;t over. Luckily, us Martin fans have grown accustomed to waiting.

His Grace commands!
<br>
<br>It plays like a two-hour episode of the show that you have &quot;choose your adventure&quot; moments in.  Although it is entirely based on the show (all show characters are voiced by the real actor with their likenesses), like the books there are several segments and each from a different character perspective.  This allows the game to give you a nice variety - so you get many different experiences (being a squire, or a member of the court in King&apos;s Landing, or being a Lord of your own house) while experiencing one connected story.
<br>
<br>The voice acting, even by the non-show characters, is probably the best I have ever heard in a video game.  The graphics are a mixed bag - I played the XBOX 360 version - I know that&apos;s not a &quot;Next Gen&quot; system, but for a game with tiny environments and is almost all story-driven, I was a bit surprised at the amount of constant tearing in backgrounds and around characters.  It was a minor distraction, though, because otherwise - the graphics were rather pleasing on their own, and it&apos;s plainly obvious they spent a great deal of time developing their engine to give very nice facial expressions, particularly the eyes.  I honestly can&apos;t say I have ever seen a game where the facial expressions were so well-done and conveyed actual emotion.  You can&apos;t help but get involved in the story.
<br>
<br>For those expecting an open-world or hack and slash game, it isn&apos;t it.  I think age is going to play a big factor in expectations - for those of us old enough to remember the pre-DOOM game landscape, where this type of game was common place, it&apos;s like visiting an old friend in brand new, fan-squeal inducing digs.  The only trouble I had was with a few of the brief combat sequences - but once I got what the game wanted me to do, I was able to proceed.  Right after the sequence I had issue with, suddenly the GoT theme song and re-creation of the opening began, and I was in GoT heaven.
<br>
<br>Folks often use &quot;fan service&quot; as a pejorative, but honestly - this is obviously aimed at folks who know and want to expand upon the GoT story.  For a fan it&apos;s just delicious - having the fate of a house in your hands, an audience with the Queen, a side bar with the Imp, all with original voices and wonderful, GoT writing.  It also has all the brutality, language, and &quot;no win&quot; scenario choices that give the show such impact (warning, f-bombs throughout, even think I heard a c-word, just like the show).
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say I wouldn&apos;t prefer they clean up the tearing in the graphics a bit, and the controls could use a little bit more work for a few tasks, but I can&apos;t really recommend this enough because it&apos;s exactly what I was hungry for - a trip to Westeros, a compelling story that ties into the show (this episode takes place in Season 3, apparently future releases will bring us all the way up to the start of Season 5), and to spend some time with some of my favorite characters and interact with them.    Telltale has really hit on a great genre here and the perfect franchise to exploit it - I hope after this series is done we get many more series to coincide with the mid-points between television seasons, I really couldn&apos;t be more satisfied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796605">Expand</a></span>

Was ecstatic to play this but was quite disappointed, especially compared to the superior Tales from the Borderlands game (I never enjoyed Borderlands prior to the Telltale game). This is the PS4 version review:
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. Terrible, terrible graphics. Horrible textures, poor representation of the show&apos;s characters (Margery especially looks hideous). Half the time I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s intentionally meant to look that way or if it&apos;s glitchy. This really takes you out of the immersion of being in a Game of Thrones episode.
<br>2. Story is mediocre. It has it&apos;s moments but it&apos;s generally dull and characters, although you control them, seem boring.
<br>3. Glitches. Everywhere. Visual, audio, and ESPECIALLY subtitle. Subtitles are incorrect, audio gets skipped, visual glitches galore. This can be solved by a patch, but referring to point 1, poor visuals are an issue.
<br>4. ABSOLUTELY ZERO EVOLUTION. Same telltale formula from the Walking Dead era (Haven&apos;t played any games prior to that). Being a telltale fan, it sucks that you can&apos;t expect more than quick time events and dialogue choices. This was most disappointing of all. Although Tales from Borderlands didn&apos;t evolve from the usual formula, it refined it to near perfection, and even then it was slightly disappointing.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>1. Promise. A lot of promise, especially since it&apos;s a 6 episode season. I don&apos;t regret buying the season pass despite a weak first episode.
<br>2. True to the original work. If you can ignore the visuals and glitches, you are in Westeros.
<br>3. Interacting with the show&apos;s characters is excellent, it&apos;s one thing to watch them be monsters, it&apos;s another to interact with the monsters knowing their capabilities.
<br>4. Price. $4 is still a steal.
<br>
<br>Recommendation: Wait until episode 2 to see if the season picks up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799397">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you are not a fan of the books and tv show, you probably will not enjoy. But if you are, it will give you the chills the way the game connects to the series. The first chapter was good, and the end of it left me breathless. Looking forward to the next ones!</span>

As the first part i felt they should have focused on less characters and let us know them better, but certainly got me looking for ward to it. It&apos;s like a very promising first episode of the show that tried to do bit too much, but overall still excellent and they portray the game of thrones universe flawlessly.
<br>
<br>On the bad side options felt less different and important than usual, but we will truly only see that later. Other issue i saw in it is the ending, feels too convenient and doesn&apos;t make much sense, mainly happens for drama and as a cliffhanger. I did notice the same flaw in the first episode of their new borderlands game, but it was easier to look past and still deserved maximum point.

<br>If you love Game of Thrones you will love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4810675">Expand</a></span>

<br>The art style and  graphics were well put together and matched the overall art style of Telltale&apos;s other episodic series. There were a few graphical mistakes here and there, especially in the animation, which is odd for a game that relies so heavily on its television-style storytelling. I&apos;ve noticed a few instances where characters would just disappear or speak without moving their mouths.
<br>
<br>The storytelling itself was spot on. It did a fantastic job at relaying the sense of urgency and danger that is prevalent throughout the original television/book series. It even faithfully followed George R. R. Martin&apos;s style of switching character perspectives in an interesting way that kept the story feeling fresh.
<br>
<br>Gameplay was limited mostly to quick-time events, which has become some sort of staple in Telltale&apos;s latest games. It really is the weakest aspect of this game, so anyone not content with the game&apos;s story and dialogue may find it boring. The controls feel pretty rough in the few section where you get to walk around, especially on a mouse and keyboard. I found that on the keyboard, trying to switch from one direction to the other without circling around would result in the character standing in place, which seems a bit unprofessional. I like to think of the dialogue as its own gameplay element, which is just as strong as  any Telltale game.
<br>
<br>Finally, probably the biggest flaw in this game is that the setting only makes sense if you are already familiar with the Game of Thrones series AND up to date to the HBO televisions series. In fact, to anyone who is just starting to read or watch the series, I heavily suggest actively avoiding this game, because it does contain spoilers. To those who are caught up, though, the game provides an interesting story close to par with the original books as long as you don&apos;t let the awkward controls and gameplay get in the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=4904335">Expand</a></span>

I had written them off as a one hit wonder that could never live up to the horror and heartbreak they created in the chilling and exhilarating story of Lee and Clementine. That was until I played the demo for their new series Game of Thrones.
<br>
<br>Telltale&apos;s Game of Thrones is everything fans of Martin&apos;s novels and the acclaimed HBO television series, are looking for and more in a video game adaption. Interestingly, the story does not alter plots already established in the hit show, but rather shows a different perspective from events already taken place, and the ramifications of the war between The Starks and The Lannisters on other noble families in the world of the story. The game begins at the night of The Red Wedding, an event fans of the show will be well aware of and affected by. The game is centered around events following House Forrester, noble bannermen to The Starks.
<br>
<br>What  was lacking in Atlus&apos; highly criticized release of their own Game of Thrones adaption, was the appearance of prominent characters from the show and their roles within the game. In this aspect Telltale goes above and beyond with appearances by: Cersei, Tyrion, Lady Marjorie, Ramsay Snow, and Jon Snow all within the first 2 episodes.What may be most interesting for fans of the hit show, is that all of the aforementioned characters are voiced by the actors who play them in the series.
<br>
<br>Just as is expected from Game of Thrones, each and every scene is filled with tension, treachery and tragedy. With that in mind, the Game of Thrones world is the perfect world for the mechanics of Telltale&apos;s episodic point-and-click adventures, where each and every decision the player makes affects which characters live and die. It&apos;s exactly like watching an episode of the show, but being able to make the character&apos;s decisions for them.
<br>
<br>What amazed me most, was the power of the story and the brilliant pace of the plot, which Martin is known for. I wouldn&apos;t have been surprised if Martin wrote the story for the games himself, nor was I surprised when it was released the Martin&apos;s personal assistant was a story consultant for the game. For gamers who have watched The Walking Dead and wished they could experience that apocalyptic world, Telltale made that dream come true. While time will tell whether they fulfill that same dream for Game of Thrones fans, they&apos;re certainly off to a powerful and promising start.

Playing in the world of Game of Thrones is exactly the type of game that Tell Tale does the best.  Excellent partnership here.  I hate QTE during combat, but considering that this is a storybased driven game, it fits perfect with the cinematic feels.  I realize that I only hate QTE in the combat games where you excel at your own skills only to have it taken away from you as you watch a battle.  That&apos;s why I detest QTE generally.  But in this game it works.  And making decisions playing the game of politics is very intense. I recommend this to everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-episode-one---iron-from-ice/user-reviews?user_review_id=5368712">Expand</a></span>
