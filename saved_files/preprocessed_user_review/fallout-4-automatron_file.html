Honestly i would have rather spent the 10 euro on a sandwich and a coffee. If you didn&apos;t like fallout 4, this will not make you change your mind in anyway. A pretty poor, uninspired DLC from bethesda who are known for their high quality content.</span>

It doubles down on shooting, looting and radiant quests with no rpg mechanics in sight. I have yet to see a justification for the season pass price hike outside of Bethesda trying to milk every cent before the release of their very lackluster content. I bought this game hoping for at least a watered down rpg experience on par with Skyrim, but instead was treated to horrible base building and a mediocre shooter. The fact that more radiant quests were added with this &quot;dlc&quot; means that once again Bethesda both do not listen to or care about what the customer wants, even the diehard fans of this game are sick of radiant go here kill this quests. Well played Bethesda you got my money, but I assure you it&apos;s the last time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6236052">Expand</a></span>

Would I say its on the level of Skyrims Dawnguard. No. The most fun you will mainly have will be gunning down robots and then building your own. Its painstakingly average and this DLC will just have you wishing more.</span>

<br>
<br>Automatron has a short, clever little story peppered with the usual sidelong references, inside jokes, and memorable characters Fallout games are famous for. The new Robot crafting mechanic is no more or less shallow than the rest of the crafting experience found in the main game. If you were expecting it to revolutionize crafting, or even provide you with a deep and interesting sub-system, you&apos;re out of luck. But if you were okay with the depth of the crafting system in the main game, the new system is, at least, no worse.

<br>There are several new enemy types in Automatron, most notably a robot-themed Raider gang, and several new robot enemies that appear to be randomly generated from the various parts available in the crafting system. It can be hard to notice this during fast-paced gameplay, though - even though no two Scrapbots look identical, for instance, very few of the available parts have any sort of a unique visual style, and most enemy &apos;bots end up just looking like randomly thrown together heaps of scrap metal.
<br>
<br>This DLC also includes two new locations - a home base for the new Raider tribe, and a secret lair for the primary antagonist. Both locations rank among the most interesting and well-designed dungeons in the game. As an added bonus, they also contain large amounts of the more rare scrap components that you&apos;ll be using a lot of if you&apos;re making and modding robots, so it&apos;s nice to know someone on the design team was thinking ahead.
<br>
<br>As far as negatives go, it&apos;s short (obviously) at around 2-3 hours total playtime for the story mode, and it doesn&apos;t really add any new or interesting mechanics to the game. Some new guns, new armor, new enemies and crafting? Sure. But nothing beyond that. Essentially, if you liked the base game, this is more of the same. It wouldn&apos;t feel out of place to tackle in the middle of a new playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6205371">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Automatron is a standard DLC in the gaming world today. It has a decent premise that is never fully realized, ,includes a few new weapons, 2 New dungeons which are the standard walk, shoot, and slash bethesda affair, and about 3 static characters. In other words it&apos;s one of those DLC&apos;s you only buy if you reaaaaaaallly just need more of the game.</span>

<br>
<br>The story line is fun, I guess. However, it has a grand total of four quests which take at most four hours to complete only if you are early in the game and have to spend time travelling to the different locations and scrounging for parts for your robot. (very minor spoiler ahead regarding what the quests are like) The first quest is the introductory quest, which is basically show up to point A, listen to conversation, and then complete quest. The next two quests are basically fetch quests, and then the last quest has you go to the Mechanists&apos; layer to confront them. After that, you get endlessly repeating sidequests akin to &quot;another settlement needs your help&quot;.
<br>
<br>What little quest content is there is nowhere near diverse enough to call it an experience that you would not be able to find in the base game otherwise. That being said, there is a fun addition to the game in which you can create your own robot. In all honesty, that&apos;s really what you&apos;re paying for here, but I would say even that isn&apos;t worth it unless you really want to customize your own companion as Fallout 4 seems to be centered around customizing everything anyway.
<br>
<br>So is it worth buying? Well, as I said: it adds very little to the game. The few quests it comes with are like every other Fallout 4 quest so there&apos;s nothing special there, and the whole robot companion system is really up to personal preference if you really think having a custom companion is worth ten dollars because that&apos;s pretty much all you&apos;re getting with this DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6203226">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The novelty of the stuff wears off quickly - and the &quot;must collect all possible parts...&quot; becomes irrelevant, because one gets them kind of automatically during the course of the mission.
<br>
<br>Compared to add-ons like &quot;Old World Blues&quot; or even the much more linear &quot;Dead Money&quot; or &quot;Lonesome Road&quot; ... this DLC pales in comparison (and shame).
<br>
<br>The quest itself is not bad per se. But it is a mission that can be done - and possibly will be done within 1 or 2 hours by most players - because most players have by that time finished the main storyline and are armed to the teeth.
<br>Compare this one mission to the .... if my memory does not betray me ... almost a hundred tasks in Old World Blues - on a new medium sized location, tightly packed with over a hundred points of interest to explore in an open world manner, with rich lore and exciting storyline. Or compare it to Dead Money (not the players most favourite) - that changed the way you had to play the game completely - turning the game into a hide and seek with some puzzle elements - but most of all ... a VERY different atmosphere (almost Bioshock-like).
<br>The closest add-on might be Lonesome Road, which was very linear, too - but still offered a richer story - and new locations.
<br>
<br>But what all those comparisons have in common is that they were 10 times if not more bigger than the Automatron DLC.
<br>
<br>In one word - this DLC is &quot;disappointing&quot;.
<br>
<br>It is about as rich in content as a new map for &quot;the Sims&quot;.
<br>
<br>So why still a 5 out of 10? - It offers content that ... i reckon ... could not have been modded. It offers quality content. But it does not change the gameplay, nor does it enrich it. It does not offer anything to the end game, nor the early or mid game.
<br>
<br>ps.:
<br>
<br>What bothered me a &quot;little&quot; is that the hideout of the Mechanist felt more secure than even the Institute (considering they have a sewer entrance) - with those dozens (literally) of heavy - almost comical - safe doors.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6204022">Expand</a></span>

However I would have appreciated more.
<br>
<br>The questline in Automatron sees you tracking down &#x201C;The Mechanist&#x201D;, a mysterious robot creator that has been sending out machines of death to hassle the commonwealth. Of course it&#x2019;s up to you to stop this with the help of new robot companion, Ada.
<br>
<br>The questline takes between two to four hours to complete, depending on your difficulty, et cetera. For the most part it is an enjoyable romp in which you are consistently facing robotic enemies with varied abilities.
<br>
<br>The story is fun and hosts an interesting premise, with &#x201C;The Mechanist&#x201D; and one other character being standouts. I would have liked to interact with these characters more as your robot companion is painfully generic. Bethesda seems to be intent on only providing you with followers that have a neutral or good alignment.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;d also like to mention that they did try to offer multiple ways to complete the questline, which is appreciated.
<br>
<br>The robots that try to kill you are crafted with a plethora of deadly intentions in mind. They are combinations of assaultrons, protectrons, sentry bots and everything in between. You will face a mish-mash of these enemies throughout the campaign, with each utilizing many combat strategies both melee and ranged.
<br>
<br>The only irritating part about fighting off these new foes is they have a tendency to explode upon death. Considering much of the questline takes place inside a dungeon I found myself falling in close quarters to their postmortem explosions. It felt like cheap deaths.
<br>
<br>The big new mechanic introduced allows you to create your own robots or upgrade your existing ones via robot work stations. These stations work like your general workstations in which you can utilize found items or craft different parts to create or upgrade your robotic automatons.
<br>
<br>There are a decent amount of options to craft a death machine. My favorite part was upgrading Codsworth to be a fully functioning sentry bot with an assaultron laser beam. That type of thing is what I really enjoy about the creation aspects in Fallout 4.
<br>
<br>I also found an assaultron head that I can shoot like a pistol. That&#x2019;s awesome.
<br>
<br>Overall Automatron is a fun piece of DLC, but perhaps not worth the 10 dollar price tag it is currently released at. If you were really looking forward to it, chances are you&#x2019;ve already purchased the season pass.
<br>
<br>For everyone else, maybe wait until it drops in price a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6221607">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Leaving random bot bad guys in the wasteland for you to shoot at and gather resources from when you are done with the story, if you can call &quot;shoot this, shoot that, kill the main bad guy&quot; to be a story at all.
<br>
<br>Is it worth &#xA3;7.99... Not for quests or the uninspired story, there is only about 1 or 2 hours of gameplay in the DLC, so it fails my value for money test by a large margin.
<br>
<br>Taken as part of the original game though, it works rather well but what it supplies is pretty much what the default game did to death already. Eg combat, crafting and grinding.
<br>
<br>What Fallout 4 needed is not in this DLC at all.
<br>
<br>Fallout 4 is lacking a good story, lacking any kind of half decent RPG options, it is entirely combat and grinding and half the world does not respawn fully anyway, so once you get to level 45, your pretty much searching every corner for something to shoot at.
<br>
<br>Assigning Robots to Settler jobs seems to be a bit Gitchy and does not work for all Robots. My first robot did not support such a feature and could not have its AI turned on for it. My Second robot could have an AI turned on for it and did work as a settler. Not sure why they were different, might have missed something.
<br>
<br>I guess there is more to this than is explained in the DLC.
<br>
<br>Since this is working, I am changing my thumbs down to a thumbs up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6202725">Expand</a></span>

It adds an extra challenge to the game making it more rewarding. The story is short but to be honest this really wasn&apos;t about the story in the first place, the real point was robot building. So you may be wondering does it fit that aspect of the intended content? the answer to that is a strong yes. The Robot building is rewarding and very much appreciated and fun at the same time. This DLC builds on  the fact that everything is needed, nothing is really &quot;junk&quot; at all, everything has it&apos;s use. And even stealth characters can benefit from this DLC you can equip your robots with a stealth blade and a stealth module like the power armor, effectively making your robot invisible and making you sneak better. Other than this the content is great the story is average so that is why I am giving this an eight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-4-automatron/user-reviews?user_review_id=6206179">Expand</a></span>
