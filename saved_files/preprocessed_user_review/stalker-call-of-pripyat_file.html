It&apos;s such a shame, that there barely even is games about it, but at least it&apos;s still more than fresh place to make a game about.  Call of Pripyat is the third Stalker game in the series, which I had never played before. The story isin&apos;t really anything amazing. You are have to find out why helicopters have crashed to Tsernobyl, which is now filled with people hoping to become rich by finding rare artifacts. You don&apos;t need to have played previous games. You can roam around freely the exciting areas of the game, though you are limited to go only few places during the start of the game. The atmosphere of the game is outstanding. It looks like you&apos;re in a abandonded area filled with radiation, and feels like it. Unfortunely stalkers talk with &apos;&apos; Yo bro wuzz up?! &apos;&apos; style, which breaks the atmosphere a little. NPC don&apos;t also some times attack mutants, which are trying to attack you. The game has simulation feel too. You need to eat food or you will starve to death. You need to heal yourself from wounds, though it only needs use button and nothing else to fix the wounds. If not counting the easiest difficulty, you will die really easily, forcing you to think when you should fight or not. The graphics of the game isin&apos;t that good now days, but even my crappy computer was able to run it fine with some settings set to maximum.  The gameplay is great, the sound design is almost as good, the game takes increadible amount of time to complete (33 hours, I had spent time doing some side quests too) and I found myself playing it a lot of time even after it, what I usually don&apos;t do. I recommend it from the bottom of my heart, if you don&apos;t want to play arcade shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1790771">Expand</a></span>

Call of Pripyat manages to take all the best parts of Shadows of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and third-party modifications like Oblivion Lost, and fuses them into a highly enjoyable experience. The new quest system is much better thought out than in previous games; instead of simple fetch quests or kill X or Y Stalker missions, you&apos;re treated to actually interesting scripted events, memorable characters, and unique settings. If you&apos;re a fan of the STALKER series, this is not a game to pass up, and while newcomers might be slightly baffled as to the plot (It contains many throwbacks to the previous titles in the seires), the gameplay is streamlined in a way that can appeal to a much broader audience than the other titles in the series. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=742260">Expand</a></span>

There were a couple of times where I got stuck in a mission where I had to do something completely unrelated in order to solve it and maybe the main story is a bit short but that will not in any way take away the fact that this game is good. if you liked SOC you are going to love Call of Pripyat</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2399947">Expand</a></span>

I was real hesitant to try S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat.
<br>
<br>And after finishing Call of Pripyat (no mods pure vanilla), the first thing that I thought to myself was, &quot;This is the sequel we deserved!!!&quot; I love this game to death, it pretty much fixes every single thing that was wrong with the first 2 games, fixing most of the stuff from S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky mostly. First of all Call of Pripyat was the only S.T.A.L.K.E.R game where I wasn&apos;t pissed off from glitches, it still has it&apos;s glitches but it&apos;s a lot less compared to the first 2 games. The AI/NPC act a lot better now... they have some minor weird moments but overall the AI/NPC act like actual people now and they follow what they are supposed to do. Also I still find that S.T.A.L.K.E.R CoP is graphically unstable because I seemed to get quick FPS drops and also if you look at an area in a certain direction it can also drop FPS... but 5 minutes later you look at the same area and FPS doesn&apos;t drop. So it&apos;s like the game is optimized for a moment and then badly optimized, and I don&apos;t know the reason why.
<br>
<br>Also the story here is a lot better, in Clear Sky... the problem with the story is that it was too quick, no character developments or nothing. But in S.T.A.L.K.E.R CoP, you start off with a general mission and you build up stories and characters while you do those missions and side missions, thus making the game a lot more interesting. Shadow of Chernobyl did this but Clear Sky didn&apos;t, Clear Sky depended on side missions and faction wars to make the game interesting while the main story was lacking. And also S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat missions and side missions were a lot more interesting, they gave a variety of objectives instead of &quot;grab/kill and get your reward&quot; but it usually had some story/character buildup and most of the time it had some action and exploring so you were always on alert if you had a side mission left to do. And not to mention that mission where you build up your team so you can go underground from Jupiter to Pripyat has to be one of the best and most exciting levels I&apos;ve played in a long time.
<br>
<br>Overall I think this game is just as good as S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow Of Chernobyl, maybe even better, the game fixed up on everything S.T.A.L.K.E.R SoC had problems with and made it better, just the few things I found wrong with it is that it was shorter than the other games, it took me 21 hours to beat it with most of the side missions done and 95% of the zone explored but with the first 2 it took me 24-25 hours to beat it. It&apos;s not a big problem it just surprised me when the game was over and I knew I was done in a shorter time then the other games. The only real reason why I say that this game is better than S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl is that they finally got a good ending out of all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games, the plot twist was really well done, the final battle is well paced for once and the final cutscenes with all those endings was really well done as well. And even though that S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 was canceled a long time ago. I think this the prefect game to end the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series with.

Unlike Clear Sky, which was a prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, this game starts right after the events of the first game.
<br>
<br>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl was an unexpected success. Despite being extremely rough around the edges when it was released back in 2007, it offered a unique open world experience. One of the main complaints gamers had, was that the levels were relatively small for an open world game. This, in practice, meant that there were lots of loading screens. This issue was addressed and the levels in Call of Pripyat are a lot bigger. In fact, there are only three main areas in the game. Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t mean that the entire surface area is any bigger though, both games are about the same size.
<br>
<br>In essence, Call of Pripyat is a very similar experience to the previous two games. The game is more refined yes, but a lot less ambitious. Graphics are better, but only marginally. The story is clearer and makes more sense, but is also very simple and basic. The biggest letdown though is that there are practically zero new weapons and enemy types in this game, compared to the previous two.
<br>
<br>All things considered, Call of Pripyat is not a bad game. It is, after all, a more refined version of the game(s) we all loved. But it doesn&apos;t bring anything new to the series. It&apos;s more of a huge and fun to play expansion pack to the original game, than a standalone masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=6851236">Expand</a></span>

Lots of side quest that have purpose instead of go get this or go eliminate that. The games graphics are amazing and the game itself installs and runs without all the bugs and patches of previous versions. The amount of gun fights has been turned down in this version but playing on a high difficultly level will make each encounter seem brutal.

Having used the website for years, I&apos;ve never actually written a review until now.
<br>Reason being is that this game is truely unique and I believe that people should at least try a STALKER game at some point in their lives.
<br>I love this game, even in spite of it&apos;s flaws. I personally think that it&apos;s the best of the 3 STALKER games, due to the level of polish that the previous games never quite reached (Especially Clear Sky, which I think is the least significant title in the series) as well as it&apos;s increased graphic abilities - DX11 support etc.
<br>
<br>I spend hours at a time on this game, roaming Chernobyl, just to explore the World. To be quite honest, I&apos;ve barely touched the main story. I&apos;ve just spend the most part of my time on the game exploring the World and completing various side-quests for money - there is simply so much to find in Chernobyl. As well as this, the curious as rewarded rather generously - during your travels, you will come across little treasure troves known as &quot;Stashes&quot;. These &quot;Stashes&quot; provide you with a range of resources. Sometimes, you&apos;ll find a couple of cans of food. Other times, you may discover a new rifle for your arsenal. These stashes are a great addition to the game, and add a bit of reward for people like me, who simply like to explore.
<br>
<br>Now, I have to admit that I play a modded version of the game, known as &quot;Misery&quot;, which enhances the game in a number of ways, but the Vanilla experience is still stellar. However, I would recommend the &quot;Misery&quot; mod to anyone with a reasonably powerful PC looking for a second play-through, as it changes the mechanics of the game in a number of ways, whilst completely reinventing other areas - graphics, sound effects etc.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, there are a few issues that can disrupt your playing experience, and there are a few design choices that will scare away some players altogether.
<br>Firstly, in contrast to the &quot;classic&quot; RPG trend, there is no level system, ie, you do not earn experience and you do not level up. Similarly, there are no aspects such as &quot;Perks&quot; or &quot;Skills&quot; like those found in other RPG games. Some people will not like this at all. Personally, I find it enthralling and more realistic that your competence in this wasteland is down to your equipment and expertise - rather than being able to tank your way through the game loaded with perks and skills. Similarly, there is no issue with level scaling, as there is no leveling system. (You won&apos;t find yourself killing everything with one punch like in other RPGs, where you could be a level 50 character battling with level 10 enemies).
<br>
<br>On the more technical side, there are a few problems with the Vanilla game&apos;s optimization - it is awful. To remedy this, you can use any of the many overhaul mods on the Internet, such as the &quot;Misery&quot; mod I mentioned earlier. Others include &quot;Call of Pripyat Complete&quot;. All of the mods that I have tested have yielded better graphics, whilst also maintaining a high frame-rate than the Vanilla game.
<br>Another issue is that the game is sometimes very reluctant to operate on 32-bit PCs with less than 4gb of RAM - But there are mods on the Internet that fix this. The overhaul mods aforementioned also bypass this problem.
<br>I have no problem here, as my PC is a 64-bit PC with 8gb of RAM.
<br>
<br>Aside from it&apos;s technical issues, which can be overcome with patience and the right mods, this game is something that any RPG fan should try out at some point.  I&apos;ll probably never finish this game, as it is just too damn fun to just walk around finding stashes and killing mutants. If you&apos;re a fan of &quot;apocalypse&quot; RPGs, such as Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, I would strongly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2871017">Expand</a></span>

Call of Pripyet is a solid addition to the series after the flaky Clear Sky came out. What gives Call of Pripyet the legs to stand along side the original is the improved gameplay and continually surprising atmosphere. My only gripe with this installment is the story does not hit as hard as the original (keeping in mind that you get the proper ending with  the C-Conciousness business). Pripyet also feels short as if there were parts missing or some side quests taken out. I loved Call of Pripyet and felt back at home in the zone, but in all honesty this game could have been an expansion instead of a stand alone addition to the series. I have very high hopes for the next installment because Call of Pripyet seems to be going down the right track.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742458">Expand</a></span>

<br>The atmosphere!  I played hundreds of games, and no game can claim a better, and more realistic atmosphere than the STALKER Series.  When you play it  you ARE the Stalker, you ARE in Chernobyl, and you ARE surviving.  Simple as that.
<br>I use SGM Sigerous Mod for Call of Pripyat  and simply cannot stop playing.

But, at the same time, they offer a unique experience that no other game I know of can deliver: survival in a hostile world. Sure, lots of games put you in hostile, stressing worlds, but they always look out for you. STALKER doesn&apos;t, causing you to really submerge into its world. You can roam away from safety in a rainy night and and accidentally walk into powerful mutants without the visibility to fight them if you want. You have to learn not to. You have to pack your own weapons and supplies every time you leave your safehouse, because the world is not guaranteed to provide. And all of this happens in a open world. Wait until the moment you find yourself tagging along a random sandbox-style patrol, because you&apos;re out of ammo and you can hear the mutants running in the bushes near you. This is survival.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2080819">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also nicely balanced, much easier than previous games and without annoying spikes in difficulty - pacing is just right this time. Game&apos;s oriented more on exploration than on endless combat with waves of enemies, which is accented by maps design - they feel more open than SOCCS ones. Parts with forced linearity and grindy battles almost doesn&apos;t exist. Game&apos;s not revolutionary by any means (it&apos;s rather an expansion of a franchise), but still a very good product with series&apos; annoyances ironed out - strongly recommended stuff, provides hours of great, atmospheric fun without frustration. I&apos;d give a 10 points, but I subtract one for rehashing old material (&quot;new&quot; bloodsucker animation and &quot;new&quot; monsters were in early alpha builds etc.) and borrowing most improvements from modders :&gt;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=741240">Expand</a></span>

CoP has indeed less bugs, more balanced gunfights etc but at the same time I feel that it has lost much of what made STALKER the game series it is. I enjoy the large scale open maps but what I don&apos;t enjoy is that the big area has not been used properly. No stalkers roaming around, no stashes to be found (except the ones you get on your PDA), Scavenging has been reduced. It feels empty and it&apos;s sad since CoP has such a great atmosphere and environments that could have gotten better wild some more life into it. But Shadow of Chernobyl stays, for me, at the top and Clear Sky stays second on the list of STALKER games but CoP is still a worthy sequel and if you are a STALKER you shall not leave CoP un-played!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1459003">Expand</a></span>

The action is great, but what really captivates me is the atmosphere of the zone, and the various enemies you encounter. What i mostly love is the AI of the mutants and enemies, more unpredictable, more challenging than most other RPG games and shooters, though fire fights can be few and far between, that&apos;s really what keeps them interesting IMO. Although I wish the game world had more underground to it, and I wish more of the buildings were explorable. Also wish the game had a bit more interactivity to it, ending was, eh...but still good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1568280">Expand</a></span>

I loved it, progression is very good, upgradable weapons, you can now sleep in many places, you have to manage the food, going to the zone in the night is very dangerous. The new labs are very creppy ! And the monster are still dangerous. There is no more faction war, but you can choose to help the duty or the liberty at some time.</span>

On the downside, if you farm the artifacts, you can get pretty buff in the first zone of the game, equipped with the best weaponry and armour, which smashes the difficulty in the head. And the game doesn&apos;t have quite as many locations which scare you **** like SoC - remember those laboratories?

It shows the devotion that the original team had along with their ability to narrow down and remove all the things that didn&apos;t work quite as well in the first two titles.  Areas are varied, sprawling, free roaming large maps that forgo the back and forth to different loading areas like we saw in the original and this overall helped keep the progression much more focused.  The combat is much more fluid and I would even say &quot;less&quot; cumbersome than ever before.  Most if not all guns are a real treat to both utilize and simply look at on screen.  However I do get the feeling that asset-wise its not too far removed from its predecessors visually and most by now would admit that the engine was beginning to look a bit dated.  This is remedied by Tesselation and some new shaders accompanied by Directx11 capabilities.  Its all very subtle, but along with the God rays and equally subtle SSAO effects the game looks quite lovely.  I expect its visuals will age much slower than most videogames from the same era as time goes on too.  The mechanics have been overhauled a bit, mixing the things that worked well in its predecessors in exchange for leaving out all the failed mechanics we only saw in those first two titles and its a nice controlled blending of old and new that really bring out how unique the final installment was.  The atmosphere is positively &quot;alive.&quot;  Wild animals are far more dangerous as well as fellow mercenaries, stalkers, and bandits.  The AI is much more proficient making them actually quite challenging to fight in most scenarios.  However, with all the good comes the many, many, glitches, game halting quirks, oddities, and niggling annoyances.  Your opponents have a very hard time doing anything about you, an assault rifle, a scope, and possessing the knowledge to be several hundreds of meters away before pulling the trigger.  Meaning you can essentially exploit the AI to a hilarious degree.  Certain gunfights can be completely ruined if you have the right gear and its not until a rather long tedious escort mission sometime later in the game, that I would actually call Call of Pripyat &quot;challenging.&quot;  Even on master difficulty, taking out enemies is not ridiculously hard whatsoever and it seems as though a lot of reviews from certain professional review sites claim the &quot;X-ray vision&quot; of AI opponents which I&apos;ve yet to ever experience.  Glitch wise, their is still a lot of them and I&apos;m surprised that the engine of the game itself wasn&apos;t brought up as the worst glitch of all.  Call Of Pripyat is permanently gimped by its own performance.  Noticeably so- you can turn off the wonderful glittery graphics in the game and still end up with a stuttering mess as the engine attempts to load sections of the level you&apos;re in.  Something that wouldn&apos;t have ever happened if the game had used an entirely different engine by this point, which I understand, is not something this developer would&apos;ve ever done.  Its noticeably bad on some of larger areas later in the game, but its not &quot;game-breaking&quot; its just &quot;immersion-breaking.&quot;  Other claims about Directx11 and Directx10 being near equal in terms of visuals is mostly true.  We are talking about one lacking thing in DX10: Tesselation.  Something that even I have a difficult time spotting the differences in visually speaking.  All in all its a great game with a good follow up to the story, great combat, varied missions and only one really difficult section about 3/4ths of the way through.  If you&apos;re a STALKER fan or enjoyed Metro 2033, you&apos;ll likely enjoy Call of Pripyat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4069321">Expand</a></span>

It was a little buggy, made you walk long distances and often murdered you unexpectedly. Remember the terror of getting irradiated and running into your first invisible creature?<br>Call of Pripyat brings all of that back and improves on it, everything is tighter, smoother and less buggy - that is not to say, without it flaws, but now with flaws you can forgive. Don&apos;t expect amazing graphics, you aren&apos;t playing Crysis 1 (or 2), secondly you should expect the occasional bug and glitch - sometimes you may get snippets of dialogue that should have been translated from the original Russian. But if you can forgive the game these minor faults you will have a great time.<br><br>What&apos;s been improved since the first game? Factions, firearms, missions, everything is back and it&apos;s all better. Your guns still deteriorate so you have to keep them repaired if you don&apos;t want unexpected jams, however you can now upgrade your weapons with enough cash and parts, but each gun and armour has an upgrade tree which depending on the mods chosen lock off other parts of the tree. You might spec for reliability in a weapon so you have to repair it less, but to do so you might trade off some accuracy or recoil, or maybe ammo/clip size. You are still affected by your carrying capacity but some armour mods allow you to up that, it all comes together perfectly. The atmosphere is still tense and moody, and get ready to run for cover when a pulse even happens, enemies are still deadly (especially the human foes) and the game has a good difficulty curve. If you go into this game looking for another triple A title like FEAR or Crysis, you will be disappointed this game doesn&apos;t have the spit and polish that either game has. But what it does have is a robust upgrade tree, RPG elements, excellent atmosphere, a compelling storyline and a fascinating open world with a myriad of ways to tackle problems. It&apos;s not flawless, but it makes up for that by being challenging and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1691632">Expand</a></span>

The game was meant for exploring a lot of areas and gathering better weapons and suits. Although the area is still based off from Shadow of Chernobyl, there&apos;s new stuff to find and many more missions and side quests to go on.  I found the ending to be sort of disappointing, as there seems to be only one ending (On what I find).
<br>
<br>**A BIT OF SPOILERS ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTING FIGHT AT THE END**
<br>As soon as you&apos;re into the center of the zone, you don&apos;t even have to move.  Just shoot at the enemy with a special weapon repeatedly.  The game will end when he is done with.  For some odd reason though, you can also travel through some warps, and fighter another bunch of Monolith soldiers.  The boss will start traveling around the area, and then eventually the ground at a random location.  Even if he is at a place where you cannot reach, shooting randomly causes him to die off anyway.  Either way you go, taking the long and hard way to defeat him doesn&apos;t change the ending, neither did you need to take the long way at all.  The extra work doesn&apos;t really pay off, and it wasn&apos;t really needed.  Overall, the game was okay for me, and it was really a challenge when I was lacking equipment.  But I think that made it much more fun in the long run.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1699564">Expand</a></span>

One can say that a little passion; will go a long way for a developer. The level design is great; its nice to see a more open ZONE and a move away from the more linear experience of the first two games. The story is good, sometimes its nice to have a more strait foreword story like COP. This game is by far one of the least known gems in video gaming today.

I haven&apos;t yet played the earlier two STALKER games, but this game was good enough to convince me to play both of those as well. The combination of FPS and RPG gameplay is done very well. I&apos;m not of fan of standard FPS games, to me they are usually too repetitive and shallow to keep my interest for very long, but this combination of gameplay styles and a well designed atmosphere kept my interest very well. However, the main storyline in this game I found to be lacking, though it had the potential to be something much greater. Some of the mini-stories in side missions were more interesting to me than the main story arc. I also felt there could have been more interesting storylines developed around the several factions that reside in the Zone. I also wish the RPG elements had been improved upon. Experience points and level ups would have given me more incentive to explore areas of the map I didn&apos;t need to go to for specific missions, but as it stands I would rather just avoid coming into contact with unnecessary enemies since all I&apos;d do is loose ammo and gain nothing as a result. I also wish the characters had been more complex and interesting, I had no real vested interest in any of the characters (even my own character was kind of a boring personality). Despite these areas that could have used improvement, I found the game to be very fun. Not a game I&apos;ll play more than once, but a game that was very enjoyable one time through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2551814">Expand</a></span>

Not only that but the game is scary, really scary, but that does not mean that every time you leave a safe area you are going to be peeing yourself, it means that when the game needs to be scary it can be. CoP also has many elements of an RPG. There is a great inventory system, lots of weapons and armor, lots of modifications for those weapons and armors, and so much more.

Being the third in a series, it has very little traces of dumbing down or attempting to appeal to a broader audience BS  (just imagine if Skyrim had that preserved magic). After 8 hours of gunfigting, looting, hiding, running, scouting, planning and trading, I am now in solid agreement of the very high user rating here in metacritic. The real magic here is how it very much preserved and improved all the things that made the original such a respected game. The RPG and gunplay elements are superb. The atmosphere, though not as good as the first, is tense with more mutants. The repair of items really creates a feeling of exhaustion and attrition and the inventory and item system has been improved. It also retained the weapon upgrade system of the second game which is really nice and it improves attachment with the player&apos;s guns. Compared to most games, this one is quite realistic--- bullet drop, recoil, accuracy, caliber and ammunition type are all things to factor in when taking shots. So if you try to snipe with pistols, the game will have a way of saying that it&apos;s a stoopid idea. Merchants are now more picky and will not just buy significantly damaged items. This makes raising money harder and increases the feeling of poverty and desparation! Artifact gathering is just like the second game and is quite intense as it forces you to work hard for them--- so keep that detector active. Stashes are now harder to find and the addition of a helmet is brilliant as it allows for more upgrades and a separate slot for obtaining night vision capabilities. The 2 &apos;any weapon&apos; slots are an improvement over the primary/sidearm system of the first two games. It&apos;s been six years now and after having played so many games, the only phrase I have in mind is this--- &quot;preserved brilliance of execution&quot;. I hope the fourth game, if it will ever come someday, will be the sequel fans deserve, just as this accomplished masterpiece is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4834077">Expand</a></span>

<br>Stalker is not just the game that allows you to change or add the weapons. It allows you to change the global way of playing, so that you don&apos;t have play the game when it gets annoyed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203162">Expand</a></span>

Graphics ahead of its time, one of the first games to utilize tessellation.
<br>Game so fun you have to beat it more than once.
<br>Massive fan base that makes countless fun mods that include: Improved Graphics, Textures, animations, sound effects, new maps, monsters, items, weapons and the implement of online play.
<br>Story: you are an undercover military officer investigating the disappearance of multiple helicopters you are disguised as a stalker with just two weeks supply.
<br>The game drops you in a very difficult environment supply, trade and combat skills are key to survival, it may be very important sometimes to scout your area and must be careful when traveling at night so you don&#x2019;t stumble upon mutated beast or radiated anomalies.  High risk high reward is always a fun aspect for a game, this one shares that aspect when collecting artifacts in anomaly areas or when collecting loot during faction battles, before someone else does, while trying to not to become another by standard as bullets fly over your head.
<br>This game is one of my favorites it&#x2019;s a must buy for any Survival game fan that enjoys challenges in beautiful landscapes of horror</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793523">Expand</a></span>

So here&apos;s a game that can tryuly be called free roaming. STALKER has all the elements of an RPG rolled into an FPS, inventory, trade, repairing items and so on. It also has another element very rarely found in games - atmosphere. Wierd mutant creatures hiss and growl before leaping at your face.<br>So on paper it all sounds very good. Yet STALKER is let down by outdated code and outdated graphics. Both of which really should not be an issue whether a game is great or not. But having a jerky screen update in an FPS which requires you to be extremely accurate with your aiming is gaming suicide. Seeing 6 of the exact same character model standing around makes you feel you have entered a cloning facility. The textures look like they were made 10 years ago. I also find it odd that when the NPCs are away from you they speak in Russian yet when you interact with them they speak in English?? Either one or the other please. The missions are hardly ever clear and, indeed, part of the game seems to be figuring out what it is you are supposed to be doing. For many people, there just isn&apos;t that many hours in a day to spend wandering around aimlessly.<br>Some good ideas are in STALKER but unfortunately the game is let down by the execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604058">Expand</a></span>

I never play RPG&apos;s but this is not what I expected my first Stalker experience to be, there is a very hard learning curve and it felt like there was too much RPG and too little action. I doubt I&apos;ll revisit this game, fighting mutants was a chore for me and I didn&apos;t understand the emissions since there wasn&apos;t much to do while you waited them out although I wish there were. What I did like about Stalker: CoP was the post apocalyptic atmosphere and various weapon customization options, I felt that part was realistic and I found it neat but the graphical errors and tough game-play made me bring this down to a 5. I don&apos;t regret playing it though because I did enjoy the atmosphere and gun-play. To be fair, I&apos;m not sure if the issues were coming from my graphics card or the game, I used an EVGA GTX 460 SE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=3048414">Expand</a></span>

Well my fellow gamers God Of War 3 Blows away the compitition with Superior Graphics, Storyline and a No nonsense Badazz God Kratos destroying everythign in his path. I&apos;m telling you now that anyone who gives this game anything less than a 10 is an idiot. It&apos;s the best of everything a true Gamer would like in a game and the very best for this Generation. So my local Gamestop opens at 10am and i got there at 9:50am and there was a line out the door (about 30 people) I guess they all called out sick from work like i did lol. Of course I pre ordered the Ultimate Edition and If you didnt well, You&apos;re an idiot because Pandora&apos;s Box looks awesome and is bigger than I thpught it would be.(great place to keep my God of War collection:) Remember If you&apos;re thinking of getting this game you&apos;re an Idiot! If you&apos;re running out the door, tripping on that banana peel and end up in the hospital on the way to Gamestop you&apos;re an half idiot. If you make it there get the game and then go have Lunch afterwards before heading home to play, you&apos;re a Moran!. If you make it there in one piece , get the game, and come straight home and Play the Greatest Game to this point in time, well you&apos;re a Genius:) Hey just to let you in on a little secret! Even Fanboys were on line to pick up a Ps3 and the game lmao. Never thought I&apos;d see the day. I&apos;d like to give a Shoutout to Telegraph who scored Bayonatta above this Game lmao. (look for them on Metacritic reviews at the bottom) where they belong in the basement. Seemed they had to close there comment thread because real gamers caught on to their Bias and called them out! Guess they couldnt handle the pressure. The pressure of seeing GOW take flight and they didn&apos; t have a boarding pass!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1155002">Expand</a></span>

I played through the story a bit and here is where my review goes south. There was a lack of beginners tutorial on how to play the game. I explored many locations which seemed empty of any life to kill and loot, human or monster. There is no quick traveling except from specific nps&apos;s who may be a far walk from where you are at many points. Also the lack of character stats and skills is disappointing as in most arpgs nowadays that is a must have for multi play experience. I have heard rumor that Bethesda is taking rights to the stalker games and i will be happy as they will turn this god awful, fallout knock off around into a good game. 2 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2966423">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One thing this game gets (almost) right, is to give more directions and explanations to the player in specific areas (while leaving others in complete dark or drown under a lengthy description). I really appreciated the feedback on your status. Plus, you don&apos;t start as with amnesia or as go-fetch guy for a faction. You are basically sent into the Zone to investigate the lost of helicopters, and while sticking to your duty, you end up accepting some missions in order to get resources, that would come handy to use the services of the mechanic guy.
<br>
<br>Since most the overall gameplay is a mix of exploring, talking, retrieving and shooting ; your best friend is definitely the guy who can repair and upgrade your gear (who happen to deteriorate quite fast) and he&apos;s not cheap. Unfortunately, the &quot;tools&quot; missions are not located into the map, so it&apos;s better to check online walkthroughs and note the locations so you won&apos;t loose too much time and end up too weak for not finding them.
<br>
<br>The one and only part that feels quite out of place (date?) is the dialog window. Even if some characters can give you precious information, it breaks the flow and too often you end up with the same answers.
<br>
<br>All in all, the experience of being a &quot;stalker&quot; is quite nicely rendered, in a slightly more inviting way than the first two games. I don&apos;t think there is a better strategy to &quot;win&quot;, except maybe upgrading your armor and helmet to death, and finding / sticking to one combination of gun x ammo in a specific type (pistol, shotgun, smg, rifle, etc) then upgrade it to suit your play style. Always travel light (between 25 / 30 kg) to run long distance with caffeine boost ; and you should be OK.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=5583889">Expand</a></span>

Bottom line is - CoP feels more reaslistic. FLNV is occasionally almost cartoonesque with Fisto the robot and whilst gives it more scope for immersion, the immediate lack of safety you feel in CoP was something of a suprise.  The lack of any intorductory training session such as in the case of FL3 may appear to detract from the suspense, but I found it added to it. Whilst the initial frequency of weapons on the bodies of dead stalkers made me initially think that trading would be easy, the Deus Ex syle inventory means you have to keep a careful watch on what weapons you pick up. Whilst I would normally decry the lack of &quot;safe&quot; trading areas, where you can perform skill related tasks, the CoP character development is soley dependent on equipment. Consequently, it feels more fluid. Oblivion is let down by a lack of, not realism, but believablity. The towns are huge, yet only seem to have 50 inhabitants. FLNV has a diverse rage of NPC&apos;s, but the points-led gameplay allows an experience gamer to screw his/her way to senioritiy too easily - e.g. I killled mister House at level 8. From a saturday morning enjoyability perspective, I appreciated both FLNV and Oblivion more that CoP, however, the excruciating realism imparted by CoP far outweighs these shortcomings. I WAS ACTUALLY AFRAID whilst playing the game -- SPOILER ALERT - I carefully and methodically went through the whole of the Jupiter complex and nothing but dogs came at me --- SPOILER OVER. In short, CoP is a super game, which encompasses RPG and FPS very well. What CoP does well is present a reasonable picture of no-mans-land where people are with you or against you. Unlike (to a lesser extent) FLNV or Oblivion or indeed far cry2, where virtually everyone is against you outside of the &quot;safe areas&quot;.  The absence of scripted encounters with those who are either neutral or friendly, does much for the feeling that you one amongst many chancers, just trying to make a buck. That is not to say it is without fault. The varying value and apparent importance of artifacts addds an unnecessary mystical quality, which jams against the very well researched arsenal of conventional weapons at you disposal. FLNV and OB feel much more like a civilisation (even a spardely populated one) and some of their charm was non shooting related activity. In short,  OB and FLNV allow you to play the gentleman almost throughout,, CoP demands an unflinching ability to shoot **** and make sure you have ammo. In many respects the enitre system of CoP is like a zombie-infested version of Operation Flashpoint and anyone who has played that game, knows how much preparation is important.
<br>Pros. The atmosphere, the feeling of loneliness and desperation is excellently executing even if the english translation leaves much to be desired. The fellow stalkers lend a sense of realism that you are one of many.
<br>Cons. The lack of any deined rpg promotion makes you unsure whether you should be progressing to a certain stage. The obscure artifact system doesn&apos;t gel well with the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=1597625">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are alright, they get the job done. The thing that bothers me with this game is that it doesn&apos;t seem polished, shooting mechanics are stupid as bullets act as arrows dropping once they reach a point distance making long range combat near impossible. The game feels too dark and stingy, which yes fits the atmosphere but just gets depressing to look at after a while. Player models are recycled endlessly, I&apos;ve ran into the same two Stalkers at least ten times. You&apos;re given a main quest but there&apos;s so many extra quests that I feel kind of overwhelmed, I&apos;m worried I&apos;ll miss something if I progress without doing these. As opposed to Bethesda games that usually pull this off well, the open world and it&apos;s many side quests are a bit intimidating to anyone who doesn&apos;t enjoy such a long, long game. The game demands a lot of time from the player, so if you&apos;re not prepared to use up hours of your time to scour the zone then this game is not for you.<br><br>I got this game on sale, and I&apos;m reasonably happy with it, the atmosphere is fantastic and the joys of using your maintained and updated fire arms that you upgraded yourself is also another slight joy in this game. However the amount of **** you can do is so vast it&apos;s almost intimidating, the story is not interesting or driving in anyway as it&apos;s hard to root for your character when he&apos;s got as much personality as a tin of paint. Other characters are the same, so it&apos;s also difficult to try and symphasize with people who ask for your help. At the beginning of the game a bandit tells me he needs this artifact as his friend is dying, I without a second thought denied his offer and killed him and his little buddies. The game is not story driven in any way shape or form, it&apos;s driven simply by the players curiousity: What sort of artifacts can I find and sell, what sort of loot can I buy with this money? How should I upgrade my guns? This isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing, but it&apos;d be nice if I felt some want to continue playing this game  to the end.<br><br>Keep in mind I&apos;m scratching the very surface of this game with 5 hours played in total but I&apos;d love to know if it improves significantly. In short, STALKER Call of Pripyat is a gloomy looking post apocalyptic master piece but falls short in terms of story and characters but makes up for it in accurate representations of real guns and it&apos;s hours of gameplay. You will definitely get your moneys worth with this game but it&apos;s not for the faint of heart, as well as not being without it&apos;s faults. (Get&apos;s a 7 so far, but some personal citation is needed)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2059940">Expand</a></span>

The quest-log is less than perfect and you sometimes find yourself in situations where you dont know what you are supposed to do to advance. The game is not really beginner friendly,  it feels a bit stiff animation wise and the visuals are not the best. Overall the game feels a little bit like it is unfinished. Less so than its predecessor but the feeling is still there. The game does make up for most of its short coming though by being extremely atmospheric. This game is at its best when you are exploring an anomaly or sneaking through a mutant lair. And when the game is at its best few games can beat it. Sadly there is also all the running from point A to point B, all the time spent figuring out how stuff works by using google, all the time spent managing your inventory. A game like this need to have some ups and down but the ups could be a little more frequent and the downs could be a little less frequent. I don&apos;t want to sound to negative since i had great time playing this game. And if you are looking for a little bit different shooter with atmosphere so thick that you could slice it with a butter knife then Stalker Call of Pripyat may be the shooter for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786950">Expand</a></span>

<br>Side-missions were fun, and it was cool to receive a permanent bonus to interactions with NPCs after completing different groups&apos; missions.
<br>
<br>Fast travel and repairs are reasonably priced, which is a great improvement.
<br>
<br>The difficulty settings were improved, easy is now easy.
<br>
<br>The weight limit is still stifling, but fortunately you can now recover stamina while walking, which you couldn&apos;t do in the previous 2 games.  Certain ammo such as shotgun ammo is too heavy.
<br>
<br>One problem in all 3 STALKER games: running over railroad tracks and other small obstacles is unrealistic.  Your character treats them like mini hurdles.  If a person runs over something as small as railroad tracks, they don&apos;t have to slow down and jump over them, they simply place their feet to avoid the tracks.
<br>
<br>The weight limit is realistic (and annoying) but the stepping on railroad tracks is unrealistic (and annoying).  This inconsistency lowers the quality of the game.
<br>
<br>Bought for $3.33, played 15 hours, not recommended for many small flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=7418059">Expand</a></span>

Then it&apos;s a fantastic game, even a little bit better than STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. The setting, characters and graphics once again create an outstanding atmosphere that&apos;ll get you as close to a post-apocalyptic zone as your computer screen possibly can.</span>

<br>
<br>- Fantastic and tense atmosphere
<br>- Pretty bad AI: path finding of monsters is horrible, all enemies behave very predictable and sometimes don&apos;t attack you even though they stare at you
<br>- Mediocre story: story doesn&apos;t develop very well during the course of the game and the ending is somehow disappointing. I was very confused about the game ending all of the sudden and I guess the first thing that came to my mind was &quot;so that&apos;s it???&quot; Plus you won&apos;t even get a render scene at the end, just some pictures ...
<br>- Mediocre gameplay: some mechanics are just useless. Why do you have to eat at all, why even add such a feature which serves no purpose and if you do add it then why don&apos;t you have to drink? There&apos;s some sort of fast travelling implemented but it&apos;s most of the time faster to just walk/run to your destination instead of finding someone to take you there. You can&apos;t sell damaged weapons and repairing them costs more than the weapons are worth. I could list a lot more but long story short - the gameplay is sometimes clunky.
<br>
<br>Overall a good game, very close to a mediocre rating (less than 7) though. The atmosphere and scenery is what pushes the rating to 7 / 10 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4522168">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story in CoP takes up where SoC left off (although you play as a different character) so it seems fitting that I played the games in that order, missing out Clear Sky (for now). As with SoC, this is quite a tough game (no hand-holding here), although it didn&#x2019;t seem quite as tough as the original. It&#x2019;s also a good deal shorter, with the main storyline taking about 15 hours to complete (there are, of course, a fair few side quests, but I didn&#x2019;t complete all of them). The graphics are an improvement over the original, especially if you use some of the mods available. It&#x2019;s also less buggy. The voice acting is okay, if a little variable, as are the character animations. This is, in many ways, a straightforward continuation of what has gone before, and the impressive STALKER atmosphere is maintained along with the challenging gameplay. Despite the improvements, however, there is less diversity in the environments compared to those found in Soc, and the world is less expansive than it is in SoC. And the story, although more coherent, is somewhat lighter. But this is still an immersive and enjoyable game to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=6493107">Expand</a></span>

The music is well done but similar to the other Stalker games. The setting is dark and interesting but most of the characters are boring. The monsters are unique and while there are zombies they are also unique in that they can still use their guns with deadly accuracy. You realistically need food and water and you need to limit radiation and stem bleeding wounds to survive and you can only carry up to 60 lbs of weight so you actually have to micromanage your inventory and make sure you do not pick up too many bullets. Sometimes small skirmishes break out between the local inhabitants and I cannot tell whether the developers did it intentionally or if it just randomly occurred (which is cool). Unfortunately you do not spend enough time in the very creepy, and also amazingly wondrous city of Pripyat which is a real shame. Other than that it is a decent game and a really gone one for people who like to play realistic and complex survivor games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=3218846">Expand</a></span>

I played the game for 150+ the story just sucks you in and wont let you go! BitComposer did very well with this title with adding certain elements to the core gameplay from Clear Sky such as the armor and weapon modifications. STALKER Call of Pripyat has a pretty extensive mod selection too which include graphical enhancements that bring the game to modern generation graphics. Call of Pripyat is also a good starter game with the series. It&apos;s not so hard that you will rage (Shadow of Chernobyl) and not extensively buggy (Clear Sky) but i&apos;d recommend that if you cannot figure out the controls and need to be pampered for a tutorial then find a guide online instead of bashing the game for a lack of tutorial. I give this a game a 9/10 for the graphics and sometimes extremely hard gameplay (Pripyat tunnell).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466386">Expand</a></span>

The pricing for artifacts are mind blowing i mean 11,000 rubles for a common stone flower?!?. The only thing that i wish they would change would be the blowouts. They are kinda boring but with a few mods they can be made to look awesome</span>

Setting the Master difficulty is highly recommended, because on lower difficulties both your and the enemies&apos; weapons have a chance to do zero damage per shot. You waste more bullets. On Master - a headshot to an unprotected human from pretty much any gun -takes them out. To your character - same, enless you have a military helmet and shot by less than a sniper rifle
<br>
<br>You get sorta realistic bullet speeds and drop. Gotta take into account both range and target speed to hit anything, esp. with the subsonic 9x39 rounds.
<br>
<br>However weapon accuracy is silly: an unmodified AK-74, and many other rifles - can&apos;t land a headshot on a human from as little as like 50m. This is where the RPG element comes in...
<br>All guns have a 3-stage upgrade tree, with 4-6 things to pick from on each stage. And that usually includes 2 or 3 accuracy upgrades. So to make those upgrades worth anything - the unmodified guns have disgusting accuracy.
<br>
<br>The game levels are a bit small to have real sniping distances (not as cramped as in i.e. Mass Effect where anything over 20m is considered sniper range, but much smaller than i.e. Operation Flashpoint where you actually get to shoot at guys over 500m away). So gun ranges are &quot;adjusted&quot; accordingly:
<br>Shotguns (with buckshot): good at 0 - 10m.
<br>Assault rifles: can land a headshot up to about 40m. Up to 80m with accuracy upgrades. No need for a scope - even with iron sights your range is capped by the spread, not ability to see your target.
<br>Sniper rifles (which are rare elite weapons): good up to 150m. With upgrades up to about 250m - about as far as the engine lets you see.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t experience any issues with not being able to simply run over railroad tracks, unlike Claytality posted below.
<br>In fact physics are pretty well-balanced, one of the few games where I&apos;d say fall damage is just right.
<br>
<br>RPG classics take it&apos;s effect on NPC traders as well: MP-5 selling price say 6&apos;000r - buyout price like 800r :-D
<br>
<br>There are some scripted missions that disrupt the flow and atmosphere a bit, go against what the rest of the game teaches you, and look cheesy or uncalled for.
<br>Like some NPC: &quot;come on, drop down this hole with me!&quot;. With no obvious way out. And there are other places in the game where if you jump down well you&apos;re stuck with no way out. With god knows what downstairs. Turned out lots of sleeping monsters. Scripted to be sleeping, and not disturbed by a bunch of shooting just above. And you gotta sneak past them. I like &quot;natural&quot; sneaking mechanics, but not scripted ones like this.
<br>Also some silly obstacles like a 5m tall ledge with a 60deg slope. Just a bit too steep to walk up it. A couple stacked barrels would have been enough but no - Grab any portable ladder or a rope with some hook at the end? No, gotta use a spacial anomaly to teleport on top of the ledge!
<br>
<br>Tha AI is OK but nothing super sophisticated. Companion AI is very dumb, esp. on the mission in Pripyat vs Monolith.
<br>
<br>The zone, esp. Zaton - seems a bit overpopulated with NPCs. It&apos;s like a popular hiking area rather than dangerous isolated place. Some mutant corpses stay for days, and quickly make it littered with corpses like every 20m.
<br>
<br>Overall the world is very dense - you can be within earshot of two distinct areas at the same time. Some NPCs tell stories how they had to &quot;take a trip&quot; from one to the other. &quot;The trip took you like, 20 seconds?..&quot;
<br>
<br>The game tries to be open-world sandbox, but it&apos;s a bit heavy on the &quot;box&quot; part. And if SoC was a box with very few people besides the player, and relatively rare but deadly mutant attacks - in CoP it&apos;s hard to walk 100 steps without hearing or seeing some kind of action going on - either Duty guys shooting bandits, or bandits shooting loners, or any of the above factions - shooting weaker mutants, weak mutants chasing/biting pigs... Or (less common) - stronger mutants tearing apart ANYTHING that moves. Carnage everywhere, every day.
<br>
<br>High-end mutants only start spawning randomly after you&apos;ve been &quot;introduced&quot; to them through some scripted encounters.
<br>
<br>There is lots of NPC relationship development. Which kinda makes sense, but is also rather spontaneous.
<br>
<br>The music is awesome. Esp. to the Russian ear. The Stalker jokes and idle chatter is funny at first but get repetitive waay to often - they are RNG-based and you can sometimes hear the same joke repeat 3 times within 5 minutes at one of the stalker hubs. Although there are some that I only heard once in &gt;10 hours, so it has it&apos;s charm.
<br>
<br>The game progression is by no means a corridor shooter though - the starter location, Zaton, has a lot of NPCs and content that you&apos;ll be returning to multiple times throughout the game. The 2nd location - Yanov - you can go to very early in the game, but just going there doesn&apos;t mean much by itself.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is very good, captivating atmosphere and well-paced progression. And I haven&apos;t encountered any bugs so far, nor any major flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=7571954">Expand</a></span>

Here the Pripyat town could have been more immersive and complete, as it is the last map you reach. More similar to the real one...only a few empty buildings, instead. No swimming pool, no ferris wheel....but the game remains one of those games you feel bad completing it. 32 hours to do more or less everything. 85/100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4429977">Expand</a></span>

Missions were cool, seems like some of the missions disappear  in the game and you can&apos;t solve them.  Pripyat was a big disappointment, some of the missions, that seemed like very important plot points, you were not able to pick back up.   They seem like they ran out of story after you get to pripyat, like 3 missions with the colonel&apos;s men and you&apos;re forced to &quot;Get to Da&apos; Choppa&apos;&quot;. and there&apos;s no going back.. kinda lame... overall It was a good game, I&apos;ve played through it twice now, and I still feel pripyat was waaay rushed and alittle Underwhelming,  Which effects this games&apos; overall playability.  Graphics are nice, nothing to write home about.  cloud effects and sky effects almost Make this game.  Beautiful.  Sounds are alittle muted, gunshots sound like they were recorded in an room with all of the walls insulated.  Character dialogue sometimes switches from English to Russian, without warning.  Not all dialogue is translated if you choose Russian language with subtitles&apos;.  Nice single player RPG  you never really get lost in it, this was the second STALKER game I&apos;ve played, I hated SOC(sorry), and I found it to be way more satisfying than the first one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4467197">Expand</a></span>

I started with the first title, Shadow of Chernobyl, and although it was atmospheric, I didn&apos;t like some of the mechanics. So, I decided to try Call of Pripyat. This one grabbed me right from the beginning and didn&apos;t let go right until the ending, which left me wanting more. Being a fan of bleak, post-apocalyptic scenarios a la Fallout, I have to say this game is the ultimate post-apocalyptic experience. The environments (Atmosfear 3 visual mod highly recommended, along with the absolute texture mods), the setting (welcome to the Zone, stalker), the large open world (divided into 3 large areas) full of mysterious and terrifying elements, the horrific creatures roaming around, just great! Gameplay is a mix of FPS mechanics and RPG elements (speech decisions, inventory, equipment upgrade, modifiers, etc.) and it pretty much takes the best from both worlds. The AI is smart and different tactics are required for different enemies. Weapons are of great variety and feel (and sound) very realistic. Supplies and ammo aren&apos;t exactly scarce since there is a presence of trades and money isn&apos;t hard to come by with all the &quot;stalking&quot; involved, but carry weight is limited meaning you will have to prioritizes with your guns and ammo. This game is simply one of the best gaming experiences I&apos;ve ever had in the almost 20 years of paying video games.
<br>The reason for taking a point away is an underwhelming ending, which came abruptly and didn&apos;t make much sense. However, the game presents you with the option to remain in the Zone after the ending in case you didn&apos;t finish all of your quests. In any case, it is a pity that the last map, the city of Chernobyl itself, wasn&apos;t better utilized as it is simply amazing. Therefore, I can&apos;t call SOC a perfect game, but it is damn near-perfect. Highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=4585589">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Performance isn&apos;t that great but a modern PC should run it fine. Parallax and lighting settings seem to work only when they feel like it. IF you can get it to run maxed out it looks rather pretty.
<br>
<br>Combat is unnecessarily hard: NPCs have laser like accuracy but your gun will always spread all over the place no matter how long you wait for it to aim. Melee attackers can phase through walls if you&apos;re hidden behind one but technically in range. Higher difficulty settings are clearly untested (if at all).
<br>Standing on a tiny rock keeps you save from all melee attacks.
<br>
<br>Animations and scripts feel very mechanical and break the immersion more than just once.
<br>
<br>While the overall setting and story in STALKER is pretty enjoyable you have to play stupid in this one if you have played the prequels. The &apos;plot twists&apos; feel like &quot;everybody in the zone knows that, why did I have to do all this crap?&quot; - Only because the devs don&apos;t allow you to ask the right questions.
<br>
<br>Exploration finally rewards you (stashes are NOT empty until you get their coordinates from NPCs) but the 3 big maps only have so many few points of interests. Most of these you&apos;ll visit by going through the quest line leaving you with nothing else to explore. Indoor and underground areas are VERY rare even compared to the prequels.
<br>
<br>STALKER had all the right ideas and COP was a step in the right direction but it came little to late and the lack of polish shines through everywhere. I&apos;d rather recommend SOC or CS (with or without their respective Complete-mod) and only touching this one if you&apos;re really hungry for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=5106598">Expand</a></span>

Exploring the Zone around Tschernobyl with all its mutants, bandits, Stalkers (Artifact hunters and looters who want to get rich by the abnormalities of the Zone), anomalies and really dangerous types of mutant creatures is a real pleasure. Especially when using some kind of mod that supports your own playstyle. I heavily enjoyed the difficult and realistic of the Misery mod. (But definitely on Rookie mode for the first playthrough)
<br>
<br>Also the weapon selection is quite refreshing. There are a lot of iconic weapons avaible, from the AK to the XM8 to the G36 to the MP5 to the Spas shotung to the M4 etc. etc. If I had to compare the feeling to it, I would say Counter-Strike fits the game regarding the gun variety.
<br>
<br>I definitely recommend this game, even if the graphics are somewhat outdated. The atmosphere and rich mod scene compensate for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-call-of-pripyat/user-reviews?user_review_id=5664759">Expand</a></span>
