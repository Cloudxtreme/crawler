Magicka 2.... is just boring.  Magicka 1 was a breakthrough, Magicka 2 is basically the same however, not so funny. They tried to make it more difficult in order to favor the coop experience and probably sell more DLC&apos;s with itens or weapons or robes. I am not saying the game have no improvements, it has, but they missed the spot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5364365">Expand</a></span>

The original Magicka had crazy robes that made you absorb lightning, Tank, Crusader or even Tentacle robes. Here you have fireman&apos;s robes that give you +20% fire resistance but -20% something else. It&apos;s boring! Where are my cool weapons? Crossbows, Machine guns, Lightsabers? Nope, you again have your boring weapons that have boring small bonuses. The game is small there are way less levels and the levels are way less varied and crazy. I&apos;ve been in Mexican hell and ancient dwarven ruins in Magicka 1 but here - forests and the castle from the previous game. There wasn&apos;t much more than that. The game is short has a few more mechanics (not too many though), has less than 30% the amount of magicks the previous one had and you are really limited by stupid things such as focus regeneration or spell nerfs. There is almost nothing that Magicka 1 didn&apos;t have but it&apos;s balanced which also means madly limited. I don&apos;t recommend buying it for more than the price of a Magicka 1 DLC. Some of them have more content than this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5369117">Expand</a></span>

This is how the original Magicka game should have been.
<br>
<br>However it doesn&apos;t feel like much of a sequel as it does a polished recreation. There&apos;s some new spells but it&apos;s mostly the same and not much in terms of creativity has been added. Also, heads up, a decent group of players can get through the entire game in about 4 hours. If you&apos;re new to Magicka this may be more like 6-10 hours due to the learning curve. The game can be very punishing if you&apos;re new. It depends heavily on your teammates, as it is possible for one skilled player to carry an entire team and rush you through all the chapters. Also keep in mind that this is a $15 game on launch day, it&apos;s scope can feel rather narrow at times and leave you wanting more.
<br>
<br>Anyways, the polish that I&apos;m talking about isn&apos;t in graphics, bugs, or performance, but gameplay. The original Magicka had some terrible balancing issues. Where a few specific spell combos were so incredibly powerful that they rendered the potentially hundreds of spells you could use down to about 2-3 all purpose kill everything spells. You may see some people complaining about no longer being able to combine lightning, water, fire, and ice the same way you could before. These were the over powered combos that killed every and any enemy virtually instantly. They were so over powered you could kill every boss in the game in a matter of seconds with minimal effort.
<br>
<br>This appears to be fixed in Magicka 2. Enemies seem to come with much more elemental strengths and weaknesses that you have to play to and constantly adjust. That spell that worked really well in the previous area might bring your doom in the next. Fire may have smoked that one bad guy, but it&apos;s going to heal the one right next to him. The over powered spells have been either removed or nerfed. As well as many other spells have been tweaked to prevent easy all purpose kills. You now have to constantly adapt, try new spells, and switch up what elements you&apos;re using on the fly.
<br>
<br>This is how the original Magicka should have been. A game that both encourages and rewards a wide and diverse play style due to it&apos;s nature of having hundreds of possible spell combinations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5281969">Expand</a></span>

<br>Being a huge fan of the original Magicka with over 90 hours logged I had a certain expectation of quality. I have almost completed the game though I can tell that the changes made to the combat really ruined what made the original such a unique title. The new casting system is reliant on a gamepad and has cut out a huge amount of spell combinations.
<br>
<br>Magicka 2&apos;s casting system just seems really plain compared to the original, from what I gather they wanted to balance out the casting system by removing overpowered spells to make it more focused around identifying the weaknesses of particular enemies though now the combat feels incredibly slow paced and boring.
<br>
<br>As of writing this I&apos;m 2/3 through the game, the story mode is significantly shorter. Thankfully the writing still maintains the quality it had in Magicka, and the graphics have been updated, but the pacing of the game is just disappointing overall. I hope that the DLCs improve the game though I seriously doubt they will change the core mechanics of the game which they have really gutted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5285608">Expand</a></span>

<br>I haven&apos;t completed game yet so this review maybe unfair but I am so disappointed and no motivation to play. Because there are too much unnecessary change from Magicka1. I am big fan of Magicka1.
<br>
<br>1:Secondary elements changed
<br>In Magicka1, casting Water and Cold and then these two elements are combined and become one element (Ice). Water and Fire and then Steam, too. Ice and Steam. These secondary elements don&apos;t have character of water even they are made of water. That is the point. I can combine secondary elements with Lightning so there are many fun combination. But in Magicka2 they are deleted.
<br>
<br>2:Lightning takes over Arcane
<br>When I cast Arcane and Lightning for example, shot as the Arcane of Lightning. But in Magicka2 on same case, shot as Lightning of Arcane. Effective long range attacks are reduced so much in conclusion with reason1. I miss Steam-Lightning-Arcane.
<br>
<br>3:&apos;Click and move&apos; doesn&apos;t suit for this game
<br>In Magicka1, mouse drag to direction where want to go is the way to move. In Magicka 2, adding to that, one click and auto move. This doesn&apos;t suit for this game. In chaos of enemies, mistakes happens so often. I want to disable this or choose one way to move.
<br>
<br>4:Why the hell there is NOT key bind setting
<br>Totally ununderstandable.
<br>
<br>5:Magics in Hotkeys
<br>This smashes fun of Magicka game.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>I love Magicka&apos;s creativity. I love it requires skills and practicing,too. Strong Magics are very complicated to cast, hard to remember. Simple combinations do very little damage but some very complicated combinations are so much powerful and fun and so creative to fight.
<br>
<br>But in Magicka2, many of them are so simplified. It maybe nice change for Biginners,Wizard Wars players,controller users and PS4 players, but for fans of Magicka1.
<br>
<br>Only nice soundtracks remind me of Magicka. But this is more like nightmare.

<br>
<br>THIS IS NOT THE MAGICKA I FOUGHT DAEMONS FOR
<br>Here&apos;s a trillion reasons why this game sucks.
<br>
<br>THE SPELLS
<br>The spell system has been lobotomized - there are now no efficient ways of killing anything and the skill cap is barely half an inch off the ground. The whole point of getting good in Magicka was knowing good spells, improvisation and casting fast enough to heat the keyboard to thermonuclear levels. There is no fast casting now, everything is charged or channeled, even the damned mines have to lie there for a while before they are of any use. There are no good spells because every spell is equally pathetically weak now. There is no flexibility because no matter what you cast it just works the same, that is barely even works.
<br>
<br>Projectiles suck because you have to charge them for eternity to actually hurt anything.
<br>
<br>Charging mines suck because nobody ever used them as actual mines anyway.
<br>
<br>Fire sucks because everything regenerates and anything but focused fire does jack sh*t.
<br>
<br>Freezing sucks because frozen things are now stupidly hard to kill. Especially in singleplayer it&apos;s just unusable.
<br>
<br>Steam sucks because its only purpose was to boost lightning.
<br>
<br>Not being able to extinguish oneself while having water immunity sucks.
<br>
<br>Lightning sucks because it can&apos;t be added to beams. Arcanized lightnings have no sense, it&apos;s just adding plain, boring damage to a spell which already is all about damage. The whole point of adding arcane to lightning was increasing the range.
<br>
<br>THE ENEMIES
<br>The enemies suck too. They shifted from crowds of cannon fodder to being the freaking Terminator. The goblins in Magicka 1 were not there to be a threat, but to be bombarded with fireballs and run around screaming in a kinaesthetically pleasing way. The trolls, orcs, beholders, mages and all the rest - they were the real enemy. Now not only the trolls, but also the regular soldiers, the goblins and even the damned peasants are made of kevlar. You&apos;re no longer a powerful wizard, you&apos;re an idiot in a bathrobe throwing colorful lights at things.
<br>
<br>The enemies are also really boring, you fight the same generic dudes in pointlessly fancy armor and glowing weapons 90% of the time. The other 10% is bugs. Magicka 1 had orcs, daemons, dwarves, bugs, undead and several tricky monsters too. There are no cool bosses either. Where is the Reaper, the Fafnir, the Jormungandr of this game? Only the final boss is actually interesting.
<br>
<br>Everybody has elemental attacks too. I get this was supposed to make the game more challenging, but instead it&apos;s just annoying because it DECREASES THE CONTROL THE PLAYER HAS OVER THEIR WIZARD. 90% of the time you&apos;re trying not to be burning, wet, chilled, on the ground or in the air just for a freaking second instead of ACTUALLY FIGHTING. There is no way to defend from the bombardment of annoying crowd control attacks, because the shields and armors barely block anything now, the walls are weak and the auras only really protect from one element.
<br>
<br>Except from the disruptor magick, which blocks casting, in a game built entirely around casting, and so just pointlessly stretches the fight.
<br>
<br>Enemies have way too much health too, killing them is just slow and tedious, especially and lower difficulties. Adding a weakness to one element fixes nothing because it rewards using the same one or two spells over and over again.
<br>
<br>THE GEAR
<br>The eqipment sucks. Magicka 1 had a helload of weapons which were mainly here just for sh*ts and giggles. Most of them were useless and that&apos;s why obtaining a strong weapon felt like an achievement. Now every weapon is close to useless because of the balance this game never needed.
<br>
<br>The robes suck as well. Magicka 1 had robes for everyone - some were there just for the looks (if you wanted to look sleek without any side effects), others could change the game completely. Magicka 2 robes just shuffle around some resistances and that&apos;s it. They&apos;re also not as varied and crazy as Magicka 1 robes.
<br>
<br>The magicks suck. They can&apos;t be cast in quick succession anymore, further reducing the reward from memorizing and learning to cast quickly while also slowing the game down. There&apos;s too few of them too. Magicka 1 allowed to completely change the playstyle just by using some magicks one normally doesn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>THE CONTROLS
<br>The &quot;click to go&quot; movement sucks, it feels unresponsive and more like Diablo than the top down shooter Magicka is supposed to be. It&apos;s also annoying when you automatically send your wizard into a crowd of enemies just because you put the cursor on them to aim better.
<br>
<br>The menu sucks, it&apos;s not ergonomic at all on PC.
<br>
<br>NON-GAMEPLAY THINGS
<br>The humor sucks because there barely is any in the latter half of the game.
<br>
<br>Even the world sucks. Gicka 1&apos;s Midgard was a simple and full of cliches old enough not to be annoying anymore. It had barbaric orcs, sneaky goblins, evil warlocks and ugly demons. It was simultaneously a parody and</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5290395">Expand</a></span>

The interface has many non-standard elements and the choices they made are clunky to say the least. It might be enjoyable for a team of kids to play, but even that application would be limited.  Would not recommend you purchase this product.</span>
