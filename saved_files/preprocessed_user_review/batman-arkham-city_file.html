Yes the game was a month late, yes DX11 features will slow down your game, when it should, in fact, speed it up, yes there is SecuRom, and yes its on GWFL. However, none of that really matters, a month later? Who fricking cares, yes I had some of it spoiled, but I should have kept away from the batman forums to be sure. Still the story keeps me intrigued, the combat is insanely good, and the atmosphere is amazing. Can&apos;t do much about GFWL and SecuRom, they don&apos;t make the game worse, they are just bad choiced to safeguard against people playing without paying. The DX11 thing is something that they already are aware of, and they will fix it. So, if your that angered by it, wait before you buy it, or if you already bought it, don&apos;t play until the patch is out. Until that patch there are lots of goodies to play meanwhile, like Skyrim and Battlefield 3.<br>As stated earlier this games combat is awesome, and works even better on mouse and keyboard than its predecessor. I have had no troubles whatsoever, and the troubles I did have came from me not being used to the combat system, not because it was bad.<br>The graphics are gorgeous beyond belief, even in DX9 it looks good, I can also run at almost max with max PhysX on my GTX460, only thing I have turned down is AA at 16x .<br>The sound is awesome, including the voice acting, The Joker is especially, like last game, really good. But most all of the voice acting done here is awesome.<br>I can&apos;t find any fault with this game other than the DX11 problem, and that will be fixed, so a solid 10/10 and this game leaves me wondering what will be GOTY. To me it is between this, battlefield 3 (the MP is sooooo solid), The Witcher 2 and Skyrim. All are 9 or 10 out of 10 in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1974635">Expand</a></span>

The game was compiled in September and not a single file was updated or ever changed. It was completed at the same time as the console version but they wanted to milk that first. They knew many people would be impatient and get for the console and then buy the pc version later. They also knew many people got the game for free with Nvidia cards and would buy it for their console with the pc version being delayed. Not only was the game never worked on in those 5 weeks, its clear not one single person at Rocksteady even play tested the game in DX11. All it takes is ONE minute of gameplay to know that DX11 has major issues. Gpu usage just plummets in areas where it should go up so that results in huge framerate drops and hitching. It is not playable in DX11 or at least not in an enjoyable  way. DX9 seems okay for the most part but physx does not seem to be running as well as it should be.  The cut scenes are pretty stuttery looking with audio a bit out of sync in them too even though indicated framerate is at 60 fps. And many people, including myself, have had a few crashes too even in DX9. Other than all that the gameplay is pretty good. Still its hard to give the game a good score based on the overall situation that Rocksteady has placed the pc gamers in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1975151">Expand</a></span>

<br>the gameplay is pretty repetitive (though you try starting the same game over 5+ times and see how much variety YOU see) and honestly it feels like dx11 does nothing for it at all.

<br>i loved AA, i really like batman in general, and i do enjoy a good beat em up, but there is no way i can imagine anyone saying the pc version of this game is NOT **** i got it free with my gtx 580 and i STILL feel i got ripped off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1973587">Expand</a></span>

Besides the problems with DX11 that the game had in its release (I didn&apos;t buy it for PS3 to get the game in PC so I feel really angry when DX11 didn&apos;t work), Batman Arkham City is what I call &quot;the game that makes you feel the experience of live in a new world&quot; (it also applies to Red Dead Redemption for example). I really recommend this game and then start to wait for the next one, because the end allows to make a lot of new stories for a next game of the series. And yes, I want more Catwoman, is great to play with her.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2477688">Expand</a></span>

This game is the ultimate Batman game you should definitely play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2697176">Expand</a></span>

Improving on the previous Batman game (Arkham Asylum) and adding new content to it, it&apos;s a must play if you&apos;re a fan of Batman (and even if you&apos;re not). The only bad thing I can say about it is the few bugs and glitches.</span>

In Arkham Asylum, it&apos;s very clear from the beginning what&apos;s going on:  Joker has seized control of the Asylum.  But in Arkham City ... who is this guy Strange?  Why does he know who Batman is?  Why was Batman put in Arkham City?  What&apos;s wrong with Joker?  Certainly this is a mystery (and continuation of Arkham Asylum) and I suppose part of the game is the unraveling of the plot.  However, at first I had a hard time getting into it.  The first &quot;mission&quot;, freeing the hostages, was quite difficult compared with AA.
<br>
<br>Now, as I got INTO the game, I REALLY started to enjoy it.  BUT, there were just too many characters, too many subplots.  It got confusing after awhile.  As well, I ignored the Riddler trophies at first because I had NO clue how to unlock them.  A little help, an optional tutorial, would have been good.  As it was, it got to the end of the story before I really got into picking up the trophies, and then what was left?  HUNDREDS of freakin&apos; trophies.  Now this might have been a LOT more fun if I had done it here and there throughout the game.
<br>
<br>As it was, in large part because there was no hint as to how to unlock the trophies, or how to go about the buttons, etc., no clues suggesting that some of these would unlock be available to unlock AFTER gaining certain gadgets, I&apos;m left with one long repetitive puzzle game at the end.
<br>
<br>Granted, I enjoy some of the puzzles.  But the controls are just TOO imprecise to do some of the tricks well.  I&apos;m not a guy who likes to play the same little jump over and over until I get it.  It would be nice if a few of these puzzles required a little more brains and a little less timing and button mashing ... especially when Batman&apos;s flying and grappling is often very difficult to control.  Or maybe I&apos;m just too old for this game.
<br>
<br>This game has a lot of fun and good elements to it, but overall, I ended my time in Arkham City feeling frustrated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805167">Expand</a></span>

It has been an extremely long time since I played a game until the end and was upset it was over.
<br>This game was done right. ANY gamer can appreciate its amazing world, writing, and game-play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3020320">Expand</a></span>

The AR missions were a breeze using the Keyboard/Mouse when compared to the PS3 controller!<br><br>It looks far better on PC too (I only have a GTX295 so DX11 is a no go for me anyway). Only real issues so far are 1) the long startup time when initially firing it up, 2) GFWL (although so far it hasn&apos;t lost any of my saves in quite a while unlike with Arkham Asylum), 3) having to keep my disc in the tray (luckily there was a &quot;community&quot; patch to fix that up...it&apos;s bad enough I didn&apos;t get a proper case with my CE but I guess the book will keep it sort of safe) and 4) having to wait so damn long after the console release (it&apos;s true - having played it a little on console before the PC release didn&apos;t help my thirst).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1993694">Expand</a></span>

As for the game, It&apos;s not quite as good as Arkham Asylum.  The more open world is liberating, but stressful, as everything feels more cluttered.  The focused story of the previous game almost allowed the player to relax more and take their time, whereas this time around the opposite is true.  This is still a great game, I just wish they had cut some of the more superfluous content.  It&apos;s not often that I suggest removing things from a game, but this is one of those cases.  Great game, but those with OCD to collect and finish all content be warned - it will take you a while, and likely lead to frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2139007">Expand</a></span>

I loved Arkham Asylum and was somewhat suspicious about whether the sequel would be able to put in enough new features to make it a worthy sequel. Fortunately I had no reason to worry because this is another perfect example of taking the really good parts from the first game and innovate on this; the open world, more upgrades, several compelling stories (although the premise of a city dedicated to contain the most violent and horrible criminals does seem a bit silly). All this plus a really surprising ending made this game one of my top 10 all-time favorite games.
<br>
<br>And precisely because of this I feel I have to address something I would never otherwise do in a review. A lot of these reviews have been positive and some of them have also been negative, mostly centering around technical issues and bugs which I completely understand. I haven&apos;t encountered any serious bugs or glitches in this game but I can perfectly relate to having bought a game only to learn that it is full of bugs and crashes, making it completely unplayable - it hurts even more when you have high expectations and the price is high. But giving this game a 0 is just downright lazy. Think about all the games you have ever seen or played in your entire life and then look at the rating scale from 0-10. I would like to see 0 and 10 as the absolute worst/best games I have ever played and I will reserve those scores when they are appropriate and trust me there are a lot of games out there that are far more worse than batman Arkham City.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2400056">Expand</a></span>

The retarded GFWL will not let me download the DLC that I have paid for. So that would be the last time I pay for a GFWL game ever.

Rocksteady took Arkham Asylum and amplified everything to the MAX. One of the finest stories I&apos;ve ever experienced meets the best superhero gameplay conceived to make one of the greatest games I&apos;ve played in the last decade. AA got a little repetitive and the end boss encounter was too hackneyed whereas not only does AC fix all that, it expands the arena as well as the challenges. Enemies while based on the prototypical thug almost come in more variations than can be handled by one man. Many hoods come with their own weaponry or else can pick them up when dropped. Each weapon or gadget in use alters the class of the enemy and beating each requires the use of independent solutions. So it gets very interesting when they come at you all at once. Batman has more gadgets than I could dish out and yet you have to use all of them at various points to beat the game. It is in this shifting dynamic during both hand to hand combat and predator gameplay that the game achieves true brilliance. The catwoman segment was interesting while Riddler&apos;s puzzles are now more like minigames in their own right and he&apos;s not the only villain dogging your footsteps. Every character in this is hugely memorable and the story does not let up one bit, right down to the cataclysmic climax.<br><br>No major technical issues to report. The game chugged at DX11 for me so I stuck to DX9. Authentication was ok but GFW does not agree with my firewall so the game required a prelaunch prep. I really can&apos;t think of a flaw to speak of, except that I may not replay the game at the higher difficulty unlocked mode because I don&apos;t think my wrists can handle the strain. Buy this game, it&apos;s getting seriously underrated here. 9.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2018534">Expand</a></span>

The only downside is that DirectX 11 is not working yet, and I&apos;m not sure if it ever will (that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t give it a perfect score). The good news is that the DirectX 9 graphics alternative is also terrific. Definitively a keeper.</span>

Here I thought that Batman Arkham Asylum couldn&apos;t be topped.  Arkham City proved me wrong and more than I thought.<br><br>OK, so there&apos;s the aesthetics: beautifully rendered, designed, laid out, composed - whatever you want to call it - it&apos;s simply stunning.  The costumes and character designs are vivid and imaginative (Catowman = :^O).  The locales, architecture and mapping is magnificent.  I truly felt like I was in Arkham City the whole time.<br><br>Sound:  Brilliant.  Crisp, reactive and vibrant.  The environmental sounds are realistic, the gadgets and weapons are full and quick and the voice-over work - well - there is no other game with such impressive performances as this.  Again, Mark Hammill just explodes here with some incredible dialogue and talent.  Kevin Conroy, as always is the perfect voice for Batman.  All the other characters, including the thugs, are just fantastic. Story:  The greatest story ever told in a video game.  It&apos;s elaborate, imaginative, exciting and entertaining in every respect.  Paul Dini and company have written a masterpiece.<br><br>Gameplay:  Fluid and simple.  Granted, at first, I didn&apos;t get it quick enough, but once you get used to the controls it&apos;s very easy to play.  The fighting system is just amazing with it&apos;s one-on-one (or more) tactics and the use of quick-fire gadgets make it direct.  The array of gadgets is creative and diverse and they all can be used against enemies as well as the environment.  The Riddler challenges and other challenges are just that: challenging: Most aren&apos;t but there are a considerable amount of them that are not easy to find or reach.  Playing Catwoman is just as fun but limited since she doesn&apos;t have as many gadgets or armor.  The combat combos are clever and aren&apos;t as easy as one would think to implement which gives the game more of a challenge.<br><br>Replay value is excellent with the separate combat challenges for Batman and Catwoman out fo the story arc.  The extras like concept art and character trophies are gorgeous.  There&apos;s also the back stories for all the characters that can be read in game as well as the audio files for their sessions in Arkham with Prof. Strange and the audio messages left for Batman.<br><br>It&apos;s all the detail, devotion and attention to the story gameplay that make this such an incredible experience.  There are no issues visually but my game did crash a few times, so aside from that there are no programming problems on my end.  My PC had no problems running the game at all the highest settings with DX11.<br><br>This folks, is a true masterpiece.  Batman Arkham City is a triumph.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2330742">Expand</a></span>

Still a GREAT game, especially for $15.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2380884">Expand</a></span>

The combat has improved in every way from the original, the storyline is less linear, the world is much more open, and you get to play as different characters. In every way this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is a perfect blend of stealth, puzzles, brawling, exploring, and using one&apos;s brain. The graphics are very good and the game plays well on my mediocre rig even on max, which is excellent. The voice acting is truly exceptional, with Mark Hamill returning as Joker. The only personal complaint I have is that Games for Windows Live deleted my save data when I was 70 hours in or so, which was very frustrating. Other than that, though, this is an exemplary game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861314">Expand</a></span>

Is just great to switch characters with Robin and Nightwing in the Riddler&apos;s Revenge too. A great game in all aspects and with no big errors.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2860943">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;ve played Arkham Asylum and you were wondering how it would even be possible to make a better Batman video game given the constraints of today&apos;s graphics engines and hardware, well you wouldn&apos;t be alone. Somehow, WB have done themselves proud and not only improved the combat mechanics, stealth mechanics and core gameplay mechanics, but they&apos;ve also come out with a much more thorough and amazing plot. This game has to be experienced. Once I started this game I couldn&apos;t stop and had to keep playing for the 20 hrs it took me to finish the main storyline and about half of the side missions (took another 6 hrs to finish all the riddler missions). You will get sucked in. You will become batman. You will laugh, you will cry, you will even begin to question whether Batman is doing the right thing. Simply put, this is the single must play for 2011 probably only losing to the Witcher 2 in required gaming. Sure the GfWL requirement is annoying and the failure to release the game with DX11 in a working condition is slightly annoying, but switching over to DX9 on my 2 yr old hardware ran the game at 1080p with everything at max at 60fps with physx off. Even in dx9 this still had a noticeable bump in visual fidelity vs. Batman:AA and for that I commend WB on the extra work done in polishing the PC version. Also the catwoman extra missions and change in combat mechanics are great and work seamlessly with the storyline. 10/10. Cannot wait for the next iteration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981856">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Batman Arkham City is the best game of the year, on my mind. I playing this game with very very big pleasure. A I don&apos;t like that DirectX 11 working very bad. Wait the patch. But I think that Arkham City is better than Arkham Asylum: new interesting story, many famous persons of DC Comics, new gameplay elements and many many others. It is ideal game about Batman.</span>

Although some are frustrated at the game from a technical perspective, it still doesn&apos;t distract from one of the best games of the year if not the best.</span>

The game is VERY fun to play i haven&apos;t gotten this hooked on a game in a long time its content is well worth the 49.99 price tag story itself can be beaten in a matter of hours but does offer plenty of side missions aswell as puzzles that surely extend the replay value. I haven&apos;t had a chance to get the DLC but im sure its just as fun. So PLEASE dont listen to all these whiny &quot;PC Gamers&quot; go get this game you wont regret it one bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2050064">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the open world of Arkham city and found gliding and fighting around at my own leisure fun for a time. The environmental graphics are good, batman also looks good with a great animating cape. The story has a few moments but did not surprise me at all and ends up being completely unbelievable even for a cartoon which is unacceptable for a claimed &apos;masterpiece&apos;. The combat is good and feels unique (much improved from Arkham Asylum being more fluid and giving the player more options in combat). Most of the Batman franchise is over used in the game with too many villains that are just there for the sake of it without much use or need. unfortunately as its a franchise Batman will never really learn any real lessons about crime or criminals and there never will be an end to Batman&apos;s troubles, batman is never going to die which destroys any suspense of danger, he will never totally defeat his enemies either, Joker will always come back again and again and again which does water down any story&apos;s significance.

But aside from the game, and the revised graphics (not too revised, but still) and the switching between characters (who, I should mention don&apos;t differ much), the game play is pretty linear, which is not so different from the first part. Granted, there are some side missions and other stuff to do in the city. But in my opinion, beating up henchmen or saving the occasional &quot;political prisoner&quot; (ironically, by beating up henchmen) does have it&apos;s limit of being fun. It gets tedious, very fast. Those familiar with the first installment will rejoice in the knowledge that most of the key elements that made it so great, are present here also. The only twist is, there&apos;s not much else that&apos;s new. You can grapple and glide, and grapple and glide for as long as your heart desires. Though i wish the grappling and gliding was less constricting, like it is in Just Cause 2. In short, Arkham City is a game that follows the footsteps of the original very closely (sometimes too closely), is rich in story and cameos, but leaves much more to be desired in terms of content and gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2013001">Expand</a></span>

No bugs, issues or ANYTHING on my end which may not be indicative of their experience, but they have to be doing SOMETHING wrong to have so many issues.<br><br>DRM? Yeah it&apos;s completely stupid to have 3 layers of it, but the scores should be about the quality of the game and not the services surrounding it. Speaking as a Batman fan since childhood (again), this game is fantastic and trumps the previous outing by rocksteady in all areas. It really delivers the Batman experience and treats fans and newcomers alike.  Massive amounts of content and fantastic turned up to 11 quality all over it.  It&apos;s not particularly difficult and failure isn&apos;t even an option most of the time, but it&apos;s the experience of the game and being THE BATMAN that is amazing. You&apos;ll spend hours in the campaign before beating it and starting an even harder NG+ and then go to the challenge maps for extra action.<br><br>If you came into this game looking for some deep skillful challenge then I&apos;m sorry you were disappointed, but if you came for an amazingly fun title and being THE BATMAN then you will be pleased  and enjoy yourself.<br><br>I&apos;m no professional reviewer and you should take my words with a grain of salt, but don&apos;t listen to these reviews focused on bugs or DRM and if that bothers you then pick up a console copy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1991897">Expand</a></span>

Since the game negatively scales when running dx11 and AMD crossfire. However slapping an extremely low score on this game due to the poorly implemented dx11 mode - would be reasonable if that meant you where unable to play the game smoothly . Direct x 9 mode runs flawlessly, and runs incredibly well. So even people without the exact hardware needed to run dx11 mode - are still able to play this game at a vastly better visual standard than everyone else. The game itself is incredible, one of the best of 2011. Arkham asylum was already a great game with a great combat system, it was structured almost like an oldschool metroid game. With progression tied to gadgets. This game opens up, and gives you a hubworld, it still has that metroid structure - it just combines it with elements of open world games. And this combination is so great it&apos;s intoxicating. Every single piece of this game is individually fantastic, now tie them all together. And you have a game that is truly worth the asking price. And then some. Involving plot. Check. Open world. Check. Enjoyable gameplay. Check. Variety. Check. Poetically mindblowing visuals. Check. 9/10?. Check.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2159500">Expand</a></span>

A few notes first: Do not get a retail copy, get a steam copy. The retail copy will make you put the dvd in the tray to boot it up.  I should be able to expect to install a game without having to put in a dvd every time. I mean it&apos;s 2012 (2011 when this was released), if I wanted to be a dirty pirate I could be one, don&apos;t spit on me because I buy games for pc. Also if I buy a retail copy in a store I don&apos;t want it to be sub par to an online distributor like steam.<br>Secondly: Games for windows live... yeah... not so great, but I don&apos;t think you can avoid it. Other than the aforementioned technical issues the game has a couple graphical issues and I&apos;m running a nvidia card (the game is optimized for nvidia). This game is great aside from being a console port, but the mouse and keyboard mapping isn&apos;t too bad. The game fighting dynamic reminds me a little bit of assassins creed, where timing is everything when you are surrounded by a huge group of thugs. There are also good espionage aspects in the game where taking down one opponent at a time is crucial to surviving. I will say that this game made me feel like batman, and that is why I&apos;m giving it an 8. I might suggest to go for the console if your computer isn&apos;t a beast because while this games graphics are impressive it seems to take quite a machine to get this to go. I am always finding that when a cut-scene ends or begins there is noticeable lag, perhaps this is the U3 engine (I don&apos;t recall mass effect 3 doing this). The story is really good, and you can tell that the makers of this game really did want to make something that would stand up for batman fans everywhere. Currently I have an i5-750 8 gigs of ram and a 560ti and I can run this game smoothly on high. Hopefully new nvidia drivers and updates will make for some more gains in the future. This was worth the money I paid for it, and strikes a very good balance of difficulty and challenge. I&apos;m also considering going 3d in the future, and know this game will be one of the reasons to try it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2325233">Expand</a></span>

The improvements on Arkham Asylum are almost infinite, and while Arkham Asylum is definitely a good game on its own merits, it looks silly compared to this. The amount of time it takes to get 100% complete on Arkham Asylum is only a mater of hours. On Arkham City, it will take days of playtime to fully explore and complete just the campaign, let alone the vast challenge modes. Not only has Arkham City added quantity, but greatly improved the quality of the content too. You get a very well-designed city which is much larger than Arkham Asylum- and a lot more interesting too. There are a load of side missions too which were missing from Arkham Asylum. From minute details to major improvements in level design, story-telling and the additional elements to both the combat system and stealth, Arkham City is more than just Arkham Asylum with a bigger map. It&apos;s not just the sheer content here- which, by the way, is EASILY double that of Grand Theft Auto IV excluding challenge modes- but also the way it&apos;s been implemented. Every single addition and tweak to virtually all elements of the game have made it far superior to Arkham Asylum which in itslef was already a well-designed game. The result is one of the best open-world action games of this generation. Arkham City is a mixture of Arkham Asylum, Assassin&apos;s Creed, GTA IV and some of its own creativity. The boss fights, for instance, are so much more varied and really show that the game&apos;s full potential has been used. The characters are nicely done and unique, not to mention that there are so many of them. The combat is brutal, satisfying, skillful and with the addition of new gadgets and enemy counter-measures - greatly varied too. The pacing and mix between stealth and mass brawling is perfectly done and satisfying every time. The game never feels repetitive or boring because of the variety in gameplay. The RPG element of being rewarded for skillful combat (through variation and combo bonuses) also help to keep your interest by allowing you to unlock new gadgets and gear. No open-world game today has a better combat system. No open-world game has better boss fights. That&apos;s the thing about Arkham City- it&apos;s a sandbox game, whereas Arkham Asylum was a short Action game. My criticisms of this game are in the story and characters, because the two don&apos;t seem to connect very well. It&apos;s not a story-driven game and doesn&apos;t feel engaging or particularly interesting until the very end. However, facial details, motion capture and lip-syncing are of Hollywood standard in some cutscenes. The game isn&apos;t particulalry challenging on Hard difficulty either; although this is remedied by the New Game plus mode which is unclocked at the end of the game which is essentially a &quot;Hardcore&quot; version of the campaign. The only real let-down for this game is its astronomical failure of implementing DX11 features. Even if you can get very high framerates with everything maxxed, turning DX11 features on in the slightest will lead to a slideshow. That said, the game is already very impressive graphically even in DX9, and although PhysX is quite demanding in this game, the framerate issues don&apos;t occur regualarly enough or last long enough to cause any problems. All in all then, what we have here isn&apos;t a beat-em-up game with free roam. Batman Arkham City represents the height of game design for open-world action games. The lack of multiplayer is made up for by the endless, varied, addicting and satisfying challenge modes. Aside from the poor implementation of DX11 and some framerate issues, this is a game which is very difficult to dislike or at least criticise. Arkham City oozes quality in virtually all aspects and is one of the easiest games to recommend to any type of gamer. There&apos;s something for everyone here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2400678">Expand</a></span>

However, there are five activation limits due to SecuROM. Since Batman Arkham Asylum now has a machine limit revoke tool, they might release a similar tool for Arkham City as well in the future. The concept of the game is very similar to that of Asylum. The difference is that this game use a while city as its stage while Asylum does a while prison as its stage. This is a good thing because the whole events are more colorful and diverse in this game than Asylum. Thanks to interesting landscapes, the game will keep you interested in what will happen next. Overall the game itself deserves 10 score. Since the DX11 problem will go away eventually, a major flaw is the activation limit. I will knock off 1 score because of this. When they release a revoke tool, the score will move up to 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1966818">Expand</a></span>

First thing I did was read the reviews to prepare myself for what comes next. Single player games are typically not my forte&apos;, aside from Bioware games for the most part. With that out of the way let me say this.... Batman AC is a spectacular game. It has an awesome cinematic story coupled with an open world feel that lets the player spread their wings a bit to tackle available content on their own terms. Aside from folks complaining about technical issues (I haven&apos;t had any, but to each his own) I cant for the life of me figure out what someone looking for a great Batman game would not enjoy about this title. It is stunning visually, exciting mechanically with an engaging narrative. It has a dark tone which I love and expect from a Batman tale that really draws you into the world. I&apos;m not sure what the developer promised that the naysayers were expecting, but I&apos;m finding it hard to identify faults in this stellar game. It is simply put, way fun!<br><br>If you&apos;re looking for a great single player game, with top notch cinematic storytelling, character progression, exploration and oh yeah, you&apos;re a DC fan..... give this game a go, you wont be disappointed.  I&apos;m so thankful I didn&apos;t miss the bus on Batman: Arkham City, neither will you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994977">Expand</a></span>

As others have said though it can be difficult to navigate to the proceeding sections of the story due to &quot;clunky&quot; controls that were obviously intended for console gamers. Combos can be difficult to execute because of the controls. The graphics I feel are adequate for what is supposed to be a comic based game. The characters are brought to life without making you feel like your playing a movie. It can start to seem repetitive but only towards the end so if the controls had been better I would have given it a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1971060">Expand</a></span>

I felt the characters were done really well and the game&apos;s atmosphere was pretty immersive.<br><br>Gameplay:<br>If you enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum, then I recommend you get this game. It had improved combat mechanics, such as new moves, new gadgets, and new types of enemies, giving it a whole new level of entertainment when compared to the original. Sure, the gameplay can get repetitive....but the combat is entertaining enough that you probably won&apos;t mind. The original key-bindings were a little screwed up for my style so I had to change them but I didn&apos;t notice anything wrong with respect to controls. I really enjoyed the new style of the Riddler puzzles. I&apos;ve gotten all of them now, but some of them took me a little while to figure out, hah.<br><br><br>Graphics:<br>The graphics looked amazing when ran at high specs with dx11 disabled. I did not have any problems with lag or stuttering, however I did crash once or twice. If you are actually looking to run this game with dx11, I would recommend you wait for the patch because I could not get an enjoyable framerate with dx11 enabled.<br><br>@Matthew_Hayward .... I went out of my way, made an account and posted on here simply because I felt the need to call you a moron, as obvious as it is to everybody else. Just letting you know, j***ass, that you can&apos;t possibly beat the game in 10 minutes. No idea what you were trying to achieve coming on here and posting that useless crap you call a review. People like you (morons) need to stop coming on here to rage instead of reviewing because it doesn&apos;t help the people who are trying to gather information to decide whether they would enjoy this game or not if they bought it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1989438">Expand</a></span>

Now, Batman can be played in an open world scene which is very enjoyable. which can&apos;t be done in Arkham Asylum. Although there is some issues with dx11, but it&apos;s fixed now with the new update 1.1, check it out guys. I can&apos;t even rate this game a 9. It  just deserve a 10.</span>

But in its current form, it does not have those things.<br><br>At its core though, its a great game. Console port? Sure, I don&apos;t care. I use an Xbox360 controller on PC for these games anyway. Money is in developing consoles games, its not practical to sink so much money into PC games as if its will show consoles sales figures. Sure, the PC is capable of better, but thats just graphics and there&apos;s much more to this game than just graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1966803">Expand</a></span>

The game was only delayed 6 weeks and youre acting like it was 6 months. You should be greatful this game is released on pc as quick as it was with plently of configuration options, including a fully editable configuration ini since game is unreal engine 3. So one part of game doesnt work, so youre score goes from 10 to 0. Its not rocksteady fault you spent 2000 dollars on graphics cards nor is it their obligations to program a game that takes full advantage of that hardware flawlessly.<br><br>I mean come on, can you seriouly say you have seen a better looking Unreal Engine 3 game. This game might be the best video game ever made, and playing maxed out in dx9 with high physx and high AA along with triple 2560x1440 res isnt good enough looking so the game gets a 0?<br><br>You people really need to evaluate your lives and gain some perspective. Ive been playing games since Zelda 1 and Mario 1 were released, and Im fairly sure Im playing the best game ever made when I fire up the PC version of Arkham City.<br><br>It runs flawlessly with ZERO STUTTERING OR FRAMERATE ISSUES, as long as I turn off Dx 11.  The only loss is yours if you dont play this game cause you&apos;re having a temper tantrum.<br><br>Better than Deus Ex, Better than Half Life, Better than Ultima Underworld, Better than Super Metroid, Better than any Zelda game,better than any Mario game, Arkham City is the best game ever made.<br><br>That said I kinda wish they had brough back Arleen Sorkin even though Im a brony, still easily 11/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1984106">Expand</a></span>

If you loved Asylum for the combat, let me just say, you are all set, buy it now, that aspect is just as good and then a bit better. While the addition of being in an entire city was nice, the city layout was horrendous. I love having more area to explore, but the fact the entire city makes a giant U shape makes travel across it an immense pain. Of the returning villains, the Riddler fell flat on his face. The game practically solves what very few riddles there are for you, and tried to make up for it by just spewing trophies all over the map, which is a complete shame. The new villains are done well, even if they are short lived. But all in all Arkham City is a good game, and a worthy predecessor to Arkham Asylum.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981641">Expand</a></span>

I respect the other reviewers&apos; saying they had bugs galore, but I think it is important to let folks know that is not the case for everyone.  Threrefore the problem seems unique to certain setups.  I must be the only one for whom GFWL works flawlessly every time, I&apos;ve never had an issue with it while playing this game.  I always patch my nVidia drivers before installing a marquee title like this, plus they&apos;ve also released a patch that makes DX11 work MUCH better now (although still not perfect).  The PC launch stumbled out of the gate, but I wouldn&apos;t avoid buying the game over it.  If you can live without DX11, it still looks every bit as amazing as the first game while improving and expanding the gameplay.  Being able to fly anywhere across the city without touching the ground, patrolling the city and dropping in on a gang as you see fit is just an awesome, rewarding experience, among others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2063016">Expand</a></span>

<br>being a huge physx fan i must say one of the greater dissapointments was the lack of environment featuring said physx. the previous batman made heavy use of tearable cloth, papers, leaves, clothing etc however if i recall correctly there wasnt even a single piece of environment that could be demolished except board but that was a cheesy half life style break. the cloth physx was dedicated about 2 rugs and some paper.
<br>the whole game was in my eyes too short following the main story. not really any attraction to do side stuff. a labouring jourey across the map to punch 4 guys and hide a nurse isnt what i would call entertainment. the story relies heavily on the thrills of &quot;woahhh im actually meeting mr freeze and clayface&quot; etc rather than an actually thrilling storyline. what they did in one building (essentially) they could not repeat in an entire city. alright game but not fun enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2060416">Expand</a></span>

The wait was worth it for me even if the console version came out a month prior because this game is so gorgeous. Just because this has Securom and GFWL and Steamworks doesn&apos;t mean **** really as long as it is playable, which it is. Right off the bat you are immersed into game and **** goes down quickly. The story is so well told and when you solve all the riddles you find out about the back story of how **** transpired between the asylum to the city. My only concern is they have kind of written themselves into a dead-end, I just hope that when/if the next batman title comes out that it will be at least half as good as this masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=2063033">Expand</a></span>
