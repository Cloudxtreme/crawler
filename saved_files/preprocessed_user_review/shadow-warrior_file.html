I see folks complaining about getting lost in complex levels, having to find keys to advance, needing secrets to upgrade Lo Wang. This is what Call of Doodie has done to a generation of gamers... put simply, this is the best FPS to come along in a while and it&apos;s apologetically hard and old school.

Because, hey, Shadow Warrior has AIMING DOWN THE SIGHT mechanics for those who prefer precision shooting (which is a mechanic I love as well, but I mix it up in Shadow Warrior with the sword and firing like some sort of insane Rambo). So don&apos;t despair, Call of Duty fans!
<br>
<br>But, I cannot deny my love affair with nostalgic shooters that I played when I was a kid, including the recent Shadow Warrior Classic Redux that I made sure to finish before buying this amazing game! However, we can&apos;t forget about Doom or Duke Nukem 3D either! Shadow Warrior does EVERYTHING right, regardless of the supposed &quot;level design&quot; issues despite said levels being beautiful and wonderfully varied.
<br>
<br>Here is why the game is good before I go off on further tangents:
<br>
<br>Insane levels of depth with weapon upgrades, skills, and powers, with each requiring their own resource to upgrade that you can find in the world.
<br>
<br>Insane value, as the game is lengthy as Lo Wang&apos;s um, wang, with about 17 levels/chapters.
<br>
<br>Explosive, bloody, and gorey combat that is too much fun whether or not you prefer using magic, sword, or other weapons like the PDW (SMG) which is my favorite weapon!
<br>
<br>Fantastic humor, with Lo Wang&apos;s classic one liners and quotable quotes.
<br>
<br>Insanely good visuals. Numerous visual options to help balance beauty and performance, including the extremely underused TRIPLE BUFFERING option. Field of view slider included for even the most discerning first person shooter fan!
<br>
<br>Secret areas. Did you think they would leave out fun to find secret areas, that are actually TOUGH to find? Well, think again!
<br>
<br>Now, that is my review of Shadow Warrior. Is this game perfect? NO, but it is as close to perfection that we will get in a shooter these days!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599558">Expand</a></span>

Plenty of upgrades, giving you lots of freedom to choose to how you want to power up. Lots of content too  17 levels and the levels aren&apos;t that short. Tons of secrets and amusing hidden easter eggs to find. Very nostalgic but at the same time very modern, for example the fact that nearly every little object in the game is destructible. The way the story is presented is a huge improvement on how it was handled in this dev&apos;s previous game, Hard Reset, and it&apos;s great fun to hear the banter between Lo Wang and the demon Hoji. Great game overall!

It has really nice combat, there&apos;s a great atmosphere, the levels are built quite well and it&apos;s not expensive at all. The only thing that should be improved is the framerate. It runs quite well, but there are games that do look better and are less demanding. Still, it&apos;s a great old-school game and I can only hope more games like this wil be made.</span>

Sure its nostalgic and so on, but to me it feels more like a console game than a pc game. Also it is looking very very low budget. Its fun for a while, but its a very simple game, leveldesign arent even worth mentioning. Ill have to give it a 4, for those 1-2 hours u actually play it before uninstalling.</span>

It&apos;s incredibly boring and repetitive.  The weapons are extremely lack-luster and very weak, the sword is a wrecking ball of self-healing immortality even on the hardest setting, there was clearly no quality assurance involved in this game&apos;s production, the bloom is blinding, I had to actually put on sunglasses when I first arrived at the snow-level to continue playing.  There are invisible walls everywhere and you can get stuck on teh tiniest doodads while circle-strafing enemies, which is the only thing you will ever do in this game.  The boss fights are the most boring and uninspired boss fights in recent history, Really, if you want to continue to hold the shadow warrior franchise in high regard, don&apos;t buy this game.  however if you&apos;re someone who can play cell-phone games for hours and hours on end without ever growing bored then this might be a game for you.  Like-wise, if you enjoy stimulating games that can provide a challenge and mix things up so you don&apos;t get bored doing the same thing forever, then pass this game by.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3604197">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At this price, you can&apos;t go wrong. I&apos;ve spent 17 hours the first day it got released. That alone has made it worthwhile and knowing we can probably expect some free DLCs on top of that (as was the case with Hard Reset) at 20&#x20AC; (discount  coupon, which you can get easily on SPUF) this game is a steal.
<br>
<br>What an awesome homage to gore, violence and the entire genre, giving nods left and right to culture of the 90s and best games from the past.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3604839">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And on top of that this game has an amazing sense of humour, I was literally laughing my ass off when I saw the intro scene. And as is usual with them(and almost any polish dev) well probably get some free DLC.
<br>
<br>Please Give this game a try, the reviewers apparently want another COD knock-off, but this is SOOOO much better.

<br>As many have pointed out the entire game is passing from Arena to Arena, shooting hordes of spawning enemies, which is like only 5 or 6 different types.  Level design is nonexistent.  The good sides of the game are the story (which is pretty alright), graphics (which are not bad), voice acting and animations (especially some silly jokes the protagonists exchange), and the skill development/weapon upgrade.
<br>
<br>So this game comes with so much good, that it&apos;s a blasphemy to give it a 6/10.  However, the designers missed a ton of opportunity here, and obviously went for the shortest, most optimal and minimal path to make money.  On the side of constructive criticism - all that this game needs is a flowing level design, not cascading rooms.  I mean - come on - first few hours you pass from forest into a town, from town into a forest, and go through a dozen of copy-pasted houses!  Come on!
<br>
<br>Fun for a few hours.  But ultimately - i&apos;ll just go to the beach!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=6688732">Expand</a></span>

Duke Nukem Forever, for many, was a disappointment in that many hoped that it would stay the course of what FPS used to entail: gratuitous, unapologetic, fast paced gore and action. But for the new reboot of Shadow Warrior, being the more &quot;eastern&quot; cousin of Duke Nukem truly shines in that it redeems what makes FPS great with all the credentials of it being made in 2013. The graphics are completely stunning, not only for the purpose of the aesthetic but even beautifully done with the gore and action too. Melee combat, for FPS, usually always tied into being used as a last ditch effort. But not here. The Katana will probably be the most handy weapon out there, and it&apos;s the first one you get! There are a lot of combinations to the weapon that can apply heavy damage and kills, but the combos are frustratingly set on the movement keys and require some wonky movement in order to use them. Second, while the firepower can, at times work for the most part, seem quite underpowered when compared to the Katana. But even then, every gun you use has a satisfying punch to it, and the shotgun is especially of that case when you can unload every shell point blank into quivering demons. As many of the professional critics state, level design is somewhat weak as it usually involved complex corridors followed by arena-sized areas, rinse and repeat. Sometimes the level design can shine between both context and combat orientation, like &quot;You Should See the Other Guy&quot;, or generally the chapters involving the shipyard. The Demons, or the general enemies are at the most times competent but usually suffer from clipping errors with items around them, so they can often try to chase you from a corner. In terms of what they can do is another story, as they can evolve and be enraged to greater bring strain to the player. The story is fairly decent and potent for a game that involves gratuitous violence, with a likable chemistry between the main character, Lo Wang, and his demon pal, Hoji, webbing the downfall of the shadow realm and how the sword and Hoji are tied to it. Also, for a FPS, we also get to see a lot of character building too with Lo Wang, from being a sneery, egotistic japanese &apos;american&apos;, to being a full blown, sympathetic professional with the wisdom and charisma of a true master. I didn&apos;t really set my sights on Flying Wild Hog before, but with their continued devotion to bring the S back in FPS really makes me feel they are the Id or 3DRealms of our generation. Overall, this game will melt your brain with fun, being fun loving and never tiring to blow demons back to kingdom come, keeping the tradition of secrets and shadow warrior&apos;s quotable one-liners, but best of all, making what is FPS, FPS!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3906628">Expand</a></span>

Well done!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3874864">Expand</a></span>

So really I think it&apos;s a game that anyone can really enjoy  it doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously and neither should you.
<br>
<br>The melee combat is so satisfying and seemingly accurate and weighty. If you want to slice a head off, aim for the neck  it works, and it&apos;s it&apos;s awesome. I love the voice acting and one-liners.
<br>
<br>The game is quite attractive and has a plethora of PC options. That&apos;s what I REALLY love about these devs, they listen to the community and when they make a PC game, they MAKE a PC game. This game works flawlessly using Nvidia Surround and looks stunning across 3 monitors.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t think you can argue with the price  especially when it was on pre-order special. You can mix it up with different &quot;special&quot; weapons for a bit more fun, and have a blast trying to find all the little secrets Flying Wild Hog have put into the game (look behind certain waterfalls :)
<br>
<br>Games are meant to be fun, and this is exactly that  so go have fun already!

<br>After more than 10 Years, we&#xB4;re getting the reboot of the Classic Shadow Warrior. Awesome! I was expecting this like Duke Nukem Forever back then. Except that Shadow Warrior 2013 did live up to my expectations, unlike DN Forever.
<br>
<br>Gameplay feels very smooth, instantly get the SW feeling back,  graphics looking great, enemys and the environment are &quot;destructible&quot;, secrets can be found just like in SW1997 (behind waterfalls)  many weapons  upgrades
<br>
<br>This reboot is exactly what you expect from an Classic SW1997. If you care more about &quot;fun gameplay&quot; then an interesting gamestory then SW.exe will satisfy you. I woudn&#xB4;t buy it directly from Steam though, better prices are to be found elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3597012">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m an old school gamer, we strung coax through the ceiling to play doom 1&amp;2 in the dorms.  This game reminds me of what it felt like to play those back in the day but cranked up to 2013 style.  Yea, there probably could&apos;ve been some sweet multiplayer added in here, but this game still rocks on it&apos;s own. I&apos;m on level 5 now, so probably about 6 hours into it.  As you get a little more involved, the tuning of the combat system starts to show through some more.  At first maybe it was a little underwhelming, but playing further into it, I&apos;m really starting to dig it.  The action is fast and encourages you to throw everything you have at them combo&apos;d up as much as possible.  The unlocks/upgrades are great (I just got the single-action revolver mod, highly recommend it.)  Some of my favorites have been Duke3d &amp; Painkiller, this is right up there with them.  If you think you could enjoy some fast paced FPS goodness with the old school charms like medpacks, hidden items &amp; tons of enemies, you&apos;ll like this game.  Graphics are good, combat is good, explosions, guts.. lots of great small details.  Just for extra info, I have a GTX 480 card, i5 2500k chip &amp; 8GB ram.. I&apos;m completely satisfied with the graphics level and framerate (have seen this mentioned a lot). I have it at 1920x1080 with about 7/10 on the graphics levels.  Put the physics up the ultra!!

<br>
<br>A gorefest in every sense of the word, Shadow Warrior puts you in the boots of a reimaged Lo Wang, a younger, if much snarkier swordsman. Lo Wang still delivers those one liners that will make you crack a grin or a gufaw, at least now he&apos;s figured out how to spread them out to not ruin their effectiveness.
<br>
<br>Plenty of weapons are in the game, and not restricted to the two hold limit, but can be some really far flung ideas, a few even making a comeback from teh 1997 original. Though the weapons lack any real impressive power at start, once upgraded, they become a real beast in their own rights. However the weapon that really stands out in the game is the Katana. Swordplay has been made to be fun and engaging this time, the distance of the strikes, the feedback of impact, and the falling pieces of the enemies make it a rather surprisingly satisfying weapon.
<br>
<br>Speaking of the enemies, they&apos;re plentiful, but a bit repetitive. You&apos;ll never be short of fodder to slaughter, but you&apos;ll be finding yourself moving room to room, alley to alley, house to house, dungeon to dungeon, fighting similar looking mobs of strengthening difficulty. This is one of the big detractors from the game as things can get a bit dull when you hack apart the same demon for the umpteenth time, but in that same mind, if you&apos;re in it just to go wild and hack n&apos; slash to your hearts content, this game is perfect.
<br>
<br>Areas are varied, and very well designed, if sometimes little maze-like, often having you lost, or making unncessary backtracking to find a key or something you may have missed. In that same light, though, secrets are back with a vengance, each chapter containing a hearty number of them that will have you searching every nook and cranny. That said, though, the areas feel more like arenas to fight in, rather than just streamed locales, but this doesn&apos;t neccessarily hurt the game, as it constrains the enemies as well so you can be sure the fight never gets dull, or that you&apos;re hunting for that one elusive enemy.
<br>
<br>The writting and humor still manages to hit right where it matters, surprisingly, even for a slightly more serious reboot. Some of the shine from the old game is still there, but a lot of the nostalgia you might be looking for, if you played the original, is rather lacking, but looking past that, the story and the jokes still hits the target to keep a grin on your face as you play through.
<br>
<br>While Shadow Warrior is not breaking any records or ground on gameplay, it definately focuses on what it wants to be  a really fun game. Its emphasis on having fun, and keeping that steady roll going, is what makes it shine through all 17 chapters. Though a few might find the game slightly dulled by the constant repetitiveness, you may wanna play this game in short bursts. However, if you&apos;re in it for a good bit of wild combat and swordplay, step right up, grab a blade and go to town. Multiplayer is missing this time, the reason for it has made the game stand out, the developers instead focusing on a great single player experience.
<br>
<br>Overall, Shadow Warrior isn&apos;t the perfect game or reboot, but it does deliver a tight fun, humorous, and entertaining package for someone who enjoys the First Person Shooter Genre of the 90s. It has a few detracting points, it does well to make up for it all in the long run.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599519">Expand</a></span>

You come to the dramatic realization that almost everything is brown, grim, and freaking boring...with very few truly enjoyable experiences to be had.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of old school, arcadey or arena style shooters, then you are out of luck. Sure, there&apos;s a Bulletstorm here...a Serious Sam there...but what else can tide you over?
<br>
<br>Suddenly, out of the shadows comes Shadow Warrior: a pleasant surprise if ever there was one.
<br>
<br>Shadow Warrior, quite frankly, is the most fun I&apos;ve had with a shooter in a long time. Taking nods from Painkiller and The Darkness, Shadow Warrior comes to the table as an arena style shooter with a ton of charm and wonder behind it&apos;s combat. The guns are stylish (and you can hold more than 2 at one time...HOW ABOUT THAT?!) and the melee combat with the katana is like nothing else on the market when it comes to first person games. The combat is just fun, and without experiencing it for yourself the only word that describes it is &quot;kinetic&quot;.
<br>
<br>There is some first rate humor here, as well. Decent voice acting along with witty dialogue from our protagonist and his demonic sidekick give this game some great character. There&apos;s also a lot of fourth-wall breaking, and the game never takes itself seriously.
<br>
<br>While the level design is mostly linear (and the game does recycle the same set pieces just a tad bit), there are branching paths to explore. You&apos;ll definitely want to explore them, too, as not only is it prudent for upgrading your gear...but there are also secrets and easter eggs absolutely everywhere...and some of them are incredibly hilarious with huge amounts of references to other games. If you&apos;re a nerd, and have been playing games since the 80s, then you&apos;ll get a kick out of some of the awesome stuff there is to find in Shadow Warrior.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: Shadow Warrior deserves your time, your attention, and your cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3597114">Expand</a></span>

On top of that: upgrades for your weapons, special powers and the most addictive swordfighting/moves I&apos;ve seen in years. The only downside are the cutscenes and triggered events, that make it not very replayable.</span>

<br>
<br>The sword is extremely reliable for taking down multiple enemies in melee. It also heals you. So what can be done to make the player feel alive? Right, invulnerable enemies. Some invulnerable until you&apos;ve killed all the trash, some invulnerable from the front. Bad game design? Old school!
<br>
<br>Huge levels that are easy to get lost in? Old school! The one tiny problem is that halfway through the game it stops making sense, so when you&apos;re lost you keep asking yourself TWO questions - &quot;Where do I go from here?&quot; and &quot;Why the cat did I even come here?&quot;. In a certain level you also get complete darkness for free. And, of course, miles and miles of identical graveyard with identical houses, some of which have a lock on the door. And some doors will magically open once you&apos;ve killed everything (even if you have no idea where that everything is stuck due to some AI glitch).
<br>
<br>Weapons? Well... There&apos;s the sword and there are several fartguns. You can upgrade them but their destructive power stays quite meh. But sometimes you have to fight a boss. Solution! You get infinitely respawning ammunition to compensate for the power of your fartguns.
<br>
<br>The process is a cycle. Enter a room. Have the door lock itself behind you. Kill everything. Run around the room trying to activate every object in sight. Kill something that got stuck somewhere. Run around the room again, this time some door or console might actually activate.
<br>
<br>This is all very oldschool and very sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944851">Expand</a></span>

I think sword combat has never been so fun before in a FPS game and I can&apos;t think of any important drawback. without entering in details (for example: many times, on melee combat,  you die because the enviroment is &quot;excessively explosive&quot; so to say.).
<br>To stay short, highly recomended!</span>

The storyline is cheesy but it fits the personality of Wang perfectly, especially when you find out after listening to &quot;The Touch&quot; and joining in as well that you are to offer money for a blade.</span>

The combat is as satisfying as it is responsive and the katana&apos;s hit detection is probably the best i&apos;ve ever seen in a video game (however special abilities are difficult to use at first), there is no weapon that you feel you won&apos;t like simply due to the fact that all of them have niche roles. The plot is interesting as well making mindless killing actually seem like your doing something meaningful however i won&apos;t talk too much about it due to spoilers. The game also has a surprisingly good sense of (especially considering the fact that the main character&apos;s name is essentially a penis joke). Lastly the world is absolutely beautiful (albeit it&apos;s no columbia from bioshock infinite)
<br>
<br>Dispite all of that however, the game has a few game breaking AI glitches (like enemies hiding behind cover forever in a place the player can&apos;t reach) that make it impossible to advance due to the &quot;kill everything to advance&quot; system that only works if it&apos;s well placed in games like castle crashers. Also as i mentoned earlier the abilities are hard to use at first due to minor control issues and the exploration can get pretty boring when you just want to kill everything in sight but there&apos;s nothing for you to kill. Another thing to note is the unbareable load times, it&apos;s worse than dead rising 2 in this respect.
<br>
<br>Overall i&apos;d reccomend this game to anyone who likes good stories, mindless killing, non-serious games and good humour but can tolerate a few downsides that prevent this game being perfect</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3879117">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed Flying Wild Hogs previous game, Hard Reset, but I&apos;ve found it very hard to feel the same way for Shadow Warrior. I&apos;m halfway through the game (on chapter 9 out of 17 I believe) and I am going to call it quits. Shadow Warrior is a arena based First-Person Hack and Slash. You&apos;re put in levels where you walk around until you get to an area. This area acts as arena because you have to kill all the enemies in it before you&apos;re allowed to move on to the next. These areas are never interesting or unique. They are just bald areas with boxes, building around the side, and corpses thrown around the ground. The best weapon by far is the Katana which I found to have very repetitive gameplay accompanying it. Each fight plays out the same and I never felt like I was making progress. I gain money to upgrade my weapons, skill points to upgrade abilities, and strange crystal things  to upgrade powers. And yet, I never felt like the game was progressing. I personally feel that the game is highly overrated because it has a japanese setting and you can use a katana. It is simply a grind from slightly different arena to slightly different arena. If you&apos;re looking for a shooter, pass it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4923090">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Only other negative is the bosses. They are OK, but just a fraction annoying and difficult. I prefer bosses like Doom 3 final boss. Just hit them until the die. Not target a piece of armour and then change attack when it becomes vulnerable.
<br>
<br>Overall Shadow Warrior is a rich fest of brilliant fun, cartoony graphics, and fairly fast paced shooting. Serious Sam and Doom fans, should buy it. The weapon mods are all good fun, so you get new ways to blast &apos;em.
<br>
<br>The main character is slick and cool. He delivers his lines perfectly; acting credit too to the ghost. SW is a well set up game, that at first can seem a little over-coloured and difficult to warm to. Just a little game time and think you&apos;ll either love it, or it won&apos;t be your game type. Since some players seem to have moved away from single player shooters. It&apos;s style is sufficiently refreshing to make it really well memorable.
<br>
<br>I am a Hard Reset fan too, so will be looking out for future titles in either series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=5514916">Expand</a></span>

<br>Someone said it was too hard on &quot;hard&quot; -- I got half way through the game without using a single upgrade. Maybe I&apos;ll have to try the extreme difficulty to be challenged.
<br>
<br>Ignore the bad reviews -- this is a fun hack and slash and runs great.
<br>
<br>Only reason it&apos;s not a 10/10 is due to invisible walls and no real ability for jumping or speed jumping,
<br>other than that this game is a blast. Don&apos;t take it too seriously. It&apos;s a pick it up and put it down type game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4935730">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is acceptable - nothing fancy - but nothing fancy is needed. The upgrade system works really well. Weapons do feel different from each other and it makes sense using different ones on different situations. And the fighting with katana is just pure fun. Slashing through hordes of demons, watching their head and limbs fly.

Lo Wang, the main character, starts the game trying to get a sword to his employer, Zilla, and after that he spends most of the game fighting demons with the help of a banned demon named Hoji. The plot is not the best I&apos;ve seen, but is very good, and the acting is even better. I admit I spend the entire game looking for a twist, but the story is very straightforward, and after any chapter we want to play the next one just to discover another bit of it. Thumbs up.
<br>
<br>The story mode is the main thing in the game. It took me about 14h to go through, and I&apos;ve enjoyed every single bit.
<br>
<br>2- GAMEPLAY
<br>
<br>The game plays great. I have some issues with the controls, but just because I&apos;m not very skilled and I do not like when I have button combinations to trigger a move.
<br>
<br>The swordplay is great, and I was always trying to use it just for the fun, despite having a lot of weapons that could make my life a bit easier. Being able to carry all weapons we can find was great, and the chance to upgrade them even better. It&apos;s funny that the sword destroys almost everything bt is not able to go through bambu. There&apos;re strong bambu in Japan.
<br>
<br>We have 3 independent skill trees to unlock and upgrade abilities, but we never feel overpowered. New opponents are always a bit stronger or annoying than the previous one, and the new abilities are always welcome and needed.
<br>
<br>The levels are long and kinda labirintish. We have no map, and sometimes we feel a bit lost. That&apos;s normal, and you always find the way out. Normally is the blinking door. There are a lot of secrets to find, and that gives you some replay ability. The fortune cookies where a lot of fun, and I was always looking for a new one, just to have a laugh reading them.
<br>
<br>When a enemy locks on us the music always changes. It&apos;s nice to set the mood, but is always a warning to when we have enemies, since after we kill any horde, the music goes back to normal. I rather prefer to have to look for the enemies and be surprised when I see them.
<br>
<br>There are some recycled sets, but there is no problem. The references to Serious Sam are obvious, and the gameplay and artstyle are very similar.
<br>
<br>3- CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>This game is now at 34,99&#x20AC; at Steam, and I would not pay that price for the game. I&apos;ve bought it in a sale for under 5&#x20AC;, and for that price you have to try it.
<br>
<br>Oooh, just the demon rabbits alone worth the 5&#x20AC; tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675564">Expand</a></span>

There are secrets hidden off the beaten path between big combat pieces, but no significant exploration or freedom of movement otherwise. It plays and progresses much like Hard Reset did, even though there&apos;s now a focus on melee combat (or at least serious attempts to coax the player into using the sword), with enemies that are suitably bullet-spongey, allowing them to clear the distance to the player and last long enough for the sword to become an asset. There&apos;s a skill tree system in play, and upgrades can be purchased both in the form of character skills (such as new melee attacks or more efficient use of medikits) and improvements for your firearms. Lo Wang&apos;s return to form does not do anything wrong, yet also nothing remarkably well. Shadow Warrior is a competent enough reboot, if not as good as its inspiration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3598168">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay looks tedious or repetitive, but trust me it is a lot of fun and blast, with different combos from the Kitana combined with weapons, skills and powers alike. The Shadow Warrior in my opinion has been beautiful re imagined/rebooted from the classic era to the modern area. The graphics are amazing a cool next-gen quick title if you are wondering about the graphics.
<br>The gameplay is fun, quick, with a lot of blood and mini puzzles to do. They are really cool secret area throwing you to the classic game, secret collectibles of Karma,Money,etc.
<br>If you truly can let yourself go of the classic era and embrace the modern step of this game, you will find a gem that only Flying Wild Hog could deliver. If you hadn&apos;t play Hard Reset from them, try it, then try this. It is worth any time you got.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3603059">Expand</a></span>

All in one a good oldschool Action Shooter with cool Katana Gameplay and nice dismemberend. Levels are linear, but with alot of hidden Treasure. Thousand times better than DN4E. If you like in your Face Action without a comlex Story. This is it.</span>

You&apos;ll greatly enjoy it with your 3d glasses, it has gorgeous graphics, one of the most beautiful that I&apos;ve ever seen on PC together with Metro Last Light and Tomb Raider 2013. This game is very fun, action paced, and it has plenty of upgrades, powers, skills. It deserves a 9/10 without any doubts.</span>

The joy, the action, the massacre is actually comparable to the 1997 Shadow Warrior. The game is fast, smooth and feels perfect. Some great weapon and character upgrades (and also some less interesting), good looking graphics and fun character models. So the following nitpicks are far from game-breaking, but noticeable.
<br>
<br>When talking about fast paced FPS games from the 90&apos;s I don&apos;t care about cut-scenes and storylines in general (unless they would be very original and compelling, or really fun) and I&apos;m not exactly in need of a snarky companion while killing bad guys. Both story and characters have been well executed and everything is fully skippable if you so desire, but the story itself hasn&apos;t got a lot of depth or originality to offer, really. Still, I guess you could have a much much worse companion than Hoji.
<br>The biggest con though would be the level design, when compared to the original. It&apos;s much more linear and not as huge and maze-like, and consequently there&apos;s not as much sense of freedom. I want to be able to backtrack from start to the end and back again, but the game explicitly does not let you do so. Also there are tons of locations where it clearly looks like you can go somewhere, except for those infamous invisible walls. There&apos;s still quite some explorational fun to be had, just not as complicated or with as much freedom as the original.
<br>
<br>But man, does the game look good and man are that sword and its powers satisfying to use. Nothing of the points of criticism takes away any of that and neither did it stop me from grinning like a maniac most of the time. This is by far one of my favorite modern FPS games and I would heartily recommend it to anyone and everyone. As long as they enjoy flying limbs and tons of blood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4149825">Expand</a></span>

But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I kept playing this one because it was actually fun, and even though I finished it a couple of days ago, I will definitely be playing it again.  This game doesn&apos;t have the stupid &quot;two guns at a time&quot; restriction, or the lack of saved games that seem to be common in games these days.  It has checkpoints AND quick saves, much like the Half-Life series.  And unlike most FPS games, the sword is actually a useful weapon, rather than just being something you only use if you run out of ammo.
<br>
<br>While this game is different from the original Shadow Warrior, there are some similarities, and some passing references to the original, some of them hidden in secret areas.  Along the way, you pick up money, karma points, and ki crystals, which you can use to upgrade your weapons and abilities.  There are special moves you can learn, which I was a little unsure about at first, because things like that usually make a game a little too complicated for my taste, but they kept those fairly simple.
<br>
<br>The story line, while a little hard to follow at first, kept me interested.  The game has 17 chapters, and most of them are pretty long.  Early in the story, you pick up a demon sidekick, and the interaction between the two kept me laughing.  The political incorrectness that was in the original is not present in this version, but there is a lot more violence and bad language.  I had to chuckle when my character dropped an F-bomb after taking a huge amount of damage.  Unlike a lot of the recent games, it isn&apos;t ridiculously difficult even on the easiest setting.  In fact, the easiest setting was too easy, and I ended up restarting and playing on &quot;normal&quot; difficulty.  That was about right for me.  It didn&apos;t make it too easy, but also not too hard to make it frustrating, except when I came up against some of the tougher enemies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3957256">Expand</a></span>

I hope turning the hilarious perverted old sensei into a try hard wannabe brat because you get triggered by real humor was worth alienating a large portion of the real Shadow Warrior&apos;s fan base.
<br>
<br>But enough about my gripes regarding the destruction of a treasured old character in the name of a bad developer&apos;s sensitive feelings, lets talk about the actual game!  First off, let me state that I&apos;m immensely glad I played this at a friend&apos;s house first instead of outright buying it.  Would&apos;ve been a shame to lose over fifty bucks on something not worth five, but at least I learned my lesson after Civ: Beyond Earth.
<br>
<br>Do you love linear corridor shooters, than look no further - the brand new shadow warrior(tm!) is your game!  Gone are the confusing, beautiful maps of it&apos;s predecessor, where you had to actually use that noggin of yours sometimes to find a secret area, or figure out what to do next.  No, Shadow Warrior is the every man&apos;s game.  You can rest assured that even if your IQ borders on room temperature levels, you&apos;ll never be at a loss as to where to go next.  Sure, the controls might be awful, but at least any idiot can figure them out.  Where repetition is the name of the game, Shadow Warrior aims to excel in every area!
<br>
<br>It took me three years to get over the simmering anguish caused by a company crapping all over a childhood love of mine to write this a review.  But here it is.  I give it a 1 because the swordplay is neat.  The words I want to type to express how I feel about this &apos;sequel&apos; (prequel, really, but I don&apos;t care) aren&apos;t polite enough to post here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=6685878">Expand</a></span>

<br>At first, Shadow warrior appears like a retarded, borderline racist remake of a retarded, plain racist game from the 90&apos;s. The plot at first appears contrived and simplistic but as you play it, you realise there&apos;s something far more deep in there.
<br>The game appears to have that cringe-worthy western ability of confusing Chinese and Japanese culture, but as you progress through the game, wading through Wang and Confucius jokes, you start to get the feeling it is all intentional and very tongue in cheek.
<br>It is all very frivolous and funny but in the background, a very sad and tragic story is revealed. Very, very well done.
<br>You get a few guns and weapons but the real star of the game is your katana. This has to be some of the best sword play mechanics I have ever come across. Dare I even say it holds the game together.
<br>The enemies don&apos;t change much and the basic of the game remain the same throughout, but the levels are nicely designed and it does allows for some exploration.
<br>I really felt that by the end, the game had gone a few chapters too long, but it was certainly a very fun ride.
<br>A very, very good budget title. If you enjoy sword fights, get this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3756541">Expand</a></span>

I would list them all, but I don&apos;t think that is appropriate for this review. In any case, when I seen this swordplay game available for pre-order, it was a must-buy for me.
<br>The graphics are impressive, the dialogue is entertaining enough, Lo Wang and Hoji are both very likeable characters, and the epic large scale boss battles were quite well done.
<br>...So why was I so rushed and eager to end the game? I felt like there was really little to do, that it was extremely linear, and that it had some of the most repetitive and monotonous combat I have played recently.
<br>I cannot deny the quality points of the game, but I expect a whole lot more depth from games I spend 40 bucks on. This game offers nothing other than moving from point A to point B while mindlessly hacking at hordes of similar enemies, and the combat is not even very impressive.
<br>
<br>I give this game a 7/10 for its decent performance at delivering a polished generic slasher game, but remove another point because of its lack of content for its price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866947">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Lo Wang in this game is not likable, his jokes are rarely funny, the demon/almost satanic theme is horrible and there are bugs galore. Instead of a &quot;baseball wrong, man with four balls cannot walk&quot; we get a fortune cookie that says &quot;there is only wang&quot;. WTF! This is only a single example but I could go on for an hour about how this game is completely inferior to the original. If you are in to horror type FPS games I could see you liking this game for what it is and not for a Shadow Warrior remake.
<br>
<br>I did enjoy Hard Reset as a FYI and I do think the sword combat is good in this game but all the other faults make this a definite pass. Instead of solid combat with an equal opportunity to use guns and the sword, this game forces you to use the sword for everything along with the lame sword powers. Half the time you fight your character is dancing around as you try to remember movement combinations to activate the super sword powers. Oh my word. If Steam had the ability to gift used games I would give this away, I dont think I can play it anymore honestly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=3802934">Expand</a></span>

Lo-wang and Oji will make you laugh various times, and finally the game is long enough to justify the time invested. Looking forward for more from the creators.

But this... the gameplay is very fun, even if a little repetitive, the graphics are amazing, the voice acting is well done and the story... well, it captivated me, in a way that I hadn&apos;t seen it coming. The game doesn&apos;t take itself seriously, and that&apos;s good, because, all of a sudden, you are anxious to see what is coming next. The plot really surprised me after I reached 1/3 of the game. Recommended to anyone who likes FPSs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4774867">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you haven&apos;t played or bought this game yet, do it.  For the low $ price this game is superb bang for buck.

Well written dialogue, a decent story, solid shooting, well done sound, incredible graphics and smooth game play make this a shooter that is worthy of the Shadow Warrior name as a reboot and if you like shooters this is one you should pick up.
<br>
<br>TL;DNR: 8.5: A humorous over the top shooter, tons of loot, hidden secrets, decent story, great action and solid game play with beautiful graphics make this a shooter for those with a sense of humor and desire for lots of combat.  Sound is great, soundtrack is fitting and there is never a dull moment.
<br>
<br>Technology/engine: 9: super smooth execution although a number of loading screens that are placed in such a way as to not be annoying and keeps the graphical fidelity high and controls responsive.
<br>
<br>AI: 8: Serviceable but a bit predictable but when the individual AIs of the mobs get mixed it gets intense and is enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 10: Gorgeous sets, great character models, wonderful animations, great cut scenes and great use of 2D cut scenes for memories.  Flying Hog deserves high marks for the graphics used in this game.
<br>
<br>Sound: 8: Sound effects are well done but occasional source to reception issues can be found in the game that prevent you from spotting the source at a longer distance.  Otherwise its a solid ambient soundscape that creates immersion and adds to the game.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack: 9: Great music throughout, I especially liked the unnerving heavy metal on the appearance of the black rabbit - one of the funniest and weirdly frightening moments that was totally unexpected in the game.
<br>
<br>Voice acting: 9: Solid cheesy delivery and poignant when needed or appropriate.
<br>
<br>Crafting: N/A
<br>
<br>Customization: 9: Customization includes various powers, skills and weapon customization all of which are rewarding and make a difference in the game.
<br>
<br>Game play systems: 9: Really well mixed variety of weapons and abilities and the game scales with a difficulty spike if you are just ripping through.  A number of the fights almost feel unfair until you find a technique to deal with the situation and the tools are always there.
<br>
<br>Controls: 8: Slightly awkward controls that are occasionally unresponsive or do something other than what was intended - ie D-D-RMB is supposed to heal you but will occasionally perform the RMB function of the weapon - which can kill you of course.  Perhaps when it comes out for consoles it will function better (although I hate to play shooters on console - prefer mouse and keyboard).  Other than that it functions well.
<br>
<br>Story: 9: I was surprised at the quality of the story, the great use of humor and the still poignant tale that is weaved into over the top violence and silliness that really, somehow, works well.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer: N/A</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4351902">Expand</a></span>

<br>But where Hard Reset was over a little too quickly, this game has a lot more length to it with some really nice looking levels in a range of varied locations. The mix of sword and guns also works better than expected, with the sword being especially satisfying to use, although some of the weapons can feel a little weak sometimes and it would have been nice to have a little more enemy variety.
<br>But if you prefer your FPS games the old way then you will love this game, levels actually require exploring as opposed to walking from point A to B and the action is constant - no cut scenes every 2 minutes pulling you out of the action but at the same time you get some of the more modern conveniences like weapon upgrades and skill points to spend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=4005159">Expand</a></span>

Much like those games, this game does an excellent job of making you feel like an unstoppable badass, a critical element of FPS that I have found sorely lacking in, say, the military shooter genre. This title sees a younger, but no less self-important Lo Wang pitted not only against his original nemesis, corporate magnate Orochi Zilla, but a new assortment of vicious demons, and he&apos;s got a new wisecracking sidekick who sees Wang for what he is: a hopeless nerd playing at being a street samurai. But while he is quick to dispense one-liners, this Lo Wang is a fay cry from the lecherous old master of the first game, and finds himself in the midst of a powerful and emotional struggle between ancient demon lords, and matures greatly as both a warrior and a person over the course of his adventure. Shadow Warrior seamlessly (More or less. The upgrade menus strike some as jarring interruptions) blends modern character progression, enemy dismemberment and bit of iron-sight aiming with movement-based, coverless shooter combat against large numbers of enemies, typical of its predecessor&apos;s day, weaving magic spells and special sword techniques into Lo Wang&apos;s already considerable arsenal of brutal firearms. The sword itself takes a much greater role then the first game and is great fun to use, rending the demons hordes into so many meat chunks. Scattered throughout the levels are a multitude of secret areas, including one lifted directly from the original game, much like the hidden Wolfenstein 3D levels in New Order and Old Blood, and you&apos;re met with a score screen at the end of the level, assessing your skills as a Shadow Warrior- I never scored particularly high, but it didn&apos;t stop me from loving the game from beginning to its surprisingly poignant ending. I eagerly look forward to playing the upcoming sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-warrior/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507847">Expand</a></span>

However, it is fun if you have some time to kill. Just dont expect to be playing it for very long.</span>

Makes lo wang actually turn in his grave due to how terrible this one is. Didn&apos;t anyone learn anything from Blood Dragon? If a game even has bad modern gameplay mechanics, it still can be good if the style of the game is right this is just another calladoody.</span>
