I haven&apos;t tried online play since the Beta and I know I wouldn&apos;t do well anyway, so I&apos;m just leaving that part out. 1) Campaign For fans of the C&amp;C series, the story will be a major disappointment. In Red Alert 1, an anonymous scientist (more specifically, professor) goes back, kills Hitler, and alters the history of the world (thus leading to Nod, GDI, and the C&amp;C universe). In Red Alert 2, they said it was Einstein who made the time travel back to kill Hitler and alter the world. In Red Alert 3, the Soviets go back in time and kill Einstein. This would naturally create a time paradox throughout the entire Red Alert timeline, since Hitler would have been allowed to live, World War II would have happened, and the world would be closer to what it is now, except no nukes (apparently a consequence of not having Einstein around). To get back to the Campaign, the campaigns are short, but fun. 9 missions for each side all having multiple mission objectives and bonus objectives. Each campaign can really be divided into the following: 2/3 battles against one faction, 4 battles against the other faction, 1 battle against the first faction, and then 1/2 battles against the second faction. It does not take long to knock one side out of the war. For the Soviets, the Empire is eliminated first and then they concentrate on the Allies. For the Allies, they knock the Soviets out, make peace, and then go after the Empire. The Empire takes out the Soviets first, then goes after the Allies. Doing online co-op of the missions would be fun, but it might make the missions a bit too easy. Sharing income would be the only difficulty in the mission (you also share income with your AI co-commander in each mission). The cutscenes are cheesy, but add a light atmosphere. The campaigns are very much so targeted towards teenage and young-adult males as most of the women are in revealing outfits (well, they all are in at least one point in the game...). The selection of actors they got to play in the game were good actors, but in my opinion, Tim Curry shouldn&apos;t be playing a Russian. 2) Skirmishes Once you&apos;re done with the campaign you might delve into fighting the AI commanders in single-player skirmishes. Oddly enough, the difficulty AI seems to be slightly reversed. The easy computers are a challenge for newcomers, the medium computers are aggressive and more diverse, but when you get to hard, the AI suddenly becomes incredibly stupid. I just recently watched a 2v2 Hard computer match and I have never seen such ridiculously inert AI in my life. Examples of the AI&apos;s shortcomings are as follows: 1) An Allied commander fired their Super Collider (the Allies&apos; superweapon) at a small band of Empire units coming to their base, only to miss them all completely. 2) The Empire that was attacking the Allied base allowed for the Allied MCV to leave the combat zone. It had almost no life remaining. 3) The Empire used its transforming units irresponsibly, constantly transforming them in times when it would make them useless in the fight. An example, a Striker-VX (a ground anti-air/air anti-ground unit combo) was attacking ground units when it was being attacked by some ground anti-air units. It transformed into its anti-air mode so it could shoot back at the ground units, allowing for itself to be destroyed. So, I&apos;d say if you&apos;re looking for a challenge, play the game against medium opponents for now. It&apos;ll give you the hardest opposition. The manual mentioned &quot;Brutal&quot; difficulty, but I haven&apos;t seen it when adding computer opponents and I&apos;m also afraid as to how low it&apos;s going to go. I actually had some really good fights against Easy opponents, especially when playing the Hidden Fortress map which pits a 2 v 1 scenario. All in all, Red Alert 3 is a fairly good game. If you can set aside some of the discrepancies from the original storyline as well as the cartoony look to the game, it can be fun. Some people have complained that the Empire of the Rising Sun&apos;s units look too close to anime units. The game&apos;s developers said that they were taken directly from anime concepts, such as the transforming units, the King Oni (a giant walking robot), to the Shinobis (ninjas) and Yuriko Omega (a powerful telekinetic girl moving about in a schoolgirl outfit). I was also slightly disappointed that they took away the ability of the Apocalypse tank&apos;s (formerly the Mammoth Tank) ability to shoot air, but it was a good balance choice. The sides are all fairly balanced, although some of the super powers are more useful and powerful than others. I&apos;m sure if EA puts up some patches to the game, it&apos;ll be ready to move on up to an 8, maybe even a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=421140">Expand</a></span>

I, being a big fan of the CNC series (especially Red Alert), think this is one of the biggest dissapointments i&apos;ve had in my gaming experience. The Things i liked about the game tough, is the graphics. Much better than the older games. The Story in campaign is nice too, and then the thing that they&apos;ve used real-life recordings in the game is so cool.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=421430">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the C&amp;C Generals series a lot and this game seemed to have a bit of that same mix of cheesiness and great gameplay. There are some really nice new RTS features like campaign co-op and 3 completely different stories to choose from. The graphics are okay too and the AI is also pretty intelligent. What ultimately ruined some of the fun I had was the amount of micromanagement and irritating game flaws which affected the gameplay a lot; errors in path finding which makes your units stop, the default stance being too passive and not being able to select a default stance for all games which will make your units ignore enemies close by, the way you have to scroll all the way back to your base and actively select your construction building in order to set its waypoint. These types of flaws would probably not mean so much if they did not affect the gameplay but unfortunately they do. This game has great potential and a delightful cheesiness to the story but the gameplay issues have not been prioritized enough to be fixed and sadly that ruined it for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2399769">Expand</a></span>

Units that move from ground to air via special ability select with those on the ground when selecting all like units. There&apos;s also terrible AI even with your own units. Units with no defense will just sit there and get attacked instead of running away. And units with offense just out of range of say a tower, will sit there and die rather than moving automatically to engage the tower. It&apos;s such a bad game. I will never buy another command and conquer game after this.

As a C&amp;C fan of the older games, this version created by EA has me scratching my head in between imprinting keys on my forehead. It feels like it was an obligatory installment, and not something done well except hitting all of the right &apos;selling marks&apos;: Sex and RA. Just the fact that they made Tanya a blonde in this installment instead of a brunette like in the previous two annoys me. Various plot flaws, including the presence of the chronosphere and lack of other chrono units annoys me. A lack of returning cast (General Carville, anyone?) hurts, but the current cast suffices, though the whole purpose of the female cast is to show as much as possible to the player, in terms of skin. Micromanagement of what little units there are can be frustrating in a large group of mixed units. a decided lack of a unit capable of ferrying land-locked vehicles across water without resorting to the massive plot-flaw that is the chronosphere extremely annoying. Ore collecting is a joke, lacking any possibility of a renewable resource for those long boxing matches I used to savor with the opponent, which now is usually taken out by my computer counterpart from sheer unit-pumping ability. I now have an obnoxious computer that I must lead by the hand in particular missions, as well as lose opportunities in commandeering enemy structures because the computer&apos;s units are trigger happy. Once again, I feel like a great game is squandered to pay fanservice to the almighty console gamer, the complete lack of a PC-oriented game in a PC-based series. They don&apos;t even dignify the PC version by hosting it&apos;s own matchmaking service, instead relying on the horrid Gamespy service for multiplayer capabilities, whereas the console version merely uses it&apos;s own services. I remember a time when this series of games was exactly that: A series. Now, it feels like a game produced for the sake of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=420081">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t help that the much touted &quot;Cooperative play&quot; feature feels more like a &quot;Way too ****ing easymode,&quot; and I was playing on Normal. :I But then, when your AI buddy is spamming the enemy with near infinite resources worth of units, well. Give it a pass if you want an RTS that&apos;s actually somewhat challenging. If you want one that plays like cheats are always enabled, this&apos;d be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=423165">Expand</a></span>

As stated by others, it&apos;s more comical (With the graphics), has more loose humour, and alot of eye candy, which personally in my opinion is just to attract young teenagers into buying the game. One thing I noticed when I played, was that the troops in the game (like a conscript), when killed, the corpse will remain on the ground for quite abit unlike other games. The bodies can even be flinged or moved around after the unit/s die. I was annoyed that there wasn&apos;t a map generator in it like the previous RA games. Luckily, the nets provided a map generator mod for the game. I would not recommend this game more than the old games. Nothing will ever beat the old Westwood games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1673591">Expand</a></span>

The new resource-gathering techniques make the gameplay slow, the units are extra expensive, extra buildings build MCVs, barracks and war factories buy extra upgrades to buy decent units.

Everything from the Talent/cinematics, unit creations, artistic design, to the gameplay and UI, the game will simply blow you away. That said, i do believe we have one major problem, and that is the sh*tty multiplayer interface through gamespy, yet again. I am STUNNED, yet not quite surprised, that EA used the same POS gamespy as Tiberium Wars &amp; TW:Kanes Wrath, but at the same time it makes sense i guess since its still a C&amp;C game so it uses the same code from C&amp;C3. But regardless, they should have spent more time overhauling the multiplayer interface that you have to kick and scream with until it starts to work. For example, last night i tried to login in RA3 with my EA Master Account that i used with C&amp;C3, and i was fed with an invalid serial key error. So i am guessing that i have to make a new RA3 account with the exact same name as my C&amp;C3 account if i want to use that login. Pretty frustrating... So this is why i can only rate this game a 9 out of 10, is because of the gamespy issues in multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer though, i must admit that is AWESOME that this entire game can be played in co-op mode. In the briefing of every mission you can click either a co-op button or solo button at the bottom of the screen when you are done with the briefing. Co-Op would be awesome if it werent for the gamespy issues! Anywho... I would like to comment on Mark J&apos;s review, which i thought was very wrong. While reading Mark&apos;s review i&apos;ve come to the conclusion that the man does not know what he is talking about, and i dont think he even played RA1 or RA2, becuase the content arguements he makes against this game are the exact same as in RA1 and RA2, but IMHO better executed then the previous 2. After everything is said and done though, with future updates and the like to be made to this game (C&amp;C3 is still being updated constantly to this day) i urge you to go pick this game up, especially if you are a C&amp;C fan, but im sure you already did if you are ;) NOTE: I bought the Premier Edition and i absolutely love the box that it came in, along with the cool poster of all the RA3 Babes (who are HOT, but this comes with the regular edition as well) and the two extra discs that the PE comes with full of cool toys and behind the scenes videos + strategies for multiplayer to entertain you with after you&apos;ve completed the game, and the PE comes with a special WARHAMMER item code that you can redeem online, it is a hat that turns you into a bear (AWESOME!). Also, the manual is printed in color (which is cool since you can see the artistic detail that went into the manual) instead of black and white like in the regular edition. One more thing to mention, in the regular edition, there is a sticker on the plastic wrapped box which states that it comes with a special WARHAMMER item, but there is nothing in the box to tell you how to get it, and there is no code for it. So i&apos;m not sure what the deal is with that... Hope this review helped!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=418956">Expand</a></span>

<br>Definitely one of the best RTS games out there besdies RA2.

This is Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 in a nutshell: Boobs, ass,  explosions, Japanese school girls, and vodka. This honestly the most immature Installment to date. Red Alert 2 although having the same crude humor, was executed perfectly and had a sense of combat etiquette and showed sexuality very subtly. The women in Red Alert 3 act like there about to film a porno, its pathetic and cringe worthy.
<br>
<br>Not the mention the game play. the emphasis on naval warfare is quickly overbalanced and does not perform any mechanical depth other than a means to escape an enemy. In Red alert 2 any body of water was both another battlefield and a barrier. it had an interesting dynamic that both the land an sea had to be conquered as a means to secure land troops across a body of water. in this game that strategy is gone, now anybody and their hydrophobic mother can swim across any body of water.
<br>
<br>Units are dwarfed and have micro-actions assign for each one of them. which is a nice touch but some units have useless micro actions, and some units micro actions are just basic functions that arnt really giving it much purpose. Not to mention the chaotic mess that is the skill tree. In the command and conquer series or in any other RTS, you must progress up a tech tree by building certain buildings to allow yourself to build stronger advanced units. But holy  the untis in this game are backward an useless. the Apoc tank got a major nerf, tsunami tanks arent even tanks as they are just weaker version of the IFV. its a mess.
<br>
<br>Over all if u are a die hard CNC fan, dont be. EA had just announced the swan song and the funereal of a beloved franchise that stood for intense strategy, compelling story, cinematic excellence and strategic infrastructure. Command and Conquer is dead, and there is no turning from it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3144046">Expand</a></span>

Ignoring the video clips which are on par with all the others in the series, the game mechanics don&apos;t feel right. I find myself playing this out of loyalty to the franchise (and to justify buying the game) but it lacks the magic of the previous versions. All units have two types of attack but the menu system is annoying. Some units are just plain novel and only used because they&apos;re all you have in the single player mode. I can&apos;t understand the high review scores, perhaps I&apos;ll play it again and change my mind, maybe I&apos;m missing something. In the meantime I&apos;ll stick to the skirmishes in Tiberium Wars. Unforgivable taking away the ore/tiberium mining and replacing it with boring oil derek&apos;s. Good to see Mr Solo make a come back via the world of failed actors who end up in video games though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=421927">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Idk who spammed this with bad reviews but they are not true and you should not buy into them.
<br>
<br>Solid gameplay, good campaign, and intriguing units. This truely is the sequel to red alert 2 with its querkyness and all. Although this game does not take itself very seriously it is massively fun to play for hours on end. Strategy is key in this game where you have many options of assault and you are able to take research and development in different areas to see what is effective. You will soon learn after playing the strengths and weaknesses of each faction and just how to play as each. This game decides to mix naval air and ground battles just as in red alert 2 but it is done better as you have the worry of being snuck up on by enemy fleets, or bombed by bombers.
<br>
<br>This game is great and I enjoy it more than many of the other command and conquer games out there. Definitely buy this and if you enjoy the campaign or just single player battles but wish for more units then buy the expansion pack it is worth the money if you don&apos;t mind no multiplayer which really is a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3372466">Expand</a></span>

Co-op on the hardest difficulty with my friend was a challenge and was enjoyable. The online play is a downfall as it&apos;s largely rushing, however if you have 3 friends to play with then this game is a joy to play. Lots of crazy things you can do.</span>

<br>Now, back to review, game is great - graphics are nice (that water!), unit balance is pretty good, and while there are one-man army units which can wipe out entire base in matter of seconds, it just adds that dynamic feeling to the game - you have to control everything, or you will be crushed. As of story - honestly, for an RTS it is great. Even if it&apos;s supposed to be funny at times, it makes a way better job of telling player a story than, let&apos;s say, Starcraft 2 campaign. Especially considering Uprising, which is also a lot darker and deeper than base RA3. It doesn&apos;t also matter if this game is similar or isn&apos;t to Red Alert1/2 - Why it would be? It&apos;s been like 7 years. RA3 is pretty innovative for the series, the whole amphibious-mecha-etc system is just amazing (compared to - again - SC 2, it&apos;s just godlike).
<br>Only problems IMHO are things like pathfinding (fixed in Uprising moreless), too much boobs (if you don&apos;t like girls :c) and imbalance between missions difficulty -  Pearl Harbor is just harder than assault on Black Tortoise or even Yokohama, lol. Also, AI derps sometimes in campaign, usually if you run to water with your MCV - then it sometimes stops doing anything for ~10 minutes or until you attack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2856984">Expand</a></span>

The Japanese campaign is horrific. The only thing that kept me playing was sheer determination to beat the game and be done with it. The only upside was the obvious sexual appeal by the female actors. Although a lovely set of buxom breasts is a nice sight in a videogame, it is hardly able to overcome the glaring problems with army composition, unbalanced factions and the base units in general. They really scraped the bottom of the barrel to come up with these half-witted, futuristic clown cars. One thing the developers can&apos;t seem to understand is you don&apos;t need to make a rock-paper-scissors army strategy where it appears each unit was torn from the mind of a child watching a sci-fi movie. You just need to make classic, cool C&amp;C tanks and supporting units and let us throw them at each other like the good old C&amp;C games. Improve the graphics sure, make more levels great! But this new junk? They deserve to all be fired for going out this far on a limb just to pump out another title. For shame EA.

Although EA have spoiled C&amp;C since they took over, they got this one right. The gameplay is both slightly new and traditional - it is still lightning fast, but having new elements like single mines for resources and full on naval battles. Many have said this new resource method is out of place in C&amp;C - and yes, it is different, but now you can focus on the fighting. The aforementioned naval battles are sublime - it&apos;s a wonder why so few RTS games do it. Now you can build entire bases in the water if need be which has never been done before in Red Alert. This added importance of a navy leads to having to pick your strategy well. All tanks, air or navy? Or a mix of all? The balancing between them is decent, if a little unsuited to C&amp;C. While you still have a few &apos;pure&apos; combat units, most have an ability that allow the unit to fulfil a different role, disable something, enhance allies firepower, things like that. It is interesting, and the best players always fully understand which units to use and when. Another welcome change is the new approach - this game is ridiculous. Not gritty, or serious, just ridiculous. War Bears, Dolphins, massive zepplins, and yes - lasers from a robot&apos;s eyes. It is a great amount of fun to observe. The FMV&apos;s are still cheesy and stupid, and while EA have accumulated a cast of models (no explanation needed as to why), they seem to have asked them to not act at all, it doesn&apos;t matter. The campaign is a lot of fun too, with the added choice of playing the whole game in co-op with a friend. Above all, if you want a silly, fun, fast and above all, solid RTS, this is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1404045">Expand</a></span>

As anyways this is the worst RTS game I have ever seen in the global recession. While popularity are into their players&apos; hands, I found this game with very poor expectations. Some ideas in this game are outdated, with a confusing spinoff story with cheap actors/actresses in FMVs just to bargain for the money with the sex appeal shown. Also the graphics could have been sharper despite the cartoonish graphics and the engine still did not support 64-bit and DirectX10 compatibility. Gameplay is a bit out of date but was gained thanks to the co-op play feature though some users who gave poor scores said that gameplay is still fast and having still fragile units. Even the worst design in C&amp;C history just happens to be the Apocalypse Tank which isn&apos;t even big then we thought to be and it lacks air defenses. And like what the other users have said, where&apos;s the creativity and innovation from EALA that we once had expected? They done their best on C&amp;C3. If you look at Starcraft II, Company of Heroes and Dawn of War II, they performed better than this game because of their good features, good story, good gameplay and very good graphics. EALA might have thought they made this game their best including the best non-Hollywood actors/actresses when it&apos;s really C&amp;C3 they made the best out of more than RA3. This rush release has been poor with incomplete development unlike on how Infinity Ward studios did on the Call of Duty series. Therefore this game is not a epic experience to C&amp;C players out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=422037">Expand</a></span>

Maybe if games like Company of Heroes, World In Conflict, Supreme Commander and Dawn of War didn&apos;t exist it&apos;d be able to call itself average, but honestly I can&apos;t think of a more infantile, braindead, cheesy game in its genre. The graphics are reasonably well presented, but the artistic concept is like something out of a bad cartoon as the art team do their best to emulate the look of Starcraft and fail. The units are uniformly stupid and inconsistent, the interface is immensely dated, the maps are poor and small. I mean take away the shiny graphics and it&apos;d struggle to be better than the original. It&apos;s like a decade of innovation in the genre never happened. I got this game for free through work and I still felt cheated.

Its is one of my games because it takes itself away from the seriousness of all the other RTS games out there at the moment and brings it back to what it should always be about, fun. Just pure simple fun. With a great cast and a funny storyline, you&apos;ll be enjoying this game for years to come. I haven&apos;t had so much fun since C&amp;C: Generals! :D</span>

RT, Ian, James, you guys have absolutely no idea what an RTS is. Now, all the C&amp;C series is about how many hot chicks they can slap up on the game with ridiculous FMVs and a plot that makes absolutely no sense nor is it actually fun to play. The graphics are not impressing at all. For crying out loud, Starcraft (the first) looks better and more realistic, and Im not even going to mention how much better the plot is. Adding a new commander does not help at all in gameplay. It just angers me because there&apos;s a dimwit who makes childish remarks and acts like a total retard &quot;trying&quot; to help me. I never asked for help playing C&amp;C. So what gives? Anyway, 3rd game in the series and it seems more and more as if it&apos;s losing the strategy part of it. A lot of people have been bedazzled by &quot;new&quot; units and a new side but its nowhere near enough to make up for the pure garbage that the game is. The Apocalypse tank...wow, what happened? Honestly...what happened? Ore wells!? Since when??? You can call RA3 an RTS if by that you mean Real Time Spamming because honestly that&apos;s all that you have or can do. Now it&apos;s all about who can build the fastest and launch the biggest wave of units OR you can wait to get a superweapon and just let that do all the work for you and pretend that you played a strategy game. I played this game for a few days and hated myself for it. I have been with C&amp;C since the beginning but never again will I buy another C&amp;C game. Fellas, this is as far as I go. I can only go so far and so low. If you want to play a REAL RTS, pick up Company of Heroes, the Dawn of War series, or Supreme Commander. Only get this if you want soft-core porn and some mild humor from some bad actors. The only thing this games is going to be dominating is the trash bin, where it belongs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424289">Expand</a></span>

The 5 comes from the fact that it would be a rare find these lidays to come across an RTS with a unique and astute balance of streamlined gameplay, organic command/control and, last but never the least, an auspicious storyline. The once asymmetrical and oligopolized landscape of action strategy is now very much a mediocre affair, given room for certain exceptions of course. Unfortunately RA3 is not among one of those few - far from it in fact. RA3 isn&apos;t alone in this field and industry of apparent complacency (it&apos;s been a while since my last having witnessed a solid RTS title - that of Blitzkrieg). However, that&apos;s no excuse for dishing up this ill-conceived, half-baked serving of what could have been a stunning revival to the genre. At risk of going off-course, I want to point out the progression of the Batman series of motion pictures. After the first two blockbusters directed by Tim Burton, the franchise went to the doghouse and got cleaned out by reviewers for its blatant absurdity and stark incoherency. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight changed all that because the series got back on track. It had rediscovered its ROOTS - the dark sardonic broodings of a pained crusader. The C&amp;C series succeeded because it had embodied the crux of what was involved in the inevitable and perpetual struggle between the standing superpowers - quantity vs. quality. One striking element was the Red Horde or Tank Rush as referred to by some participants. The mammoth tank was an avid rendition of that concept which took flight - a powerful illustration of firepower, armored endurance and overwhelming superiority. It gave Westwood Studios all the Christmas bonuses it can take, buffet style, until EA came along and bought up the entire operation - BUMMER! Tiberian Sun failed to achieve stellar status because of the decision from somewhere within EA to exclude the mammoth tank from the game. I hope whomever made that call is serving out his term chipping rocks in Eastern Afghanistan. That walking thingy called the Titan just didn&apos;t cut it; it failed to make the distance by miles. I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to say that the original C&amp;C and RA1 were dark. Both had their providentially inserted moments of comical relief which gave the game a certain quality of wit and charm. EA tried to mass-replicate the set of once-successful characteristics by turning the franchise, in its RA3 offering, into the Rocky Horror Picture Show of the RTS genre. What can the fans say? Innovation actually takes a fair bit more than transparent and reflective water effects. I&apos;m uncertain as to their business model which underlines the intrinsic market segment targeted by the title. Perhaps it may connect with and develop a new fan base. I do know however that the game&apos;s direction, as dictated by EA, has done an exacting job towards alienating a significant proportion of pre-existing fans whom had marched through thick and hell alongside Westwood ever since the first original C&amp;C hit the shelves in 1995. I was one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419833">Expand</a></span>

Some of the diologe was rather clique and predictable but over all still a delight. This cast is the best in a video game I have seen to date. As far as the actual game play goes, It isnt too different from past editions which means it is just as fun only a whole lot prettier. I havent really got to play with all three factions enough to really get a feel for the balance. Of course the C&amp;C games have never been able in my opinion to reach the level of balance found in starcraft but the shear number of crazy options you have on what to build it a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419957">Expand</a></span>

On one hand, it is the continuation of one of the most popular and respected RTS franchises, on he other hand, it most definitely lacks the Westwood touch. On the plus side is the fact that, despite sheer simplicity of gameplay, self-contradictory storyline, ridiculous design, incredibly cheesy cutscenes and lack of any challenge whatsoever... this game is fun to play, simple as that. All factions are distinct and well-balanced, while pretty much every unit has a secondary ability which allows for a number of creative strategies to be implemented, the missions are quite varied, and inclusion of famous landmarks gives them a distinct feel. Music is at least good, especially the bombastic Soviet march played in the main menu, and battle themes for all factions, and graphics, cartoony design aside, are well-detailed and smooth. On the other hand, there is a lot of problems both small and big. The very first thing that strikes every longtime fan of C&amp;C is the utter lack of understanding of the series on devs&apos; behalf. Until now, RA2 was the only C&amp;C game with intentionally cheesy cutscenes and cartoonish design - the first three games were gritty, quite dark tales about world war, and that&apos;s how the series&apos; &apos;founders&apos; envisioned it. RA3, on the other hand, throws all of it away, which is visible in pretty much every unit and scenario of the game. The ideas implemented range from weird (an Imperial unit transforming from a sub to an anti-ground fighter and vice versa) to completely retarded (a chopper capable of shrinking down units or Mt. Rushmore monuments turned into laser cannons). Design is also weird at best - the mighty Apocalypse tank (well remembered as the respectable, realistically-looking behemoth from RA2) looks like something that could be classified as weaponized toy, while the entire Empire looks like a corny collection of various anime rejects, from Mecha Tengu land/ground unite to the insanely powerful Shogun Executioner. Even the most plausible units are strange - in the previous C&amp;C games even the most outlandish units had had a certain deal of plausibility to them due to design that was rooted in a real-life weapons. Here, on the other hand, units look as if they were designed after toys. The only units that have genuine character to them are the Kirov Airship (the design of which is taken directly from RA2...) and a few naval units (out of which, once more, a number was taken from the previous installment). The other problem is the implementation of the AI commander to aid. While the player has a limited control over his or her actions, they are very basic and ultimately come down to simply ammasing an army and sending it to slaughter. There is no &apos;Hold your ground&apos; or &apos;Expand to this mine&apos; kind of subtleties - it&apos;s all brawn and no brains. The AI commander has also a very &apos;all or nothing&apos; attitude - upon ordering him to execute an instant attack on a selected target sends ALL his units at once to the given location - that way, before the heavy armor arrives, the fastest units are usually slaughtered by the enemy, who later on has no trouble dispatching the other units who manage to catch up. This way, sometimes destruction of a simple Factory is done at a high price in resources and personnel. What&apos;s worse, the Co-Commander and the player share their income - which tends to be infuriating, as the AI eagerily builds units only to lose them a few moments later... and it comes partially at the player&apos;s expanse. The campaign is strangely designed; but before I get into it, let me recap how the previous C&amp;C games handled it. The first RA had 14 missions per side... with only TWO warring factions and a SINGLE continent. That really gave the conflict a punch - even as the Allied divisions locked on Moscow, or Soviet war Juggernaut approached the final Allied resistance point, they still had to give it their all, as the enemy fought (literally) to the last men. The inclusion of Counterstrike and Aftermath only increased the number of missions, and quite difficult one sat that, ultimately making it a whooping 26 missions per side. Now, that&apos;s a bloody, lengthy, plausible conflict. The cutscenes, while tended to be overacted and cheesy, still gave the sense of urgency and seriousness to the conflict unfolding in front of the player. The same can be said about Tiberian Sun and C&amp;C aka Tiberian Dawn. Even Red Alert 2, despite intentional cheesiness, managed to add this sense of urgency to the campaign - nuclear destruction of Chicago followed by a covert operation meant to neutrilize Soviet nuke silos, almost defeated Allies who nevertheless posed a threat beacause of their Chronosphere... most, if not all missions felt strategically important and somewhat logical. In RA 3, on the other hand, the campaign is very brief, despite plenty of stuff to do in every mission (9 missions per side, and it&apos;s a three faction war pretty much from the beginning), and feels very disjointed. The objectives sometimes are strange, too - for instance (SPOILER) the final Soviet mission requires the player to destroy Fort Bradley and the Statue of Liberty... and that&apos;s all. The Allies lose their cherished monument, and surrender. There is no mission in Washington, or any other strategic target in the US - compare it to RA2, when invasion of the Big Apple was just the third mission, and even that was but one victory, as Allies continued to oppose. The other thing that feels strange is how little it takes to take out a warring party out of the conflict - in RA it took 14 missions to finish the war against a single enemy, in RA 2, 12 battles to take out the Soviet Union or Allies and enemies within. In RA 3, it&apos;s usually 4 or 5 missions to eliminate a faction. It makes the conflict hardly believable, as victory seems to come too fast and too easy. This rant is getting too long for what&apos;s supposed to be a brief comment, so let&apos;s wrap it up - RA3 is definitely an enjoyable game, yet it is more of a shadow of what the series used to be. If you are a fan of the series, make sure you know what you are up to, as this game departs very far from the original feel and style of the series, and mostly does so with poor results.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=420587">Expand</a></span>

The sarcastical scenario and shocking ending really makes you happy ever after. Besides the movies are great. But on the other hand, RA3 still didn&apos;t get out of the circle of simple RTS, it&apos;s still a little too easy for RTS gamers.</span>

The gameplay for the console just S**ks period. But after playing the demo on PC, I decided to buy it again ( at 10 $ on STEAM, why would I cry about it ? ) I like the storyline, the cinematics and although there is a lack of new original units in the game and a weird way of getting ressources ( mean by weird that you have to build near the spot and still need collectors ? ) the game is still good. The co-op features was an addition to this game and I like it . There is more difficult RTS games in the world though so for those guys who complaint about the game being too easy, I give you a big point on this one ! if anyone want a difficult RTS, pass on this one or you will regret it. But if you dont care about the difficulty, the graphics and just want a RTS where you build an army in a easy strategic way to destroy your opponent, get it . This game didnt worth its price when it was 50 $ at the beginning ( well in Canada it was 50 $, and 60 $ on console ) but now that the game is 10 to 20 $ , you should get it without complaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=742975">Expand</a></span>

It is an exercise in monetizing the franchise by EA and a way to boost their stock price. If you are not already a Red Alert fanatic, you&apos;ll likely rate this game a 40% (no grade inflation). The graphics are updated and look very good. There are a lot of vividly animated and colored units with the usual funny voices. A lot of people are up in arms about the cut scenes - when regarded in that light, Red Alert 3 is more of an interactive third tier movie. For $10 you can do much better in a movie theater (or for much less if you use Netflix like I do). The strategy part of the game, i.e. its core, is flawed. I personally hated the protocol concept. Basically you can have an enemy that is defeated, down to his last building and out of money and units, yet he can still control a series of devastating attacks that will savage your base and army. It is just silly. One of the interesting aspects of traditional RTS is that they combine resource management with the army build-up and the actual combat. Once you remove a big portion of your damage generation from the economic supply chain the game becomes just a silly arcade. Play whac-a-mole with your opponent&apos;s army using a silly set of tools like the magnetic satellite that pulls entire ships into outer space. And do that all for free... Basically the entire balance of power can be switched around with a few lucky deployments of the other guy&apos;s protocols particularly on larger maps. The protocols are overpowered and especially as they do not cost anything they ruin the strategic element of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419727">Expand</a></span>

The Red Alert games were always better than the Tiberium games that came before them and this is no exception. Red Alert 3 is much more balanced, appealing to the eye, and a lot more fun to play than C&amp;C 3. It doesn&apos;t seem to have that same attraction that keeps me playing Red Alert 2 to this day, but I can see myself playing this for a while.</span>

I&apos;m primarily a single-player person, and the co-op doesn&apos;t entice me at all, and playing with a AI commander is incredibly irritating. I really loved C&amp;C3, which was a good step after the horrid Generals, but in this part of the franchise EA managed to loose the plot again. Shame.</span>

I was unable to pick the game up again knowing how disappointed I was.

<br>I&apos;m not a religious man by any means, but I do not have any faith in the EA handling of the C&amp;C universe. Since Red Alert 2, each subsequent release from EA LA has buried this once glorious game deeper, and deeper, deeper still in EA&apos;s own septic waste. C&amp;C3 was a step in the right direction. C&amp;C:RA3 however proves how out of touch EA really is. The once solid design, mechanics &amp; love implemented by Westwood has been replaced with **** arrogant design, heavily sedated and influenced by other game universes, manga, and comic books. You would be forgiven if you thought this would improve the game formula. Sadly it does not. Co-op is a feature implemented during a period of &apos;every-game-must-have-co-op&apos; madness at EA. EA have thrown money into the cast rather than the game and is marketing sex appeal and fantasy rather than science fiction. The result is a game which is prehistoric before it ever launched. Too many &apos;new&apos; features to entice customers. New feature this, new feature that, battlecast, **** and ass, stereotypes that will bore the balls off you.
<br>
<br>The game has some nice tech, and they have obviously tried hard to bring back the cut-scenes story arc to submerse the gamer. But the direction is just abysmal, and the story is a lame duck that couldn&apos;t hatch a fart without popping a blood vessel in it&apos;s eye.
<br>
<br>My gut feeling is that RA2 (and just barely C&amp;C3) are the last straws in what was once a very enjoyable universe that will be remembered fondly until EA gets it&apos;s s**t together and stops leaving the design in the hands of an 8 year old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2500728">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are not even that redeeming even on ultra it looks like im playing a cartoon-ish web browser game and the recycled audio with the time tested lines was just too much for me at that point.
<br>Im just glad i never bought this game at full retail price and really just paid around a dollar and some change for it.
<br>
<br>Bottom line? Not even worth the one buck i spent on it.

There are no unique units, no fun maps, the acting is terrible and quite frankly, its just an embarassment to EA games. I took a careful look at those who dared give this game anything higher than a 75 rating.</span>

The action is smooth, quick and easy to control. Unit balance is superb. Each unit has a special ability and tier 1 units never become useless as the game goes on. The games start fast and end hard. Your first combat units are on the map within 20 seconds instead of spending 2 minutes every game building up SCV&apos;s. Scouting always pays off, as well as using support units. There are infiltrators to shut down parts of enemy bases, disguised transports to sneak in engineers and commandos, terror drones to infect units, cryocopters to freeze ground units which can be instantly shattered. And one of my favorite tricks, the chronosphere, which lets you drown enemy land units in the sea, or beach enemy ships instantly. The single player campaign is goofy but well executed and enjoyable. The sound and music are one of the game&apos;s strongest features, the music changes with the tempo of battle and you are awarded commander points to apply to three trees of bonuses. Ive played every major RTS since the first command and conquer, and I&apos;m happy to say that this is by far the most clever and advanced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=742784">Expand</a></span>

I am just not good with the micro, and use C&amp;C as a game to relax so i will never take the time to get all the hot keys down etc. Its by far worth getting, its a lot of fun, and for sure not the weakest in the franchise (I am looking at you Tiberium Twilight).

I am very curious why the critics have rated it so much higher than the actual players - there must be some way in which EA are influencing reviews. I got so bored trying to play it that I cannot be bothered to even try to finish any of the three fractions. There is too much tedious micromanagement (what was wrong with the simple double-click to guard/patrol approach?) It seems that EA are buying up quality titles and then  dumbing them down for console players, who must think this is great, and it probably is, compared to the even worse rubbish that they are used to playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2848275">Expand</a></span>

As it stands its still a very fun game but you can see all the areas in the game that could have used more work. I just hope in the future if they make a red alert 4 that they spend the time to make it great instead of just ok.</span>

I played the demo and really thought this would be a good game. I was wrong, I was WRONG. I got five missions in and realized I had no idea what&apos;s going on or how to play. The story is an absolute travesty. The cut scenes are basically there so you can go get a beer before the next mission. If there&apos;s a war going on I&apos;d like to know just what the heck we&apos;re doing to win it. It sure doesn&apos;t seem like a war is going on. The units all feel like toys or cartoons, everything feels borderline racist, and you think that might come out really well at first, but it ends up being dopey. They &quot;blended naval combat seamlessly into the game&quot; by making it hardly distinguishable from land combat. It feels like everyone&apos;s got little rafts. The maps are claustrophobic, water does not act as any sort of distinguishable barrier, its not clear what units can move across water and which can&apos;t, the unit abilities are unfocused and take two brains and three hands for a human player to use, and the Russian commando unit is a girl. And, no, its not cool to command an army of trained bears. They die really really fast and you lose. The blimps are tiny, the resource gathering mechanic feels mindless and tacked on,everything about the aircraft is annoying and worst of all the companion AI&apos;s are just an awful addition. They take up your resources and fight your battles for you. That may sound okay, but trust me, you don&apos;t know how much you enjoyed being in control of your own forces until half of them are at the AIs disposal. You don&apos;t decide when and where to crush the enemy, he does. The best thing you companion can possibly do is die. The happiest thing that ever happened to me in a mission was seeing my companion die and taking over his resources.

<br>I cannot tell you how much I loved Red Alert 2. It was my first RTS. I played every C&amp;C game after that. Even the really old kinda crappy ones. After Tiberium Wars, I was optimistic. I thought maybe EA would not take a crap all over the C&amp;C franchise, I thought things might work out. I was WRONG. I honestly can&apos;t think of anything good to say about this game. I liked part of the opening. I didn&apos;t like it enough to give it a &quot;1&quot; but hey that&apos;s something I guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-red-alert-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2520431">Expand</a></span>
