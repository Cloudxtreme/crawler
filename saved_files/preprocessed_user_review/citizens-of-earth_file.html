It has that fantastic old school feel but doesn&apos;t feel old. The game play which seems simple at first can get more complex as you recruit citizens and face new challenges.</span>

You get Citizens of Earth. In Citizens of Earth, you&#x2019;ll play as newly elected &#x201C;Vice President&#x201D; of Earth who wakes up at home after his first day in office, only to find a sinister plot happening in his home town.
<br>Citizens of Earth plays out just like you would expect from any traditional RPG, but rather than a hodgepodge group of people who don&#x2019;t know each other, you&#x2019;ll begin Vice President&#x2019;s adventure fighting with (rather as) your mother, brother and other townsfolk from your home town. I think this worked well with the story line, because what better reason should a Vice President fight evil, when he&#x2019;s not fighting next to his fellow politicians, than to protect his home? You can have up to three citizens in your party, all having different abilities like the Baker who produces freshly baked, health-restoring bread to heal his allies. Vice President leads his trusty citizens through combat, including a Barista who can scald enemies with hot coffee or sell useful power-up items to other party members. This type of initiation and story telling makes the title fresh and interesting and I wish more games would include a fresh, funny story like Citizens of Earth has, but does the meat of the game hold up to its great introduction? It left me wanting to see what all the citizens do, and collecting all of the Citizens of Earth helped stretch an already long title into a quest for more than completion.
<br>
<br>While Citizens of Earth isn&#x2019;t a visual diamond, live game play does the title considerably more justice than a screenshot can give it. In the traditional style of a JRPG, you&#x2019;ll be fighting in an arena for every fight, with menus for selection. Citizens of Earth looks as good as it gets in this regard, but it&#x2019;s not flashy either, just respectable. With a cartoon-focused style, Citizens of Earth is its own league of art and design, but it&#x2019;s not the shiniest title on the block &#x2013; it just looks good.
<br>You&#x2019;re the Vice President, as we mentioned earlier, and waking up in your mother&#x2019;s house after your first day of ruling over the entire world is a fitting scenario for this tale of twists and turns. Set in a small home town sent into turmoil, Citizens of Earth runs across a major plot-line and a sub-plot, disguised as the major plot. As you spend your days fending off the forces of evil on Earth, your first adventure blends straight into a war at the corporate level &#x2013; an appropriate fight for any new Vice President of Earth. At home, you&#x2019;ll begin by taking on your former rival candidate for Vice Presidency, who causes a small riot in your town. Forcing a barricade of police around the city, this begins a small scale experience of that traditional RPG feeling that CoE will be known for. Tackling your way through endless waves of protesters; fans of your latest election of course, begin unlocking the Vice President&#x2019;s first followers with the defense of the town, and later the world. Reaching forward, after the protesters are cleared, you&#x2019;ll unravel a sinister plot from an alien civilization to take over the world &#x2013; but can you conquer the scum of the universe, or will Moonbucks&#x2019; evil alien corporation conquer you? Citizens of Earth pulls a fun twist while not taking itself too seriously, making the story a nice change of pace in a world full of overly confrontational titles.
<br>During our play through of both the PC and PS4 versions of Citizens of Earth, this Eden Industries created title wasn&#x2019;t as polished as we would like to have seen, and we were able to re-create some of the bugs we&#x2019;ve found on the PS4, leaving something to be desired there. Though these bugs weren&#x2019;t game-breaking, here&#x2019;s what we found. First, on the PlayStation 4, the title crashed after just 1.5 hours of play in the local school. Accessible at an early part of the game, those who are brave enough to take on simulations of any monsters they have previously faced in much larger packs will enjoy the Virtual Reality mechanic. While this is a fantastic mechanic, many monsters in the game are able to spawn other monsters mid-fight. We found that in these VR simulations that we would experience moderate levels of game crashing glitches. While it is possible to grind out your characters&#x2019; levels in the &#x201C;real world&#x201D;, this VR simulation could clearly be the preferred method to anyone interested in power leveling &#x2013; so this was especially sour for us. On the up-and-up, the title had our back with frequent auto saving, so it didn&#x2019;t hurt too much beyond a restart, but it was still disturbing at some level. On the PC, some visual glitches occurred as well, where the screen may occasionally turn a solid green for a split second. To their credit again, Citizens of Earth was updated during our play test, and reduced this PC glitch considerably...Continued on PowerLeveled.com</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/citizens-of-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4914602">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am almost positive the biggest driving force behind ANY of it&apos;s sales is that it made an attempt to identify with Earthbound, which to be honest is ridiculous. It lacks the art, humor and soul of Earthbound.
<br>
<br>The game substitutes any sort of meaningful character progression by having 40-ish party members, none of them being interesting, meaningful or deep. All of the character abilities and commands are just re-hases of other ones under different names.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t even get me started about the gear and equipment system which is obviously implemented to increase gameplay time, not enchance gameplay.
<br>
<br>The developers should be ashamed. Just terrible. I really wantred to like it, but to be honest the ONLY reason why I wanted to like it was because of the Earthbound name drops. Outside of this, the game isn&apos;t special, it isn&apos;t unique and honestly it&apos;s not good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/citizens-of-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=4937723">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I like this game a lot, like the variety of characters and the different abilities they have.
<br>I like the gameplay, art style, combat and crazy JRPG  enemies and bosses style. The humour is silly and can be childish.
<br>
<br>Dislike there is no world map which makes it hard to know where to go at times leaving you wandering in circles and there are also plenty of locations without any area map and vague quest descriptions making you unsure what to do next such as go south of your hometown and whisperwood is directly south of hometown, but nope nothing happens or progresses the quest there and you have to actually go south of whisperwood to get to the Executive Retreat so the quest description should of been go  fartherest south of your hometown past  Whisperwood.
<br>
<br>Some of the minigames to recruit citizens require you to be very fast and accurate with button pushing, the only game I could not complete was the soda guzzling one and had to get the photon to slow time to be able to complete it.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s annoying trying to recruit the weather lady as she will only appear and join you during a thunder storm, same sort of problem with the scientist.
<br>
<br>Despite things I dislike, I had a lot of fun playing this game, I&apos;ve played plenty of old school RPG&apos;s and pokemon and this game has a simular feel, I like it a lot.
<br>
<br>It may not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea, but it sure is mine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/citizens-of-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=6089178">Expand</a></span>
