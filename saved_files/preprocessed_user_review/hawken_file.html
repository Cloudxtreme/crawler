<br>I keep losing connection to the host.  The game looks fun but it&apos;s frustrating to be kicked out so often and the gameplay (for me) is a little jerky, it&apos;s definitely not smooth.</span>

<br>1) they work for the competition
<br>2) they really *love* their run-and-gun Unreal-style chaos that rewards twitchy shooting without strategy
<br>3) they seek opportunities to make themselves feel better through mean-spirited reviews
<br>
<br>* I started playing the game about a week ago because it&apos;s free.  Free! I thought, &quot;Why not give it a try?  Nothing else grabs me right now and since I still play on Windows XP, I can&apos;t try XCOMM yet.  I played L4D2 for a couple years, but there&apos;s only so much zombie apocalypse a man can take.
<br>
<br>* Hawken provides the action of FPS in spades as other reviewers have said, yet it does so in ways that still encourage strategic play - not twitchy 12 year olds.  Combat rewards maneuvering around the apocalyptic landscape, careful use of thrusters to leap into vantage points or dodge incoming fire, and playing the field to your strengths.  If you play a light mech, you&apos;re better off darting in and out of cover, or even running up behind enemies.  Heavy mechs rely on armor and heavy barrages.
<br>
<br>* There&apos;s also a great collaborative mechanic to the game.  It pays to work with your team.  That&apos;s something that L4D2 players would enjoy.  But I&apos;d say it&apos;s more complex than the team tactics in L4D2.  In Hawken, one often has to re-adjust on the fly, run away from a pair of mechs so that your team can back you, and rely on other smart players to innovatively flank or distract the other team.  At the same time, I don&apos;t like to rely on such precision coordination in FPS games because it&apos;s hard to find really good players like that, and it cuts out spontaneity.  So I&apos;ve actually had a tremendous amount of fun leading by example, and seeing my teammates come together in the ways above.
<br>
<br>* As far as graphics and beauty.  It&apos;s just criminally wrong to call this game lackluster.  I play it on low setting on Windows XP and it&apos;s stunning.  I can play it for short periods of time on high settings (an hour) and it&apos;s even more stunning, but the difference is slight enough that I don&apos;t mind the low-settings.
<br>
<br>* My connection has been great.  And I&apos;ve felt like I could jump into the game after its 15 minute tutorial.  Again, I&apos;m by no means a FPS pro, so it&apos;s quite accessible.  Also, the starting mech has plenty to learn and experiment with, and with games you get free in-game money to spend on minor upgrades.  They&apos;re minor enough that other players don&apos;t wipe the floor with you if they have them and you don&apos;t, but they lend a significant advantage, especially when coupled together intelligently.  And again, in case, it&apos;s not clear, these upgrades are free of real dollars, but earned over time through playing.
<br>
<br>* Which leads me to my final thoughts: How do they make money when the game is so good and it&apos;s good when I haven&apos;t put a cent into it?  Real money is used primarily for cosmetic upgrades, fancy emblems, and other stylistic choices.  One could also get the strategic upgrades early, but why?  It&apos;s plenty fun just playing the game and receiving the occasional bonus by playing your games!  I will say, I am beginning to get tempted to put some real money into the game just for some slight stylistic additions.  I&apos;m a sucker for customization, and the game gives it in spades.  For those that want more options of their free-to-pay games, keep in mind the game is in Beta.  I have no doubt that&apos;s the first, and easiest thing to add.
<br>
<br>* I have one criticism.  Only one.  I don&apos;t like the hotkey for flipping your mech, and there appears to be no way to change that. (It&apos;s bound with the boost key, which can be changed, but the boost key doesn&apos;t bother me.)
<br>
<br>* So... free-to-play, amazing graphics, fantastic strategy and action, customization, style, good mechanics and fresh gameplay, good team-play...but one hot-key needs fixing.  You decide.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4034163">Expand</a></span>

Nachteilig sehe ich das noch etwas holprige Team Coop Match, da man genau 6 Leute haben muss um &#xFC;berhaupt starten zu k&#xF6;nnen, des weiteren ist es als Gruppe nur zu 3 m&#xF6;glich an einem Mulitplayer Gefecht teil zu nehmen was auch etwas &#xE4;rgerlich ist, da ich gerne mit meinem ganzen Team spiele. Die Option &quot;echt&quot; Geld auszugeben finde ich nicht weiter &#xE4;rgerlich, wer ein paar Euros zu viel hat unterst&#xFC;tzt so die Entwicklung und bekommt nebenher auch noch ein paar sch&#xF6;ne Extras. Wenn das Problem mit dem Team spielen und eine bessere Verkn&#xFC;pfung mit Steam weiter gef&#xFC;hrt wird sehe ich in diesem Game einen neuen erfolgreichen Newcomer der Extraklasse. Wer hektische Gefechte nicht mag sollte das Game lieber meiden denn bei Hawken ist von der ersten bis zur letzten Sekunde eines Gefechts ACTION ACTION ACTION angesagt.

It was a wise investment. The graphics in this game are for sure a 10, I&apos;m currently running it on ultra settings.  Action is fast paced, but people might lose interest quickly on how soon you die.  It gets better, trust me.  Once you start unlocking the mods for your mech things become better,  This is a free to play game and from what I see, you can do a lot without paying for a single thing and still enjoy the game.  I&apos;ve been trying to reach out to the developers and find out what they have in the future coming, I have had no replies yet.  Currently there are only 3 or 4 maps to play and you can&apos;t customize weapons yet.  Each mech has it&apos;s own abilities and you are pretty much stuck with those.  Downfall in my mind.  All in all, the game is great to play for a few hours at a crack, you will get sick of the maps sooner or latter since there are so few of them.  I give the game a 7 overall.  The developers need to &quot;butter&quot; up the players with new things coming and where they are taking the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3978788">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s quite a bit to be said about this game, both good and bad. As I&apos;m writing this, I find myself thinking &quot;Well, (insert feature here) is  pretty great, but (insert issue here) is still a big problem&quot; and vice versa. I&apos;ll admit, I&apos;m cutting the game a little slack because it&apos;s still in beta, even if it&apos;s official release date is only a short time away.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll start with the things I really like about Hawken. They&apos;ve taken the standard slow, clunky mechs we&apos;ve grown used to and thrown them out the window. Some people have called it &quot;Call of Duty: Mechs&quot;, but I honestly think that&apos;s a good thing. I think that a simpler, faster game style will appeal to a broader audience. It&apos;s not nearly as overwhelming as some of the other mech simulators out there, and the learning curve isn&apos;t as steep. It&apos;s a game that your average casual gamer could pick up and be at least semi-competitive at in an hour or two, whereas some of it&apos;s competition interests only the most dedicated mech simulator fan due to complicated mechanics and confusing customization options. There are plenty of mechs to choose from (after you unlock them, which I&apos;ll address later) for any play style. The maps are large enough to accommodate &quot;snipers&quot; but small enough that short-range mechs aren&apos;t at a disadvantage. It&apos;s pretty nice visually, with very distinct differences in map design. I also really enjoy the free-to-play model they&apos;ve gone with. This is by no means a pay-to-win game. The majority of what you can buy with real money is purely cosmetic. Though you can buy &quot;early access&quot; to the weapons for each mech, they&apos;re not so much more powerful that you&apos;re at a disadvantage without them. Pay-to-win kills free-to-play games, and they&apos;ve avoided that by a large margin.
<br>
<br>However, that&apos;s not to say that it doesn&apos;t have some pretty glaring issues. First and foremost, there&apos;s a noticeable lack of non-aesthetic customization options. Each mech has only three different primary weapons, and your secondary weapon is permanent. You can get some items and &quot;internal components&quot; to help adjust your mech to your preferences, but there&apos;s no feeling of really being able to own it. I fear that this will cause people to lose interest in the long run. Another issue I&apos;ve noticed is that there are very few maps, but I would imagine that they&apos;ll release more maps as the game continues to develop. I&apos;ve noticed quite a few random lag spikes too, even when I&apos;ve got the lowest ping on my team. The matchmaking needs work, as you&apos;ll sometimes get paired with people at vastly higher levels than you. The hit detection is a little strange, and there&apos;s not much of a feeling of impact when you land hits or when someone lands hits on you. Even when you do a good deal of damage, it just doesn&apos;t feel like it. I would also like to see more optimization. My PC should easily be able to handle this game on Ultra at 1920x1080, but I had to lower the resolution a bit.
<br>
<br>All in all, I gave this game an 8 because not only is it still in beta, but it has a lot going for it. Hawken has a whole lot of potential and could be a really excellent game. There&apos;s room for a lot of strategy to come into play if you have a few friends to play with. The game play is probably the most interesting and entertaining I&apos;ve seen in a modern mech game, though hardcore fans of the classic &quot;slow, clunky giant&quot; mech games may not enjoy it. However, the game still feels thin, and I worry that a lot of people may get bored with it after a month or so of play in it&apos;s current state. If the devs work on fleshing things out with more weapons, better customization, more maps, and less simplistic game modes, Hawken stands to make a big name for itself. If not, I fear that almost no-one will still be playing it a year from now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4011652">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now with that being said, I enjoy this game very much and is a great free-to-play(If you have the patience for the beta stage of a video game). The balance between the different classes of mechs is good, the maps are of great quality, and i like the current game modes(They plan to add more at some point). New recruits to the game get one mech(The Recruit) and its fairly good(I&apos;ve seen it used in every skill level of players). All weapons, mechs, items, and internals can be unlocked through playing the game and you never have to pay a dime for anything that effects game-play(cosmetics are not free). The players whining about pay-to-win obviously didn&apos;t put enough time in to see that paying for a mech does not mean you will do well. The biggest problem with this game is this.....its still technically in beta and means that this is not a finished product to truly pass judgement upon currently. Here&apos;s my pros and cons.
<br>
<br>Pros: Fun, Free-to-play, Great Graphics, Great maps, 16 mechs to choose from(all with different play-styles and abilities), Not pay-to-win, still in beta(which means more content on the way), great to play with friends, Fun maps, Good game modes. Fast-paced(without instantly dying all the time).
<br>
<br>Cons: Matchmaking still needs more work, Can get frustrating(Due to the competitive nature of the game), To play with friends you need to be on the same or of similar mmr(skill) levels. Still in beta(which also means that there are a few problems that exist in the game.)
<br>
<br>Overall I enjoy this game, I recommend this game to everyone who want to play a competitive Mech shooter. Remember though **************WARNING************STILL IN BETA********THIS IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT YET***********************
<br>
<br>(On a side note)
<br>I&apos;ve been playing free-to-play games for awhile and noticed that there are people who play for free, and then whine or complain about someone who puts money into a game. These developers have put countless hours into their games, and don&apos;t live for free. They deserve some money and they don&apos;t demand any money from you to play/try their game. So show some respect to the people who pay-to-play, pay-for-hats, or pay-for-early-unlocks, because no one wants to work-for-free, nor deserves to work-for-free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4069067">Expand</a></span>

Frequent updates by the developers show they really care about Hawken, and want it to succeed.  Nitpicks to the game are all minor, and include things like the high skill ceiling (steep learning curve) to really get the most performance out of your mech.  However, the game&apos;s tutorial is fantastic, and it is very easy for new players to jump right in.  I highly recommend giving the game a try.  The default mech available to everyone, the CR-T Recruit, is incredibly powerful and very capable in the hands of a skilled pilot.  Three additional, fully kitted out, mechs are available for free each week.  Plus, if you enjoy the game and wish to support the developers, you can purchase one of many very reasonably priced game packs, which include mechs and in-game currency, and play like the game was a regular release title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4176858">Expand</a></span>

If you can&apos;t determine that mechs outlined with red squares on your HUD are enemies, then maybe you should stay away from other games that use shapes and colors like checkers and tic-tac-toe. Microtransactions yes, but pay-to-win no. The Recruit suit (introductory mech given to every player) regularly tops charts in TDM, and skill outweighs weapons in this game. The developers are even nice enough to provide you with 400 Meteor points (cash points) after your first hour of play.

<br>As a F2P the game quality is superb (visually) for what it is. This is by far the best shooter I have come across since last year, and I did try them all. Since finding hawken, I haven&apos;t looked elsewhere and it&apos;s been very rewarding and engaging, there&apos;s at least 15 or so mechs now and each has a different way to play with new mechs coming in the future, as well as maps, once Adhesive have time to add them in, but updates are now happening at a much faster rate than before.
<br>
<br>The issue with the match making is that the servers need to assertain your MMR rating, which does not happen over night and will take time to pair you up with players on your level. The better you become at playing or the longer you play, the better the chances for more quality games. Instead of being insta killed all the time. The thing is, that people have the mentality of not wanting to lose, but you will lose at some stage, even if it has to be 20 times before you win a game.
<br>
<br>People need to realise that most of the game modes require team effort and co-operation, being a solo bandit killing mechs as if you were rambo does not always work out, especially if you keep dying. One thing about hawken is, it&apos;s not just fast paced, but you literally have to think on your feet and use good thinking, not only to get kills but to avoid being killed and living another skirmish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3997051">Expand</a></span>

Most of the issues regarding balance have been solved. You can also unlock new mechs without having to purchase them (With real or in-game money) by fully levelling up one of your current mechs or by increasing your pilot level.
<br>
<br>Combat is fast, for a western Mecha game. You can quickly dodge incoming missiles by sliding either right or left at the perfect moment, you can hover up into the air, and quickly turn your mech 180 degrees if someone catches your unprotected backside.
<br>
<br>I will say that most players online are pretty much incompetent, but this is more thanks to a lack of coordination and communication than anything. If you are playing this game, be prepared to use the voice-chat if you want to succeed.
<br>
<br>Team balancing is also an issue, but the devs are actively working on trying to fix it. All in all, I say that if you&apos;re a mecha fan, download this game and try it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3908799">Expand</a></span>

The devs are literally giving 2 flying F***s about the community...with slow updates, lesser servers, with some awful ping (I play on the UK ones and in about a third of em I ping 200-250). With that kinda money support/funding, this game should have rocked the ground amongst other F2Ps like PlanetSide2, Team Fortress 2, Blacklight: Retribution etc... Hawken has, if I did the counting right, more than 3 years since they started development  and I quote: &quot;On March 9, 2011 Adhesive Games announced Hawken with a trailer of the work-in-progress, with only 9 months of development behind it.&quot; That&apos;s right down pathetic, and poor excuse too still be an incomplete, not finished game...
<br>
<br>As for the technical part of the game, it runs OK, but still needs polishing...I can barely keep 60fps with a 1090t, gtx670 and 8Gbs or RAM on HIGH settings (not ULTRA)
<br>
<br>The game has (STILL!) some dreadful balance issues along with a niche community of hardcore players that have maxed out their mechs...and all that (along with step learning curve) really make the sessions frustrating in the long run...leveling of the mechs is OK at best, it&apos;s sort of appealing...but by the time you&apos;ve maxed out a mech or two, you will most likely find the game repetitive and stagnant; with really few incentives to actually spend more of your money on in-game currency (Meteor Credits).
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a good F2P first-person-shooter, just go with the ones I&apos;ve mention above...if you&apos;re really into mech stuff, and you&apos;re not satisfied with MechWarrior Online or other of the same genre...my advice, don&apos;t get your hopes too high with Hawken either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3300789">Expand</a></span>

The combat is innovative, with abilities, internals, 2 weapons and dodge mechanics all making for fluid and fresh combat not seen in other games. The learning curve is perfect and the matchmaking is shockingly accurate and matches you with players of your skill level. And it&apos;s a beta!

The learning curve is rough only if you jump straight in to ranked matches (namely free-for-all death match) without doing the tutorials and running a few games of the offline practice or online co-op bot mode. That said, the game tries to place you in games with people of similar pilot rank but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t get smoked occasionally;  It&apos;s a squad based shooter, not a sim.  There are bound to be some elite players who practice night and day... The controls are really easy to learn and master if you play basically any FPS games, and the sound, graphics, &amp; physics are really good. Mech balance has been very thorough, as you&apos;d know if you played all through the beta. There are internal components you can earn to customize your mech a bit, and you can unlock every single one via normal game play, and it doesn&apos;t take eons which is nice. You can pay real money to unlock cosmetics like paint, and body parts from the other mechs of the same class. You can also pay to unlock internal parts sooner, and buy bots faster than you&apos;d earn them, but it really doesn&apos;t give any real advantage since all the bots are equally capable if played right. Anyone who thinks the game is pay-to-win hasn&apos;t played it enough to know that is nonsense. A lot of players stay with the starting bot long after they&apos;ve unlocked everything else because its just good all around. I do wish there was a single player or co-op campaign mode but that&apos;s not what the game is really about. One thing I really love is the online community for Hawken, The devs can regularly be found in higher ranked games and the response the player critiques/requests is better than any online game I&apos;ve seen. Patches are on-point, and somewhat frequent without being annoying. My only real gripe is that if you play at non peak hours, sometimes the only games active aren&apos;t what you really want. Overall, Hawken is pretty incredible. I honestly can&apos;t figure out why anyone would give it a negative review unless they&apos;ve been emotionally compromised, coming off the heels of repeated beat downs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965590">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>HAWKEN is for tier 1 PC gamers. A terrific experience in the likeness of Armored Core but with all the features you have always wanted. This is not a game for your 12 year old teeny bopper who thinks Episode 2 is the best of the triology. Anyone born before &apos;95 knows what I mean. This games learning curve is steep and the gameplay fast paced. PROFESSIONAL GAMERS ONLY PLEASE.</span>

                                        <span>Hawken is astonishingly fast paced and action packed and it deserves better than the current critic score. The fast paced battles and customization make the game fun for hours and hours. I did not play it as much before in alpha, but now I have hours and hours into the game on steam. I hope that you will get past the lame critic score and see the game for how it really is: awesome.</span>

<br>
<br>NOTICE! Even though it&apos;s free to play it&apos;s not pay to win. Many people wants to think it is but it&apos;s not. Sure you can pay money to get mechs faster but every mech is available to everyone . It&apos;s just a matter of how much time you want to spend on the game. Anyways what&apos;s the deal with buying mechs that you can get for free anyways?
<br>
<br>Many people who say it&apos;s a bad game usually doesn&apos;t like the genre or doesn&apos;t know how to play the game properly. The gameplay is fast paced and can be quite complicated when it comes to movement. The boost and dodging is what makes the game challenging but also fun. You need to dodge often to avoid enemy fire.
<br>
<br>Hawken is really worth a try but don&apos;t hate on it if you don&apos;t really get the movement no one does in the beginning.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3978502">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Hawken is a new outstanding free-to-play game. I think this game shows how the 3rd world war will look like. People will fight using huge powerful mechs. Thanks to this game is made on the unreal engine, both graphics and gameplay are on extremely high level. Sounds effects fit to the game setting. Hawken is awesome game. I really recommend it.</span>

Playing with friends is a blast and adds a lot more depth to combat. Relying on your team mates for drop repairs, cover fire, shields and radars and baiting / ambushing your oponents is very rewarding. With repair guns and a Technician class hinted in the game files, I can only speculate that we can see some whole new elements of gameplay being added in the future. Being a beta, I have high hopes for Hawkens future. There are some balance issues here and there, but nothing that cant be overcome with solid communication and maneuvering with your team. I would love to see a lot more customization for the mechs, some form of ranking system or rated play and a party system and have faith that the Hawken devs are listening to their playerbase. Hawken is a great game, and worth a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2903269">Expand</a></span>

<br>You have to be quick to dodge using your boosters. Read your opponents moves and play strategically while still maintaining twitch reflex shooting. Its very, very intense. Don&apos;t treat it like your average FPS, you aren&apos;t a humanoid, you are a mech, you have separate advantages and disadvantages, get used to them.  Verticality plays a huge role in the gameplay as well. The mechs are agile in a whole different way. But if you try to run and gun like an average FPS, you&apos;re toast.
<br>
<br>There really isn&apos;t any other game like Hawken out right now. Its a Mech Sim FPS with an arcade game feel. There are 8 mechs to choose from, I think, each with their distinct advantages and abilities. The game also features a very robust item/ mech upgrade system, much time will be spend configuring the build that suits you best.
<br>
<br>As far as the F2P model, its rather well designed, if you play smart and play well, procuring ingame credits is a breeze (as is leveling up). If you lack the patience or time, real world currency can be used for unlocks.
<br>
<br>Did I mention the game looks incredibly stunning? No other game imo right now touts as much polish and detail visually, its remarkable that its F2P.
<br>
<br>Get this and decide for your self.
<br>
<br>A++
<br>
<br>PS. Its still in Beta, it will only get better from here on out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874297">Expand</a></span>

Even when winning matches, the frustration due to the game&apos;s chaotic nature can have a tendency to outweigh the overall fun factor.  Matchmaking is constantly being worked on but seemingly never improved.  Playing in team based modes (which comprises 3/4 of the currently available game modes) tend to result in one team dominating while the other team  struggles and constantly deals with a rotating team due to players constantly leaving due to frustration.  Making matters worse, while still in the open beta the game functionality and regular player base seems to have filtered out many of the curious newcomers and has culled the herd down to those hardcore players that have mastered their mechs, leveled each one to the maximum level, and don&apos;t necessarily want things to change.  This leads to very limited options when searching for available servers and almost guarantees a new player to be dumped into a match full of high level, very experienced players.  If in the US and searching at night on a weekend, you may be hard pressed to find just one server for each type due to the lack of activity.  New players that express their concern about this painful level gap in game or on the message boards results in many of the established players explaining as a fact that mech level means nothing in Hawken (if you are as incredulous reading this as I was when someone first tried to explain this concept to me  check the hawken message boards as there are many discussion regarding it).  Even if this were the case (which obviously it is not  leveling gives bonuses and bonuses give advantages), this would mean that the best case scenario is that the currently implemented upgrades system is close to worthless. =/
<br>
<br>If you are curious go check it out and think for yourself, but based on experience it would seem the best course of action would be to wait until the game is out of beta before really investing any time (or God forbid money) in hopes that the fixes to gameplay and balancing are ironed out.  While the game is in beta it seems as though focus is mainly on overall stability (there are very few crashes) and implementing new content for the dedicated fan base as opposed to making the game more accessible and enjoyable for new players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967938">Expand</a></span>

It does not really stand out in any way, possibly due to the bland graphics, so super foggy to the point that you might imagine the game is taking place underwater. The game modes can be fun, and require team play, but the lack of things such as auto balance, and some unbalanced map design mean that winning a game in Hawken might not be due to your skills, but most likely due to some underlying fault in the map/ mechanics/ balance.
<br>Hawken aims to be a hit to the &quot;unskilled&quot; f2p crowd, with level ups to keep you interested, unlocks and cosmetic items, and this comes at the expense of the skilled player, when the team based game modes are full of people generally not helping. Ultimately the game modes are what will either make or break this game. If Hawken does manage to cater for skilled, competitive players, and fixes the little annoyances here and there, it will no doubt become a great game. However, given that these problems do exist, it means more likely the game will be just-another-UT3-game, as easily forgettable as it is was initially exciting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958223">Expand</a></span>

However, since its move to steam the game has taken a drastic u-turn replacing the old game with a steam friendly &quot;twitch shooter&quot; mess. This is coupled with the stream of updates that occasionally remedy issues but mostly hinder and damage the game further(2steps foward 4 steps back). Further failures of adhesive games lay in its match &quot;balancing&quot; system. This system rarely creates balance 90% of games having a difference of 20 kills between the teams, stacking too many players on one team and filling the winning team players while leaving the losing side till lacking. Hawken represents the biggest fall from grace of any free to play game; going from my favorite time-sync to a pitiful disaster with little to no reasons to keep playing. In addition pay 2 win elements have crept further into the game since its steam update with the replacement of skill tree unlocking mechs to just buying them with micro-transactions or in game money a further dumbing down of the system. In game currency earnt per game will barely raise over 250 each game mech cost between 7000-12000 of this currency, so prepare to spend a lifetime saving for the mech you want. Hawken has sold it soul for a chance to get on steam and alienated veteran players to attract call of duty kids; the devs may as well remove the mech models and replace them with humans because the once powerful mechs who could take hits I played in have been replaced with tin cans that are destroyed instantly by a single shot ,(the intro video shows this perfectly to their detriment). Give the game a chance if you want, you may like it, but eventually its allure will fade you will become woefully  bored with what remains. For those who read all of it , Thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3997089">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is very far from the truth.
<br>
<br>It IS a free to play game, and the pay scheme is a refreshing one, especially for a player like me who was IMMENSELY disappointed by the cash-grabbing, lie-to-the-community cesspool that Mechwarrior Online has unfortunately become.
<br>Simply put, you have to pay for cosmetic options. Period. Everything else in the game, including any options you might consider necessary for having an edge over other players, can be purchased by credits earned in game, which you earn by playing. You get one free mech at the beginning, and you unlock other mechs by leveling this mech, the progression is very simple to understand. You can of course pay to unlock any mech early, again, with real money, or, and for me this is very important, in game credits. An average match will net you around 250 credits, and an average mech unlock is around 10K credits, so do the math. The most expensive mechs will cost you 40-50 matches, or if you don&apos;t have the time, about 10 USD in real world money.
<br>The game seems to be making most of its money on cosmetic options. You can get paint schemes, new plumes for your rocket exhaust, legs, arms, body, etc. These are the only options that require you to pay real money. I myself only bought a couple of these, mainly because I thought they looked good, and partly to support the devs.
<br>Gameplay used to be MWO-like at the beginning, with the weapons, mech armor and speed balanced towards long engagement times. It has fluctuated between MWO and extra-twitchy shooter for some time since then, but with the last update I find that it has settled somewhere in the happy medium between. There are around 8 maps, I believe, with 4 game modes, not including the newly-implemented co-op mode played against bots.
<br>
<br>The community is very active and quite loud in its critique, but not caustic. You can usually find people who can help you get better at playing. There is a simple, but adequate training simulation for beginners.
<br>
<br>Overall, I have found Hawken to be quite a satisfactory experience. But hey, it&apos;s free to play on steam. Go try it, it&apos;s not like you have anything to lose.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3980686">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hawken plays like unreal, fast paced rapid combat with a TTK that is a bit longer than would be expected based on the pace of movement. It also has a nice sense of progression all mechs can be earned and will be unlocked by simply playing the game.

The only downside to Hawken is that so far there are only 4 game modes and about 6 maps I think.

Eventually you learn that a certain mech should attack the enemy like this and this mech like that. When this is finally learned the game gets so much more enjoyable.</span>

<br>The game is definitely favored to a well balanced team and one that knows what they are doing. The recruit class is actually a very good mech surprisingly. I found myself using it the most after unlocking the other classes.
<br>Yes you have to pay for the colors and camos, but if you were part of the beta like I was you get a few or just one.
<br>The plus side to it is if you play for a good amount of time you actually could spend 0 dollars on mech upgrades. Meaning this game is deff not pay to win. Hell I&apos;m a level 2 and have been able to hold my own with level 10+ guys. Just with the in game currency unlocks. Sure it could take a while but at least you don&apos;t feel helpless at all. This game has really come far from the early stages of the &quot;beta&quot; that was releases some time ago.
<br>I can honestly say that this game is on par with titanfall or better. Why? Because it requires actual skill and team work.

It is something more than just arena shooter. The game looks great, the combat is fast paced, controls are responsive. It&apos;s not pay to win, and the devs actually listen to their community. It&apos;s well balanced, and just simply fun to play.</span>

<br>Mais le jeux est parfois frustant d&apos;ou le 9/10!!! Car certain joueur otiste sont vraiment meilleur que les gars normal comme moi meme ayant jouer plusieurs dizaine d&apos;heure. Les modes sont bien construit, et avec les nouveaux patchs les graphiques sont vraiment mieux qu&apos;avant bien que le jeux est d&#xE9;sormais beaucoup plus difficile a apprendre.
<br>
<br>je recommande se jeux a nimporte qui MAIS STP. ESSAIE D&apos;ETRE BON AVEC UNE MACHINE AVANT DE DIRE QUE LE JEUX SE DE LA POURRITURE!!!.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3969750">Expand</a></span>

First off, if you are concerned by some of the more negative reviews and their complaints that this game is pay to win, don&apos;t be. There is nothing pay to win about this game. The only aspect of this game that is locked by real world money are purely cosmetic features that effect the way your mech looks. every thing else can be unlocked with playtime and the natural in-game currency (earned through matches). Hawken itself is a very fun mechanized combat shooter and is very well balanced, so even a new player should be able to handle themselves once they get a grasp on how the game plays. It burrows a lot from Mech Warrior Online, but removes most of the clunkier aspects while speeding up the gameplay. There are both cons and pluses to be garnered from that. As a result, the game is much easier to get into, control, and come back to. However they have also sacrificed some of the more dynamic aspects like component durability and destruction, and the start up sequence proves to be just a bit less interesting. As of right now the game is still in early development, so there&apos;s no real telling what might change between now and it&apos;s actual full release, but they game is still a lot of fun and very much worth checking out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3987970">Expand</a></span>

This was quick to grasp, and when that was over I jumped right into my first game. The first game you play will always be Team Deathmatch, as it is decided for you that this is the best choice for a beginner.

If your expecting mechwarrior with slow combat with slow moving mechs then this game is not for you, it is much closer to chromehounds or Japanese style mech games. The shooting is skilled based it is not the low time to kill bull that is plaguing other FPS games where map knowledge and spotting the enemy first is all that is required. The game has an emphases on landing skill based shots and out maneuvering opponents. Once you master dodging in and out of cover and landing skill shots you&apos;ll soon be able to rank in the top half of the scoreboard with just about any mech. The starting mech actually is one of the better mechs. It starts with the assault rifle which is the most well rounded primary gun in the game and the TOW which is hands down the best secondary weapon. The only down side to FRED starting mech is that it is an ugly mech and an eyesore but it has it&apos;s charm. Anyone who says the game is pay2win simply doesn&apos;t understand the game since you can acquire  everything in the game with time. Meteor points just allow you to skip the grind and purchase paint jobs.
<br>
<br>Now for the bad stuff. Despite Hawken&apos;s shooting mechanics being solid the game lacks variety and customization so far. The tech tree has very little effect on how your mech plays and I think it is mostly a place holder right now. Paint jobs are very limited with no ability to change color palates or add much to make your mech unique from other players. The game modes are also horrible. Basically both objective game modes suck right now. Seige just leads to snowballing lopsided matches and missle command or what ever it is called is your run of the mill domination style game. The game could use a capture the flag style mod or some kind of  better objective game mode. With that said this is just about the only game that I will play death match or team death match in. Both those modes are great but without a more objective team work orientated game like what I was use to in NS2 I can see this game growing stale. There are only a few maps with prosk being a far superior map to the others with it&apos;s mix of open and close combat. Uptown is just a horribly designed map that favors close combat only giving very little freedom to sharpshooters and rockeeters. One aspect of the maps that is great is they are all multileveled much like the quake and unreal tournament maps of what I consider to be the golden years of PC FPS games. So in conclusion Hawken is the start of great shooter with a firm bedrock of mechanics that however is undermined by a lack of customization and variety. At this time the game still feels like it is very much a beta product but it also feels like it has plenty of potential. Since the game is still in development I have high hopes for it but I&apos;m skeptical. I&apos;d rank the game an 89/100 right now but it could easily be 95 if the developers added more content. The gameplay is there the content is not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861974">Expand</a></span>

The different mech types are very varied which makes for some interesting tactics (my favourite is the Sharpshooter, though most of the maps are difficult to snipe in).  There are various different abilities available such as placing decoy mechs (that don&apos;t move, but copy you otherwise) and throwing an EMP that disables all nearby mech&apos;s weapons (including yours if you&apos;re too close).
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d definitely recommend it, as it&apos;s also one of those games that will only succeed if the player-base remains a critical mass to keep the games fresh.

I have just started playing this game two weeks ago and had no need to spend a single penny on this game.
<br>
<br>The starting mech that you get for FREE, even though it&apos;s not the best looking, is one of the best in-game mechs with free internals and 700hp (more than any light mech or medium mech in the game). A lot of high level players are still using the starting mech.
<br>
<br>You can buy every other mech and all their upgrades with Hawken Points(No need to buy Meteor bucks) that you get from playing the game. It&apos;s very easy to get a lot of points. Plus, they give you 5000 starting Hawken Points when you start. With new mechs costing a little over 6400 points, you can buy any other mech you wish in no time. You can get about 200 points per game, very easy to buy ALL the mechs in a relatively short time span. To reiterate, this game is Play-to-Win not Pay-to-Win. Only visual aesthetics cost real money. This game is a AAA quality game that has people peranoid with the &quot;Free to play&quot; title.
<br>
<br>As for the game itself, it&apos;s a fun mixture of Mech Warrior, Counter Strike, and an RPG with a skill tree. The game is not perfect by any means and the only reason I gave it a 10 is to counter the incompetent lemmings. Hawken is still in beta and not a finished product, but still, it&apos;s a fun experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3100359">Expand</a></span>

My biggest gripe is engagement distances  they are way too short. 100 meters is long range sniper... Seriously? Even BF2142 had better mechs, even though they were just a small part of that game. Using active defense to block missles, slow, heavy damage overheating cannons. I don&apos;t feel this here.
<br>
<br>Even the world of tanks has engagement distances of around 350 meters, possibly more. But in this game you just get some hazy fog obscuring distant stuff. With this in mind, the levels feel small and while there is some hot around the corner action, it gets boring fairly fast.
<br>
<br>Combine this with some &quot;OP&quot; flavors of mechs and general lack of players, and I had to suffer through some horribly unbalanced matches where little one can do counts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2965852">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not saying it has no depth, it has plenty, the skill ceiling for booster jet juking is pretty high, it just doesn&apos;t have any meat to the potatoes. There&apos;s roughly a dozen mechs, all of which have 3 weapons to choose from, max. The only customization that I could see were just different cooldown/oh f##k buttons. Coming from Mechwarrior online, the lack of customization in a mech game is crippling for me. The blatant lie about there being &quot;sniping&quot; in the game also bothered me. The maps are so small that you&apos;re basically up in the face of every single person, and the &quot;long range&quot; weapons have the same shell travel time as everything else, meaning hitting that incredibly dim, hard-to-see mech that&apos;s hiding behind the fog of impaired vision is ungodly difficult. This leads to situations where you&apos;re face-to-face with the far tankier, better-equipped mechs that are designed for close combat.
<br>
<br>There are also no real hitboxes, unlike Mechwarrior Online, 90% of the time you&apos;ll just be firing wildly, trying to flank as there&apos;s no incentive to take carefully aimed, skillful shots. As of this date the game still feels very empty and lacking a lot of the content you may initially expect, such as mech customization and more intuitive combat than spamming thrusters and aiming in the general direction of the enemy. People have likened it to Call of Duty: Mechs, and they would be both right and wrong. It&apos;s very different from CoD but plays the same, if that makes sense. It&apos;s F2P and I recommend at least trying it out to see if you like it, but keep your expectations reasonable as this game doesn&apos;t have much more to it than CoD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3964815">Expand</a></span>

Idiotic match making system, confusing interface and even more confusing maps. Game play is some times fun but it will get boring pretty soon very repetitive. I played 2 weeks and around 10hrs its not for me, if some one needs content in a game it is not the one.</span>

In Hawken, it&apos;s all about reaction time, accuracy, and out-maneuvering your opponents.   Some fights last for multiple minutes at a time, which is insane for an FPS.

But its well balanced, being that even a higher ranked player with a nicer mech can still get schooled by a level one starter mech, and incredibly fun. Everything can be earned in a reasonable amount of time unlike many other free to play games, making this something i would be more than happy to play for a long time. Also it is not pay to win. The only things that you pay for are cosmetic and dont effect gamplay. So there&apos;s none of this Blacksite BS where a guy can just wreck people because he payed $20 for armor that puts him at an unfair advantage over FTP players, or like in TF2 where classes can purchase OP weapons and hats. Overall the game is very well handled. It is very fun to play and since it seems the Devs hearts are in the right place (making a good game over making money) i will be more than happy to spend money on this game unlike other games like Blacksite that seems more like a CoD money grab. (PS i love TF2, just using that as an example.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3249890">Expand</a></span>

The main gripe I have is that it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re piloting a mech, it actually reminds me most of Battlefield 3. But unlike Battlefield 3, you cannot change out weapons or equipment once inside a match (although you can switch between your mechs). The starting mech is pretty good and within just two matches I could buy one of the more specialized ones. Another issue I see though is that it&apos;s a very team-based game, you get pulverized in seconds if you try to solo, so you always have to stick together and cover each other. Though in all matches I&apos;ve played most communication seemed near non-existent. My advice then is to play this with 2 to 3 friends to have a solid core of players on your team should you want to win reliably.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3467466">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s accessibility has been greatly improved in this patch,  adding in a tutorial that introduces you to all the important ideas of combat and movement, as well as letting you train against bots.  The meta of the game itself is still slightly unapproachable for new players due to it&apos;s heavy utilization of teamwork with mechs that can turn into turrets and healing mechs and mechs that excel in invisiblity and flanking, all of these factors mesh together well in the team-play factor but new players are thrown to the dogs in terms of figuring them out, it&apos;s a real learning curve.  My only concern about the game&apos;s success at this point is matchmaking pitting random pubs against premades for crushing consequences pushing players away from the game.  Other than that though, it&apos;s a really well done game, it looks amazing, sounds amazing, has good music and gameplay, it&apos;s new interface is incredibly easy to navigate and intuitive as well.  I&apos;m speaking of hawken as of september in 2013 however, I do not really know how the game was before that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=3547163">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>GOOD
<br>+ For an F2P game there is very little P2W here (100 % non-comsetics are grindable)
<br>+ Well thought-out ideas for deployables, mechs and abilities
<br>+ Mech combat is actually pretty fun and tactical with dodging and boosting
<br>
<br>BAD
<br>- It lacks the &quot;weight&quot; feeling when you shoot someone
<br>- Not enough variation in gameplay, few mechs, items and weapons that are hard to unlock as well
<br>- Poorly designed maps, potential achieved by giving mech &quot;boosting&quot; (weak flight ability) mostly unused
<br>- Generic modes (TDM, DM, Rocket assault which is really domination, Siege which is domination + capture the flag) without innovations
<br>- Weak audio, explosions sound like someone kicking a cardboard box
<br>
<br>SUMMARY
<br>If you are a kid or someone who can&apos;t afford a decent game go for it, you could have chosen worse in the F2P world. Good thing is you don&apos;t have to spend a cent on it.

With a good distribution, you can get a noticeable advantage in close matches if the other mech is 10 or so levels less than you (max lvl is 25). The starter mech is the absolute best mech to learn on (one of my favorites in general), and you can buy a new mech right off the bat with free credits. Most mechs are balanced and the balance is only getting better as the open beta continues. You can also buy  internal upgrades that are mostly useless, additional items to equip (you can only equip 1 offensive and 1 support), and aesthetic items.
<br>
<br>The game looks like a triple-A title, it&apos;s easy to forget that this is a relatively small indie team behind it. There are 4 stages currently, and I think the game could do with more diversity on this front. Hawken differs from a normal FPS mostly in how you maneuver. The mechs can feel very slow before you learn how to move effectively and manage fuel and boosting. The gameplay is like many other FPS titles: movement, positioning, and awareness primarily decide who win fights, while reflexes and aim are crucial. It is balanced rather well in that the most skillful player will nearly always win the match, and most mech types offer similar overall combat ability despite difference in combat style. There is still more balancing to do among the mechs, but the current state of the game is very good for open beta. Faster smaller mechs seem to be winning more often in free-for-all deathmatch, but the balance is better in team game modes.
<br>
<br>Current Negatives: Matchmaking can take a long time, and the results are sometimes very one-sided. Teams are not auto-adjusted during a match if a player quits. Gaining hawken credits takes a bit too long for a guy with a full-time job, but the weekly rotation of free mechs helps a lot in this regard.
<br>
<br>Overall, Hawken is a very fun, fast paced shooter where you get the feeling of piloting a mech with a more FPS style of piloting and gameplay. There&apos;s a lot to learn and skill decides winners at the end of the day. I&apos;ve been having the time of my life with this game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes FPS titles, but is looking for something different from the standard crop of war shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967542">Expand</a></span>

Also its always been a free to play game but now until further notice they are charging ppl to play which is kind of terrible since the mass majority got this for free.

<br>
<br>I have not spent any money on game-play items, and feel no need to. Using the default mech I have been consistently in the top three places on scoreboards, frequently first place, even when up against players who have clearly pimped out their mech, so I find it difficult to accept the idea that this game is &apos;pay to win&apos;. Having said that, the game does require some grinding to aquire items, and until you have filled out your item slots you ARE at a disadvantage. I&apos;ve rated it 8 for the excellent presentation and attention to detail, fun game-play with interesting combat and depth via items, and not being too grindy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4047103">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My only complaints are that this game has no single player mode and that it suffers from the pay to play function.  I would have been willing to pay actual money for this game but the in game purchases really make me not want to play it at all.  Yes you can still seemingly unlock everything without paying for it but just the fact that it is in the game really kills it for me.  I know this is the direction that games are heading and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to get to the point where you can respawn for just .99 but I will not be playing games like that.
<br>
<br>Anyways this game is very good if you want a mech combat experience for free but be advised that there are some pay to unlock areas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4017712">Expand</a></span>

The jumpjets and the amount of HP mechs have, takes the emphasis off of snap and reaction skills out and opens the door to tactical and strategic skills. You don&apos;t have to collect stronger weapons nor power-ups like armor, so skirmishes tend to be fair fights. The game modes are interesting, taking a game or two to learn the unfamiliar ones like Missile Assault and Siege, and are regularly played.
<br>
<br>There seems to be some personal matchmaking rating that matches you with those near your skill level, but for me it seemed to have cut down the # of available games down a lot. There doesn&apos;t seem to be too many online to find a decent game where one team doesn&apos;t outnumbers the other, I wind up having to go to another server, US East, to find them. Balanced games seem to be uncommon and leavers are not really punished in any way except for counting under their &quot;Abandoned Games&quot; stat figure. Unreal engine dodging in this game can be ridiculous with how some light mechs can do their dashes in the air with very short cooldown. Maps are few and the amount of cheap destructible stuff on many maps is a bit excessive. There are a few mechs that are too similar to others, creating a grind of an experience on them.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s free to play, but they obviously are trying to make money. Every time you start up the game, you must stare at a sponsor billboard screen for 5 seconds, unable to skip or alt-tab to wait it out. The upgrades and unlocks in game are so numerous and expensive that you&apos;d need to spend well over 100 hours to unlock them using credits earned from playing only. It took me on average 20 game wins to afford something, games which last 10-30 mins each.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s plagued  by some bugs, such as items getting planted/embedded into the ground making finding and aiming at them hard. You can get stuck on some things like under energy lifters, on trees, or whatever. There&apos;s also hackers that use aimbot and move speed enhancements ruining games.
<br>
<br>Overall, I do not regret uninstalling the game, though I did not regret the bit of fun I had playing it. I just wore through the fun of learning the mechanics of mastering weapons, aiming, dodging, flying and navigating through the map, and various game modes. It just eventually turned into a grind, a time sink, once I started focusing on the unlocks, instead of my performance. Friends moving on to other things didn&apos;t get me to move on, but I did play less and have less fun, and frustration with terrible team balance and hackers were the final straw to get me to kick this to the curb.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4393150">Expand</a></span>

Key to this is an almost invisible development team.  Compounding a recent lack of new content and development and the fact that this has been beta/early access for a long time is the lack of any recent update from the dev team.  On top of this are some very annoying mechanics, such as the increasing reliance on twitch reflexes making this a game dominated by younger players, the fact that spending money does give you an edge on internals and equipment that can really help (so partial pay to win), the lack of mechs and weapons countered by quite a long grind with an overpriced premium model to help if you want to, a matchmaker that either keeps you waiting forever or dumps you in a match that is already lost and game modes that have no tutorial leading to slower players wandering around trying to play deathmatch and losing the game for their team.  This game could rate higher but the missed opportunities, p2w mechanic and invisible devs lead to a lower score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4430575">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have not had this much fun since Halo2 multi-player (was my first online FPS expeirence) and my Unreal Tournemant days.
<br>I and my RL friend logged in last night Qued up for a match and it was ON after that! :-). We actually lost track of time because we were having so much fun.
<br>
<br>I have read a few reviews saying it has a P2W model, I dont see it my self. Sure Players can get gear/items/mechs quicker by buying Meteor Credit/MC, but you can earn enough Hawken Credits/HC(free in game currency by playing) at a decent rate that playing a handful of matches will net you your first mech in no time.
<br>
<br>And like any other online match making game you can come across different level of skilled players across the board, so ya at times you mite get your a$$ handed to you and visa versa.
<br>So what are you waiting for DL Hawken and come join the Fun! its FREE! :-)
<br>
<br>I also love that they put in Training:Team Death Match (AI bots and you), to get accustomed to the controls scheme(s) of piloting. That way when ya hit a live match you have a decent understanding of them...instead of the &quot;Oh S**t&quot;what buttons do what in the middle of a fire fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4087049">Expand</a></span>

Having skill actually makes a difference.&quot;Fun&quot; is the easiest way to describe the game, and considering it&apos;s free to play, there&apos;s no reason why anybody shouldn&apos;t give it a go.</span>

Very good visuals, fair customization, a bit of grinding; however, the game is not pay to win as it does come down to skill: I was pwning face with my unaltered starter mech.  The combat is a lot of fun and there are many little nuances and tricks that make close combat quite exciting and interesting indeed.</span>

It is not perfect, but it is terrific considering the cost. A lot of the negativity of it being expensive or grind-heavy is not completely true. To earn the most expensive mechs it could take a while, but earning the 3 or 4 which are only 3800~ Hawken Credits is pretty quick. I earned 3 of them in a week, and they are very competitive. Compared to League of Legends, that was very quick indeed. I think some people might have trouble adjusting to the gameplay quickly, but that is part of the appeal to me: mechanically, it is incredibly unique for an fps. The mechs in general are quite tanky, so extended skirmishes and epic strafing battles are the name of the game. You have to get used to having the endurance to fight a 30+ second duel, all the while carefully managing your weapon heat, your cooldowns and your gas tank. In games such as CoD or CS:GO, if you position poorly you can get headshotted from across the map and be dead instantly. I like that in Hawken you really have to work to get every kill. This might be a personal preference, but I find it a refreshing change from the tried and true fps model. The one criticism I can agree with is that the replay value of the game does suffer from the lack of maps and modes. Siege mode is not balanced very well, with brutal stomps happening in probably 60-70% of all games. Missile assault usually ends up in pretty close games, but is honestly pretty annoying as it is a sort of musical chairs of capturing and losing points over and over. Team deathmatch is very balanced and is of course good old-fashioned fun, but it does get old after awhile. I wish they had a more subtle and teamwork-heavy objective oriented game, similar to the awesomeness that is the de series of maps in Counter-Strike. It would be even more enjoyable if they instituted some sort of rank queue or leader-board, to encourage you to improve your skills in the game. I do get better all the time, but stomping in deathmatch is not as fun as it would be to climb ladder and continually face tougher opponents. There is an MMR-esque system supposedly, but it has not impacted my experience much. Anyways, loads of fun and awesome gameplay for the value, but there is a limit in terms of replayability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4063732">Expand</a></span>

Mechs come in loose categories -- Light, Medium, and Heavy -- with variation within each class. The fastest Heavy is quicker than the slowest Medium, etc., and each mech is designed for a particular role. I&apos;ve enjoyed the feel of heavies (&quot;fatties&quot;) for the power that they wield while still having decent access to the dodging mechanics of smaller mechs. It means I can take a rocket for a smaller mech on my team, and feel good about it. I mention my own style because the best part of Hawken so far was finding that &quot;right&quot; feeling. I never paid for the mechs that I got, access to them was never limited, and I ended up with what I wanted. Four hours in and I felt like I was at max level (but definitely wasn&apos;t there yet). 10/10 for being 100% F2P. It&apos;s one thing to find a good game, another thing to find a good developer who wants you to have a good experience.
<br>
<br>Combat for newbies seems like a mysterious thing. It&apos;s decided more by positioning and teamwork than things like your ability to aim and click quickly (looking at you, CoD). Skirmishes are extended by better players, lasting minutes each until there&apos;s nothing but a constant stream of combat across the map. It&apos;s that kind of energy and strategy that keeps me going. I feel like a part of a team and know that our success depends on my ability to support those around me. The items you can deploy deepen combat roles and increase reliance on the team. The only negative, I would say, is poor team balancing, which can make certain losses utterly depressing. Combat gets a 8.5/10 for its energy, team dynamics, and the occasional soul-crushing, life-altering, mind-blowing defeat (seriously, fix the autobalance, guys).
<br>
<br>Customization is limited by design. There&apos;s no way of actually increasing the &quot;power&quot; of a mech. Weapons, mechs, and loadouts are balanced. They serve mostly to put you in a certain role, which will hopefully give you what you want out of the experience. What limits the experience, then, is the fact that you must grind to get enough credits to buy new items or weapons. If someone buys a mech that isn&apos;t for them, no amount of custom options will make it right for them, and the grind repeats. (It&apos;s the same as any other game in that sense. You must be careful with your credits. Each mech has its own category of usefulness, extended by custom options, but not changed by them. Do not buy a Sharpshooter and expect to walk up to Brawlers and blow them away. That is literally never going to happen.
<br>
<br>Visual appearance can only be changed through &quot;Meteor Credits&quot; which cost actual cash, and things like paint jobs are purchased for one mech at a time. Like in real life or something similarly crazy, painting one car with tiger stripes doesn&apos;t give the other car tiger stripes. I&apos;m fine with this system, but it ruffles the feathers of some players. Customization gets a lowly 6.5/10 from me. The fairness of the system is what makes it so great; its limitations are what make it small and seemingly unimportant.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;m ranking Hawken slightly higher than I feel it needs (as an Early Access game, an honest score should be about an 8.0) since some of the reviews on here seem shockingly unaware of how to, you know, play the game. Aren&apos;t you supposed to play something before you review it? I also give a slightly higher review due to the fact that Hawken has given me a prospect of a game that can be improved. I&apos;m excited for everything they change, anything they talk about adding, anything and everything new, even if I won&apos;t go for it myself. It plays like a game with a great future ahead. For my personal experiences so far, potential for dozens of additional hours of free gameplay, and high expectations for the future, Hawken gets a glorious 9.0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4075120">Expand</a></span>

One drawback is the tutorial AI is a little too easy, a request I have made on the suggestion forums is to up the AI in later tutorial team deathmatch modes so the jump to MP is not such a large spike in difficulty.

<br>With Hawken being in Beta and many patches to come, I look forward to the future for this game.  Just typing this review, my trigger fingers are itching to get back in my mech and send rounds downrange.

You cannot play like other FPS game though; This game very much requires you to play with team. In order to win, you need to stick to your team and also know when to commit the attack and when to back off. It is as if you are playing Dot A, every mech has its role. Heavy mech is for tank and support, while light mech is for pursue and kill nearly died enemy. Sniper role is not for kill but for support the front line in the back, let assault team do their job easier. If you like soloing, this game may not suit you. It is very hard to fight 2 mech alone, we like to flank and kill enemy that comes alone, so don&apos;t do it. If you have the right mind set, the game will be very much fun.
<br>
<br>Game play is fantastic. Mech feels slow but fast at the same time. You need to learn how to play first. It will require you some time to understand to mechanic, then it will be super fun. There are many mechs for you to choose, many upgrades and many items available so that you can create your own unique mech which suits your play style. The game has matchmaking so that you can play with the guys who are same lv as you, however it is not perfect yet and the lv of player may not correctly indicate player&apos;s skill. All maps are well designed as well. They are very complicated for your first time play but each map is unique and has many strategies to play out.
<br>
<br>Graphic is good, not the best but if you consider that it needs only 3 GB to install, it is good enough. All Mechs are well designed. Sounds are good as well.
<br>
<br>Most importantly, it is free to play. There is no reason for you to not to try this game if you are into FPS game. This game does not force you to pay. Most items that need to buy with real money are the decorations for your mech.
<br>
<br>In sum, I gives this game 9 of out 10. It is a must try for everyone who love FPS game. If this game has single player and nice story, it will be perfect</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4168722">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t without flaws... its still in BETA so there are some issues with bugs and occasional lag problems. Sometimes an update (monthly) will degrade the gameplay. But in my experience the devs are responsive to fixing those problems fast with a patch. (within a day or two)
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been generally impressed with the player community so far. There is way more positive interaction than most competitive multiplayer games. More often than not, negative players are shamed into leaving. I&apos;m older than most players and appreciate a little civility in my gaming.
<br>
<br>The bottom line for me... its a FREE game... and it&apos;s really fun.... win win!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4196618">Expand</a></span>

Takes an age to unlock some of the better mechs though so patience and lots of playtime is a must - that is unless you have a nice fat credit card...and yes, you will run into some of the credit card mechs, and yes, they will kick your noob ass :)</span>

<br>
<br>The action in this game is fast paced and the initial learning curve is not really high. The starting mech every new pilot gets is verry forgiving and still a viable choice later in the game.
<br>
<br>There is a impressive support for this game from the community. Most ppl buy the meteor credits (which is the currency used in game that can be bought with real money) because they want to see this game succeed. This is certainly the case for me.
<br>
<br>The only thing i am missing is mech customization wich has been removed in beta in favor of better game balance.
<br>
<br>I love this game and will probably continue playing this game for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hawken/user-reviews?user_review_id=4381877">Expand</a></span>
