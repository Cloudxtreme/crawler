The emphasis has always been divided between constructing a working kingdom and forming a powerful army. However, Legends shifts this focus onto combat. Action does, however, remain the same as it&apos;s predecessor, with a slight twist or two. They scrapped Stronghold 2&apos;s Spearmen and Armed Peasant units and replaced them with a unit called Men-At Arms, who function much like Stronghold 2&apos;s Outlaws. They also added Fantasy units, such as Dragons, Mages, and the Knights of the Round Table. Each of these warriors have special abilities. These make sieges much more interesting than in previous versions, as combining the abilities available to you offers some unique strategies that you can&apos;t replicate with plain old wood and steel.
<br>
<br>Economically, however, the game suffers. It did away with the Crime and Punishment system (my favorite part of castle management in SH2), as well as various other factors such as Plague and whatnot. Jousts and Minstrels and what not are also relegated to Random Events. This makes Castle Management much more simple, as supplying your populace with enough food and a Church or Inn means that you don&apos;t need to worry about your home when you&apos;re marching off to war (which, again, is the main focus of this entry in the series). However, as the delicate balance of army-building and kingdom management is what makes previous Stronghold games shine, it feels more like a spinoff (albeit a very fun one).
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this is a great game for anyone who likes medieval/fantasy themed battles, but if you REALLY prefer economic management in a Stronghold game, this may not be the best of options.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stronghold-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4041214">Expand</a></span>

This game is so fun, I love how they took the great Stronghold series and introduced the fantasy elements (perfect combination!).  You have to read the other reviews (especially the critics) with a grain of salt.  They are looking at the game wrong - it&apos;s not about 1 player - its not Stronghold 3 - it&apos;s a (very welcomed) spinoff of Stronghold 2.  The 3 different classes are super fun for multi-player (Ice, Arthur, and Evil factions), I wish there were even more!  I am keeping my fingers crossed that Firefly builds Stronghold Legends 2!  I&apos;d buy it in a heartbeat!  I would write more, but I have to get back onlinen to play another multi-player battle!   Thanks so much Firefly!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stronghold-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=2160505">Expand</a></span>

I do like some of the gameplay, but I hate the complex fancy graphics. Get it only if you got a high-power computer.</span>

Well first off the the &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; are very enjoyable to play as with the new units. I criticize the bugs and the sudden increase cost to build certain resources in the game. The bugs you should expect are occasional save files that fail to load and crash although it could be just my lousy computer. Resources now cost twice or more than in the 2nd Stronghold which can sometimes be a challenge to set up a economy in certain game modes. The medium campaign feels harder due to the amount of Frost Giants and how powerful they actually are. Lastly I slam the balance of game play with new units as said before the medium campaign requires many armoured or heavy ranged units to deal with Frost Giants that tear down walls in a snap. A certain unit on the so called &quot;evil&quot; side can be sometimes be hard to deal with as they can &quot;convert&quot; weak units into joining their side and require armoured units to deal with them efficiently. Overall this game is mediocre at best in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stronghold-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4496006">Expand</a></span>
