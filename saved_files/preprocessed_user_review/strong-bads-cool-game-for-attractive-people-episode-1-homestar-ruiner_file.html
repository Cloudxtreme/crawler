This game basically takes that premise and puts it into a game perspective - you will be playing as Strong Bad, a villain character that thinks he&apos;s totally awesome and your objective in this adventure game will be to destroy the glory of Homestar, another character from the universe. Even if you don&apos;t know the lore, the characters are still wacky and funny. Like me, you will probably not get the full experience, but nevertheless the game is still loads of fun and is quite long (7 hours to 100%).
<br>There are also mini games to play such as creating your own comic or playing an arcade game - Snake Boxer 5 which is so unfair that you have to find hidden manual pages throughout the game in order to beat it.
<br>You can gain achievements (or trophies) for accomplishing certain task in the game, forcing you to play for a much longer time if you want to obtain every single one.
<br>If you like the character of Strong Bad, you will enjoy this game a lot. If not, it will probably just be a mediocre adventure game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episode-1-homestar-ruiner/user-reviews?user_review_id=5123736">Expand</a></span>
