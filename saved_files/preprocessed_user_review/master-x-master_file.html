<br>PVE: a great dungeon crawling instance based team event that anyone can enjoy.
<br>Extras: the game itself has several forms of PVP combat and several PVE instances ON TOP of mini games and all sorts of different stages based on the day.
<br>The glaring issue:
<br>Hardware: somewhere along the way NCsoft likes to balk on the use of high end infrastructure. Their severs have a very hard time keeping up in some instances and i feel this could hurt the game in the long run if they start scaling hard. More people = more problems in this situation.
<br>
<br>This game has a lot going for it and i&apos;d love to see it do well and enjoy a long life.

Great yea ? So best way is to play Multiplayer game as a Singleplayer... Why ? Who knows, ask NCsoft... Shortly game is only about farm and fun with friends, but only way to farm and have fun with friends is to $pay$ to Avoid Farm and Fun with friends...
<br>It really can be a good game, but now it&apos;s just a parody on HotS, they can&apos;t even bring same quality service as Blizzard, this game is one more prove why players should stay away from games that use regional restrictions.
<br>Shortly one more Korean freemium !@#$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-x-master/user-reviews?user_review_id=7391173">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, MxM is a pretty unique experiment and not just because of the control scheme, but because it feels very &quot;mmo&quot; ish and has an actual PvE counterpart and...it&apos;s actually pretty fun!
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start from the beginning though: MxM is essentially a moba where you have free movement via WASD instead of the usual mouse clicking AND the mandatory requirement of choosing two masters for fighting, making it a tag game where you can switch heroes every 10+ seconds. So it&apos;s very action oriented &#xE0; la diablo, with a pve mode where you can do little &quot;dungeons&quot; that don&apos;t last more than 5 minutes and get rewards that will help you in pvp.....
<br>
<br>Yeah and this is where I kinda got annoyed too. You see, in order to play well in pvp, you need to play a lot of pve - or use cash.
<br>
<br>Let me start by saying this: the only thing tied to pvp from the pve is the character unlock and your basic attacks, while skills upgrade only work in pve. But while skills can be upgraded via Gold, basic attacks can only be upgrade via mods which drop from pve and they can make a bit of a difference, especially when the third upgrade is quite strong.  It&apos;s not gamebreaking as far as I&apos;m concerned BUT it can give you quite an advantage and forces you to grind pve....which is random unless you have a ticket. Yep, you can&apos;t choose the dungeon without a ticket - which is cash shop stuff - so you&apos;ll be forced to do a random dungeon everytime you can&apos;t choose. Nothing too bad but this ties to another issue: master unlocking.
<br>
<br>You have only two ways to unlock masters, and one is using SOL coins: you get them via levelling and most masters only require about 4 to 10 to unlock, with the newest ones requiring 15 or something. All good you might say but there&apos;s a catch: they also have a secondary lock, which is tied to...anything really. For example, I wanted to unlock Cagnazzo and the only way to do that is to do a specific dungeon (Karith), and get 5 bloody items which drop from brutal or extreme difficulties and while the dungeon itself wasn&apos;t the problem, i only had 5 tickets at my disposal (I think you get 5 each day but i can&apos;t tell). I also wanted to unlock Vita - a support character - and she&apos;s locked behind a trophy point of 1000 and I&apos;m still at 700. The list is big but this essentially means that unless you play a lot of pve, you&apos;ll be stuck at the usual suspects - which are good but not the characters I want.
<br>Or if you want you can unlock them right away for cash, which bypasses everything.
<br>
<br>BAD ncsoft, really bad...just make us unlock stuff with gold if that&apos;s a problem!
<br>
<br>And on a side note, but this is 100% personal and very nitpicky but....the game kinda lacks on roles.  You have juggernauts - tanky heroes - nukers, assault, assassins, marksmen, skirmishers and of course, supports. Now, in most games I know of 3 roles from the holy trinity, tank heal and dps, with dps being of various kind (assassins, nukers, etc) and tanks being either full tanks or bruisers, but supports are generally those who heal and provide CC - basically supporting their team.
<br>
<br>But you see....there&apos;s barely any of this: supports don&apos;t even heal  (Demenos can heal but i haven&apos;t found others who could) And tanks barely tank, instead just do more damage while being &quot;tanky&quot; (basically a bruiser). This is a nitpick as I said because, and this is embaressing to say, but I&apos;m one of the 1% who is a legitimate tank/support player in most moba or team based game and I LIVE for supporting and tanking teams - mostly because nobody ever does it. So seeing a moba that basically enforces more damage than anything else is....a bit sad for me. But as I said this is just persona: I&apos;m sure the remaining 99% won&apos;t bother playing as a dps because hey, nobody plays a support or a tank.
<br>
<br>Do I recommend it? Well it&apos;s free and it is legitimately fun, but it gets repetitive as well - just like every moba. Give it a shot and see for yourself: I have fun from time to time, but I do take a long day break afterwards because, It lacks a bit of satisfaction that, say, a Hots or even a Dota 2 game has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/master-x-master/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468555">Expand</a></span>
