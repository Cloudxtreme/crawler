I really enjoyed my time so far. It looks like a very nice spectacle fighter.
<br>
<br>I like the art style and the cinematics. The controls are pretty good so far. You combo your attacks with 3 buttons (which is just complex enough for me). Doing big combos while being surrounded by dozens of zombies is really satisfiing, i have to say. In addition to these buttons you have a dash to quickly move (no jump btw), a block and some other actions like grabbing a zombie in order to use him as a weapon or throw him. Overall the combat feels really good. I can&apos;t complain at all.
<br>
<br>The difficulty seems to be pretty high, but I don&apos;t mind dying a few times now and then. They could have added a few more savepoints. But that&apos;s only a minor complaint.
<br>
<br>The camera is fixed, you cannot adjust it yourself. This will piss off some people. And yes, sometimes you end up in a situation where the enemies are behind the camera, where you can&apos;t see them. This can be annoying sometimes. On the other hand, you can use your right thumb purely for attacking, blocking etc. and don&apos;t have to interrupt only to move the camera. I think both systems have pros and cons. I am fine with how Yaiba handles it most of the time.
<br>
<br>So yeah, i think it&apos;s a good game. The most important thing is that the combat feels really good, and that&apos;s what these games are all about, right? ;)

<br>Sure this game isn&apos;t for everyone but if you like the artwork and don&apos;t mind TONS of gore and b-rated humor with some great beat &apos;em up gameplay, you&apos;ll love this. They did a FANTASTIC JOB on the PC version too, the gameplay and action is very fluid on PC.
