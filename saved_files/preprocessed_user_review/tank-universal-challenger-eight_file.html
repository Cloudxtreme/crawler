First there is no music to speak of. Second the graphics are so throw back that they make you wonder why they even made the game. The only saving grace for this game is the gameplay. The controls are solid and responsive.</span>

Some reviewers have complained about the graphics, but that smacks of ignorance to me.There&apos;s nothing &quot;dated&quot; about them the game&apos;s retro wireframe look is a stylistic decision, homage to the classics Battlezone and Tron. The game uses modern 3d accelerators--including particle effects and post-processing--and a lot of care has gone into making this look like a retro game, with pixelated smoke as one example. If you don&apos;t appreciate the style, perhaps the game isn&apos;t for you. But you&apos;d be missing out on some very fun gameplay and a quirky sense of humour. If you enjoy the 80s notion of symbolic cyberspace and its associated imagery, you should enjoy this game immensely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tank-universal-challenger-eight/user-reviews?user_review_id=727610">Expand</a></span>

The graphics have a TRON-like look and you never get tired of them. Blowing apart an enemy from a long range is very satisfying, as is building up enough points to get some unlocks. I don&apos;t know how else to praise the game besides saying it is quite simply: FUN. It took me 8.6 hours to beat it on normal. The flaws: I&apos;d have to say one annoying flaw is the lack of music in the game. The menu music as well as music heard during certain rare moments is really really awesome, so I&apos;m disappointed to hear it so rarely. Browsing the music folder in the game yields a hefty amount of sweet &apos;tunes so it&apos;s strange to see they&apos;re not played all the time. If I had to nitpick, I&apos;d have to say the enemy and team mate AI could use a bit of work, and the pacing of the game can be a little off. Using the speed-boost ability definitely helps but due to its high cost, you use it rarely. If I were to make a suggestion: I&apos;d rather have the speed boost be free, but you become a lot more susceptible to damage when using it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tank-universal-challenger-eight/user-reviews?user_review_id=725973">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> For an indie game this one is pretty good. It&apos;s obvious that a fair bit of effort went into developing the in-tank game play and I think it works well. You know it&apos;s an indie game as it&apos;s lacking any voice over acting, instead you get speech bubbles you have to read. Some dramatic music here and there would be nice but doesn&apos;t detract too much. Overall an enjoyable game.</span>

                                        <span> this game must be horribly coded because when you are looking around most of the time the walls and floor dissapear and my framerate drops to like 2SPF (not fps) and the only real way to fix this is to look up but that only works till you look down again. imho if all of that was fixed it could be a better game but right now, it sux, not worth paying for</span>
