There isn&apos;t anything new compared to the old versions, the interface itself is almost a ripoff. I&apos;m sorry for Nadeo, but this would work better as an add-on for TM Forever. Driving lacks of techniques to learn and gets repetitive after a few hours of play. Engine seems to be outdated. Sound was the big negative point of older versions and TM2 didn&apos;t improve even a bit. The maps looks all the same. While old versions were realistic, but in their own physic rules, TM2 is so artificial, not as titles like &apos;Drift city&apos;, but that kinda breaks the feeling. Many things are not intuitive, editor looks a bit messy, the game lacks of a guide and help section. There&apos;s not even two months from the release and 95% of Online servers are empty and the average amount of people Online is decreasing a lot last days. TM2 isn&apos;t worthy to buy and, except for the graphics it&apos;s by far the weakest game of the TrackMania series. As a recommendation, I suggest TrackMania United Forever, which is a must buy for all racing games fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-canyon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1820091">Expand</a></span>

The racing is as wonderful as ever, and the graphics truly are a leap forward, but everything else is a confused mess. Much seems to have been taken out since Trackmania United, with the community expected to fill it in later. The solo campaign is simply &apos;Race&apos;, with no &apos;Platform&apos;, &apos;Puzzle&apos; and &apos;Stunt&apos; mode any more. There&apos;s no in-game &apos;Explorer&apos; to allow you to look for skins and tracks. There&apos;s no way of sharing your creations once they&apos;ve been built- at least, as far as I can see. I can&apos;t understand why they&apos;ve simply thrown all this stuff away, since Trackmania United Forever was so fully-featured.<br><br>On top of that, there&apos;s no explanation as to what&apos;s going on, either. in fact, if you want to read the manual, you have to search for it on Google- and even then, you&apos;re not going to find it. It&apos;s here: http://wiki.maniaplanet.com/en/User_manual . It&apos;s also woefully incomplete. If you want any further explanation, you&apos;ll have to start mining the forums. This shouldn&apos;t be necessary.<br><br>And there are bugs, and the interface is a mess, and there appear to be people who have hacked their way to the top of the rankings, and there&apos;s absolutely no communication from Nadeo as to what they&apos;re aware of and what they&apos;re going to be doing in the future.<br><br>So, ultimately, this game has a very, very long way to go, and there&apos;s a very good chance Ubisoft are going to make you pay extra for all the things your missing. Probably best to avoid it for a few months until everything gets sorted out. Until then, buy Trackmania United on Steam. It&apos;s the same price and it&apos;ll last you for much longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-canyon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1758458">Expand</a></span>

How do you take a game that has over 6 million players online and make it better? This is how you do it.Trackmania 2 Canyon is absolutely a must own, must play game if you want it all in a multiplayer game,PERIOD.<br>Admittedly,it has a few unforgiving learning curves when it comes to the editors and how to&apos;s when trying them out but, if you played the former it shouldn&apos;t be a big hassle.The player and forums are a valuable reference to most questions that need answered.Most folks are friendly and are willing to share info.    Gone are the Airbrakes that most were used to in the original and,drifting has taken its place to master and overcome obstacles &amp; mishaps.The overall handling of the new vehicle(s) aren&apos;t as tight as the original Stadium car but, with practice you will become proficient enough to hang in there with the best of them.    What more could you ask for? New graphics,new editor interface,support,great gameplay.Absolutely a FANTASTIC game.Thanx Nadeo for your dedication and hopefully a new environment ASAP.    As far as Godwhacker&apos;s complaints...obviously he doesn&apos;t get it and probably never will.Too Bad....somethings you just gotta work for to make you appreciate this game and how to make yourself a better player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-canyon/user-reviews?user_review_id=1762097">Expand</a></span>

<br>Why? The Canyon car has very loose handling and is all over the track in turns, while over half of the available track pieces are extremely narrow and loops and wallrides are undriveable due to a lack of grip. Unless you limit yourself to building tracks out of the same 20 pieces over and over, it is very hard to create something fun in this game. The elimination of blockmixing (using third party tools to combine blocks) by the developers isn&apos;t helping.
<br>
<br>With the cheaper Stadium and vastly superior Valley available now, there is very little reason to recommend this black sheep in the Trackmania series. Its dead multiplayer is testament to this. Don&apos;t get me wrong  don&apos;t take your money elsewhere. Just spend it on Nadeo&apos;s *other* titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-canyon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3344469">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Single player is boring and works for tutorial, but online is where the fun starts. Since game has track editor there is thousands of user created tracks and best thing is that user created tracks are mostly awesome. Usually amateurs make bad content, but you cant go very wrong with the tracks and bad maps are removed from servers. Like previous titles this has RPG tracks too, what are very hard and take hours to finish. Very, very clever. Another thing what makes this game so good is adrenaline rush cause you dont know what is after next jump or curve. Awesomeness of this game is impossible to show in videos or text, you need to play to understand what I&apos;m talking about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-canyon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2346941">Expand</a></span>

Besides, the building aspect of this game is just fantastic. I can&apos;t say how many hours I just spent building my own track in the editor. Again, &quot;easy to learn but hard to master&quot;, since it&apos;s incredibly easy to create a map, but harder to find nice, smooth, flowy transitions to make it memorable. The ManiaPlanet platform also allows players to create skins, change textures, own 3D objects and even scripts to make an own gamemode. So, if you want to play a highly mod-able racing game with thousands of tracks, get this game, you won&apos;t regret it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trackmania-2-canyon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3023695">Expand</a></span>
