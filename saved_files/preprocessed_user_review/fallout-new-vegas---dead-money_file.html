<br>And that is not only the WORSE way of making progress, but is also the most frustrating one.
<br>
<br>At the base level you have an explosive collar that will explode you head if you take the wrong path.
<br>Added to that, there are the enemies, that deal serious amount of damage, but even worse they can&apos;t die.
<br>Yes, because if you don&apos;t destroy, at least one, of their limb, they&apos;ll just go knok-out for a while.
<br>Even further there are the holographic enemies, that are unbelievably overpowered and can&apos;t be killed.
<br>Added with the chronic lack of ammo, all this stuff make the most powerful concentrated of frustratingness.

So whatever you do, you have to do it in the way that designers of the dlc want you. You don have any invention. - speakers, signals, cloud, holograms - it all makes you repeat and repeat all the time the same moves. EG. you need to go from point A to B. In normal game you go, watching around, sometime seesing. Not in Dead Money. When you make few steps further than the game wants you to make you heard beepieng, and in a few second explosion. So you do it one more time - more carrefully - watching for speakers. And you find it (or not). If not, you do it again. And again. And again. Untill you find out what makes beep, and what trigger explosion. And it looks quite like a Hitman. But its not a Hitman - its Fallout.<br><br>If it was a Hitman DLC - I would score it for 8+.

<br>
<br>Explanation:
<br>The stories are very intriguing as always in the New Vegas world.  You will find little notes and voice recordings here and there that cement you into the world.
<br>
<br>However, the story progression gets incredibly bogged down by the horrible new obstacles introduced in Dead Money.  Every new mechanic introduced in Dead Money primarily slows the gameplay down.  For example, there are radios sprinkled throughout that restrict you from going into a particular region.  It feels like playing Monopoly but making a rule that you have to divide every dice roll by 2.  The gameplay mechanics don&apos;t add more excitement - instead they add more frustration and boredom.

<br>If you&apos;re on the fence about spending money on this, I would say &quot;no&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=4440496">Expand</a></span>

The fact that it&apos;s a DLC may make it more frustrating since you can&apos;t get back to the main part of FNV until you&apos;re done with Dead Money.<br><br>What makes this so frustrating?  Where to start?  First things first: Dead Money plays differently than the rest of FNV.  That&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing, but it must be noted.  Now, when you enter the Sierra Madre Villa (the area outside the Sierra Madre casino) you are stripped of all your weapons and equipment (excluding quest items--keep that in mind).  This is almost always a bad idea, but Dead Money handles it as well as possible, giving you the new rules of the game right upfront.  The rules: you have a slave collar around your neck and it will explode it you get too close to any speaker.  They&apos;ll beep first, so there&apos;s some warning.  Also, the are clouds of poisonous gas all around and they&apos;ll kill you dead.  There are also &quot;ghost people&quot;: people in dark biohazardesque suits that WON&apos;T STAY DEAD!! (Well, unless you blow off a limb).  Sounds cool right?  WHY SO FRUSTRATING? 1) the villa is all very similar in architecture and so difficult to find your way around in.  2) There are traps everywhere.  Everywhere!  3) The gas clouds: deadly, impossible to see through and just a general hinderance.  Add in the fact that beartraps are often located in the impossible to see through, but killing-you-as-you-disarm-the-trap gas, and controllers will fly.  4) Most important. Speakers. Are. Terrible.  They are everywhere and clustered together.  So you&apos;ll walk out of range of one speaker only to be a step from being in the range of another.  Or they overlap completely.  And they are often impossible to see.  Add all these together and you&apos;ll want to get this over with as quickly as possible.<br><br>Some other gripes: Ghost people are a unique enemy.  Well until you almost immediately get a perk that keeps them from coming back from the dead.<br>You&apos;re required to get three companions so you can break in to casino but that&apos;s just filler.  They don&apos;t really do anything to help you break in.  At least not anything on screen.  So you&apos;re hopes of pulling an Ocean&apos;s Eleven FNV-style are left unfulfilled.  Instead you&apos;re just fetching companions.<br><br>The pros:<br>There is seriously good loot.  The holorifle is awesome.  So is the gun you can take from the main baddie.  Or if you&apos;re willing to leave that gun, you can steal up to 389,943 caps worth of stuff.  Also the casino deals in pre-war money so if you max out your winnings you&apos;ll have another 100,000 caps worth of loot.<br><br>If you don&apos;t care about that, then there isn&apos;t a lot to recommend here.  Most reviewers seem to have liked the characters and story, and while they were good, they weren&apos;t speculator.<br><br>All told, then, only loot nuts and completionists should bother with this and only then if they are willing to deal with the frustration of it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=2406827">Expand</a></span>

The unique thing about Dead Money is that it isn&apos;t a endgame bonus like other DLC content is for other games, but is more like a really long additional quest thrown in the middle of the game your already playing. The game recommends you not playing until level 20, but I started at 19 and I really don&apos;t see a problem besides having lower overall health starting anywhere in the late teens.  Okay to make this short, the problem with this is yes there is a bit of trail and error and saving will be at all time high for this overall experience.  You have to make your way through the trap infested villa area which is outside of the casino the Sierra Madre to assemble your group of 3 shady partners to get inside the likewise unsafe casino.  There is really only two types of bad guys, the Ghost People and the Holograms (there are radroaches but they are just normal).  You could suggest that the 3rd bad guy is the Sierra Madre itself much like Rapture was in Bioshock.  This DLC will start you out with almost nothing but a holorifle (an energy weapon that starts out pretty weak but after much improvement becomes a decently strong weapon) makes you take a fresh approach to the game.  I&apos;ve beat the regular Fallout New Vegas prior to this DLC and never once felt unprepared and vulnerable. This DLC will give you that feeling, a bit of fear of dying.  A lot of creepy moments and new and interesting weapons, new weapon/food recipes and lot of loosely connected substories to the main game make this worth the 10 bucks.  There are some similarities to this DLC and bioshock. Vending machines, the story of the creator Sinclair (i.e. Ryan) and the ghost people are vaguely similar to Big Daddys. Even if you don&apos;t like the DLC it is worth it if this is your first play through the regular game just for the weapon you get at the end of the game and the possibility of treasure making you rich.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=1491233">Expand</a></span>

After I got half way through I just wanted to get the hell out of there. If you like quicksaving every 2 minutes and essentially travelling through a maze painfully slowly, where a wrong turn means an unavoidable death, then this is the game for you. Poor design and a poor DLC.</span>

It&apos;s a shame, as the actual content isn&apos;t that bad...it just keeps breaking the game, leaving me either unable to continue without reloading to avoid a bug or without decimating the .exe file and crashing it. The buildup is also incredibly drawn out, far too long for my taste. Overall this is one of the worst DLC packs I&apos;ve ever had the displeasure of playing, but it does have its moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=3372809">Expand</a></span>

I guess at the heart of a game, it should be fun, right?</p><br><br><p> Yeah, I guess. Well that&apos;s where Dead Money falls down. The fun. The characters are what holds this DLC up (Dean Domino in particular) but the lack of weapons, lack of NPCs, lack of different varied areas make playing through this a chore. You only carry on so you can get back to the Mojave. The story itself is sound. You go and investigate a mysterious broadcast, get knocked out by gas and wake up having to ally yourself with a mute, a laconic anti hero, and a super mutant with a split personality. The catch is that you&apos;re all fitted with bomb collars; one of you dies, you all die. Together, under the thumb of the omnipresent Father Elijah, you&apos;re tasked with robbing the Sierra Madre Casino, before he will let you go. It&apos;s possibly the best story of all New Vegas&apos; DLC. But the gameplay is rubbish. You&apos;re constantly hopping to avoid toxic clouds, radios which set off your collar, and the admittedly creepy and well-done residents who don&apos;t want to stay dead. Avoiding the clouds and radios is fine a few times, but making it a key part of the game? No thanks. An oh boy, the locale. Dark and dreary may make it atmospheric to an extent, but the boredom of the same textures over and over outweigh this.</p><br><br><p> This DLC very nearly falls completely flat on its face. Only the characters are the saving grace. </p></span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115931">Expand</a></span>

<br>First, the DLC is very linear and very frustrating. When i buy a fallout DLC, i expect a &quot;open world experience&quot; not a linear with only one way to do the things and without variety of enemies and scenarios.  You can&apos;t use the most of favorite fallout weapons such as AMR and minigun. You can&apos;t make any decision. You can&apos;t turn back if you don&apos;t like the DLC.

The level design was not creative in the slightest (consisting of maze-like roads, and enemies/hazards that could kill you and you couldn&apos;t fight back) The only reason that this got one point is that the dialogue was well written in some cases.</span>

The problem isn&apos;t that the gameplay is slower paced, it&apos;s that the means of making it so end up being extremely tedious as the game goes on. The first problem is in the design of the Villa, which has almost no variance in architecture and makes up over half of the DLC. Areas look so similar that it doesn&apos;t even feel like you&apos;re exploring, instead it&apos;s like running around a hedge maze. The second problem is with the speakers mechanic, where you have to either run past the speakers or destroy them to avoid death. The problem with this is that you have no idea whether or not the speakers in a particular section are meant to be destroyed or ran past. This inevitably means that in most speaker sections, you have to run around looking for the speaker to see whether or not it is destroyable. But because the time you have before death is very short, it&apos;s almost guaranteed that you will die by that time if you don&apos;t know exactly where the speaker is, resulting in an endless string of quicksave-quickloads for all the speaker sections, which are present throughout the entire DLC.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a shame that these problems exist because as mentioned, the storyline is actually pretty good. But the gameplay leading up to those parts just feels like a chore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488325">Expand</a></span>

Most of the enemies in this DLC only die from dismemberment, obviously making them much more difficult to kill. I found myself often needing to shoot off their heads as they lie on the floor from &apos;dying&apos; the first time. There are also holographic enemies that cannot be killed and must be avoided by sneaking by their narrow field of vision (think Metal Gear Solid). It feels very much like a zombie survival-horror type game, and is a nice change of pace from New Vegas. The characters and very interesting - more so than most of the ones in New Vegas. Voice acting is of very high quality. The story is also captivating (and depressing), and alone is worth the $10 to experience. Dead Money&apos;s gameplay is a good change of pace, though it may get tedious for some players. It is definitely worth a purchase if you&apos;re a Fallout fan and want more story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=1626730">Expand</a></span>

The theme throughout is how stupid and self-destructive it is to become obsessed -- with gold, or revenge, or control, or anything. Every one of the characters suffers from a crippling obsession, and you can liberate all but one of them.<br><br>The nightkin God is suffering from a split personality and an obsession with controlling his carnal self, Dog (making Dog a cutter was a stroke of genius -- psychologically perfect). Christine is obsessed with revenge for a long-ago broken heart, an obsession that leads her into traps again and again. Dean Domino is obsessed with humiliating some one two hundred years dead for reasons that were petty then and are utterly meaningless now. And Father Elijah, of course, is obsessed with the power that control of the Sierra Madre will give him to &quot;wipe the slate clean,&quot; kill everyone else and rule over an empty world. I didn&apos;t mind the map design. This is the world of Desire, after all, and the ruin, the traps, and the poison red mist all seem appropriate. And I&apos;m a bit puzzled by the remarks that everything looked alike -- the whole area was thematically similar, as should have been no surprise, but never absolutely identical. It was unpleasant and claustrophobic because it had to be.<br><br>The speakers might have been placed better. There are a few points where the easiest way to get essential information is to engage in a series of &quot;exploratory deaths,&quot; and that&apos;s always a bad thing in a video game.  However, some of the most infernally frustrating parts are the result of not noticing some detail; you have to be very observant. If you keep your eyes peeled, you&apos;ll even be able to find the emitters for many of the holograms, and when they are destroyed the hologram disappears.<br><br>And at the very end, you come to the vault and its golden stash -- packed in 35 lb. ingots. Without exploiting glitches, you are going to get away with at most three or four of these, since if you&apos;re overloaded you won&apos;t make it out. One humorous and ironic sidelight is the obsession many players have show for trying to take every bar of gold, no matter how they have to bend the rules to do it. In a game centered on obsession, at the end there&apos;s that proof that the player him/herself is obsessed as well.<br><br>The endings vary, of course, but the only philosophically satisfying one is that in which all three of your companions reach at least a temporary peace with their own demons. Dog/God is the only one who attains something close to enlightenment, in which the two halves of his personality realize that they are the same after all and the wall between them, the struggle, is nothing but an illusion. That&apos;s one of the more moving passages I&apos;ve seen in a video game. Christine doesn&apos;t quite get that far, but she stays in the Sierra Madre as its caretaker, free of her obsession if not entirely understanding it. Dean Domino remains the same thief and cheat that he always was, but even he &quot;felt sad for a moment, and had no idea why.&quot; And Father Elijah gets his gold -- locked inside the vault to die slowly in the company of that which he thought was most necessary to him. Some will always refuse to be saved.<br><br>The ending slideshow is very moving, with all the characters joining in the message, &quot;It&apos;s not getting there that&apos;s the problem. It&apos;s letting go.&quot; But that isn&apos;t quite the last word Dead Money has for the player. There is one last sad farewell from the recorded voice of Vera Keyes, the woman for whom the Sierra Madre was built, putting into words what the player undoubtedly suspects, that the journey was his/her own obsession and it was taken in pursuit of goals that were already within the player&apos;s reach before he or she set off for the Sierra Madre. It&apos;s not a pleasant DLC to play (thank goodness you get back into the open air with Honest Hearts, and receive a massive dose of groaner humor with Old World Blues), but it&apos;s a very good one</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716179">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Some very nice voice acting (as usual!) and a lot of opportunities to unlock different sorts of conversations with the main characters helps a lot to immerse you in the dark atmosphere of Sierra Madre.
<br>
<br>I agree, sometimes it&apos;s difficult, and you can&apos;t exactly say it&apos;s long, but i&apos;ve got a full 8 hours fun out of it, with a lot of frustration too (which imho is needed, with small doses...)

<br>
<br>Cons: Pretty much everything else. Level design is boring, dialog is boring, lots of pointless running around and all your equipment is taken away (stuff you get is very basic). To add to the fun, you have exploding collar on you neck which explodes every time you fail to destroy or avoid transmitters placed everywhere (which often are more or less hidden). Basically lots of repetition and loading save games. So much fun!
<br>
<br>If you want to try the DLCs I would recommend the &apos;Old world blues&apos;, which is easily the best (read: least bad) one. If you like it, then maybe try the other ones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343143">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s mainly because the story is barely substantial, the missions/quests added by Dead Money are very difficult, and the Sierra Madre is f*cking impossible to navigate through without dying once or twice.
<br>The only quests/missions I was able to complete legitimately were the first eight, the rest were near impossible.
<br>The only thing I can give Dead Money out of a 10 is the achievement image for Assemble Your Crew, and then finding out what these people look like and what they do.
<br>There is no real reward for completing Dead Money. Sure, you can get some gold bars only if, and excuse the potential pun, you play your cards right, but that&apos;s it.
<br>I wouldn&apos;t buy Dead Money unless you&apos;re an achievement hunter (like me). This DLC is simply a payable mod that doesn&apos;t work sometimes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=5381278">Expand</a></span>

But I give this game a 10 simply because it had many unique aspects. The radios linked to your collar that can blow you up. The hologram people. The interesting cool weapons. The environment. The poisonous gas in the air. The story. Etc. I played this mostly to explore, and even more than that for the story. The story is interesting and draws one in, but the game play to go through the story is semi painful at times. Ex. The collar on your neck (The entire DLC) is linked to radios that if you get near them cause your collar to beep, you have to back away or &quot;blow the radio up&quot; (if you can) before you do. It makes it hard to go anywhere, so it was annoying, but at the same time it was very unique. All the weapons were amazing, and they were fun to use, especially to bring back to the Mojave, but the people in the DLC were about 1 people, Ghost People, and that was all, boring right? The reason this gets a 10 is for its interesting well designed take on this story, and it&apos;s perks and weapons, rather, not game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=1666198">Expand</a></span>

The downside is not being able to return to the location.</span>

It removes what makes the original game so liberating and mixes in some new styles that don&apos;t work - however are refreshing. It&apos;s frustrating, yet kind of cool. Again, it&apos;s worth getting all the dlc for this game. This is ultimately a weak link - however it&apos;s worth playing.</span>

<br>You guys should go back to your ANIMES where everything is colorful and pervert. I think the atmosphere and sense of danger and expectation we can find on DEAD MONEY IS something that I&apos;ve just found on BIOSHOCK 1. This DLC is really something. Despite of being a little bit LINEAR is very dark and immersive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=3834356">Expand</a></span>

The whole game feels like they purposely chose the most frustrating bits of Fallout and built a game around them.  Like when you&apos;re trying to navigate on its useless &quot;local&quot; maps through areas which are confusingly split up into multiple loading areas.  In Dead Money THAT&apos;S ALL YOU DO.  It&apos;s just one big rat maze you have to negotiate over and over.  When you finally do get out of the rat maze (following what&apos;s got to be the most lengthy backtracking segment in gaming history), dying by red gas and radio signals is replaced by dying by unkillable holograms...and more radio signals.  The game is frustrating right up until the very last segment which is so frustrating I finally gave up and watched the ending on youtube.  I don&apos;t know who at Bethesda came up with this, but they need to never design a game again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707080">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, the problem of this DLC is that without a walkthrough, going through this DLC is very frustrating especially in the last maze. Dead Money is something that I would recommend doing with a walkthrough on the first play through; I don&apos;t usually recommend that.
<br>
<br>I wonder if designing a new skill (search  awareness) that highlights traps and speakers is a good idea; because while it becomes less frustrating, it also reduces the sense of victory after completing the last maze.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428087">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;re naked bar some grease monkey suit and a collar and you just have to compulsively scavenge fountains for some casino tokens to buy food and whatnot. Granted later on that feeling of having to be on your toes and go against &quot;ghosts&quot; and hostile environment that literally eats you alive with next to bare hands, wanes quite dramatically, mainly because of the too much med packs and stuff you pick up along the way. But still it can be quite challenging. Also some unique features compared to vanilla and other dlcs make things more interesting: find holotransmitter to kill immortal holograms, dissmember ghosts or they rise again, find and destroy speakers before your head pops off and the like. Npcs are also miles more memorable then, say &quot;honest hearts&quot; had and couple of them are old acquaitances from &quot;old world blues&quot; and BoS questline and have some interesting revelations about them.   Overall:  Good: Interesting mechanics, npcs and gear, difficulty (at first), decent story and lore about your companions.    Bad: Difficulty (halfway through it just turns from hard to easy), lack of enemies (you got ghosts, holos and that&apos;s it), dissapointing main baddie (he threatens you, then he&apos;s almost apologizing, then he&apos;s explaining everything like a teacher, then he threatens again, makes no sense), lame last fight (psst... Bethesda... gre-nades. Ok? Sitting behind the boxes and finishing fight in full health, when he has turrets on his side is not my idea of &quot;great&quot; fight. It&apos;s lame is what that was.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723198">Expand</a></span>

Original idea, new characters and overall the entire story and writing are a really of high quality. As for the fun factor, that&apos;s not as awesome and even gets into the frustrating territory in some places, but it&apos;s still a good try for a Fallout survival horror, worth playing and memorable unique experience. 7/10</span>

<br>Foremost in my mind is the characters, who were fantastic, well written and wonderfully acted.
<br>
<br>Dead Money felt very fresh, and it felt like it offered a lot of contrast to the main part of New Vegas.
<br>
<br>I was impressed with the inventive touches that pervade Dead Money, such as the use of audio logs to trigger Dog/God, and Christine&apos;s muteness and consequent conversation was really well done, and I felt myself warming to her despite the communicative limitations. My hat is off to whoever wrote that.
<br>
<br>I liked being stripped of my belongings and being forced to make do with what was around. It added a tense survival quality, and a feeling that the stuff around me was important, and that scrounging was necessary. That feeling tends to disappear quickly in the main game.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere was well realised, very creepy at times. I was reminded of playing Resident Evil on several occasions, which surprised me. It&apos;s Fallout.
<br>
<br>The sound and music is all brilliant. It all works really well, and Vera&apos;s song is hauntingly beautiful.
<br>
<br>The gameplay feels a bit too masochistic at times. Quite punishing. I forgave it. The quality of the story, characters, and setting had me pushing through.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, I found the themes of this story hit close to home and I found myself touched emotionally, which is something that games rarely do for me. Dead Money haunts me, in every sense of the word.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=6080477">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a great addition to the base game because of its tragic story, a unique and perilous setting, as well as new weapons and armor that&apos;s somewhat stronger than those found in the wasteland. If you&apos;re playing on hardcore difficulty and found that the Mojave isn&apos;t that hard, you&apos;ll definitely be challenged by the Sierra Madre Casino, because you are stripped of your inventory when entering the place, the poisonous air takes a bit of your health away every second, and the enemies won&apos;t die unless you tear off their limbs from their body. There&apos;s also the matter of managing your food, water, and sleep, so you really have to manage your resources well. Overall, a good and challenging DLC, offering everything for those who play for the story, gameplay, or both.

                                        <span>Is not a bad DLC. The gameplay is rather boring maybe but the setting is good. (reminded me of the first Bioshock somehow). The story is nice too but this one, along side with lonesome road, is more &quot;linear&quot; than both base game and the other two dlcs. still good imo.</span>

<br>Dead Money takes a more survival focus as the Courier is forced to make it through the Sierra Madre. From the start the player will have to endure extremely difficult obstacles, with less of a focus on fighting your enemies, but rather trying to navigate the ruins of the resort to complete the quest-line. Resources are far more limited then in any other part of the game, and there are portions and features in this DLC that are just not fine-tuned enough to work correctly, resulting in infuriating deaths that don&apos;t feel to be the player&apos;s fault. Besides the flaws in the gameplay, the story is a good tie in to some events that are mentioned in the base game. The environment gives a very gloomy look, but still shows the player the charm and beauty of what the resort was like in the past. The companions are nothing special, as they serve more as a way to progress the story rather then be a companion to the player. This DLC introduces a lot of interesting concepts and story hidden within the world, and it should satisfy anyone who is into a more survival based playstyle. Despite the frustrations I had with it, I did enjoy it somewhat when I looked past the frustrating parts and the unpolished or seemingly unfair sections of the game. It is definitely worth playing through at least once, for the unique experience it brings to New Vegas as well as for its story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---dead-money/user-reviews?user_review_id=7463200">Expand</a></span>
