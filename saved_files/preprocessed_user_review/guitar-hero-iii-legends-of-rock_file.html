If you are a 9yo and brought a Barney lunch box to school, I guarantee you that in a weeks time you would not bring that lunch box again for THAT is the power of psychological influence. Because the other kids have &quot;grown out of&quot; Barney and you have not, you will have social influences to adapt to the majority belief and will most likely do so. If something is deemed &quot;cool&quot; the first thing to do is, well, do it so that YOU are cool. Additionally, &quot;feeling&quot; you are doing something is not the same as doing it... simulated entertainment is not the same as real entertainment. Simply put, if you shove a child in front of a television (simulated) to get it to shut up, you are hurting that childs development.

On the positive note... at least you look minorly cooler with a guitar controller than you look doing the absurd DDR &quot;moves&quot;. Personally, I think it&apos;s 90% about the songs, 8% about people thinking they&apos;re playing the songs... and 100% about the Japanese brainwashing other country&apos;s with their subcultural. And on the note that people who gripe about DDR suck at it... obviously they do. DDR isn&apos;t about &quot;skill&quot; it&apos;s about practice. And spending hours Practicing just to unlock another song sounds a little too much like work to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=408208">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dancing has an EXPENSIVE HUNK OF METAL, and you dance alone because you has no life, no friend and you dont go to partyes.
<br>Guitar Hero its still great, has good graphics, and its the same thing if you spend money in a console or a video card, when you play EXPERT or HARD difficulty its like playing a real guitar,  you need speed and concentration. The game has unlockable items and song like the DDR games. I rated it 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=69996">Expand</a></span>

As well as downloadable songs which have been unfortunately taken off the Xbox market. The game also has decent graphics and a very fun campaign which is especially fun with 2 players. 9/10 (Awesome)</span>

<br>&#xA0;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is a music rhythm game, the third main installment in the Guitar Hero series, and the fourth title overall. The game was published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane. It is the first game in the series to be developed by Neversoft after Activision&apos;s acquisition of RedOctane and MTV Games&apos; purchase of Harmonix, the previous development studio for the series. The game was released worldwide for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 in October 2007, with Budcat Creations assisting Neversoft on developing the PlayStation 2 port and Vicarious Visions solely developing on the Wii port respectively. Aspyr Media published the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X versions of the game, releasing them later in 2007.
<br>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock retains the basic gameplay from previous games in the Guitar Hero series, where the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of lead, bass, and rhythm guitar parts in rock songs by playing in time to scrolling notes on-screen. The game, in addition to existing single-player Career modes, includes a new Co-Op Career mode and competitive challenges that pit the player against in-game characters and other players. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the first game in the series to include an online multiplayer feature, which is enabled in the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 versions. Initially the game offers over 70 songs, most of which are master tracks. Another aspect in the game was DLC  which allowed players to purchase songs, tracks, and characters. One of the most popular DLC packs was the Dr. pack. It included three characters. Dillan The Tatortot, Andrew the certificate ripper, and Julio Caesar. Another popular DLC pack was the song pack called Perales. It included the hit song Dr.Lopez by Perales. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature the ability to download additional songs. The musicians Tom Morello  and Slash  make appearances both as guitar battle opponents and playable characters in the game. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions also include Bret Michaels  as a non-playable character.
<br>Critics were generally favorable towards the game, but reviewers noted a difference in the game&apos;s style compared to previous installments, associating it with it being Neversoft&apos;s first development attempt with the series. The game is often cited to be too difficult, creating &quot;walls of notes&quot; that are difficult to complete, and led to alterations in note placement for future games in the series. According to Activision, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the best-selling video game of 2007, both in terms of units sold and revenue earned, and that it is the first single retail video game to exceed one billion dollars in sales. The company also claimed that it is the second-best selling video game title since 1995, following Wii Play, and is one of the best-selling third-party games available for the Wii.
<br>Development
<br>Activision purchased RedOctane in 2006 for $100 million to achieve &quot;an early leadership position in music-based gaming&quot;. In September of that year, MTV acquired Harmonix, the developer of all Guitar Hero games up to that point; this purchase would later lead to the development of the competing music-game series, Rock Band. Without Harmonix&apos;s availability, Activision selected Neversoft Entertainment to develop Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Neversoft president Joel Jewett stated his company was asked to develop the game because of a conversation that Jewett had with RedOctane&apos;s founders Kai and Charles Huang at the 2006 E3 Convention, in which Jewett mentioned how the first Guitar Hero game helped reduce the stress in the Neversoft offices during their development of Tony Hawk&apos;s Project 8. Several months later, Jewett was contacted by the Huangs, asking if Neversoft wanted to work on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Dusty Welch, head of publishing at RedOctane, recognized Neversoft had a &quot;10-year track record of launching a game every single year and being in the top of the charts&quot; and felt that the development group &quot;brought a better and deeper sense of music sensibilities&quot; to the series. Despite the experience from the previous games, Alan Flores, head of development at Neversoft, commented that the game was &quot;deceptively simple&quot; and that it took much work for their 30-person team to recreate the gameplay for Guitar Hero III. Though they &quot;wanted to take the Guitar Hero experience to the next level&quot; by adding additional instruments in the same manner as Rock Band, they opted to focus on perfecting the guitar gameplay.
<br>The note tracks, on-stage motions of the band, and stage lighting and effect synchronization were created by the same team of developers who were all musicians and had previous experience in note tracking either from other music video games or from MIDI tracking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=5659318">Expand</a></span>
