<br>
<br>And that something good is this game. The &apos;Harvest Moon&apos; franchise has been a mixed bag over the last decade, and the same can be said for the spinoff series &apos;Rune Factory&apos;. Fans took the good with the bad and went with it because they were holding onto something special. Today, the Harvest Moon series barely exists on it&apos;s own. &apos;Story of Seasons&apos; and other life sim titles have come along to replace it with mixed success.
<br>
<br>Well, if you loved those series then &apos;Stardew Valley&apos; is what you want to play. An indie dev has revived the concept...with an obvious passion for &apos;Harvest Moon&apos; and an insane attention to detail.
<br>
<br>I know, right? I didn&apos;t see it coming, either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6129444">Expand</a></span>

So far the Dev released 6 patches (in 3 weeks) and the game itself is marvellous and reminiscent of old times when games were created to be fun, not to make the most amount of money. A very nostalgic experience with all the touches of life-improvement modern features. Amazing.</span>

Games like Harvest Moon never held my attention too long, but this has so many things to do that it keeps me hooked for hours.  I can&apos;t suggest this any higher to anyone that liked Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, or just any relaxing game to play.</span>

Yet, what I can say is that this game seems masterfully made and is addicting as all hell.  It took me a couple of in-game days to get into it and understand it, but everything was simple and self-explanatory enough that I was able to jump right in.
<br>
<br>It was really an inspiration to learn that it was just one guy that made this game and what a job he did.  The art is great, the music is great and all of the characters have such specific backstories and behaviors that you&apos;d think a whole team made it.
<br>
<br>I noticed a couple of glitches, but nothing game breaking.  My biggest issue with the game though is in the lack of settings and options.  I would like to be able to play at work, but I cannot make the screen small enough to do so.  Additionally, volume control is limited to music on or off.  I also would like to be able to save other than at the end of a day, but I can see where that&apos;s ultimately problematic from a design perspective.

What it does better than the Harvest Moon games is that it does not gate its content behind time limits. From the very beginning, you&apos;re able to complete any of the objectives presented to you in game provided that it is the right season. After playing the frustration that was the latest Story of Seasons that required you to sit through 4 years of game time to unlock everything, this was a nice refreshing change. The story is fairly plain and there&apos;s not much that develops it, but it doesn&apos;t matter in the long run. My only complaint is the rather small inventory size, especially when a single item has at least three item qualities meaning that it can take up three item slots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6424186">Expand</a></span>

There is so much to love about it and I can just get lost in it&apos;s world for hours at a time. To start the graphics and music are excellent. Everything is bright and happy which sets just the right tone for a game like this. There is so much to do in it&apos;s world. To name a few you can farm, fish, mine, fight and just create a relationship with others. I love slowly working towards a bigger and better farm and how stressful it is. Turn it on, put on something in the background and prepare to feel a bliss sense a happiness that comes. There are a few things I would like to change but nothing major. Sometime the clicking controls are a bit wonky where you thing you clicked somewhere and your tool swings at something else. That only did happen maybe twice in my 25 hours with the game. Also I wish the characters you can marry where more intrusive and a relationship could develop without just shoving flowers in their face. Dinally the gamepad support is **** so just stick to a mouse and keyboard. But then that the game is wonderful. ANd for only $15 you can take a risk and see if this is the kind of game for.

                                        <span>TL:DR - Buy the game. Now. Seriously. No... just do it.
<br>
<br>The best $15 you will ever spend. I loved Harvest Moon as a young teen, and when I saw this on GOG, I nearly fell out of my chair. Then I fired up the game... it was a lot more than Harvest Moon. It was amazing. Lots of depth, plenty of things to do, lots of secrets, and plenty of surprises hit me dead in the face.</span>

As i progress further into the game i&apos;ll update, but i got pretty much information to give on you guys for now.
<br>Im a big Harvest moon fan, actually not that much, in fact the only ones i played was Friends of Mineral Town and Back to Nature, and ow boy, Back to Nature... i&apos;ve spent easily 500+ hours on that game, it is just so good to start something with barely nothing and turn it into a big thing (That&apos;s why i love games like Tropico 5,XCOM, Total War ETC).
<br>I know its boring but i&apos;ll need to make a lot of comparisons with Harvest moon Back to Nature (because it was the only one i REALLY played and enjoyed)
<br>First off by the story, you are the grandson of a farmer which lives in a small town called Stardew valley, its not explained if you lived with him or not (probably not), one day, he leaves you a letter, and asks you to open it when you grow tired of the City life.
<br>Twenty years have passed and you are working for a company called Joja which is somewhat a parody or critic of the today&apos;s companies, &quot;enslaving&quot; his workers. One day at work, you grow tired of being exploited and decides to open the letter, only to find out you grandfather has left his farm all to you, to start a new life.
<br>Well its pretty much back to nature, but there you live in the city and visit your grandfather in vacations, people already knew you basically but from what i remember he stopped visiting and got somewhat forggoten. his grandpa dies and he gets the farm. So my point is, this is not a ripoff, i was so glad to see such familiar storyline, but from now on things really change so don&apos;t be mad.
<br>So you are introduced to your new, devasted, overgrown land, 500 moneys and 15 seeds as a gift from the mayor, so with hard work you need to transform a terrible once forgotten farm, 500 bucks and 15 seeds into a money-maker machine, restore the town&apos;s economy and bring the people together again. (i&apos;ll explain)
<br>So, Joja gets in the city, everything is different, people likes TV more than hanging out, the once high populated city hall is destroyed and the economy is really bad, so it&apos;s up to you to maybe kick joja out (i don&apos;t know yet if this is a possibility)
<br>So let&apos;s go to some things you can do and have:
<br>-You have some basic tools, which is used to: chop trees down,mine ores and rocks,watering crops,prepare the soil, fishing and foraging.
<br>-There&apos;s plenty of ways to make money in the game, including your primary crop plantation in your farm (beside animals like chickens giving you eggs), Mining, Fishing and even fighting and looting monsters!!!!
<br>-Socialize with other people and even marry and (maybe) have children
<br>-Participate in festivals held by the locals
<br>-Have a pet like a cat or a dog
<br>So now i&apos;ll list somethings different than BtN.
<br>-There are monters, yes! you can actually fight them and loot them, they are pretty though tho, but you can upgrade yours weapons and equipment in the guild hall.
<br>-Bigger Map
<br>-Bigger and more beatiful farm land
<br>-You can craft and build items like chests, scarecrows, sprinklers, furnacers etc
<br>(Im missing things for sure so don&apos;t hesitate to comment and correct me)
<br>Overall its pretty much the same mechanics about farming and etc and i completely love it!
<br>Although there is somethings i didn&apos;t liked
<br>-Females are not cute like the Harvest moon ones (I really preferer those japanese stylish art for women)
<br>-The guys are really cool and the girls not so much, there is one that has a band and rides a skate sometimes!
<br>-The energy system really needs an overhaul, its frustating in the start but becomes too much underpowered on the early to mid game!!
<br>-The TV could use some more work
<br>The soundtrack is simply amazing, it really gives you this &quot;farm&quot; feel!
<br>This is a great game, and it was made by one guy only (which has worked on StarBound) buy it now if you love Harvest moon like me or if you like micro management games like Tropico 5,Sim City etc, its really worth its price, i&apos;ve been playing this for 5 hours straight, no recent games has done this to me, so this is a GREAT sign!
<br>Really, JUST BUY IT!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6130039">Expand</a></span>

What&apos;s more amazing is that the game was created by a single person and it isn&apos;t an early access game either, it&apos;s 100% done product and the developer has stated that there will probably be more content in the future.
<br>
<br>Also the price is just $15 or 13.99 euros.</span>

Until now, the only alternative to the series has mostly been Rune Factory, which is also a very good series. This game, however takes the good from both series and breathes new life into the formula.
<br>
<br>It has many elements that any player of either series would be more than familiar with: farming crops, raising livestock, fishing, and mining. And everything is timed with the daily clock and monthly calendar dates, with special events happening every so often. These categories work the same way as their inspirations for the most part, however there are some key differences. A big over-arching change is that your farmland is almost completely customizable. Other than your house, there is nothing that is pre-placed, and your land area is gigantic. This allows for a fully customized farm that is unique to you. Fishing has a minigame instead of automatically catching whatever you hook; at first, the minigame is extremely difficult, but it does not take long to get used to. Farming also comes with conveniences that never existed before, such as upgradable sprinklers that water tiles of your crops for you (the amount depends on the level of sprinkler) as well as several kinds of fertilizers that have different effects on your crop. Raising animals is mostly the same, however the range of animals that you can care for is vast, including chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, and cows. All of these areas of the game work well, and as one would expect, with there being plenty of variety in all three. Any of these elements can be completely ignored if desired and the player can still make a profit. There is no rush to get to anything at a certain time (for the most part) and the game can be played at your own pace.
<br>
<br>Mining can be best described as a combination of Rune Factory&apos;s combat and Harvest Moon&apos;s cave systems. Each floor has a ladder that needs to be found to move on to the next floor, with there being better ore, minerals, gems, etc to mine the deeper you go. Inside the mine are various monsters that can be killed, sometimes even required to kill. The combat is simple, where LMB swings your melee weapon, holding LMB charges up a slingshot, and RMB does various special actions depending on the weapon. However, the simplicity works for the game, as you are always on the clock, and if it were too complex there&apos;d be too much time spent fighting. There is something special at the very bottom of the mine, giving even more reason to explore it.
<br>
<br>Of course, a Harvest Moon inspired game would not be complete without interactions with the townsfolk. The system is the same as it is in Harvest Moon, where you can talk with villagers and give them gifts to get them to like you more. Unlike Harvest Moon, you can only give two gifts per week, meaning the progression of affection is a lot slower unless you complete quests or special interactions with each villager. So long as you give the right gifts and complete the special tasks, it still will not take too long before your chosen bachelor or bachelorette can be married.
<br>
<br>Despite everything the game does right, there are some issues with it. The running speed is atrociously slow, especially with diagonal movement. You do eventually unlock a horse, but the horse only speeds up diagonal movement; the vertical and horizontal run speeds remain the same. In addition, the bachelors and bachelorettes vary from each other with personality, however they are fairly two dimensional with their personalities. The developer also apparently had a stroke at one point because if you look at the progression of their appearances, there is a point where they gradually become worse and more same-faced, losing some uniqueness to them. There is also a very unfitting anti-corporation message in the game that could have been left out. The overall graphics style is up to personal preference, but I personally like it and think it does a good job creating the comfy atmosphere these games are known for.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the game is capable of being fully modified due to how simple the engine is made. Every pixel can be changed, and mod tools are in the process of being created to add extra content. There is already a mod that changes the appearances of the bachelorettes to an earlier time, as a result of many individuals wanting them altered. So who knows what the developer and modders will add to the game in the future.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this game has just as much if not more content than any of the more modern Harvest Moon games yet is half the price. There are some aspects that I did not even mention such as the sewer dungeon and what is basically the Harvest Sprite tasks because I am 18 hours in and still haven&apos;t finished either of those things, nor have I seen everything the game has to offer yet. I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6131504">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game should be 9.9 but what can we do with ignorance

<br>Winterspark: so sad to be you I do&apos;t even have words for him.
<br>Kummaz &#xBF;only nostalgia? Not really there are manypixel games on steam and none has been this succesful.</span>

I became interested in the game when I heard about it on all of the usual video game websites.  I&apos;ve never played a game like this before, but my girlfriend loved Harvest Moon back in the day and we are both are in love with this game.  It is one of the first games we&apos;ve ever played where we can both play.  Are growing farm has 1 of each animal, all given nicknames very personal.  A goat that has a combination of my in-laws names for his own.  A pig named Porkins in honor of the Star Wars character, because why not!?!?
<br>
<br>Being able to give personal names to these animals, your child, your farm, etc. Make the property and assets you own in the game feel like your own, you&apos;re more invested.
<br>
<br>The gameplay loop is satisfyingly addictive, and there&apos;s a lot of flexibility in how you can play the game.  My first play through was mostly focused on a moderate amount of farming, lots and lots of foraging, mining, and fishing to make a little extra income so I could gradually level up my tools.  My second play through was noticeably different. Focusing heavily on crops and saving up to buy next season&apos;s crops in bulk, I was usually so tired after watering all of the crops, I usually didn&apos;t have enough energy to fish, mine, or cut down trees.  My time was then spent putting more focus into befriending people (because it doesn&apos;t use energy, the game&apos;s version of stamina.) and I have the excess crops to afford that kind of generosity.  It pays off though.  The recipes and perks of being good friends with your neighbors allows you to learn new recipes for food that can restore that crucial energy meter, or they can send you the odd gift like useful supplies for the farm.  Those are two different play-throughs with two very different consequences.
<br>
<br>Want to do nothing while your farm makes it&apos;s own money?  Craft 3 dozen bee boxes and let them generate $100 (or even more if you place them near flowers) per bee box every 4 hours.  Want to be the country&apos;s largest producer of pumpkins?  Use every square inch of your farm to plant 2600 pumpkins... Have fun watering them every day.  Or you can become a spelunker and dig down into the mines and try and collect as many minerals and resources as you can get.  There are many ways to make money in this game.  That freedom is yours to decide.
<br>
<br>Controls are a mixed bag with a gamepad, I&apos;ve had a few head slapping moments where seeds, walls, floors, fertilizer were placed somewhere they shouldn&apos;t have been. Does it affect the gameplay much?  No, it doesn&apos;t.  But when it does happen, 1 or twice every few hours of gameplay, it reminds me that a keyboard and mouse is the best way to play this game.  But if you&apos;re a gamepad gamer like myself, don&apos;t be dissuaded to ignore this game.
<br>
<br>The game mostly functions well, I have come across a few glitches in the game, but most of those have been resolved by a dedicated 1-man developer who&apos;s interacted with the booming fanbase of a game that he passionately made on his own within 4.  He&apos;s constantly releasing patches, there have even been occasions where he has personally helped repair save files of people who have lost progress on their game.
<br>
<br>This is a very personal game that should not be overlooked.  Play the game the way you want, get sucked into the gameplay loop of &quot;One more day&quot;  while your eyes are red and you&apos;re staring at the computer screen at midnight when you have work tomorrow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6312577">Expand</a></span>

This game&apos;s sucked me in for three days straight, which hasn&apos;t happened to me in years. Things are subtle and deep - not overplayed and always obvious (stay away from the Wikia except maybe to look up where fish are, btw!). It does require a pretty insane amount of time (luckily[?!], I just burned off most of my right hand so am out of work for a couple weeks) - so this might not be for someone who doesn&apos;t have time for anything but bite-sized chunks (you can&apos;t save at will, unfortunately, unless you go to sleep early).
<br>
<br>I&apos;m having trouble praising it because I instinctively want to balance it but don&apos;t have many bad things to say about it. The run speed is dreadfully slow, but there are plenty of ways around it (I went with &quot;Stardew Injector&quot; and set runspeed to 2). There&apos;re also two games here -- there&apos;s stuff that doesn&apos;t work (grinding; watching the TV every morning for recipes, chopping TONS of wood, gifting [this should probably be redone from scratch...], farming), and stuff that carries the game to a 8-10 rating (surprise unlocks and lots of RNG tables, cool stuff to craft to make your already-cool unlocks become even better items, way more content than I think anyone would anticipate even after playing a full 10+ hours).
<br>
<br>I struggle to make cheese in real life - and love the stuff, so when I first got to milk a cow and saw cheese in the community center bundle, I knew all my milk was going in the fridge until I unlocked something to transform to cheese, and I really can&apos;t explain why it was so thrilling to finally make my first batch, but it was, so great on ConcernedApe for getting me giddy as a schoolgirl about making virtual cheese. -And now I save my cheese because I know one day, I&apos;ll unlock some awesome recipe and I&apos;ll be using cheese power to blast through the crystal mines down to level 50+ without breaking a sweat. It&apos;s such an enjoyable time investment that even as someone who looks down on losers who invest boatloads of time for a string of data in a program, I get sucked right in to the same thing, and I don&apos;t even feel dirty about it.
<br>
<br>-So congratulations on discovering this game. Go out and buy it, now!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6158729">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are lovely and charming and really sets the tone for the game, and the game play while relatively simple has yet to become boring and lack luster. But what really made me love this game was how quickly I came attached to the characters, the town, etc. Starting off as the new guy in town and slowly integrating yourself into the community has been something that I have found so rewarding. If you are even remotely interested in this game, please give it a try, an easy 10 and one of the most engaging and addictive games I have every played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6304953">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a game with a lot of diversity, from growing crops and raising livestock, to fishing, to exploring the mines, to developing relationships with the townsfolk, to customization of your farm, to completing quests, etc.  It mixes Harvest Moon and Minecraft, and it&apos;s a marriage made in heaven!
<br>
<br>Usually I do appreciate good graphics.  But for this type of game you don&apos;t need it and I don&apos;t even notice now.
<br>
<br>There is one negative I can see in the game: the social aspect.  It lacks depth.  I think VG developers have improved in this area a lot in the last decade, so I may be spoiled in that regard.  I just felt it was lacking in Stardew Valley.  Villagers don&apos;t have a whole lot to say, and unique events are limited.  I would have loved to see this part fleshed out a lot more.
<br>
<br>Regardless, it&apos;s an amazing game.  And for the price, you can&apos;t go wrong!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6211040">Expand</a></span>

It has surprising depth and there are many ways to make money.  The game does a great job of giving you nudges on what to do but leaves the strategies up to you.

<br>Loved it!</span>

<br>Stardew Valley is a fantastic game that successfully brings back the nostalgia of the SNES-era Harvest Moon title while infusing it with new concepts and depth to bring it into the current era of gaming.  The game is simple enough to learn and play and makes an excellent game for couples to play alongside each other as the game was easily picked up and played by my non-gamer girlfriend with minimal problems.
<br>
<br>The player starts as a farmer with basic tools and an overgrown farm in a small run-down house.  From the beginning, the player is tasked with restoring the farm to its former glory, but how the player accomplishes this is up to them.  They can clear land and plant crops to sell at a profit, build barns and coops to raise animals to sell their eggs and milk for a profit.  They can fish.  They can mine.  They can adventure.  Stardew Valley empowers the player to go at their own pace and do what interests them.  There is no real &quot;correct&quot; way to play the game.  There is a simple fun in experiencing milestones, whether that is leveling up a skill to earn a perk, upgrading a tool for increased inefficiency, or watching as the villagers become more friendly with you.
<br>
<br>Players can become friends with townsfolk, learn their backgrounds (Some of which are incredibly well-written emotional stories), and even date and marry the man/woman they desire.  You can decorate your home.  You can become a mainstay in the village by repairing the community center, and many other nuanced things.  I found myself becoming invested in the little village and its characters and particularly enjoyed the routines of the villagers to be an interesting addition. (&quot;Oh, oops, of course the store is closed on Tuesdays, she&apos;s over at the Fitness Group!&quot;)
<br>
<br>The graphics are clean, and the music/sound effects are enjoyable to listen to.  All of this is even more impressive when you consider that the entire game was made by a single individual.  Stardew Valley is a fantastic game for folks who are looking for a different type of game - especially those who enjoy experiencing growth and progress.  There&apos;s a great satisfaction from delivering a good harvest and spending your money.  I really recommend this game - it was an absolute joy to play and holds a great charm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6467211">Expand</a></span>

<br>Est&#xE1;s cansado de los t&#xED;picos juegos con una acci&#xF3;n demasiado r&#xE1;pida?
<br>Necesitas relajarte?
<br>Este es tu juego.
<br>Una banda sonora de 10, un jugabilidad simplemente excelente y con detalles que hacen a este juego una simple obra maestra.
<br>Adem&#xE1;s, la simple grandeza recae en la complejidad de todo, haciendolo incre&#xED;blemente rejugable.
<br>Si quieres una experiencia distinta, mucho m&#xE1;s tranquila y viciarte unas horas, este es uno de los juegos que mejor cumple esos requisitos.
<br>Cabe mencionar que el juego no necesita un superordenador para cargar esos gr&#xE1;ficos, con un simple port&#xE1;til es suficiente.

I wish STEAM had a better system then simply to recommend it or not, because a lot of times, that isn&apos;t the best or easiest answer.
<br>
<br>Stardew Valley is a &apos;Harvest Moon&apos; inspired farming/realtionship simulator with a dash of dungeon crawling and crafting thrown in. The graphics are appealing and the music is well done.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately if you are already familiar with this kind of game play and mechanics, Stardew Valley really isn&apos;t all that creative, unique or innovative.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem with this game is, there has been many, many games, like this before it, that has done a significantly better job at what Stardew Valley is trying to achive. It&apos;s a farming simulator, but anyone aware of Harvest Moon can tell you it does a better job. It&apos;s a dungeon crawler, but only in the lightest of senses.
<br>
<br>And even then, Rune Factory not only did it better, but offered a huge selection of spells, skills, abilities, weapons, varying dungeons and even bosses. It&apos;s a crafting game, but the fact is, it offers much less then more traditional crafting games such as MineCraft or Terraria.
<br>
<br>It suffers from classic issues such as vague quests, plots and more. It can be a massive grind at times and can end up being incredibly tedious, to the point some people may become frustrated. And while multiplayer was initially announced, it&apos;s been pushed back for a later date (if we ever see it). Is it just me or is that completely disappointing? The one thing it could have done to really set itself apart from it&apos;s predecessors and it doesn&apos;t do it. And now that the game has been fully released, how can we expect to see that feature? &apos;Don&apos;t Starve&apos; had to do a completely separate release to account for multiplayer aspects.
<br>
<br>What it boils down is, Stardew Valley isn&apos;t a bad game. I enjoyed the time I spent so far with the game, but, it doesn&apos;t really do anything new or innovative for a genre that has been around since the 90&apos;s. Stardew Valley is really very mediocre. Hopefully, in time, with a few updates pushed out, they&apos;ll prove me wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6150730">Expand</a></span>

What an understatement that does not do it justice. It offers roleplaying elements, exploration, progression, crafting and building - all in a good 16 bit look.
<br>
<br>At first the game seems to ask the player for basic chores - and the days seem to be too long for the few things to do - but very soon there is such a huge list of things you want to do that the days seem way too short ... and the actual farming seems to take away too much from what might be considered &quot;spare time activities or hobbies&quot;.
<br>Balance of time management, rewards and progression seem fine to me. There is a lot of freedom to act and choose. Do you want to perfect profit? Do you want to socialize with the townsfolk? Do you by chance become a dungeon crawling adventurer? - or a lot of other things.
<br>
<br>Stardew Valley is one of those games that i believed to be rubbish when i heard of it first.... a pixel farming game (yea - like that is fun... ) - but it turned out to be not only fun, but utterly amazing.
<br>
<br>Now - at that point i cannot make a judgement about its long term/end game state. I reckon that - once the player has established a near perfect income basis and befriended most of the town or found out most locations backstory and lore - there won t be too much to do anymore. But up to that point - there is plenty of fun to be had ... especially for the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6283623">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay in general, lack any depth. Everything is a chore, and due poor time management mechanics, it&apos;s impossible to not be stressed by this game, And if you want to gift those bland NPCs,  be prepared for more stressful time trying to catch them.
<br>
<br>And about the story, well, I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t really complete a review because after the first year I stopped playing and deleted this game. Only the thought of going trough all this again was too much for me.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t think of anything but give this game a solid 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6254851">Expand</a></span>

I still can&apos;t believe this game was made by one guy....ONE GUY!! For 15$, this game is amazing and definitely worth buying for those that love farming games.</span>

BUT BAM! Stardew Valley came out and though trepidatious I was I took the plunge and boy do I have no regrets. It&apos;s difficult to point out just what Stardew Valley does that is so much better but I would gander that it has something to do with the interminable list of upgrades, collections, and quests that keep you playing. I am nearly 30 hours in and I want to get married, get the bus to start working so I can mine in the desert, get a bigger barn, get a bigger coop, upgrade my house so I can have a child, donate my rare finds to the museum so they give me sweet gifts, collect all the rare scarecrows and....so much other stuff. Why do I want to do this? Idk. I don&apos;t want to to do any of this stuff in real life. It&apos;s bizarre but I love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6220083">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all I really love Harvest Moon type games ever since I played Animal Crossing on the Gamecube, when I saw Stardew Valley on Steam, I initially thought it would be a small Indie game that&apos;d keep me interested for maybe 20 minutes or so. 35 hours later I finally realized that this game is not perfect, it&apos;s not even the game of the year, but what it is, is good. As of right now I&apos;m in the winter of the first year.
<br>It&apos;s fun, it&apos;s simple, it&apos;s cute, it&apos;s casual, it&apos;s nostalgic.
<br>
<br>Things I like about this game:
<br>1. It&apos;s basically Harvest Moon
<br>2. It&apos;s easy to get into and doesn&apos;t have much of a learning curve.
<br>3. There&apos;s always something to do.
<br>4. There&apos;s story to it which I&apos;ll explain soon (No spoilers!)
<br>5. It teaches you to hate big industries that step on small businesses.
<br>
<br>Things I don&apos;t like about this game:
<br>1. I have half an hour, I&apos;ll play Stardew for a bit (Two hours later)&gt; Winter is Coming, I&apos;d better stockpile this hay.
<br>2. One.. more.. day..
<br>3. It takes X days for Y vegetable and you want it tomorrow?
<br>4. My Dog is useless.
<br>5. I spent the entire day looking for you.. and you don&apos;t like my gift?
<br>6. To hell with fishing (The Next Day)&gt; I&apos;ll give it a go again.
<br>7. What do you mean the shops close at 4PM?
<br>8. Slimes.
<br>
<br>The Story: Okay the general story is, you&apos;re a city-slicker, your Grandpappy said to you &quot;Kid, one day you&apos;re going to get sick of City life and when you do you&apos;re going to open this envelope I give you that you take with you to work&quot; So that happens and you get the deed to your Grandpa&apos;s farm, you spend the next year (And more years) fixing up the place, starting your own farm whilst participating in festivals the town holds and helping the villagers.
<br>
<br>The gameplay: The gameplay is casual, it&apos;s simple, it&apos;s fun. Controller compatible, there&apos;s complex parts of it and it can take some planning, like you&apos;ll wake up and watch the weather channel, find out it&apos;s raining the next day and you&apos;ll maybe take the time that rain saved you from watering your crops and maybe use it going in the mines or fishing or even giving gifts to villagers that you can&apos;t bloody find where they&apos;re hiding at so you spend the entire day looking for Abigail because she&apos;s not helping her Father at the shop.
<br>Fishing is difficult, not negatively, it&apos;s a challenge and I enjoy it, but I dread everytime I get an errand that says &quot;Catch X fish and deliver to Y Person&quot;.
<br>It&apos;s repetitive in the sense you&apos;ll live like a farmer, you get up every day water the crops (except in winter) and when you have them you&apos;ll nurture animals (So far I only have chickens) the average day (except in winter) has me doing this until about 10 AM and then I&apos;ll either: Forage for wild plants, tend to my land (Chop trees, break rocks, cut weeds), go fishing, go mining or on very rare days I&apos;ll just go to sleep and do it all again.
<br>The one thing this game has that drives me mental is a poor sense of direction sometimes. Like I&apos;ll be trying to till a spot of earth, but because I&apos;m partially stood on it, it&apos;ll do the next one over (I have the slow placement grid option on which helps) and the amount of times I&apos;ve accidentally killed a crop or broke a fence because of this is too damn high. It&apos;s a small complaint but if it were removed the game would be perfect to me.
<br>
<br>My final verdict: If you have a lot of time to burn, whether it&apos;s twenty minutes before bed or six hours before you go out clubbing, just remember to set an alarm and inform the people you love to come looking for you, or you may wake up infront of the Pearly Gates trying to think of what to tell the Gatekeeper when he asks what you&apos;re doing there because you starved yourself playing for too long.
<br>
<br>Seriously, the game is 11 Sterlings (&#xA3;) it&apos;s so cheap and if you like -anything- I mentioned above it&apos;s worth it, honestly the cons of this game are insignificant and the pros are plentiful.
<br>
<br>Oh and it&apos;s moddable, yeah.
<br>
<br>Happy Farming!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6195418">Expand</a></span>

Absolutely fabulous! Honestly, the only things keeping this from a perfect ten is the tedious daily grind and lack of real personality in the other characters. While I suppose the grind is something to be expected in a farming game, the lack of real character development kinda hits hard. I really had no desire to befriend the villagers, though getting mail from them was kinda nice. In the end though, the game is still fabulous and I can&apos;t stop playing! Definitely a recommended play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6203219">Expand</a></span>

So that&apos;s delayed me from writing anything because to truly explain how impressed with this game I&apos;ve been and how enjoyable it&apos;s been would take forever... to sum it up; before this game came out, I hadn&apos;t been so excited for a games release since I was a kid and I found out about the release of Harvest Moon SNES in the Nintendo Magazine. The hype slowly dwindled with each predecessor with a few occasional gems - but more recently all the new farming sim games have been shells of the past great games. Stardew Valley promised a lot, and it delivered a lot. Its pre-release hype, for me, matched the level of satisfaction that I got out of playing the game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Graphics - reminiscent of the HM for SNES but blended perfectly with the new indie style used in similar games.
<br>Music - great sound track
<br>Storyline - enough to make sense, quiet enough to let you do what you want
<br>Farming &#x2013; Brilliant execution, diversity of crops, diversity of livestock
<br>Crafting &#x2013; amazing idea to include an HM style game and executed very well
<br>Side Stories &#x2013; Really great moments that bring life to the town
<br>Same-Sex Marriage &#x2013; Long time HM fans of the LGBTQ variety (and allies) have literally been begging Natsume to include this and our voices never heard
<br>Misc. &#x2013; Fishing, Mining, Questing, plenty to keep you busy and keep you creating your own adventures
<br>
<br>Cons (though despite existing I should still point out I find the game near-perfect):
<br>Tutorial &#x2013; For me this wasn&#x2019;t an issue but for friends that I got into the game, they found the game a bit difficult to get into and came to me occasionally for help.
<br>Festivals &#x2013; I like the festivals (concerned ape I swear I do you did great overall!) but I felt that they were lacking a little bit of depth &#x2013; maybe varying the prizes from year to year or something, not sure what the solution would have been.
<br>Random Events &#x2013; would have liked more random events, but not a huge deal.
<br>Crafting &#x2013; I love the crafting system, but by the end of the second year, I wanted more new recipes to pop up
<br>
<br>Overall this game is a 10/10 for me. I recommend it to anyone that loves this genre and anyone that loves a good indie game. It&#x2019;s for the die-hard fans and it&#x2019;s for the new entries. Concerned Ape is amazing and I&#x2019;d drink any koolaid he told me to drink. This game, and CA&#x2019;s attention to rapid updates at the initial release, is a testament to what a dedicated developer who cares about the genre and the community can do. So hats off to Concerned Ape and a huge congratulations, you&#x2019;re amazing, this game is amazing, never change.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6360714">Expand</a></span>

While the long-term goals may be present for you, you cannot achieve them all in one day or sitting - the game has no intention of you doing so.

I can&apos;t really say I&apos;ve been bored once, and that&apos;s rare in video games these days when severe monotony hasn&apos;t set in even after 70 hours of gameplay. This game is an amazing accomplishment by one talented developer that provides hours of entertainment for only $15 dollars on Steam. I can honestly say this is probably the best $15 I&apos;ve ever spent. I would highly recommend making the purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6608233">Expand</a></span>

Stardew Valley has snuck its way into my top 10 favorite games list and is easily my favorite game of the first half of 2016. I had been interested in this game since launch, and I finally got my hands on it in the Steam Summer Sale. To my surprise, this little indie gem managed to far outreach my expectations. I can easily describe the feeling of playing this game with a single word: pleasant. In a medium where the are violent, bloody, action-packed games, this was a nice game where you could wind down and just have fun. That&apos;s not to say that they don&apos;t have a place in gaming, The Last of Us, Skyrim, and Uncharted 2 are some of my favorite games of all time. It&apos;s just that this was different and it was different in a good way. Anything you do in Stardew Valley is optional. Want to go mining to advance you skill with the sword and pickaxe? Well, you don&apos;t have too. Want to fish to gain friendship with the local sailor and deliver them to the townsfolk? You don&apos;t have to. This is a tranquil, peaceful, beautifully designed world where, if you wish, you can just sit on your porch and listen to the soft, atmospheric music. Luckily, the fact that nothing is really pushing you to do anything does not make mining, fishing, fighting, or questing any less enjoyable. The singular, lone developer has put in so much content and has created a world that sucks you in as soon as you see the title screen.  Almost everything I have to say about this game is positive except for one excusable, tiny thing. The only problem is that when you marry a townsperson, the dialogue is replaced with less interesting lines. I think that it shows how good a game is when the only real problem aside from random bugs and glitches (which really only do things like showing light a night when there are no fireflies). Overall, this game is nearly perfect, and an easy 99 out of 100 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6536713">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In Stardew Valley, not only they are gone, but here we have a lot of improvements, like ability to move everything around (furniture in your house, items you place on field like sprinklers). I love the idea of sprinklers. Going to mine feels more like going on some adventure than just going for ores (a lot of different gems, bombs to destroy a lot of stones at once, creatures that you need to fight with your sword or even slingshot).
<br>
<br>This game also have a wonderful, peaceful atmosphere, I would say that even better that Harvest Moon had. The music is great - the one in mine is my favourite. There are also quests, like providing given vegetable of gem to somebody, which gives us money and makes relationship with that person better.
<br>
<br>I really love this game and I don&apos;t regret paying for it full price, even though some time before I bought it, there was a discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=6575128">Expand</a></span>

Get this game, you will be guaranteed hours of fun, challenging decisions, learned lessons, highly rewarding experiences, and a self learned strategy.

<br>What made this just under perfect is the fact that some items in the museum are near impossible; that is less than 1% to find.  If the makers made it more achievable, I would have given this game a 10 (9.5 for me)!

<br>
<br>Then after much prodding and pushing you decide to give it a try...and...well...then you&apos;re preaching about the wonders of this game that only just a little bit ago you were criticising. Welcome to Stardew Valley.
<br>
<br>The thing about this game is that it&apos;s really fun. It has all the elements of Harvest Moon you may or may not have loved and then takes everything just a step further in terms of depth, farming...there&apos;s some RPG elements present that are light but very enjoyable. Also, runs perfectly on low spec machines. It&apos;s a prefect laptop game.
<br>
<br>Really, nothing I say is going to convince you to buy it a try it. Just do it. It&apos;s a lot of fun...even if on the surface you can&apos;t imagine how that&apos;s possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=7019101">Expand</a></span>

With the game having an immersive feeling and the characters around town you can get joy when you fix up the town hall and marry that cute awkward girl you may have had an eye on if you know who I mean. Its definitely worth the price tag even if its a game you play once a month or once a week to relieve stress.

You farm, mine, fight monsters, and build improvements on your farm. There are lots of characters that offer unique quests and you can even get married. It&apos;s a very relaxing game, if you like RPG&apos;s or farming simulators you should give it a try.</span>

<br>there is no endgame and not really much content ( in Winter you cant do really much).

It&apos;s slow paced but not necessarily in a bad way, just too slow for my personal licking. It&apos;s unique, and I liked the feel of owning a farm. One thing that I think is just bad is how repetitive it can get can be really irritating. But i recommend the game anyway, it&apos;s not terrible, for some it&apos;s a great game!

I thought was very unique and not like other games. The graphics and story of the game are very aesthetic, and it lasts for thousands of in-game years. Although, I wish you could earn more than 8 stars with everyone (besides being married to them), and I wish there was more info of the game because I usually have to look up how to do something or how to get certain fish or crops. Overall, the game is so much fun and very addicting!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stardew-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=7660276">Expand</a></span>
