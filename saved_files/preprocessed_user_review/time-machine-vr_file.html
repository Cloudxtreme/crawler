Of all the VR games I have played so far, and I have played quite a few, I would definitely have to put this one in my top five.  I have always been fascinated by prehistoric creatures, mainly dinosaurs.  Not only did this game show me detailed models of prehistoric marine life but I was even able to get right up in their faces.  One thing I did not realize about ancient creatures, they have tons of teeth!  This game is by no means Call of Duty or Battlefield and I wouldn&apos;t even try to compare it to a game like that.  If you are looking for a mind numbing game full of gratuitous violence, this is not that game.  Instead this game is immersive, educational, thought provoking, ground breaking and an absolutely breath taking experience.  It transports you into a world full of prehistoric creature, many of whom want to eat you.  You zip around in your underwater pod checking out all kinds of prehistoric marine life.  If you don&apos;t care too much about the educational side then you will still have fun playing the game and if you do want to learn a thing or two then there is a really cool database that will tel you all kinds of information about the animals you have studied.  From a learning stand point I think this game is awesome.  I so wish I had something like this when I was a kid.  All I had were stupid math games that wouldn&apos;t let me progress until I solved a math problem.  This is so much more fun and I know that kids will love learning about prehistoric animals with this game.  There are only two things I could complain about with the game.  One is that you can&apos;t to above water.  As I stated before I am fascinated with all kinds of prehistoric life.  So I would love to see some future content where you could go above water and check out the land animals.  Second, I soooooo wish there was more content to this game.  I don&apos;t want to stop playing this game.  I wish there were more things for me to do in it.  But alas, I must wait until the developers release more content.  I know it is coming but I just can&apos;t wait.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone.  If you can manage to get a VR headset, whether it is an oculus dk2 or a cv1 or a vive, you absolutely HAVE to check this game out.  If you want to get an idea of the game then just check it out on YouTube.  There are several people with gameplay videos uploaded, me included.  They will give you a small idea of what the game is like but honestly videos can never prepare you for what virtual reality is really like.  You just have to experience it for yourself.  Seriously though, get a headset and make sure this game is one of the first you try.  I guarantee you won&apos;t be disappointed.  I tried this game on an oculus rift DK2.  10 out of 10.  One of my favorite VR games thus far!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/time-machine-vr/user-reviews?user_review_id=6497292">Expand</a></span>

<br>The cockpit of the time machine is well designed and I experienced no motion sickness from artificial locomotion.  If nothing else, I recommend every Vive or Rift owner go on Steam and check out the demo.

One of my favourite features is pausing time for a short period to get a real close up look at these beautifully designed and detailed creatures.

The attention to detail and the scale of the environment is unbelievable. you as a player could freely explore these huge areas filled with creatures that you could go right up close to, to get a sense of just how small you really are in the jurassic era. I got this weird mixture of feelings when playing this game, excited to dive deeper into the environment and the story, but at the same time I always had this frightful thought that something was hunting me. This game did a fantastic job of giving me the illusion that I was really there.
<br>I would recommend Time Machine VR to anyone who has an Oculus Rift or htc vive. Because I think Time Machine VR is exactly what virtual reality is all about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/time-machine-vr/user-reviews?user_review_id=6493334">Expand</a></span>

I played on the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, both had their pros and cons but somehow gave a different experience within each.  It was really cool to see how  the dinosaurs progressed as the game was released as I finished the third mission expecting more and had to wait for the next release.  In the end I would recommend this game to others as it provided a comfortable experience and did not give a quick sense of motion sickness like other games have done.  The story was  also pretty good as it made you ask questions, wondering what was going to happen next. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/time-machine-vr/user-reviews?user_review_id=6493835">Expand</a></span>
