The controls are horrible, graphics are almost as crappy as EndWar (eww) and it&apos;s just another boring arcade shooter, except now you&apos;re constantly moving at over 100 mph. I swear, no tactics or thought was put in this game. Battlefield 2 had BETTER controls and flight physics than this POS!!! We need another Lock On: Modern Combat. That&apos;s it! I&apos;m going back to Flight Sim X. All in all, Ubisoft has completely destroyed the once proud Tom Clancy title. Hell, even he doesn&apos;t want to be recognized for this crap anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=423029">Expand</a></span>

Controls are bad I started by using my XBox360 controller. At least, they kept the implementation. I guess it can work but the control with the thumbstick are unprecise enough to make it almost impossible to gun down either ground unit or flying unit. 2. Joystick support is bad. I mean, it&apos;s a flying game. So I thought I&apos;d plug my Saitek X45 and play the game. Well, it don&apos;t work well at all. First, someone had the weird idea that speed should be just a Slow and Fast button. If you don&apos;t press any of these, you go normal speed. Wow.. nice. Even the rudder is a left and right button. You can&apos;t have an axis on it. Even when I thought everything was allright, the game just start automaticly ruddering to the right until I completely restarted the game and unplugged the joystick. I said ok I&apos;ll return to my gamepad. 3. You don&apos;t feel like flying. I always liked flying game. I played flight simulator a lot and I really enjoyed IL2 for the really short time I played. I also like the Original Crimsom Sky when it was released on PC. All that was all right. However, in HAWX, you don&apos;t feel like flying. It looks exactly like when you&apos;re in free camera after death in FPS. You just glide in a direction and shoot. Since the controls are weird, you&apos;re never precise either. You&apos;ll still lock on a target and you can shoot missile on the target. So you just wait for waves of different enemy, go after them and shoot missile on them. Once fights comes in, you&apos;ll be harassed by other missile. You can dodge them or throw flares... it&apos;s still not that fun and just a bit chaotic. So you end up chasing the target and throwing missile at it while randomly going for another one until the mission is done. 4. While you play, there&apos;s some dialogs but you only see a small thumbnail with voice-over and it&apos;s nothing special. Just like Star fox. Sometimes, you see a cutscene but it&apos;s only for a short time until you&apos;re rethrowed into action. 5. Graphics are OK I guess. I thought it&apos;d be more than that. Since you don&apos;t even feel like flying, it just look like empty space. It might look good when you get higher but seriously.. it&apos;s just bland. Nothing like scenery in Flight Simulator. 6. When you crash, it&apos;s ugly. You get a small explosion and a commentary like Don&apos;t shoot! Don&apos;t shoot! Than you&apos;re ask if you want to restart to checkpoint or restart the mission. Then you have to watch a bland cutscene showing the same surrounding when you retry. 7. There doesn&apos;t seem to be any physics in the game. I found it tough to even try to shoot tank on the ground. I would have liked to be able to shoot ground target in a line, like in movies but it&apos;s unrealistic. You end up so low that you can crash at any time trying to correct your direction. 8. You get XP for kills and it unlocks new plane. Looked like a gimmick. Nothing original here. 9. I never got to take off or land or anything. I was never showed outside my plane or anything. Seriously, this game is lame. I don&apos;t recommend it to anyone. I was really thrilled to try it but I suggest getting IL2 or something like that. Missions are a lot more rewarding to me. Even the menu don&apos;t work well with a mouse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=85630">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are very good if your computer is up-to-date. I&apos;ve been playing it on the PC and I&apos;ve had no problems with it at all. I was looking for a simulator, but I found something even better! The gameplay, however, does get a little repeptitive.</span>

I just want to blow people out of the sky and not have to worry about whether I&apos;m going to accidentally deploy the landing gear, play this game if you want click... Bang! Gameplay. 2. Play it with a joystick, the old mouse and keyboard is great for shooters RPGs and RTS but if you want to drive a plane at least get a gamepad. 3. Yes, the story is crap. Remember this is tom Clancy. His stories only make sense if you are patriotically American and actually care about a bunch of grown army men whining about they&apos;re paychecks. 4. Multiplayer is fun. Anyone who has a problem with the game should play multiplayer. If the AI is to stoopid you&apos;ve got humans to asplode instead. If you FEEL stupid then you can make your friends feel stupid too. 5. The graphics... Don&apos;t expect anything brilliant and you&apos;ll be pleasantly surprised.

The plane models also look nice, for example the F-16. There are many planes and many places. I haven&apos;t finished the game yet but I wil try it. The controls in the beginning are quite confusing but you will get used to them. The menus are easy to understand for me. You can easily find what you&apos;re looking for. This is not a flying simulator. It&apos;s half arcade. My knowledge is not so good in these sort of games and I usually don&apos;t like them but this an exception. I don&apos;t know anything about planes but now I know. Well, if you like flying but don&apos;t like simulators this game is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=1657931">Expand</a></span>

Also the way aircraft maneuver is completely unrealistic. For example C130 Cargo planes and AWACS which are large aircraft fly and make sudden maneuvers like dragon flies. Also enemy fighters doing circles around you like a swarm of angry computer bees with missiles is also absurd. Another aspect I did not enjoy is the thirdperson mode that you are sometimes forced to use to do certain maneuvers. But, regardless the story isn&apos;t half that bad, but still cliche. The graphics and terrain detail is very detailed and make for an excellent environment for flying. The music and sound effects are obviously lacking and poor in quality compared to most new games. Never the less, this game is fun to play and challenging on expert in a unrealistic fashion. The plane models look excellent with lots of different plane and weapon load outs. Also it is well polished and I have not run into any crashes, instabilities or bugs while playing so it runs smooth and solid which can&apos;t be said about most titles!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=1989202">Expand</a></span>

Its relegation to extreme discount status is understandable - the plot is ridiculous, some of the production values are off (poor lip synching of characters in dialogue sequence), the single player campaign&apos;s length isn&apos;t too long, and apparently no one is playing this game online.  However, wow this game&apos;s fun.  The controls are amazing, there are some cool mechanics (like the ability to control the plane in 1st and 3rd person - changeable on the fly), a nice collection of planes to use, and some really fun single player missions.  If you can grab it for 10 bucks, it&apos;s a good deal and you&apos;ll enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=2252284">Expand</a></span>

The controls for the PC are hardly decent, especially with a joystick, specifically the one made for the game. All the menus could run more smoothly.

<br>I suggest UBI or Valve to build a cloud save functions for this one.

<br>You&apos;d better finish missions on your first try or else chances are that you will replay the whole mission. When restarting from a checkpoint the game will sometimes get forever stuck &apos;Waiting for other players&apos;. Well, there are no other players to wait for since this happens when you&apos;re playing the single player. After finishing a mission the game may also simply crash, luckily then you&apos;ll still maintain your progress and can proceed to the next mission.
<br>
<br>Several times I also began a mission with no plane to control. I could still control the camera but the plane wasn&apos;t visible from the outside view. Cockpit view showed as intended but the plane still couldn&apos;t be controlled. Quitting back to menu from situation like this usually simply caused the game to freeze.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise the game is nice enough arcade flying game. There is absolutely no realism to the flying. Even the stall recovery works completely backwards: In order to recover from a stall you have to pull your nose up to level the plane. This caused some major confusion for me during the stall tutorial, as by instinct I was pushing the nose down to gain speed yet the plane kept stalling on and on. The easiest (normal) difficulty can be surprisingly challenging at times. Glad the game wasn&apos;t any longer as I probably couldn&apos;t have taken the constant freezing and killing the game process much longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=6311815">Expand</a></span>

It is quite easy to master and play, which means that it is good for casual players. Combat system is simple, and graphics are excellent, making very act of flying enjoyment. All environments are designed by using satellite imaginery, which means that you fight at real locations.
<br>
<br>These good sides are countered by numerous issues. While plot premise is good, execution is rather cheesy and unimaginative. While voice acting is OK, and your wingmen use military codes, most of the time it feels cheesy and unimaginative, not to mention utterly superfluous and disconnected from the actual tactical situation. In terms of flight physics, reality has gone out to the luch and will not be returning - aircraft make maneuvers that would turn pilots into ketchup, post-stall maneuvers are far less suicidal than they should be, and missiles are more agile than they should be. This is made worse by the fact that enemies rarely react to your missile attacks unless you are very, very close, meaning that missiles typically hit. Even at highest difficulty levels, only &quot;ace&quot; pilots actually present some challenge; rest of the time challenge is limited to being able to destroy a horde of enemies quickly enough to get to the other side of the map and destroy second horde of the enemies before they manage to destroy whatever it is you are protecting. This is made worse by the fact that your wingmen are as stupid as the enemies, and are typically of little help.
<br>
<br>Ande since aircraft are apparently made of tritanium and diamond, you will need two missiles or several gun bursts to shoot down a single enemy fighter; enemies might require between two and a dozen hits on you to bring you down, but they have no chance of landing these unless you forget to maneuver.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you want a military combat simulation, play Lock On: Modern Air Combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-hawx/user-reviews?user_review_id=4858313">Expand</a></span>

But damn if this game isn&apos;t crazy amounts of fun. The plot doesn&apos;t make sense, lip-syncing doesn&apos;t exist, and there is a lack of variety in game mechanics. Despite all this, it is mindless, joyous, childish fun.</span>
