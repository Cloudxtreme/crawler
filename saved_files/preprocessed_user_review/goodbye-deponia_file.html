The puzzles are 90% intuitive, but expect to get frustrated enough to the point where you simply have to look online for simple answers, rather than clicking on every item, character, and conversation options with everything.
<br>
<br>The story was enough to captivate me for over 50 hours of great gameplay over the entire trilogy.  There&apos;s lots of humor, from toilet humor to adult humor, and you&apos;ll find yourself LOLing along the way.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, there&apos;s a few roadblocks and puzzles that simply aren&apos;t intuitive, which should have been fixed during play-testing, and the ending is completely unrewarding.  Literally 15 minutes of serious thought and storyline changes from the devs, and it&apos;d be a 10.  That&apos;s sad!
<br>
<br>I wrote my own special ending for it, where Rufus gets saved by Goal through a SIMPLE dialogue option during the ending where she finally figures out which one of the three dudes pinned by the fan blades is really him.  The other two drop down to Deponia never to be seen again, while Goal and Rufus go to Elysium, along with the few remaining Deponian survivors.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve noticed a trend with Daedalic Entertainment and very **** endings.  &quot;The Whispered World&quot; forced you to choose between one reality or another, killing off the characters that you worked with for 99% of the game; &quot;A New Beginning&quot; forced you to kill the protagonist via super-heated steam; &quot;Edna and Harvey&quot; forced you to realize that you killed a childhood friend, and left you with the decision to also kill his father or go back to the loony house.
<br>
<br>Seriously, Daedalic, write some better endings.  I wanted to give this review a 1/10 just for the ending, but I had to seriously think about the other 99% of the story and gameplay.  Consider yourselves lucky, but for the love of everything, write better endings!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=4183914">Expand</a></span>

<br>But the ending...isn&apos;t particularly &quot;bad&quot;. It&apos;s just not very satisfying. It feels like the game ends without a real close. It feels a bit rushed.
<br>
<br>Nonetheless. This Game is pure fun with a little bit of serious-ish Drama. The whole Deponia Trilogy might be the best thing Poki did till now. Buy it, play it, love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3653731">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>now onto the good the art is what youd ecpect from the last 2 installments. it is a tang of fun and excitment that will pop from the screen its easy to get lost in the art of the game and loose focus on the main story line of the game as you click on things just to see what they can do. the music in the game is captivating and enhances the art and animation. they go vary well together.
<br>
<br>all in all though in the end i have to give this a 2 for working to get to this i feel betrayed by the fact i bought the first two games. also played them to get to this blunder oc a game and end of the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843777">Expand</a></span>

There are some laughs here and there as well as some comical references pulled from many other games and TV shows and while it seems to be worth playing, I personally thought so too until the dramatic climax. I had flashbacks to the horrible ending of Mass effect trilogy it was the same thing all over again a Non-ending. One that leaves you with a disgust for the entire series after seeing it. It very quickly goes from something you liked to play and were fond of to a bitter memory that you shake your head and try to forget when it pops into your mind. Do your self a favor and don&apos;t play any of these three games you will just be disappointed at the end.   Any way you look at how this thing ended they are all horrible. I believe the author of the story even deliberately gloated the fact at the end. Basically saying look I made this awesome story watch as I destroy it with a baseball bat.
<br>
<br>There was also several things in the story itself that made me cringe.
<br>
<br>#1 separating two love birds and forcing one of them into indentured servitude.
<br>#2 convincing kids to touch a pedophiles penis, and also doing it yourself. Then convincing woman to get the pedophiles penis tattooed on there arms.
<br>#3 killing baby dolphins and turning them into cat food for a puzzle.
<br>
<br>There were others but this is all I can point out without adding spoilers.
<br>Don&apos;t buy the game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=4074989">Expand</a></span>

Almost all the times you have to be selfish and mean to get through the plot. This was actually fun for me to think like that. Also drama and and even jokes in this one is a bit deeper which fist for the final section. However for someone like me who tend to attach strongly to fictional characters, the ending really sucked. It managed to take the fun out of the video game and somehow made me regret the time I invested on the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3952885">Expand</a></span>

<br>I catched myself on thought i almost didn&apos;t play quest games. So i decided to meet genre. Deponia intrested me by her marvelous graphic style. I played first part. For all adventure i had a feeling that something is wrong. Sometimes float unlogical decisions. sometimes it was getting boring, and almost for all playing time I couldn&apos;t get what the game want from me. I thought I will get the final and never remember it again... and it could catch me in the very end. Unexpected plot turn in the end was like a shock therapy. So I bought the dilogy in Steam and fast enough began to play the second part. This part was much better. Developers worked with game world, improved puzzles and did it more obvious, add many intresting characters which made them love, and show many emotional scenes which could make you do everytihing: fun, cry, live through and greedily play further to recognize: what next, what next?! I loved the game without the rest and very waiting for third part. And when I got  almost nothing could bring me out from it, I played two days. Everything is fine in the game was cool  fun from meeting old friends, unexpected turns of plot, intresting places, atmosphere music, and many humour white and black. I even didn&apos;t notice, how i bonded to Rufus. This character never boring, egoistic in the beginning of his way but changing for the all trilogy and becoming real hero  and martyr in the end, like he said &quot;How is it possible not to like me?!&quot;.
<br>And it&apos;s only increasing trategy in the end. The only person who really deserved the place on Elysium... Must die in the end?! First- i saw it somwhere else... Oh, common! You can see it EVERYWHERE in the films. And there it&apos;s can be accepted and you can live further like nothing happened, because it&apos;s a single story, you listen it for two hours and you don&apos;t bond to characters and story too hard. But videogames absolutely different. Because it&apos;s you personal story, and longer you get involved  then deeper in you heart it falls. And I consider than hero in the end must  be judged for his way, how he made trough it, how he changed himself on it. And i can say this  Rufus just didn&apos;t deserve the death, even heroic. Why everyone think that story must end not logical way but somehow different to make the story unusual and rememberable (that is sarcasm)?! Daedelic, Why you don&apos;t think that fan want happy ending? Why do you kick the balls third time?! I&apos;m sure, that i&apos;m not the only one who think like this.
<br>And... I think i shouldn&apos;t be upset because of the fate of hero. I must thank for he existing and gifted us much happy hours. Thank you, Rufus. I suppouse you won&apos;t get in hell to fix junk presses. I beleive you fall on somebody poor who had much less luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3648401">Expand</a></span>

Only random guesswork will get you anywhere, as it suffers from the worst &quot;puzzle&quot; design i have seen in a long time. Very disappointing.</span>

I spent playing 25 hours, half of it just trying everything on everyone; not for the funny responses, but to get unstuck. Had to check the forums for some clues. The game suffers from the &quot;use the tape on the cat&quot; syndrome: twisted logic actions and denied straight paths. (For example, one task involved creating an imprint, but unless Rufus visited the psychologist before to name a similar imprint, the imprint just dissolved into a blob.) Despite the shortcomings, the series is a definite buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3653351">Expand</a></span>

Not hard, not too easy - pretty much a smooth ride all throughout, except for a couple tricky places.
<br>My main complain is the English sound - sound optimization for English version seemed to have missed the quality check entirely.  Sound compression, balancing, equalizing are not well done, especially when it comes to Organon speaking.  And when Organon starting singing their hymn for the first time - my eardrums, i&apos;m afraid, were permanently damaged.  Same issue plagued the first and second part, but Goodbye Deponia takes the cake.  I wonder if the original German has similar issues.
<br>
<br>Overall, a good continuation of the series, well drawn locales, nicely written dialogue, joyful puzzles.
<br>
<br>RECOMMEND.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6903433">Expand</a></span>

<br>i didnt like that much idea with death and cloning but somehow that part was very quick.
<br>somehow i still feel (hope) this is not the end of entire series because final cut-scene isnt saying Rufus is dead, it was Cletus actually. At one point camera is showing very precisle the Elysium so am kinda expecting if there ever gonna be another realease (which i really hope) we can maybie start adventure on Elysium. There is deffinitely more to say in these game.

<br>
<br>Things that I liked about the game:
<br>* Humor, puns, insults, jokes - basically the dialog for the 1st 50% of the game
<br>* The characters Rufus, Goal, Doc are likable. You can understand what they&apos;re doing.
<br>
<br>Things that I didn&apos;t like about this game:
<br>* The humor and dialog basically suck in the 2nd half of the game
<br>* There is a cloning puzzle which basically ruins the 2nd half of the game
<br>* The character Toni is annoying as F.
<br>* The villians don&apos;t have any character. They say one thing and do another. It&apos;s hard to distinguish them in the game and understand what exactly they are trying to achieve. It spoils the plot major in the second half.
<br>* The second half of the game has puzzles that are annoying as F. **** cryptic puzzles that you can&apos;t guess. You NEED a walkthrough for the second half of this game.
<br>* The controversial horrible ending - it ruined the memory of the entire series for me</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=5843870">Expand</a></span>

Nevertheless it&apos;s a must play for every fan of point and click adventures and redefines the standard of this genre.</span>

Voice acting is good, the art is pretty and consistent. You meet a TON of characters (and ruin all their lives in the process). Put simply if you are in anyway a fan of adventure games this is a must play.
<br>
<br>If I can give you one hint to solving the puzzles though, it is to pretend you are the worst human being in existence. If you can do this then all the puzzles make sense. Probably the biggest detraction from the game is the main character, Rufus. Rufus is just UNLIKEABLE. Through out the series, you keep hoping that some where along the line he&apos;d mature a bit and think of others, but no. Only at the end do we get anything close to this.  He is so awful, that for me some puzzle were insolvable because I couldn&apos;t get into the mindset of doing something so horrible to progress.
<br>
<br>But keep in mind this is more of a satire on how old adventure games had you do bad things and you would still be the hero. Here there no question that nobody thinks that Rufus is a hero. In the end, if you&apos;re interested in irreverent (offensive) comedy, a good story and a strong adventure game, then the Deponia series is an excellent place to look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goodbye-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3811079">Expand</a></span>
