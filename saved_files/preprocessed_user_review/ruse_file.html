This game is a must for all those who want a good strategy game that isn&apos;t un-realistic.  I can see this game becoming one of the main games along with SC2 that will be played in tournaments for the determining who is the true master in RTS games.  I would strongly recommend picking this game up if you are a real strategy fan or a fan of any WW2 game.  I started off back in the early 90&apos;s playing close combat on the Macintosh.  Since that time I have been searching for a game like it, and finally something came along which is like it, and in many ways much much better because of the scale and magnitude of the battles.  But then again, my old Macintosh wouldn&apos;t have been able to do that with 32 mb of ram, lol.  I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370308">Expand</a></span>

People may complain about the game being casual, but don&apos;t let short sighted people who think clicks per second equals depth fool you. someone seeing chess for five seconds might say it&apos;s rules are to simple to create a game with depth, and such a person will probably also say R.U.S.E. lacks depth because it removes a massive amount of micromanagement normally seen in rts, yet this micromanagement added little to the depth of the games.<br><br>R.U.S.E is closer to grand strategy than anything else, so people who complain about the game lacking depth becasue of a lack of micromanagement has not understood the point. The game is about out thinking your opponent. Not being faster at clicking at special power buttons and moving a single units behind cover. This might be called lack of depth by people used to this kind of micromanagement in games, but R.U.S.E. is about seeing who got the smarts not the reflexes.<br><br>R.U.S.E. is closer to grand strategy done in 30 min than anything else, and thank any eventually existing gods for that!

My problem with it however, is partly the lack of content (few maps, worthless singleplayer etc), but mainly how unbalanced the game is, often it is just about building the most amount of tanks, back it up with some artillery and charge the enemy. Deception and planning doesn&apos;t really make that much difference, atleast not in the games I&apos;ve played.

<br>
<br>A truly tactical RTS that more than meets the genre requirements, if not challenging them all too much. Despite other reviews, I believe RUSE has an addictive gameplay and tactical depth that is not bogged down by excessive micromanagement. This is served up with excellent visuals and a robust multiplayer component that will keep you booting up the game for time to come. With the addition of coop, skirmish and challenge modes, RUSE is a well rounded package. The campaign is a little uninspired, and at times frustrating, but it is clear the developers designed it to &apos;teach&apos; players the RUSE mechanics.
<br>
<br>Critics have considered the &apos;slow&apos; pace of the game as a major flaw. In my opinion the pacing of the game is in line with other titles from the RTS genre, considering the size of the maps and (potential) scale of battles. The battles are as intense and exhilarating as any other good RTS.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve previously played the Company of Heroes Anthology, Total War series and World in Conflict. RUSE certainly ranks amongst those titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370852">Expand</a></span>

I think a lot of gamers who don&apos;t like the entire macro/micro-management part of RTS games, will for sure enjoy this one! 10/10, not a &quot;full&quot; 10/10 because of small missing details like mine laying and such.

The maps are absolutely huge and detailed, and this is most appreciated when zoomed all the way in.

The battles are brutal also, epic and lifelike.

<br>The gameplay itself is also fantastic online. I successfully managed to bluff what I thought was a superior opponent today. I consciously made an effort to appear to be concentrating all of my forces on one side of his position, while carefully hiding my real attack force. He absolutely didn&apos;t know what hit him until it was too late. I&apos;ve saved the replay as a trophy for myself too.

And that is just an example!  There are quite a few ruses, and if you learn when and where to use them, you can become a decent player.  Fail to use them properly and you will lose.<br><br>The units are decently balanced, the graphics are gorgeous, and the game is...  Wait for it....   FUN TO PLAY!!!!  And THAT is something that is missing from so many games these days!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370175">Expand</a></span>

Many a RTS, such as SW: Empire at War, Company of Heroes, Sins of a Solar Empire, I&apos;ve sighed in disdain at the lackluster skirmish AI, I would always find myself searching for an AI mod to make them more challenging. On RUSE, id be afraid to do that, for the AI may become self aware. The skirmish AI on easy provides a challenge, which makes things all the much better when I play against the hard AI. And as for multi-player battles, well the deception and strategy that goes into playing is astounding. There are limitless ways you can go about crushing your enemy, which greatly appeals to me, and many RTS gamers in the community. I for one see RUSE as the best RTS this year, with large gorgeous maps, wonderful unit selection, and brilliant strategy, it truly is one of the best RTS games to be released in over a decade, hands down. Those who disagree can lay &apos;neath the mighty tread of my Pershing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371067">Expand</a></span>

With limiting time, and wealth combined with deceptive factors (ruses) creates completely different scenarios of strategy each time. I am convinced that it is impossible to repeat a winning same strategy due to the changing conditions the opponent generates. However, the campaign is somewhat dull but I believe the best part of a RTS game is the multiplayer experience. R.U.S.E. provides the key nations in WW2 (except Japan) that differentiate in strengths and weaknesses. The graphics provide an extraordinary experience in the fighting, being able to see the action in vivid detail in real time. I would strongly recommend purchasing this game if you are an adherent RTS gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379609">Expand</a></span>

Think again, because this is exactly what R.U.S.E. is.<br><br>I must admit that after playing this game, the other RTS titles seem a bit flat, if not impoverished, both in user interface, but also in strategic depth. Play it, and you discover that traditional RTS seem to just enjoy interface that feels like RPG with more units that gets bogged down into micromanagement, instead of bringing you the strategic depth, and tactical surprise by either rapid change of action, and explicitly facilitates subterfuge.<br><br>It is also one of few real-time strategy games that can meaningfully simulated intentional deception by much more than just a fog of war.<br><br>Players may easily manipulate appearance of their units, and also hide them altogether for a short time (&quot;Radio Silence&quot;) in order to strike at a most surprising point.<br><br>I recommend this RTS as a best game of the year, and also a striking example of how novel game mechanics, may re-create a genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1608444">Expand</a></span>

However, for some reason I found myself gleefully positioning anti-tank guns into forests, hiding an airfield of spitfires, sending fake tanks into the enemy&apos;s base, parachuting troops into an empty town, building a lot of tanks ... reminds me of the days of playing C&amp;C on the Playstation at Uni. However, this game moves at a pace that actually gives you a moment to think. Whereas something like Starcraft 2 will have you pulling your hair out with frustration, RUSE is definitely much more of a strategic game. Quite a lot of the strategy is based on second-guessing what the enemy is up to. Each unit really does feel like it has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, doesn&apos;t matter how many planes you have, they will all get shot to pieces if you fly over a fortified anti-air position. So that means you can&apos;t build a ton of planes and send them over to knock out the enemy&apos;s key buildings. It&apos;s also really hard infiltrating a base with some parachute troops. What this means is that you have to fight a largely ground battle, with air-support, and you have to have the right balance of units in order to win and make progress. I suppose that&apos;s like most games, but with RUSE you feel like your unit build and positioning decisions actually have impact. Not since World in Conflict have I enjoyed a top-down real-time war strategy game so much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2031804">Expand</a></span>

Micro-management is well and good... but there are those of use who appreciate the finesse of good planning and good thinking instead of just reflexes... sure the campaign isn&apos;t necessarily the most original (a narrative picking up on the rich elements of ww2 which has been seens before but probably still has a market for it), and there could be a pace management widget... but many people fail to appreciate the subtlety of its mechanics...

R.U.S.E. is first and foremost (as with all games today) a multiplayer experience. It has been designed as such, with fantastic dialogue between beta testers (of which there were many) and impeccable attention to detail, gameplay, and realism. The single player campaign lacks the fast paced run and gun people are use to, but the heavily strategic and tactical gameplay of multiplayer absolutely shines. The art of deception the game is based around gives players an endless multitude of strategies to fool foes, interact with team mates and drag you in to a gaming experience you won&apos;t forget.

The game depicts large scale conflicts in real time and on multiple fronts. The campaign is fun, well crafted and introduce the players to the units and concepts of the game. You&apos;ll take parts in some histprical battles altough the designer took some liberty by modifying history itself. All in all the campaign&apos;s story is entertaining but not great. It does the job of connecting the missions together. Where the game really shine is in the tactics one must use to winn a battle. You have to carefully use cover, hide units in woods, village to ambush the ennemies. You have to be careful to have a well balanced army on order to be able to manage all kind of situations. The game also have a supply system in wich you receive your ressources from supply depots by roads, so, if you deny the roads to a player you cripple it&apos;s economy. The roads allow also infantry to deploy faster and make movement easier so they play an important role in each game. The ruses advertised by the game are a nice addition and are useful most of the time. You can deploy fake attacks; for exemple, you can send false air attack to a sector of the map to help reduce the air defense where you are really going to attack, spy on ennemy units, etc. All in all the gameplay is very well crafted but is slower than most other RTS, no quick rush here &#xC3;&#xA0; la Starcraft.
<br>In multiplayer you can play in team against AI, coop operations or against other humans. Victory is not only acheived by crushing your ennemy entierly but also with a victory points system wich are accumulated over the course of a battle and at the end the winner is the team with the most (but a 10% difference is considered as a draw). Overall I recommend the game for any one who wants a deeper RTS experience !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370945">Expand</a></span>

The single player campaign is long with the story unfolding mainly through cut scenes and missions spreading across war torn Europe. On top of this is multiplayer that  includes several different modes and a large number of maps to play on. Several factions each with there own units and unique advantages add a lot more variety to the game but can sometimes make matches turn into &apos;rock, paper, scissors&apos; game, which can sometimes just mean impending doom for a team. Along with the other two modes is challenge mode, including single player and co-op mission that pit you against greater odds with often limited resources, although this mode is lacking missions compared with the other two more has since been added with dlc.<br><br>Overall Ruse is a fresh look into the real time strategy genre being set on a grand scale and then bringing innovative new features this will keep you entertained for hours, although multiplayer is what will make you go back and play again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1375374">Expand</a></span>

Of course some call this a method or winning, I just call it an annoyance. When I was playing my friend, I found many &quot;Rush&quot; tactics that can not be stopped. For example, if one builds multiple airfields, he can keep spamming the airborne infantry squads to rush an enemy base. Also if your advisary keeps building an armor base for example, he&apos;s able to keep mass producing units until you break through. Aside from the massive rushing tactics, this game is a great new mix, I just wont be buying it anytime soon until the price tag drops.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371750">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are amazing and even the sound effects. I started playing SP to get the feeling of the game play (B/c its my first time) and i&apos;m getting better every time i play.<br>Thanks for the people who worked on making such a great game.</span>

This game is another game added to the very few of RTS games which actally requires proper brains of the player rather than someone who the fastest at base building and spamming the other player with 1 type of certain unit.. The game also moves at a nice slow pace allowing the player not to get caught up in any rushing by other players which is great for people which like to properly defend and attack locations aswell as being a great way to invite players which are not as experienced from being donimated in 5 mins by a 15 year old child who plays the game for 15 hours a day. Anyone who complains about the slow pace only really belongs in the kiddy mainstream &quot;so-called RTS&quot; like command &amp; conquer. On the realism topic regarding this game there is just 1-2 complaints however ive been able to look past these. One of these is the soldiers fade in and out of a appearing truck for all their movements incudling the airboune which is alittle bit of a shame considering the soldiers generally do move much slower in a combat field. The other complaint is that there is no location damage on tanks such as the rear of a tank being more venerable to the front and sometimes they drive the speed of a racing car. Apart from these minor complaints regarding the game we have a game here which should keep the realism people happy aswell as the people who dont want total realism. Im only taking off 1 point because of the minor complaints but asides from that great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1377851">Expand</a></span>

You don&apos;t micromanage troops. Eisenhower, Montgomery et al didn&apos;t sit there thinking &quot;we need 12 men in that foxhole over there facing south west &quot;..that&apos;s TACTICS..this game is STRATEGY. RTS as a genre is badly named.
<br>Ok this game offers strategy. a great rock paper scissors dynamic and excellent subterfuge twist. Having the right balance of troops in the right place a tthe right time will win you the game not the number of times you can click &quot;repair&quot; or &quot;make new unit&quot; or &quot;harvest this resource&quot; and then double click a location. It&apos;s not a ten though. There are turn based games that o this better, but it&apos;s great to have a real time, STRATEGIC, game that actually requires more thought than reflexes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1999371">Expand</a></span>

And lets be honest, Starcraft 2 is the same gameplay it was 10 years ago.
<br>
<br>R.U.S.E. is a fresh update to the series, the likes that we haven&apos;t seen since Company of Heroes. Those who complain there is no micro managing are those who didn&apos;t play the game, or didn&apos;t play it enough to understand how complex the game really is.
<br>
<br>In this game, you get abilities called RUSE, which are abilities you activate such as a spy in an area who will report any enemies he sees in the area. There is the decoy army, which you can say to send a fake air force to fly at the enemy and they will shoot at them. Combine this with your real army, and the enemy wont know the fake units from the real units, thus increasing the survivability of the real units.
<br>
<br>Thrown on top is the balance the game throws in. There is no ultimate unite, such as we see in the Command and Conquer franchise. You start off with building your base, whether it be Anti Tank, Infantry, Artillery, Tanks, or Air Base. Nothing is so powerful that there isn&apos;t a good unit to take it out. AT are ineffective vs infantry, yet infantry are easily taken out by anti air, which are easily taken out by tanks, etc etc etc.
<br>
<br>Not to mention you need to manage unit upgrades, such as upgrading from being able to build tiger tanks, to king tiger tanks. Or from being able to build B-25 bombers, to B-17 bombers.
<br>
<br>Another great aspect of this game is the amount of nations you can be, and how they are all very different from each other. Britain has a good amount of air power, Germany has some of the best anti tank capabilities, the French have some of the best defense structures, and so forth and so forth.
<br>
<br>This game also requires a lot of strategy, which is one reason I think people have a hard time with it. Remember to hide units like artillery and anti air in towns so the enemy cant find them as easy, remember to keep air recon units up so you can spot incoming enemies and targeting them, and knowing when to use choice points like bridges to set up ambushes.
<br>
<br>Forrest and Cities are your best friends for sneaking up on enemies and place ambushes. Place anti air in the forest, and then place AT guns and Infantry in cities, and ambush enemies on their way to you.
<br>
<br>The game doesn&apos;t have as much micro managing as other RTSes, but it requires a lot more strategy. It adds a sense of realism in how you would command a military as opposed to just doing rush tactics, which don&apos;t work by the way. People who like this are the people who like games like Company of Heroes, and Iron Hearts 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458940">Expand</a></span>

Complaining the AI is &quot;too smart&quot; when there are multiple difficulty levels and you can even set the enemies style of play is an amateur comment. Also, there is a wide variety of map sizes enabling you to have 10 minute games, or two hour epics depending on your mood. And with a 25 minute time limit on ranked games anyway, the pacing can hardy be pinned as dull. Some of these critics need to be sent to their own office for review and play the games properly before their higher valued opinion is allowed to bias the scores of genuinely innovative games such as R.U.S.E.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1454753">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pour ceux qui desirent un apercu du jeu, je tiens a dire que le jeu deborde de critiques ( bonnes comme mauvaises )
<br>Pour ce qui est des points n&#xC3;&#xA9;gatifs :
<br>
<br>- Une campagne beaucoup trop courte en mode solo ( J&apos;avoue ne pas avoir chercher si une extension etait de sortie.. gratuite ou non .. )
<br>
<br>- La synchronisation de certaines parties fait d&#xC3;&#xA9;faut on peut vite se retrouver  a 1 contre 3  en multiplayers du fait d&apos;un petit bug, il vaut mieux etre equip&#xC3;&#xA9; d&apos;une bonne connection.
<br>
<br>- Chose bete, le nombre de joueurs .. Ruse est un jeu qui se developpe mais cela peut etre lassant d&apos;attendre le lancement d&apos;une partie pendant quelques minutes..
<br>
<br>- Pour les Hardgamers, l&apos;abscence d&apos;une league E-sport..
<br>
<br>Les points positifs :
<br>
<br>- La vision du jeu est juste exceptionnelle ( Zoom ), pouvoir voir l&apos;animation des differentes unit&#xC3;&#xA9;s au plus pr&#xC3;&#xA9;s est un plaisir. ( Plaisir limit&#xC3;&#xA9; en multiplayers ou vous n&apos;avez pas le temps de prendre du temps, tellement il faut etre r&#xC3;&#xA9;actif :) )
<br>
<br>- La strat&#xC3;&#xA9;gie : Pour ceux qui n&apos;appr&#xC3;&#xA9;cient pas du fait de la lenteur du jeu, je dirais plutot que le jeu est m&#xC3;&#xAA;me trop rapide. On parle de strat&#xC3;&#xA9;gie, les nations propos&#xC3;&#xA9;es disposent chacune de qualit&#xC3;&#xA9;s differentes et c&apos;est ce qui en fait un jeu a part entiere. ( nous ne sommes plus dans la version GDI / NOD de command and conquer ) - L&apos;origninalit&#xC3;&#xA9; des ruses permettant de rendre une partie encore plus attrayante.
<br>
<br>- La vari&#xC3;&#xA9;t&#xC3;&#xA9; des unit&#xC3;&#xA9;s.
<br>
<br>- Le jeu dispose de nombreux modes de combat &quot;escarmouche&quot; dans lequel on trouve differentes sp&#xC3;&#xA9;cificit&#xC3;&#xA9;s selon le mode.. Ce qui permet de ne pas tomber sur un type de jeu st&#xC3;&#xA9;r&#xC3;&#xA9;otyp&#xC3;&#xA9;. Non il ne suffira pas de &quot;rusher&quot; avec une dizaine de tanks&quot;, non il ne suffira pas de faire une dizaine de tours defensives pour stopper une attaque. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1463167">Expand</a></span>

The use of ruses didnt really help much, as the ones that i used did nothing against the AI. The graphics are awesome, though. This game has a good concept, but it should be integrated with more easily-accessible RTS gameplay mechanics for it to be a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1376548">Expand</a></span>

I admit I liked the idea of yet another WW2 RTS, but after trying the beta, I was not impressed. Last week I tried the demo and was impressed enough to buy the game. But I am no longer impressed. The idea is sound. Build your units and crush the enemy. The units are well-chosen, but I found that they had maddening limitations. Why can&apos;t anti-tank units not even FIRE on infantry? I understand the need for balance, but an anti-tank position being destroyed by grenade throwing infantrymen just standing there does not make sense. The &quot;gimmick&quot; of the game, the RUSEs are poorly implemented. They hide or reveal friendly/enemy units and offer some help, but not a lot. I found that I did not use them unless ordered in the campaign. And the campaign itself is another problem. I don&apos;t even want to begin with the historical inaccuracies (not to mention an officer wearing Captain&apos;s bars to whom a Major is apparently superior) Leaving the campaign aside, the skirmish maps offer some fun, but the AI is either too smart or too dumb. Your team AI grabs all your supply depots and enemy AI seems to have heavy tanks immediately. But that&apos;s just my opinion. If you want to try a moderately different recent RTS that is not SC2, it may be worth it.  I have not played multiplayer, so I have no comments on that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1373515">Expand</a></span>

The war playing is realistic too and the units movement is easy and effective. I strongly recommend it as one of the best strategy games ever.</span>

It fails as a single player campaign or skirmish game for me. Storyline, WWII, so nothing original there at all to keep the interest. So lazy. The tutorials are built into the campaign, which I really dislike. As the campaign progresses, you get more options. Seriously, why 5 levels down the road am I now only getting a new unit to use. Why not all options from the outset - if you were serious about keeping it realistic, then give me units that existed at that time? The maps may look 3D with mountains and all, but they are flat in gameplay terms, you can&apos;t go over anything, not even into towns. And your units increase in viewing size as you zoom out (until draught type icons for top zoom), so you feel like your moving monsters around, not real size units. Viewing close then far is smooth, but on far your units become draught pieces. Supreme Commander had the same type idea. The problem with that? Well, who are you suppose to be in the game, the unit on the ground fighting, or the commander in HQ looking at a map and moving around pieces of wood for tanks. I just don&apos;t like that at all, be one character or the other, and when you choose one, your control over what the other character can do is minimal. And finally, the Ruses, e.g. how is seeing the enemy units a ruse - isn&apos;t that what spotter planes do? I just could not get into this game at all, it made me think of Sudden Strike, how good that was and that was 2001. or Panzsers (2004 release) where you cared about the main single unit (usually the captain). Alas, RUSE just didn&apos;t have a storyline character to care about, and a look and feel that was smooth but lacking grit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2671987">Expand</a></span>

It has the right balance of Macro managing and Micro managing.   Some other RTS&apos;s such as Starcraft have too much hero and unit management and while that isn&apos;t bad, its just not my style of managing an army.<br><br>What makes RUSE great is the game mechanic.  Units are highly detailed in specs, from Range, Speed, Multiple weapons (each weapon has a different damage output per type of target and range), Armor, and Target types.  So you can imagine that it will take some time to really master RUSE.  The lvl cap is 100, but levels don&apos;t necessarily indicate skill, but does give a hint to experience.  However, to better gage skill is to look at one&apos;s RUSE hours played on Steam.<br><br>The map choices are great.  Some maps are arena style, and just a few are historical style.  Most maps are fair and symmetrical, but when you want something different, you can play D-Day, where it isnt necessarily a fair positioning.  A strategy of one of the defense positions on this map could result in falling back to survive, instead of defending your position as this position is set up for a double team to begin with.<br><br>The IRISzoom engine is beautiful.  Zooming in and out is a pleasure as there are no pop-in textures and everything is super smooth.  Units turn into stacks of pins as if you were looking at a war map.<br><br>I&apos;m lovin RUSE and I&apos;ve gotten over 300 hours in so far with much more to come.<br>Looking forward to European Escalation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1938240">Expand</a></span>
