The graphics, beautiful. The Free running, excellent, some tweaks made to improve it, and endless fun to be had. The story, FANTASTIC, and WAY better than Assassins creed 1. There is more to do, and a wider, more diverse range of directions to go, so it is not the same things over and over again. And the events that are taking place interest you and draw you in. The Combat system remains largely unchanged, but larger scale of enemy difficulties makes for some more challenging and often more enjoyable fights. And I love the cash aspect of this game. Instead of just having a sword and a dagger, the ability to buy and upgrade weapons, to save for the next one, is great! Plus the ability to upgrade the Villa (Sort of home town) in order to gain more revenue is good as. So, based purely on playing the game itself, i give it a 10. I give Ubisoft a 0 for trying their hardest to lose as many customers as they can, but admittedly they&apos;ve put out a damn good game. I will add that this is an obvious console port, with the menu better controllable with keys, as well as the game telling you to press the &quot;hand&quot; key rather than the shift key (the HUD has an Xbox button style diamond like in Assassins Creed 1, with images corresponding to each button on an Xbox controller). Once you get past this, and the keys become muscle memory, you will have no more issues with it. I would give it 9.5/10 but there&apos;s no such option so I&apos;m rounding up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747805">Expand</a></span>

Still, after a remap and learning the controls, it&apos;s a very easy thing to go off flying across rooftops and enjoying the scenery of Italy.</span>

Great main storylinethat builds Ezio from his womanizing care-free beginnings into the iconic assassin of the order. Various ways to complete objective even if gameplay is linear. Would have liked different endings depending on how you complete objectives. Gameplay mechanics improved from the original, but a more intelligent and agressive AI would have been ideal and felt like a cake walk. Music by Jesper Kyd is phenomenal. (as always)

<br>Straight up combat is still a weak point in the game, but they increased the fun factor by providing more means to avoid it like hiring thieves, using smoke bombs, creating a distraction by throwing money, strategically placing corpses, and assassinating targets from distance with a pistol.

Every single aspect of the story is very well made and the near-end plot twist is awesome, from beginning to end it is interesting and keeps you immersed. The graphics are good but there is space for improvement, Assassin&apos;s Creed had amazing graphics and I feel this is just the same graphics with little or no improvement. The overall sound is amazing with a great soundtrack which is also great to play with an instrument and some excellent sound effects as well as top voice acting. The platforming is way faster and better in many ways such as the gameplay that has you always interested. You can get about 12 hours out of this game and even though the replay value is not much I had the desire to play it again, which I did. Now to the part everyone hated, the Ubisoft DRM is something that has people really mad, but I had surprisingly no problems with this. Overall you should get this game though you should be really careful about the DRM for mac users the best option is buying it in the mac app store and but I think overall the best thing you could do is get it for console, yet its worth a try on PC/Mac.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509608">Expand</a></span>

The cities are beautiful and they really feel alive. The medieval theme looks and feels really nice. There is quite a load of content in this game with plenty of things to do besides the pretty long main quest. Managing your estate is a fun but shallow distraction. The  vehicle sections are pretty fun. The acrobatics looks cool and feels fluid when everything works. The game feels overall really competent and you get a a nice amount of content for your money.. But sadly it does have some problems. The combat is quite awful and feels static, repetitive and boring. The ridiculous amount of healing items you can carry around also makes it extremely unchallenging and tedious. The climbing and acrobatics in this game works for the most part quite well and it really fun to use. The one-button for everything system in the game is however not flawless and sometimes the game will misinterpret your actions which is never any fun. A long campaign is always nice and this games have one. What is less nice however is that the campaign contains a lot of really boring filler missions that only serve to drag out the game a hour or two. Some other annoyances are bad jumping puzzles, lack of interesting side characters, strange difficulty-curve, terrible stealth-missions, terrible stealth-mechanics, unsatisfying assassinations and lets not forget everything Desmond related. I might sound really negative but i did enjoy my time with the game and i would definitely recommend buying this game for a cheap price if you think the concept sounds interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3020095">Expand</a></span>

I will agree with the multitude of people who complain that it is pretty shoddy, but the game itself, not counting the DRM, is a true masterpiece<br>The storyline is highly involving and intricate, the time setting couldn&apos;t really have been more appropriate and I found Renaissance Italy a very interesting setting to work from.The graphics are fantastic, and even though the system requirements are a bit beefy, I couldn&apos;t help every once in a while climbing a viewpoint simply to stand there and gaze at the surrounding cityline.<br>A major aspect of the first game was the non-linear style of play, which I loved. This has been very nicely updated and improved in the sequel, which a vast range of side-missions to complete, as well as having entire cities to roam around almost freely, allowing you to decide  when to complete a main objective; you can go and rush through the main story if you want or leave it out until you&apos;ve had some fun with it.<br>The fighting system, freerunning and climbing aspects, the largest parts of the game, have been improved very nicely, with more freedom as to how you can conduct yourself about the city. The in-depth and well-explored characters also allow the player to feel immersed in the game. All of this makes for a game that can be replayed again and again and will always feel a little different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602295">Expand</a></span>

The controls are easy to use and you can bind abilities to different keys if you feel the need to do so.<br>The graphics are great and at medium to max settings with anti-aliasing, look better than the console equivalent due to the vastly superior shadows and lighting.  I do however feel sad that the PC version has ended up getting low user scores because of DRM, because the game itself is great. All in all, it&apos;s a great game and is now available very cheaply.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2082829">Expand</a></span>

You can ! Wanna look for collectibles ? You can, i would say this is one of the best and safe buy of AC&apos;s game i did, you will be able to visit Venice and Florence, and as for me which i listened to the entire game made in Italian was feeling like real.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2308680">Expand</a></span>

I started out very excited, especially after the strong finish of the first one.  I jumped right into this one.  About 2/3 the way through though, I encountered the timed platforming challenges.  Make it through a platforming puzzle before the gate closes.  Usually fun, and challenging.  Fighting with the controls and the fixed control camera, is not fun.  The combat started getting more heavy, as you&apos;d expect and this issue started to rear it&apos;s ugly head more, as my timing was confounded by a cinematic swing that ended up behind a bush, tree or NPC.  I can only assume this is a terrible PC port.  I&apos;m guessing the console folks had better control of the camera.  Had to take quite a few points off, because I had to quit the game a couple times out of frustration, and started becoming eager for the end of the game.  That being said, the game did finish off strongly, with an intriguing addition to the story line for the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3760240">Expand</a></span>

The world is literally HUGE and there is a bare minimum of 45-50 hours of gameplay.  I have played it twice now and it works out slightly differently each time so there is definite replay value here.  There is an enormous amount to do and if you do everything in each city you could probably push your experience out to 60 or 70 hours.  What I really enjoyed in this game was the wealth of historical data you can access about Renaissance Italy - so you not only have a fantastic gaming experience but also learn a great deal about the environment in which you play.  The only downside to this game is some of the controls especially when doing the puzzle/treasure hunts.  Getting Ezio to jump the right way can sometimes be an exercise in frustration and as a result can cause you to take a hell of a long time to complete the mission - however once you do the sense of satisfaction is significant as you feel you have cracked a really difficult problem.  Therefore as frustrating as they may be I would not take the easy route and skip them even though if you become desperate you can do so as they don&apos;t really affect the storyline.
<br>
<br>In short they really pulled out all the stops on this one and if it wasn&apos;t for some of the frustrating controls in the puzzle/treasure hunts I would give it a 10.  Pick it up you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933713">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 serves as the direct sequel to the first game, continuing the storyline of Altair but mostly of his descendant, Ezio Auditore.
<br>
<br>The story takes place during the Renaissance period of Italy, which feels refreshing away from the Holy Land, where sand dunes and plain terrain is the environment most of the time.
<br>
<br>Note that Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 varies a slight bit from AC1, with a few better improvements, as well as bringing back some of the issues that i had problem with.
<br>
<br>Pros (8):
<br>
<br>(Primary) + Significant general improvements over AC1.
<br>
<br>+ Graphical changes were significant, the game looks much more detailed, lifelike and just more vibrant overall.
<br>+ Even detailed character modelling returns.
<br>+ Repetitive missions are gone! All primary missions, if not most, will always be different. Long gone are the days where doing the same reptitive task leads to the completion of the mission.
<br>+ Storyline is even longer and better. Game no longer ends randomly on a cliffhanger, like some sort of lousy movie film.
<br>+ At least 30ish hours of gameplay. Considered a long duration for a singleplayer story-mode game.
<br>+ No game stability issues, did not crash time during the whole of 28 hours of in-game session.
<br>+ More checkpoints, leading to lesser frustration when dying, crashing, etc.
<br>+ Side missions now serves a function, such as obtaining a cape for collecting a certain amount of feathers.
<br>
<br>Cons (2):
<br>
<br>- Artificial Intelligence coding STILL feels choppy, but is improved, enemies to retaliate more often and are more aware of their surroundings.
<br>-Game mechanic seems worse than before. Scaling walls and performing parkours in general, feels choppier and rough.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend playing the first game and follow the series on a chronological order. And if you loved the first AC game, you would definitely love this one.

Having played it in June 2014, I can say I didnt have any issues except a few minor bugs.

<br>The game itself is great. I got 100% completion in about 50 hours. The gameplay can be repetitive and boring at times, but the storyline keeps things interesting. I couldnt play in long sessions however because the controls were just absolutely awful. I played with a mouse+keyboard initially, but gave up and stopped playing the game. I came back months later and played with an xbox 360 controller in steam. it worked a lot better, but it was still frustrating at times lining jumps up right, etc. Many times I&apos;d jump off a building and he&apos;d go in a totally different direction.
<br>
<br>So overall, this is a great game but hampered by agitating controls and repetitive gameplay. It does improve vastly upon the first Creed, and I would recommend it for under $10. Steam has it on sale every now and again for pretty cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326202">Expand</a></span>

Why do i not have a problem with the DRM? I gave up on Ubisoft and downloaded a work around. It worked, to say the least. Now then, as for the game itself: There&apos;s no repetitivity like the first game, every mission felt fresh and fun throughout. It took me, according to my stats, 25 hours to get to the end of the game, and i missed out the side missions, which there are plenty of, albeit repetitive, so you&apos;re getting your money&apos;s worth. I had a lot of fun with the game, i&apos;d highly recommend it if not for the DRM. The voice acting is superb, the graphics are nice, although much like the first game. The addition of money to spend on equipment, health &quot;packs&quot;, clothing, paintings, or just to invest in your huge villa is fantastic. The &quot;notoriety system&quot; seems like a work in progress, or a half arsed effort. Every large scale murder, or fight or socially unacceptable action will increase your notoriety, making guards identify you as an assassin faster, which will provoke a fight. That&apos;s all well and good, but the ways of lowering it are ridiculous. You can tear down a poster, located in an area the general public will never see, clearly just to give a free running aspect to it. 4 posters will clear your name completely. Or you can murder a &quot;corrupt guard&quot; which will clear 75% of your nororiety. Needs quite a clean up, but it&apos;s a fresh change to the game. Now for the downsides: For a start, the PC version is quite clearly a console port in every way. The controls are terrible in some places, such as having to repeatedly tap shift when using the Gondola (boat). Anyone with a PC knows that hammering the shift key boots you to the dektop because of the sticky keys nonsense.The lack of advanced graphical options is ridiculous. There&apos;s just &quot;setting 1, 2, 3, 4&quot; for about 5 options. No way to edit .ini files either, because Ubisoft don&apos;t respect their PC customers (clearly indicated by the DRM...). Also, some options won&apos;t save your settings, such as subtitles on, or inverted controls, etc. There&apos;s also the terrible physics engine, just like the first game. If you kill a guard on a slanted rooftop, his body will stiffen in the air, before the physics engine kicks in and his body slops down the side of the roof. Throwing an enemy off a building will result in the body bouncing and flipping around. The terrible AI, like the first game is still there, with guards getting stuck on railings, preventing their friends from climbing that point and pursuing me. The flying machine was a horrible disappointment, as was the the pistol attachment. It takes around 3 seconds to line up the shot, then after firing will increase your notoriety by 10% (explained above) and takes around 2 seconds to reload. Bullets cost 175 florins each, and you can only hold 6 at a time. Considering how loud and impractical the gun is, not to mention the huge cost, it makes other weapons far more viable options. Throwing knives, for example, are 50f each, and have a capacity of 20, not to mention the extremely fast throwing speed. The story is also quite deranged, while at the same time, interesting. (i&apos;ve tried not to include any spoilers)The main problem i had with it is that it spans over the course of 23 years, yet none of the characters age at all. The protagonist should be in his mid 40&apos;s, yet looks the same as his late teens. The only character change is near the very end of the game, where the protagonist gains some stuble...wow. If you don&apos;t mind terrible DRM, lack of customisation options and a terrible engine (bwah hahahahahaha) then it&apos;s worth giving the game a go for the fantastic gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747690">Expand</a></span>

<br>Secondly, the graphics really shine, even 5 years after the game was released.
<br>And thirdly, the game play itself is so much smoother. Ezio plays as a dream, he is not only a skillful assassin, but also a more than decent swords fighter. One important remark: it is highly recommended to play this game on pc using an analog game-pad. It helps a lot, really.
<br>For the rest: don&apos;t hesitate, even after all these years, this still is a real masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4174872">Expand</a></span>

Combat is unchanged, if not worse than the first Assassin&apos;s Creed, so it&apos;s still by far the worst combat I&apos;ve come across in this genre. Free running is stupidly boring and unsatisfying, never mind how little to no skill there is in holding down two buttons. However, if you can ignore the pointless complications of the modern day story which confused us all at the end of the first game you&apos;ll find an open-world adventure game which unlike the first game, packs the content to be classed as a GTA clone done properly. Side missions are not as repetitive, collectibles are far more rewarding and satisfying to get, let alone more varied. There are more RPG elements but without the unnecessary complications which accompany them. The devolpers haven&apos;t made stupid decisions with this game, but they have made it a proper free-roam game with a decent story, good length and side missions and well-designed towns. The graphics aren&apos;t anything special even when maxxed out, but they are still pretty good and stand up to inspection. All in all Assassin&apos;s Creed II has the credentials of a solid action-adventure free roam game, but unfortunately the gameplay mechanics are archaic and outdated, sometimes even buggy. If you want gameplay and level design consider Arkham Asylum, but if you want an immersive game Assassin&apos;s Creed II is better in every way. It&apos;s just a shame that it excels in everything but the most important element of a game- the GAMEPLAY. That said though, it&apos;s targeted towards a more casual audience who want more of a cinematic experience rather than intense and skillful gameplay as seen in Arkham Asylum. I guess this is more for the passive gamer rather than someone who really appreciates a solid combat system and will analyse every inch of level design. If you are a hardcore gamer chances are you won&apos;t enjoy this game very much because it&apos;s quite boring to play. A nice break though if you want something which is effortless and almost not even a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2582718">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft seems to have learned a lot from the many problems AC1 had. Despite issues with the camera changing its angle at the most inopportune time, resulting in several keyboard-smashing moments, the controls, combat and gameplay are infinitely more enjoyable than the first game. Ezio is a compelling character who we really get to know over the course of the game. Best of all, I was always kept wanting to see what would happen next in the story. The variety of missions keeps things interesting, and the soundtrack is simply incredible- one of the best in any game I&apos;ve played. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good story with substance and mystery.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2539128">Expand</a></span>

Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 expands on all the aspects of the original - the cities are bigger, the activities are more varied, you&apos;ve got WAY more gadgets, the game itself is longer and the plot now spans over thirty years. The storyline puts us in the feet of Ezio Auditore - a young Florentine noble who loses his family shortly into the game. On our course for revenge we meet lots of important historical figures of that era (and kill some of them) and explore beautifully reconstructed cities of Florence, Venice and a couple of smaller towns. Collectible hunting has become more reasonable, and you should definitely check the Glyphs - collecting all of them will reveal quite a shocking &quot;The Truth&quot; video, which plays an important role in the franchise&apos;s mythology. (or you can just watch it on youtube, why) The only thing that game drops the bar at is the graphics. They&apos;re noticeably worse than in the original, and that&apos;s somewhat of a letdown. All in all, Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 is a well-made game, which retains the original&apos;s flaws, like the somewhat dull and easy combat system and drops of pace - I&apos;ve played it for several weeks and then had to take a break from it for almost a year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2727650">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To summarise, this game is a juicy T-Bone steak.....With a sticky cat poo on top! Good game with a broken DRM system (Broken save sync). System lock every time i played, and missing game save progress wore me down until i was utterly sick of replaying what started out as a enjoyable game with good story line.
<br>
<br>It doesnt matter how good the steak is. Its impossible for the cat poo not to ruin what should have been a gaming feast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2537491">Expand</a></span>

Still, PC version isn&apos;t bad, and It&apos;s fun for a while. 78 out of 100.</span>

I played it quite late, which on the bright side allowed me to take advantage of my modern PC to enjoy a really smooth experience in high resolution, which is very immersive (and impressive).

<br>
<br>Ezio is a great character and the gameplay is somewhat enjoyable and the setting nice to look at, for some time. Should the main story take several hours less to complete and expand on its working gameplay mechanics, Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 doesn&apos;t really inspire me to check out any of the other games.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t see the charm in the underlining scifi story with Desmond and Animus. Most of the time it only distracts you from the characters and environments you actually care about and even restricts the openness of the game: you cannot enter this area because Ezio doesn&apos;t remember this area or Ezio had these collectables when this memory occured. When the scifi story is actually developed, it is rushed and feels like a forced cliffhanger so that the Assassin&apos;s Creed games have some continuity. I decided not to care about the scifi story and enjoy assassinating people as Ezio. If only it could have ended sooner (and had a better ending, for that matter).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3256817">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The whole game is designed for the console though so the control scheme on KB/M is pure **** (unless you want to kill your left pinky), couldn&apos;t play it without a controller, though I prefer playing action games with a controller so I was OK with it. Graphics is optimised for the console so if you don&apos;t have a 16:9 monitor you get a letterbox on the screen...Well, what did I expect from Ubisoft?
<br>
<br>If you are going to play just one AC game, this is it. But you don&apos;t have to go through the collectibles since they are pointless time wasters. Just go through the story and you&apos;re done with the game. I really don&apos;t like the collectibles for achievements trend, to be honest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6539550">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I played AC1 years ago and sort of forgot how I felt about it at the time. I remember only that I was interested enough to play AC2, but that I also got really, really, really really BORED. AC1 was a good example of an open world game that lacked gameplay. Lots of stuff to see, lots of atmosphere to take in, lots of spirit and effort, but no transition of the character&apos;s struggle to the player through difficult or fun gameplay mechanics.
<br>
<br>In less verbose, AC1 wasn&apos;t hard and wasn&apos;t fun. It was a long winded and repetitive, but still an enthralling visit to the Holy Land of the Crusade&apos;s times.
<br>
<br>Guess what? AC2 is exactly the same. Running on rooftops, escaping guards, trying to assassinate without being discovered first, failing, killing 50 guards with nothing but your sword, it&apos;s all the same.
<br>
<br>Setting changes, we&apos;re in Renaissance Italy, and there&apos;s a loooootta more guards on the roof than I remember seeing in AC1. And of course the architecture and world appearance are all changed.
<br>Florence/Firenze looks beautiful, and Venice may be the most beautiful open world city I&apos;ve ever seen in terms of style, effort and realism.
<br>
<br>So the beautiful interactive tourism postcard principle still holds very true. And since Renaissance Italy wasn&apos;t a time of war like the Crusades, the cities have a lot of beautiful buildings and less military ones. So overall, it&apos;s a plus in every way.
<br>
<br>However while it bettered its predecessor in almost every way(except perhaps slightly less realism, so no more crossing the entire holy land to get to a new city, instead we get fast teleports from city to city), and it mended some of the worst aspects of it, namely the missions are more diverse and thus repetition is less strong, it didn&apos;t fix them.
<br>
<br>The three sins of AC2:
<br>-the combat
<br>-the parkour controls
<br>-the repetition
<br>
<br>Combat is just like the last one. It&apos;s still very slow, very hit-and-pray or wait-and-counter, and it still sucks HARD. I need to stress this, I had moments where I literally wanted to yell at my screen &quot;ATTACK ME ALREADY&quot; to some guards. I&apos;d like to say that the addition of the new smoke bomb, throwing knives and poison blade help, but they absolutely don&apos;t. They&apos;re either pointless(poison blade), or just serve to make an easy game easier without adding any fun(knives and smoke). No aiming and no skills required, too.
<br>The only really novel gameplay addition is the gun, which does diversify gameplay, and has only 6 bullets, so you use it little and it makes every shot precious.
<br>
<br>Parkour controls are just too simple, and thus make you **** up. Not only a is a two-button system boring to play(you just keep your fingers pressed or not for 20 hours), but it can very often lead to VERY unpleasant consequences, like flinging yourself off a building or missing a ledge by 10cm and falling to lose half your health. I think the game would immensely gain from a run, jump, grab main system of 3 buttons, rather than a run, jump/grab system. You&apos;d actually press buttons and get a feel for your controls, and not get any more infuriating falls.
<br>
<br>Repetition, what can I say. It was bad in AC1. I forgot how bad it was, but let me tell you, I finished AC2 with 95% or 96% done; in 25 hours. All paintings, statues, renovation, shops at max, weapons, armors, Assassin Seals, everything but the 100 feathers collectathon. If I had avoided all that, you&apos;d think that the game would be a lot shorter and less tedious, right? Well no. That was the stuff I did to diversify my entertainment. Because AC2 is still 15% bad combat, 70% simplistic parkour, and 15% choosing your route to reach a target, an item, or an objective. Little got me more annoyed in AC2 than being teleported back to Venice, which has some really voluntarily complicated level design, to see that the game put me 350 meters away from my target and that I have to go up the roofs again, cross the city again, hold down two buttons again, for 5 good minutes if I&apos;m fast. This repetition of the same tasks that you never get really good at, because they&apos;re all simple unless the controls destroy you, they weigh tremendously heavily on the player. I just got so bored. So hard. Past 12 hours I was a little tired, past 17, I was begging the game to end.
<br>
<br>Yet, I&apos;ll easily say that I was charmed by AC2. The production values that were poured into the cities, the level design, the Renaissance Italy style, the friendship with Leonardo Da Vinci and some others, even the story and plot of the series, which I don&apos;t regard very highly, it all wooed me. I completely fell for the interactive postcard, and although I got very bored, I know that I&apos;ll want to try Brotherhood at some point. There is a magic to AC2 that&apos;s certainly not in the gameplay, but in countless work hours that served to make this immersive, boring, memorable, and all in all enjoyable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6939809">Expand</a></span>

There were major improvements in this game. If you loved the first game (Assassin&apos;s Creed 1) you are going to love this one. Everything that you had in Assassin&apos;s Creed 1 is still here, just improved and a lot better.Running, climbing and the assassinations. This sequel fixes most of the flaws from Assassin&apos;s Creed 1. Bigger cities, better visuals and a better protagonist. Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 is better than the original. Just like the end of Assassin&apos;s Creed 1 was shocking, Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 is even more shocking. The setting takes place in the 15th Century Renaissance Italy. Throughout the whole game, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Your family are bankers and you soon find out to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Ezio is an assassin and you watch him age throughout the game and perfect his skills in every way. The story is much clearer. You get to use the Animus 2.0 to help you identify people, documents, locations and etc... This a free roam word. So you get to kill guards, pickpocket and hire mercenaries, courtesans and thief&apos;s. Ubisoft also added a day and night cycle, economic system to buy armor, weapons, paintings, maps, etc...There are definitely more combat moves than just strike and counter and definitely a lot more weapons and customization. The characters in the game make you express your emotions whether you feel overjoyed about a character, want to knife the character in the face, or tear a little. The story was not as repetitive as the first one. The story is very intriguing. I would give this game a rating of 92 out of 100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4290420">Expand</a></span>

AC2 puts you in the role of Ezio, a hot-headed charming lad turned assassin who we get to see develop and mature in a deeply personal story of revenge.
<br>
<br>Where AC1 suffered from crippling repetition in its side quests, AC2 rectifies this somewhat by including more variety within the side missions and in its locales. However, most of these turn out to be little more than diversions that don&apos;t really add much depth. They are still entertaining for the most part, but even in AC2 they still become slightly tedious and repetitive, their incentive being a little extra cash on the side. The glyphs are the exception to this, which provide a nice change of pace in gameplay with its puzzles, in addition to a little more backstory and lore to the game.
<br>
<br>When it comes to visuals, the game looks fairly decent. Standing on a tall tower and looking down upon the city of Florence certainly makes for an impressive scene. When the cutscenes come rolling in however, character models definitely leave much to be desired. What impresses me most about AC2 though is its setting and general atmosphere. I have to congratulate Jesper Kyd on the soundtrack because it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. It does a phenomenal job of imbuing a great sense of discovery, of true Renaissance Italy, and it is the main reason (at least for me) why the game remains so memorable over the years, because just listening to it gives me the fondest sense of nostalgia.
<br>
<br>Overall score - 8.5/10 (rounded down)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5140282">Expand</a></span>

Since most people liked to complain about the lack of variety in missions from the first one I&apos;m reluctant to say it hasn&apos;t improved a lot.

You have mostly assassinations, a few races and collectibles to find. What shines much more than its predecessor is the story, it flows much better, the narrative evolves more linearly, but in a cleaner pace. The controls are a mess but completely bindable, just go adjusting to whatever feels better and you should be fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5268949">Expand</a></span>

The game is very rewarding in each aspect and each mission seems unique in its own way. Story-wise, AC II will keep your attention up through the (roughly) 20-30 hours of game-play. You&apos;ll find it both exciting and also witty in many ways(I myself had to laugh a lot at some of the references used in the game), mostly due to the awesome protagonist: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Fantastic voice acting!
<br>
<br>The graphics are stunning, making the scenery of Italy absolutely enjoyable to watch. Unlike the first part, Assassin&apos;s Creed II makes the best of the franchises potential, leaving just enough space for better things  to come. A true masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5082302">Expand</a></span>

The Ezio trilogy made Assassin&apos;s Creed my most favourite game franchise. I will sure visit Italy in future and that will be only for three reasons - 1)This game, 2)Gladiator movie, 3)Home of supercars like Lamborghini and Ferrari.</span>

Takes best elements of it&apos;s predecessor and builds on it a great game.
<br>
<br>The game follows a story of Ezio Auditore - a character I found extremely annoying at first but learned to like by the end of a game. This time the story is set in renaissance era of Italy with action taking in a couple of Italian towns like Florence, Venice, Tuscany.
<br>
<br>Ezio is introduced a s reckless playboy character until both his father and brother are hanged for treason. Only then Ezio learns that his father was an assassin and begin his journey into the ranks of assassins. The story this time is a bit more linear than in the original Assassin&apos;s Creed but there is no lack of side activities to torment the completionists. Same as previously we follow the modern-time story of Desmond who re-lives the life of Ezio. And as previously the time spent outside the animus feels like totally necessary.
<br>
<br>Mechanics wise this game improves on original game in almost every aspect. Drops the tedious repetitive missions in favour of more catered story driven missions this time. Crowd blending has been vastly improved making it more natural than previously. Notoriety has been introduced which can be removed by bribes or taking down wanted poster. It is really fun trying to navigate through a town having highest notoriety with guards alerted to your presence if you&apos;re not careful enough. Combat was also refined giving a wider array of moves.
<br>
<br>Graphics hold up till this day - although you can tell the age when you&apos;re outside the town and it feels a bit empty. Inside cities however there&apos;s nothing to be picky about. The designs gives a good feel for the time period. The cities are well designed and fun to travel through either by foot or taking the rooftops.
<br>
<br>Overall a big improvement to the original one and a really fun game that still holds up very well. Definitiely worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6832551">Expand</a></span>

From what was supposed to be the great story you get a shadow of great story, quantity over quality and lack of consistency. Its still good and interesting, but there are some serious quality issues with all of this. Graphically thing is the same, cities are big and overall graphics looks quite nice and atmospheric, but LOD is so horrible that you can see very low quality textures changing into proper ones in front of your face. In terms of character design, some characters are well made, and some, like Catarina or Cristna, look like made on a knee 30 minutes before game release. Combat - the same, mixed bag. Ambitious, but like it usually happens with this kind of endeavors, you get quantity over quality and half of the rushed and unpolished. Overall I liked the game and I will have big sentiment for it, but this is just such a mixed bag of great and poor things...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6908830">Expand</a></span>

Combat system is very good, action is nearly perfect. After all, a great, great game that I&apos;ve played so far. But there is something make it not perfect: first,  the system requirements are too high, even on the very strong PC, there is still a lot of lag and glitch. Secondly,  requirement of  constant internet connection to play the game is annoying for people who have bad internet connection. A great work of Ubisoft, hope they can provide more in the next project. 9.0 points for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1573457">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Renaissance is one of the best times in AC series for now, lots of different locations, each with its unique sightseeings and interesting missions. It&apos;s hard to say why, but for some reason with every new part of AC we are going farther from silent kills and that kind of actions, more stupid submissions (( It&apos; sad. But the AC2 still has the soul of stealth.
<br>10 out of 10 - definitely

I remember I was finding myself rather bored during the first 4-5 memories (out of 14). The missions weren&apos;t interesting, the areas were bland and the story was taking too long to get started. However it does pick up eventually and gets much better and incredibly fun. There are about 5 cities in this game, which is slightly more than the first game, and it also made improvements on many aspects from the first game, like the climbing and stealthy combat. The face-on combat is pretty much the same (it was already great to begin with, so I guess no improvements were needed), except fist fighting has gotten significantly improved. The game is also a lot more diverse. There are a lot of areas to explore, a lot of side quests to do, and even various mini-tasks such as refurbishing one of the cities to the full. One could probably spend many hours playing this game. So AC2 is better than the first in many areas, including graphics, storyline, gameplay and perhaps even the background music too. But it has some drawbacks however. The controls for example, which were already one of the biggest flaws of the first game, are even harder now. I had to go back to the controls menu to check up on some of them even in late stages of the game. They are hard to memorise and they are also very inconvenient, forcing you to hold like 3-4 buttons at the same time just to run after someone, making chase parts of the game rather difficult. I was also not too fond of many of the side quests and such. They were bland and so I ended up mostly just playing the main story. AC2 is a good game. I am guessing because of controls issues it&apos;s not supposed to be played on PC, but on a console. My bro has it on Xbox360 and the controls issues are virtually non-existent, so I&apos;d probably advise you to get it on Xbox360 or PS3, not on PC, not to mention the killer graphics requirements the game has on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769827">Expand</a></span>

The DRM does not make the game any worse. I understand that your gaming experience can be ruined by the fact that you have a really spotty internet connection, but that&apos;s just the experience, not the game itself. When I bought this game, the first thing I noticed was the big box on the bottom that says &quot;Continuous Internet Connection Required.&quot; If you see that, don&apos;t buy the game. It&apos;s that simple. I completely disagree with Ubisoft for using the DRM, but don&apos;t let that detract from a great game. Now for my actual review:<br><br>I loved this game. It was MUCH better than Assassin&apos;s Creed. The combat itself hadn&apos;t improved all that much, though I really liked being able to use the hidden blades in combat, and the attachments that went with it. I particularly loved the fact that climbing wasn&apos;t as slow, as Ezio could climb swiftly if there was a clear path to the top.<br><br>What I was most impressed about was the story. In the original AC, you played as Alta&#xC3;&#xAF;r, who really had no character presence. He was just a blade with a voice, and you never really connected with him. However, Ezio was fantastic. His personality had so much depth, and as the story progressed, you really felt Ezio progress as well. Hats off to Ubisoft on this one, regardless of the DRM.<br><br>That being said, I give a 9/10, one point off for the numerous times that I would jump from a wooden beam, and automatically jump diagonally away from my destination.<br><br>To all those complaining about the DRM:<br><br>If you consider yourself a &quot;PC Gamer,&quot; you should really have a good internet connection. It&apos;s 2011, catch up with the times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488958">Expand</a></span>

I hear that the DRM is a bit of a killer for anyone who paid for the game. It seems Ubi have done exactly the opposite of what their DRM was supposed to do. When will these companies learn that no matter what they do to try and stop people cracking these games, the hackers will always find a way around it. All they do by introducing these DRM measures is to alienate the people who actually buy a legitimate copy. The pirates are rewarded for pirating since they do not need an internet connection to play, the game doesnt lock up and freeze when connection is lost and save games arent lost when the internet goes down, the crack takes care of all that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=747751">Expand</a></span>
