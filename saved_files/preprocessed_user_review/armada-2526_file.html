Th graphics are quite well done, the Music I find rather good too. That being said, where the game loses all of its potential is in its combat mechanics. Combat in Armada, does not hold up to the title&apos;s name. Very limited, in many ways frustrating even, and specially nothing like the Trailer, that was the biggest surprise for me. I was very disappointed. If you intend on playing all your battles with Auto-Resolve it can be fun for its other aspects. I hope they release a Combat mechanics Overhaul and make this game what it was supposed to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armada-2526/user-reviews?user_review_id=1647491">Expand</a></span>
