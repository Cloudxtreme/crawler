<br>What about the episode is the best that did Teltatle. Great ending, great stories.
<br>Thanks for all the emotions that you gave us!</span>

                                        <span>The Wolf Among Us is a masterpiece. For me, better than TWD by far. The action scenes, characters, art style, music, the Fables themselves, story and choices - AH! It all wraps up perfectly, and I really hope they&apos;ll make a second season of the Big Bad Wolf. Loving it, my favorite game from Telltale. 10/10.</span>

As a huge TWD fan and Fables fan I was very excited for this game and it definitely didn&apos;t disappoint . The characters are well written (in general) and the world is one which begs to be explored more. There are some nods to fans of the Fables books which are always appreciated. Like the TWD season 1 I&apos;ll definitely be replaying this.

                                        <span>The Wolf Among Us is a strange yet well accomplished new IP by Telltale games which rises to the levels of TWD. Amazing character development, intense crisis points, along with a great all round cast and dialog. Will leave this game as one of the most successful and satisfying games for 2014.</span>

In my opinion this episode is the best in the whole first season. You quickly find out who the killer is and spend much of the episode trying to finish solving the crime you have spent so long focusing on. This episode has plenty of actions and some of the hardest choices in any episode. The main problem for me was that this episode is extremely short. For $5, or less if you have the season pass, I would have liked for this to be more than 1 hour long. Here is the reason why many people as well as myself believe it is better than The Walking Dead: YOUR CHOICES ACTUALLY MATTER! In The Walking Dead you could choose to save people or let them die, but in the end it didn&apos;t really matter. The people would die later in the episode or die the next episode. In The Wolf Among Us some of the people you interact with can either die in the first, second, or third episode or still be alive through the end of season 1. Some choices are difficult, but for the most part this episode is well written and you are able to choose whether you want to be reasonable or turn into the big bad wolf. The ending leaves more questions than answers, but if you have enjoyed any other telltale games this is a must have and it won&apos;t disappoint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4348705">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. If you&apos;re not playing on PC, there&apos;s intermitent lagging.
<br>3. There are some choices, but gameplay can feel linear, a lot of choices lead to the same results, and game hold your hand in terms of find clues and stuff via showing delectables targets over items you can interact around. It might be better if game gave you a reasonable time limit when finding clues/searching for evidence and your lack of finding everything created different results. But maybe as a developer that might be too complex a thing to do, idk.
<br>
<br>Gonna close by saying TWAU was awesome. I liked it better than Walking Dead because it introduced a new universe that you couldn&apos;t find on TV (lord knows how many zombie themed shows/movies we&apos;ve seen recently). The big choices DO feel like big choices when you are making them, and the experience is like being part in an episodic shows ala Game of Thrones, True Detective, etc. I loved the universe, the art is beautiful, and the scripting gives every character some depth.
<br>
<br>I think Telltale is making some good interactive viewing for us video gamers, but they still have lots of room to grow. If Chrono Trigger on SNES can do 13 endings, they can do multiple endings too! Oh and I seriously suggest waiting for an entire season to come out before playing, I did so and playing through the entire season with some drinks nearby was nice :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4346099">Expand</a></span>

<br>(Well done Adam Harrington, Erin Yvette and Chuck Kourouklis). The gameplay is divided into 2 parts, solid and simple point and clicking with a few minor puzzles, and amazing QTE (Quick Time Event) fighting scenes against various Fable characters, you truly start to care about these characters, and what happens to them. and the hardest part is: You are the one who will choose what happens to them, your choices affect the story, and how the game will come to an end. This game will also most likely get you interested in buying the comic books this game is based on (Fables, made by Bill Willingham) I&apos;ve heard the comics are really good and I should get into reading them myself too. In the end, you might not get as much emotionally attached to the characters, like in &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; but the plot and the story is superb and the characters are all great and different with their own personalities.
<br>
<br>I will definetly recommend buying this game, especially if you liked the walking dead, If you see it on sale, and you&apos;re atleast a little interested. Buy it. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4340068">Expand</a></span>

The Wolf Among Us is a very different premise -- it&apos;s monsters as humans, their trials and tribulations as they find their way in our world, whilst dealing with dangers of their own.
<br>
<br>Bigby isn&apos;t the most eloquent protagonist to ever grace your ears with his gruff words, but that doesn&apos;t stop the overall story from start to finish from being an elegant one, proficiently told. Gripping, chilling, intelligent, and genuinely mature (as in, thinking, not boobies, since I know that word can go both ways). It has a sublime subtlety to it all that requires an observant watcher to catch all of its little tricks. It&apos;s clever, and it knows it, too. And it&apos;s of a tone and calibre that we don&apos;t see very often. It&apos;s a thriller, which isn&apos;t to say that it&apos;s a horror game, it isn&apos;t, it&apos;s something much smarter than that.
<br>
<br>It definitely isn&apos;t for everyone, and I feel that there&apos;s something of a deceit in the gore of the murders, since this isn&apos;t The Walking Dead. It&apos;s going to bore people of... a certain inclination, as it has no explosions, guns don&apos;t play a particularly large role, and it can be somewhat out there, for lack of a better term.
<br>
<br>Further, it doesn&apos;t fall into the pseudo-intellectual trap of being melancholy and without hope, for it&apos;s neither of those things. It&apos;s gritty, and it&apos;s so very real, and it&apos;s human, but there are no lost causes. Which isn&apos;t to say that thanks to the advanced system of choice and consequence in place you can&apos;t make lost causes, you absolutely can, but those aren&apos;t forced on you. And personally, I didn&apos;t choose to make them throughout my story, either. My tale was one of gazing into the darkness of life -- the greed, the xenophobia, the unabashed and shameless pursuit of self preservation -- but being pulled back from the precipice before slipping in by ethics, empathy, and compassion.
<br>
<br>For monsters, they can indeed be very human, in the best possible use of the word. And that&apos;s what makes Biby a great character, his supporting cast so engaging and compelling, and the whole experience so very enthralling, right up until the close of the last act.
<br>
<br>If you are so inclined, you won&apos;t be disappointed. Between The Walking Dead and the Wolf Among Us, I&apos;d pick the latter every time. After all, it is quite wolfamongous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4347301">Expand</a></span>

<br>I guess I expected a little more from this season when I played its superb first episode, but by now, I knew what the game was going for. Im somewhat thankful for being gradually let down by episodes 2 though 4; episodes 1 and 5 would feel like a completely different game written by completely different people otherwise.
<br>If it wasnt for episode 1, I wouldnt feel dissapointed, but as it is, I think this thing had a lot of potential, and didnt live up for it.

And if the parts weren&apos;t slow it was nearly impossible fighting scenes. But for the most part I liked it; I liked the Crooked Man, Nerissa and Vivian but season 2 isn&apos;t confirmed and may not happen.  So why the ending? It felt like Telltale was playing with us a bit.</span>

Other than that you get to play as the big bad wolf trying to solve the mystery of murdered fables making choices as you go. Ohhh that ending felt REALLY satisfying, well the one I choose anyway hahahaha.

<br>
<br>The spooky atmosphere is more present than the previous installments, particularly leading to the fight between Bigby Wolf and Bloody Mary. And that fight between them is truly exciting. There&apos;s more action in this part than the previous four.
<br>
<br>The directing of the fight and chase scenes is brilliant, as well as the voice acting, which really gave a great level of depth to the characters. And all thanks to Bill Willingham for the Fable comics and these characters and this world he built.
<br>
<br>All these things, along with the beautiful visuals and coloring, and the terrific soundtrack, have helped to create a gaming experience that i enjoyed more than any other in a very long time. Fantastic job, Telltale Games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4378113">Expand</a></span>

This game made me feel emotions I&apos;ve never felt even in my other favorite games. DEFINITELY A 10/10 and I recommend anyone to try it out. Great story, great concept, great feeling while playing it, great soundtrack, great environment and great characters. Tell tale, you&apos;ve done it again.</span>

The only complaint I have is the resolution with one of the minor antagonists, it was a missed opportunity for some great dialogue replaced instead with a visually impressive but ultimately shallow combat sequence. Nonetheless, I recommend this game to all who appreciate a good story well told.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343127">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, as lovely as it is to watch and follow, the level of interaction is pitiful. It&apos;s basically QTEs mixed with dialogue selections, nothing else. Ok, you can move Bigby around a room a little bit, and sometimes when you&apos;re in a fight sequence you might need to thumb a control stick in a particular direction, but overall the level of interactivity is lacking. I know huge fans of the game will say that it&apos;s all about how you respond to conversational dialogue and situations, but it never really feels like anything you do or choose to say will make any kind of difference to the on-rails script. Ok, in this episode there is one choice you need to make that impacts which way a certain character is dealt with, and I really enjoyed being asked to make such a moral decision. However, when I play a game, I want to feel like I&apos;m not just a spectator. I really hope that the player gets to do more in the environment and to alter the course of the narrative in future games. Probably a tall order, I know.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4369802">Expand</a></span>

The problem with a medium such as this is that choices often feel hollow, there are only so many different routes a game developer can allow and be able to carry on the main story-line but Telltale finds a way to make choices feel significant and give the player payoff in the end.
<br>
<br>Here lies the only flaw I found with the game, choices carry very little weight until much later in the game. In the end of Telltale&apos;s games you see a massive conversion of all decisions you have made, they effect how all characters respond to the conclusion and you are left with a detailed description of how your choices effected the game and its outcome. But it is disapointing choosing two completely different playstyles in the beginning and seeing every scene play out so similarly, often identically.
<br>
<br>Past that though, the game is fantastic. The Wolf Among Us is more engaging than the Walking Dead Season One for better or worse, more constant dialogue, objects in the environment and plenty of QTE&apos;s which I find to suite this genre well. The interface that handles all of these things looks fantastic as well and blends into the comic-book art design the rest of the environment has.
<br>
<br>With this game you get an interactive story with a great payoff. The ending will leave you wondering how things could have played out differently, the story is well done and certainly worth the ride and the game is beautiful. The only thing that could irk some is the grind, feeling like none of your choices matter until too far into the game where they already feel bored.
<br>
<br>All in all, a 9/10 and a solid recommend. If you find it on sale and love story-driven adventures, buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4365972">Expand</a></span>

As usual, every chapter including this one has no more than 4 or 5 *real* choices, and all the rest is just there for flavour, to give you the illusion of making an actual impact when the plot is advancing on rails anyway. After TWD, these are becoming more and more Telltale Games trademarks.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, this game has been a great ride and i enjoyed every second of it, but this ride deserved a better ending.
<br>THE FIGHT should&apos;ve been an actual revenge on Bloody Mary, or at the very least it should&apos;ve given us an actual choice on her fate. That would&apos;ve been a real hard call: kill the psycho that crippled you, or spare her to show you&apos;re better than that? What we got instead is a brief cutscene of the big wolf chewing on a glass doll. No real revenge, no real choice.
<br>THE FINAL CHOICE comes in the form of 3 different sentences for the Crooked Man, once you win the crowd during the trial. But, did you really win the crowd? Nope, that is achieved through a deus-ex-machina trick. The choice itself comes in the most obvious and predictable terms: spare him, sentence him to death or be the really bad guy and kill him in front of everyone. I think we deserved more than that, since from the beginning of the episode we lack the most important choice, that would&apos;ve really added to the game: join the Crooked Man.
<br>THE CLIFFHANGER comes too abruptly, literally in the last 30 seconds of gameplay, when your ass is already off the chair. And no one will convince me it was planned since the beginning: it clearly was not. It&apos;s a last minute lure for season 2.
<br>
<br>I gave this game a high score, despite my criticism, because, as I said, it has been a great ride. But we&apos;d better see some improvement from now on, both in quality and quantity of the choices presented in Telltale games, because there&apos;s no point in &quot;choosing your own adventure&quot; if the adventure is always the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4412308">Expand</a></span>

<br>Like many of my favourite &quot;games&quot; - i do have to wonder ... &quot;is it truly a game&quot;? - i get the occasional flash events, a lot of timed decision making and a few &quot;click on highlights on the screen&quot; and &quot;walk down the scene, but you can really only walk on rails&quot; parts.
<br>
<br>So in terms of actually being in control, i am left with a fairly sour taste. - a sour taste that is still overshadowed by the good parts of this game though.
<br>
<br>the good:
<br>
<br>- Mature story with great voiceacting, surprisingly fitting animations and scenic detail. A great conclusion to a very good story through 5 chapters.
<br>- characters i did care for, none of them one-sided or simple, but all of them with a sufficient amount of complexity to show that they are more than just archetypes ( unlike being a fable in the traditional sense )
<br>- decisions that felt to have weight - that felt like they mattered
<br>
<br>yes, the good revolves almost entirely around story and storytelling, but that is what i wanted when i got the game! - a beautifully told story, complex characters and questions that seem to be important in RL.
<br>
<br>postscript:
<br>
<br>for those reading that review - be aware that games i compare it to are games like &quot;Dreamfall&quot;, &quot;the blackwell series&quot; and more classic adventures ( cannot compare it to the walking dead, never played it )
<br>
<br>i also reviewed the entirety of &quot;the wolf among us&quot; not just chapter 5, because to me, it is ONE story that cannot really be split up - if you own 1-4 ... you will most certainly want chapter 5, unless you hated 1-4... in which case hardly any review will change your mind, i reckon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4347408">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you enjoyed The Walking Dead, I highly recommend you play this game.
<br>It takes what TWD did right, and expands upon it. That combined with an interesting story and great voice acting makes this one of the best games I&apos;ve played recently.</span>

This was made better as it did not rely on a gut punch to have an effective ending. I applaud Telltale for this ambitious game but the minor problems do make it impossible to give a perfect ten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4370610">Expand</a></span>

What sets it back from being a 10/10 is that the choices don&apos;t really affect the way the story goes. Yes, there are some minor changes to progression, but, overall, the story is the same. Maybe I was in the wrong mindset when I started playing, but I was hoping that it would be more like Heavy Rain. If you do the wrong choices, the story takes different paths. This disappointed me a little, but The Wolf Among Us is a game that simply resonates with me, probably because of all the noir theme, the beautiful soundtrack and stylish visuals. Too bad it has few to none replay value, but still... grab it when you can, and you won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796687">Expand</a></span>

<br>3 things make a good game, STORYLINE, CHARACTERS and GAMEPLAY. Graphics is also important but not always.
<br>1. Storyline: The Wolf Among Us&apos; la noire aura makes it&apos;s storyline much more mature and unpredictable. It had a far better start than The Walking Dead but a much weaker (but also interesting) end when compared to TWD. The bonus for the Wolf Among Us is the Walking Dead is already on tv and some of the choices are already predictable. But as always the end matters more than beginning.
<br>Winner: The Walking Dead
<br>
<br>2. Gameplay: The Wolf Among Us&apos; action-oriented gameplay is much more satisfying than that which resides in The Walking Dead. Granted, the walking dead&apos;s storyline doesn&apos;t leave much room for action but still they shudda placed more of it (like in season 2)
<br>Winner: The Wolf Among Us
<br>
<br>3. Characters: This is the deciding factor. Both games are almost identical in this aspect. The only difference is TWD characters die to easily within a 5 episode period. Meaning there isn&apos;t enough time to develop the characters. While this adds more gloss to its storyline, it depreciates it&apos;s character-involvement. Lee and Clementine are the ultimate anchors, and boy did they keep TWD atop, btu the same could be said about Bigby and Snow. The difference is, TWAU has so many compelling characters to back up it&apos;s two main protagonists(eg bloody mary, tweedle dee and dumb, mr toad and his son, colin) whereas TWD&apos;s two main characters are left in the cold.
<br>Winner: The Wolf Among Us.
<br>
<br>The Wolf Among just edges The Walking Dead, but only just. I can see why critics would place TWD of higher regard than TWAU, because most emphasis today is placed on meaningless action in games from players, a critic would be soooooo happy to see a game giving it&apos;s main focus to it&apos;s storyline and difficult choices. But whilst the Walking Dead deals with Life an Death, Black and White, The Wolf Among Us delves in those shades of grey, making it a much more compelling show</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-5---cry-wolf/user-reviews?user_review_id=4943039">Expand</a></span>
