Let&apos;s start with a short summary:
<br>
<br>Seldom have I played a game that gives me such mixed messages. Sublime text based story and a truly wonderful world battle with bad game mechanics and pure boredom. And while I wish I could fully advise to buy this game, I feel troubled by some pretty bad design choices.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>
<br>This has been said before, the game world and the writing are simply great. The whole world, while really dark makes complete sense. Every port that you explore has new interesting stories to tell.
<br>
<br>The choices you have to make are meaningful, even if you succeed in challenges you often have to deal with negative effects that come sidelong. Like some artifact you get that is worth a lot but raises your Terror levels. The card systems is kind of artificial, but works really good. You always know what you need and what your chances are to succeed in a challenge.
<br>
<br>As a whole the setting is wonderful and you strife to learn more from this world, explorer the secrets of the deep Zea and deal with it&apos;s terrors.
<br>
<br>The neutral (People might find this good or bad according to personal taste):
<br>
<br>The game is really hard. Ressource management is brutal, most of your money is spend on fuel and food. Building up something extra takes a long time.
<br>
<br>You will die quite some time, and dying is really punishing in this game. In the beginning you loose everything and you will have to start all over again. If you find this troubling I advise you to turn off permanent death witch is an option. (But default is unforgiving mode, so be careful)
<br>Also ff you die there is no random content, except the position of islands. So you will have to go through everything you did again.
<br>
<br>Overall the pace of the game is really slow. Most of the time you will stare at your screen seeing your little steamer make it&apos;s way through an almost black screen. Of course this adds a lot to the feeling of the game, but if you are after fast paced action, you won&apos;t get it in this game.
<br>
<br>The bad
<br>
<br>There are way to little options for ships, equipment etc. After 10 hours I haven&apos;t bought a single thing! I have now 2.000 money to spare, which is not bad considering the time I spent and there simply isn&apos;t a single thing that would make sense to buy. I repeat that 10 hours in the game and I haven&apos;t bough a single upgrade because there is nothing to buy:
<br>- New gun -&gt; you will avoid fights 90% of the time anyway
<br>- New engine -&gt; makes you slightly faster but consumes more precious fuel
<br>- New ship -&gt; WAY more expensive then 2.000 echo
<br>
<br>While we are at it: combat sucks. You will be stuck with a single gun forever because you can&apos;t buy another ship, so you have tactical options of 0. Also combat is really dangerous most of the time, so you will avoid it as best as possible.
<br>
<br>Trading also sucks. There simply isn&apos;t anything you can trade with the starter ship that has enough margin to cover fuel &amp; food and getting a trading ship is really expensive.
<br>
<br>Also this is a roguelike game, but dying is the worst thing you can do. You will want to avoid dying in any way possible because it&apos;s so extremely punishing. The permadeath option makes about as much sense as for Monkey Island.
<br>
<br>The Verdict
<br>
<br>So where does that leave us? Incredible writing vs. crappy gameplay. I the writing good enough to take the pain? I would say yes, but turn of permadeath or you will never explore the wonders of the Zea and only do the same stuff over and over again (remember, the definition of madness...).
<br>
<br>This game has been compared to Faster then Light (FTL) a lot. But let me say this to you straight away: It&apos;s NOTHING like that. FTL is a game stripped down to it&apos;s core gameplay. With incredibly deep and tactical fights, fast gameplay and a different outcome every time you start new. The combination of ships, weapons, crew members, augmentations etc. are endless in FTL and you get stuff pretty fast. On the other hand the story is spare and you will just get to make a handful of decisions along the way.
<br>
<br>That is about the complete opposite of Sunless Sea. Story driven, slow, very spare random elements, a complete lack of equipment and very flat sometimes really boring gameplay. To break it down for you: In FTL hardly every nothing happens in Sunless Sea you don&apos;t do anything at least 60% of the time.
<br>
<br>Would buy again? Yes, but a very close one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5047520">Expand</a></span>

<br>What does it offer? Tense gameplay where every choice matters. Great atmosphere and incredible writing. You get to sail your own ship. I now have a Phorcyd-class Corvette (&quot;Small, swift and formidable, like a very angry vole.&quot;) equipped with a Cotterell &amp; Hathersage &apos;Reproach&apos; deck cannon, and I hold my own very well. I&apos;d like to get a Caminus Yards Helltrasher deck cannon, but cash is short (it always is). Right now I need to go get a demoness and bring her back to London, the admiral wants me to stop by a certain port that is mostly on the way, and one of my officer thinks he can make me a better engine. I wonder how my little nation of rats and guinea pigs is doing?

<br>
<br>What are we playing for? The story is a mess. I know that it&apos;s an already fleshed out universe from Fallen London, but the text is somewhat cryptic, the design is not the most user friendly, and the tutorial is absent - so it&apos;s hard to delve in gameplay-wise, and I need that to happen in order to enjoy the storyline. It&apos;s got no info of where to go, what to start with, and you&apos;re just thrown in like that. And you die, and you lose (almost) everything, and then you die again.
<br>
<br>Under that hard, unwelcoming shell, there might be some sweet pulp; However, it&apos;s this shell that&apos;s off-putting. If one does not get a foothold in the world, gain something to push him forward or have any event happen that can get him directly involved. It&apos;s not that the game is bad, but it&apos;s poorly balanced. If there&apos;s a hook, it&apos;s hidden too deep and most people won&apos;t grab it. Shame, it did a lot of things right...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5000094">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is first and foremost is incoherent.  Is it an action game ? No, combat sucks. Is it a trading game ? No, trading is so pointless there&apos;s even a loading message advising you against it. So given a ship and crew when you start the game, what should you do ? I can&apos;t tell because I don&apos;t know. All you can do is set sail, reach an island which hopefully gives you a little resource to allow you to repeat the process next time. In this game money is so scarce you&apos;d even have to sell the introduction manual. A few ways there are to make money are available only in online forums. Even so these all require unreasonable amount of time for grinding and save skumming. It really doesn&apos;t help either that the ship moves very very very slowly. You will spend most of the time watching your little ship struggling painfully to get to the edge of monitor.
<br>Playing this game is like coming to a party when everyone is about to leave. Try as you want, you just can&apos;t get into the crowd. This game is derived from Internet game called Fallen London with rules and lore no one but fans know. Indeed it has interesting premise, about exploration and Cthulhu-like atmosphere. But with poor presentation and incoherent gameplay, I am not going to spend another hour finding out. Neither should you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5156574">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Long story short, you play as various sea captains on their voyages around the &apos;Unterzee&apos;: a strange underground ocean full of eldritch horrors and and other strangeness, both human and non-human.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get the simple stuff out of the way first: the writing is perhaps the greatest collection of prose in a video game this year or last year, and perhaps ever. It reads like Charles Dickens making &apos;come hither&apos; eyes to HP Lovecraft, and one of the greatest joys this game has to offer is simply the joy of text, and of drinking in all the wonderful things that these game designers had to say about their world.
<br>
<br>The graphic design is also exceptional. The player is confronted with stylish renditions of ships, islands and many things much more wacky and wonderful than those first examples. Many things seem to just have half a toe dipped into the uncanny valley: several of the human characters have exaggerated features, and the player themselves can only choose a silhouette, rather than a portrait, and whilst everything is presented more or less on a two dimensional plane, the artists have obviously worked hard to bring just a hint of the third dimension into their game. Ships rock slightly back and forth on the water, and the Lifebergs (towering masses of living ice) rock menacingly to and fro as they chase you down.
<br>
<br>The sound design is also absolutely excellent: the ambient sound of the water is actually incredibly relaxing just on its own, whilst the various melodies that play as you sail are all memorable and evocative in their own ways. The only criticism I could make is the somewhat counter-intuitive recycling of sound effects for various different monsters, something I think could be easily fixed.
<br>
<br>However, substance-wise and on a technical level, the game sometimes disappoints. It&apos;s intensely resource-focused, to the extent that it sometimes hampers the ability of the player to explore as the designers probably intended. Certain resources are valued the same as others, but are much, much harder to obtain, giving the game somewhat of an imbalanced feel. The UI is a bit of a mess, with some story objectives revealed through officers, some in the journal, and some through items in the hold, and without the ability to annotate the map, it becomes difficult to keep track of everything you&apos;re supposed to be doing. The action of the combat is often dull and uninspired, with little practical variety in weapons or abilities, and occasionally the game veers dangerously into the territory of &apos;grind&apos;-something that really shows that the people making it have only previously made a commercially successful browser game, where grind is essentially gospel.

<br>Despite this, I wholeheartedly recommend Sunless Sea to any friend I talk to, because to cut a long story short, the mild lows are not enough to distract from the wonderful highs. By focusing on their strengths, Failbetter Games have created an experience that, for better or worse, simply should not be missed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5156095">Expand</a></span>

I mean, who in their right mind would force you to slowly repeat every painstakingly slow move you made, after dying? It has to be part of the experience and the uniqueness of the game, right? Well, if it is, kudos to the people patient enough to do the same things over and over, &quot;discover&quot; the exact same places again and go through the same sequence of events, until they find the one with the highest chances of keeping them alive. It would have been quite a different game if there was some kind of randomization each time you started with a different captain but nooo... Practically everything remains the same and you have the extremely tedious task of doing everything all over again. How hard would it have been to move a few islands around, randomize a few rewards and add a fast forward button? I will give it a few more tries just because the atmosphere and stories are indeed cool, but someone needs to accept that it just isn&apos;t a fun game as it stands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5188015">Expand</a></span>

<br>The idea of playing as a sea captain, in a game of survival and exploration set in an alternative &quot;steam punk&quot;/Lovecraftian universe is indeed enough to whet any ones appetite.
<br>My experience is: dying early on whilst trying to fathom the mechanics and UI; this I can deal with, what I find I cannot deal with is the dull boring grind. What is the purpose of the game? Once I&apos;ve discovered a new place I can only unlock certain story lines with specific items. Where do I get those items?Once I&apos;ve got an item where do I use it? The game flounders because it seems to be a mass of side quests with no defining Storyline. Nothing at the beginning of the game grabs your interest enough to move you forward.
<br>This is not a total flop of a game, there is something unique enough about Sunless Sea to keep your interest piqued enough to struggle through the repetition and grind.
<br>Maybe I just have to hold my hands up, admit that  I&apos;ve missed the point completely and say &quot; Hey this game is just not for me&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=4971603">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is not for everyone, however. For those who do not enjoy a good book or moments of silence, this game is not for you. Sunless Sea has more in common with a text based role playing game more than it does with a rogue like.
<br>
<br>The stories are interesting and will keep you wondering what happens next but are short enough to not warrant several hours of constant reading. The combat is simple enough and will not win any awards but is still fun at times. The music is fantastic and sets the mood and tone of the game very well and can be a joy in itself to hear.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is decent and worth the price of a movie ticket and bag of popcorn. There are periodic updates that add new content and bug fixes and new stories are added as well. Also take the time to look up how Failbettergames handles their stories. Some may enjoy the way it is handled and some may not. Best to do some homework before you spend your hard earned money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5322672">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you do decide to play the game, turn on the feature that allows you to save the game when ever you want, &quot;Merciful Mode.&quot; Don&apos;t let the game fool you into playing &quot;Unforgiving Mode&quot; where it has one autosave and you have to start over when you die. The story, the haphazard collection of pieces that it is,  has a lot of atmosphere... the first time you meander through it, but it wears thin on subsequent readings.
<br>
<br>Combat is very simple and not very good. Trading from port to port isn&apos;t financially sound.  Overall I&apos;ll just say the game is balanced heavily against the player in all aspects: combat, economy, exploration, etc. to the point where it can almost be said to be punitive where it should be encouraging.
<br>
<br>Some slightly more experienced design balance, a central storyline and better pacing and this would be a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5278686">Expand</a></span>

There is a light-handedness to the dark humor that keeps it from feeling silly or breaking the fourth wall.
<br>
<br>It is also among the most truly &quot;roguelike&quot; of the recent spate of games claiming that category; the game will kill you brutally the first few times you play, and you will meet many a death before you win, but each time you play you will learn more about how to succeed.
<br>
<br>Unlike the original Rogue, your character doesn&apos;t start over at exactly the zero point each time; each new incarnation can choose one set of things to inherit from its predecessor, and after you&apos;ve achieved significant success you can write a will and stock a mansion with sellable curios to give your next character a further leg up.
<br>
<br>This last is perhaps the most brilliant thing, in a game design sense, about Sunless Sea. Permadeath is so painful that ameliorating it just this much, and adding the additional story elements of inheritance, makes all the difference between depression and eagerness to try again. That said, you can decide at any time to start saving and loading, implicitly removing permadeath. This will only affect your ability to gain the achievement for winning with permadeath turned on.
<br>
<br>I hesitate to give this game an unqualified 10 primarily because of annoyances about not living up to the UI flexibility expectations for a PC game, and secondarily because it will not be many players&apos; cup of tea.
<br>
<br>The biggest of these annoyances is the complete lack of control over the text display in a game that&apos;s all about reading text. I run the game at my monitor&apos;s full resolution all the text is unreadably small; reducing the resolution makes the text readable but makes the log window (which is admittedly not the most important thing on the screen) too small to see much in.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you like games that reward paying attention to the text rather than scrolling past it in a hurry, this is probably your game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=4967067">Expand</a></span>

On another, it degenerates into a cross-between &quot;rogue&quot; like gameplay and the mother of all grind-fests. You can trade, but it often isn&apos;t worth it since most trades rarely cover the cost of fuel or supplies of the journey. There&apos;s combat, but that isn&apos;t worth it either since it costs more to repair your ship than you get back. You can upgrade your ship, but that isn&apos;t worth it either as you end up far worse off in terms of increasing fuel costs relative to static quest rewards. Ship movement is painfully slow. As others have said, &quot;story&quot; seems to consist of 200x sidequests with no real main quest &quot;glue&quot;. Game has a lot of potential, but also has seriously unbalanced resource management &amp; mechanics in general.
<br>
<br>I think this is really one of those games where either the &quot;feel&quot; of the game will &quot;click&quot; with you, or it simply won&apos;t, and for me it didn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5110884">Expand</a></span>

Also, you can die in this game, and death can be a HUGE setback in progress (because while there are ways to mitigate it a little bit, death is permanent...time to start over). If those things don&apos;t bother you (or they are good qualities in a game, in your opinion), read on. Otherwise, this game isn&apos;t for you. Sorry.
<br>
<br>Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, I just want to say, this game is insanely good. It&apos;s compelling in a way I haven&apos;t experienced for a long time. It&apos;s like sitting down with one of the most interesting, complex, well written books you&apos;ll ever find, and then getting to make all the decisions, fight in all the epic battles, etc etc etc.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll meet piRats and soul stealing monkeys and vicious scoundrels and squid men and zee beasts and cannibals and immortals and tiger people and face thieves and strange men from strange places where everything happens in the future tense. You&apos;ll fight on the sea, on the land, over treasure and power and the lives of your self and your crew. You&apos;ll find romance, long lost artifacts, gateways to other worlds, horrors man was not meant to know, and more adventure than you can shake a stick at. All this and more, coming at you in wonderfully written, beautifully presented prose that will sweep you away into a world at the border of insanity.
<br>
<br>In terms of gameplay, it&apos;s a slower paced (which fits the world well), real time combat (although not twitch based combat), some random generation (so you&apos;re worlds different every time, to a degree), permadeath, stat driven rpg about exploration and investigation into a world of bizarre horrors, insanity, dark humor, and surprisingly human motivations.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, if you enjoy a good story, want a game where your decisions and choices actually do matter (like, a lot),  if you are the type of person who can fall in love with an imaginary world, if you like the idea of exploring into the black unknown, or if you just always wanted to be a zee captain, this is a game you won&apos;t regret purchasing. Remember, no one is born a zee captain, but anyone can be one, with the right motivation and a not-so-healthy dose of optimism. Come, zail the zee, it is calling your name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=4969241">Expand</a></span>

In short, it hasn&apos;t been dumbed down to a modern console-port CRPG and has some old-school elements that require attention to detail (in story and action) and putting in some effort in resource management.   It&apos;s also not a combat-oriented CRPG/adventure so the combat system is simple compared to the button-mashing-special-attack fests of the modern games in the genres.  But I consider that a feature, not a bug.
<br>
<br>You have a small variety of choices in your &apos;win game&apos; goal.  My current &apos;win game&apos; goal is to find my father&apos;s bones and bury them.   There are three others.
<br>
<br>The stories and characters are interesting and will engage the serious, and many of the casual, CRPG players.   The game has various port challenges with multiple outcomes (RNG or choice) possible.  You can make mistakes and they are fatal at times (my first Captain was murdered by his own crew!).
<br>
<br>You control the plot pace and are not forced down a linear path.    You have stats to upgrade, ships to purchase and upgrade, crew to hire and upgrade, a world map that is reshuffled with every new captain.    Combat can be avoided, or taken on.
<br>
<br>In the UnderZee you are rewarded, or punished, for your choices and your impatience, or patience.  And when something bad happens to you, it&apos;s always because of what you did.  Or failed to do.  No deus ex machina garbage to hamper (or lift) you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5223953">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a bit slow-paced, although the game is only &apos;grind-y&apos; if you are actually trying to grind stuff. This game isn&apos;t meant to be played that way: it&apos;s meant to be a game where you sail out into the big black and hope it pays off.

Spend the price of the game on gas. Drive somewhere you&apos;ve never been. Get out, look around. Enjoy the day. Have a picnic. When the sun goes down, try to get home without running out of gas. You&apos;ve just had a better time than playing Sunless Sea. (If you don&apos;t have a car, put the money in a coffee can marked &quot;Savings for a Car.&quot; You will still have a similar experience.)
<br>
<br>This game is truly a waste of time and money. Sunless Sea tries to be a lot of tantalizing things, but does just about all of them poorly. Combat is atrocious, exploration is tedious and unrewarding, movement is inexcusably slow, the &quot;story&quot; seems to be an assemblage of set pieces with no interconnection or apparent coherence.
<br>
<br>My first biggest problem on a game level is a fundamental one. I don&apos;t understand why this game calls itself a roguelike, or features permadeath. Since it is supposedly story-driven, if you are expected to frequently die then you just sit through the same story elements every time after every restart. I would opine that the fact that you have the option to turn the roguelike aspect off indicates that it was an early concept that became obsolete during development. I do have more cynical ideas about why it exists, though.
<br>
<br>My next biggest problem is the speed of the game. Your ship is inexcusably slow, even with upgraded engines. Maybe later ships are better, but the price of these ships is so steep I never got a chance to try one (the reward-to-cost balance is an issue of its own). Regardless, to somehow make enough money to buy better ships and equipment, you will waste hours watching your little boat inch its way sluggishly across the pretty but mostly non-interactive environment. A simple fix would have been a fast-forward button, featured in many similar games. I suspect that the choice not to include such a boon, however, was in deference to maintaining the atmospheric quality of the game. I could see the difficulty in progressing as being in deference to the atmosphere of the game. The pointlessness of everything you do as being in deference to the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>These unenjoyable aspects foisted upon the player bring me to the core problem with this game; The creators&apos; artistic vision is allowed to interfere with the player&apos;s good time. Every element that would make Sunless Sea a competent game seems to have suffered in favor of story and atmosphere. That could be excused, to a limited extent, if the story were well put together. By the game&apos;s nature of exploration and horribly ill-conceived roguelike elements, however, there is little hope for a linear plot. It feels like a series of set pieces strung together ad hoc because it is, out of necessity. If instead of making a game the creators had created a short animated film with a coherent story set in this universe, it might have actually been good. This game is not, and should not exist.
<br>
<br>I was actually excited when I first heard about Sunless Sea. I loved sea-trading games like Port Royale but wished they had better developed worlds, I loved FTL, which some crooked critic compared it to, and sure, steampunk, I&apos;d love to see that done well in a game other than Bioshock for once. Review scores for it were really high. But Sunless Sea is not a game. Every time I tried to give it another chance I quit playing with an unpleasant taste in my mouth, wishing I had my time and money back. Everything in this game is done better elsewhere. The art is pretty, though in no way does it justify a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5026708">Expand</a></span>

Also, you will have to enjoy reading, and have a vocabulary that includes &quot;tenebrous&quot; or possibly &quot;cyclopean&quot;. There&apos;s a swirl of Lovecraft here, with a dusting of Poe, but the cake underneath is its own recipe.
<br>You largely build your own narrative from the many, many stories you stumble across, which makes for unique possibilities. If Failbetter continues to add stories, the world will remain living and will gain a depth rarely offered.
<br>And do be warned: You will bury captains at sea. Often, at the outset, and whenever you foolishly think you are &quot;ready&quot; for what&apos;s out there.

<br>
<br>- I like the detail of each isle/ archipielago. I reccomend to you to play this game with the lights out in your room in order to appreciate better the darkness.
<br>- I like the music, very frightening and suffocating.
<br>- I&apos;ve enjoyed the histories told in the diferent isles, and the different people you meet through your travels.
<br>
<br>- The only problem I&apos;ve experienced is that you need a high english level to enjoy the adventures. I have a mid level and I&apos;m constantly using a translator in my mobile to understand the meaning of lots of sentences.
<br>- Combat is basic but I liked it. Sometimes AI for enemies is not smart.
<br>- This is a game with lots of histories to read. If you don&apos;t like reading texts in games, this is not your game.

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get one thing correct - it&apos;s impossible to advance in the game without cheating.  Most items in the game costs thousands or even tens of thousands of &quot;echoes,&quot; the game&apos;s currency, but quests, items, and other monetized items discovered through the game rarely bring more than 10, 30, or 50.  The rare completed quest that brings more than 200 echoes seems like a great boost....until you realize you spent more than that in fuel and supplies to even get to the necessary location.
<br>
<br>Here we have a game which not only fails in every way to be compelling from a storytelling perspective, but which is so fundamentally broken at the level of gameplay that the vast majority of downloaders will never see even 10% of the map.  For an &quot;exploration&quot; game, the design and execution could not be worse.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a fan of the recent trend of indie games that make an effort to be difficult - I think &quot;Paper&apos;s Please&quot; and &quot;This War of Mine&quot; are two fantastic examples.  This, however, is sheer dreck from every possible metric.  The combat is sluggish and repetitive, the pace of exploration is so dismal as to suck the joy from reaching new locations, and you&apos;ll only ever experience any of those things if you&apos;re willing to manually edit your save file, anyway.  Save your money.  This is one piece of flotsam that should have been thrown back into the &apos;Zee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=4995482">Expand</a></span>

If you can imagine a sort of mutation of Lovecraft, Ports of Call, Rogue Legacy and FTL with undead tourists and sea monsters then you`re getting there. But then it isn`t really like any of those at all either, but something quite particular indeed. Half the time I couldn`t even tell if I was having fun or was being shanghaied into some sort of sociology experiment quite frankly. Crossing the sea takes positively forever, and chances are you`re not making it across even if you`re patient enough to try. So in short the best description I can give of Sunless Sea is that it is a verbose, story generating, nautical legacy rogue-like set in a faux, subterranean 19th century Britain with undeads, pirates, talking rodents, giant crabs, jellyfish, mechanical sharks and other sea dwelling terrors. It could hardly be any weirder if it tried.
<br>Meanwhile there`s a curious mixture of gloom, literacy and nonsensical absurdism in this game I am unsure if I have seen anywhere before. It`s not exactly funny, not exactly tragic and not exactly dramatic. It just is, like a weird alternative reality full of slightly unsettling things of all kinds. But something is very likely to take a hold of you while playing Sunless Sea whether you like it or not, and whatever it is.
<br>Mostly it`s desperation and sheer panic of course, as hours of meticulous progress threaten to go down the drain unless you can somehow limp and cannibalize your way back to the relative safety of Fallen London. But on the occasions when you do make it back, preferably with some haul to make the whole thing feel worth it, there`s a potent sense of relief I haven`t experienced too often in video games. There is a distinct visual style as well, and the sound is excellent in every way, as you chug your way nervously around a subterranean ocean called The Unterzee. But it`s the panicked moments when you know you`re gonna be lost at sea, again, which drive you up the wall and right on to starting all over again with the next poor sap you`re gonna drown in an act of overstretch, stupidity, hubris or accident, in the form of your heir. Ideally each drowned sap, erm I mean captain, will build on the fortune of his predecessor until some conclusion to the game can be reached. I have not reached that far yet, but it is an interesting concept and it is well executed in Sunless Sea.
<br>I would score it higher if it wasn`t for the sense I am getting that the story part of the game crashes a bit with the rogue-like genre. Replayability is all good and well. But who wants to read the same text over and over again? I ended up clicking through most of it because of this, which is a shame because it`s well written stuff. Just not the tenth time. Or the twentieth. And similarly, random events have a bad habit of not seeming very random. Once I got the same one five times in a row within about three minutes. I didn`t want it and dismissed it only to get it again twenty seconds later until I thought it was a bug of some sort. Secondly it seems a bit grindy. This isn`t necessarily a bad thing of course, and at least the game rewards the lost art of patience. But I am having a hell of a time getting any development of my ship going at all, which is sort of a big deal in a nautical rogue-like. The upgrades are expensive, not to mention upgrading the hull, and the one cannon upgrade I did manage to buy was not inherited by my heir as advertized, which felt like the game cheating quite frankly. And the game is hard enough without cheating the player.
<br>Other than these slight niggles, most of which have more to do with the irrepressible creativity of the designers than any actual flaws with the game, I can`t find a thing to criticize about it.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended if you have the patience to read my review of it. Especially if you like things difficult and slow paced and you enjoy reading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=5053774">Expand</a></span>

Strongly recommend getting the Zubmariner DLC too - it&apos;s playable inside the main game story, and gives you many advantages once you&apos;ve gained the ability to scour the surface, the Unterzee and the sea bed too.
<br>
<br>The game also makes a big deal about playing for permadeath, teasing the idea that it would be detrimental to use Saves and lose your status as a &quot;true&quot; player. I&apos;d advise you to forget that, and use the Save! It&apos;s hard enough without completely crushing yourself. Abandon all ideas about finding some cheap stock that&apos;s worth a fortune at another port, too; such things are almost totally non-existent, and this isn&apos;t Elite. Money will appear as windfalls from unexpected moments in the game&apos;s story, as will life-saving food and fuel (although you will also need to buy these!).  The game wants you to forget about traditional game ideas and put both feet into being a foolhardy sea captain from a horror story. Be reckless and give yourself to that premise, and the game will pay you back with more (wonderfully well written) stories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=7547029">Expand</a></span>

<br>Making money is almost impossible as simply maintaining your ship is hard enough let alone making a profit out of the mostly luck based &quot;story&quot; events.
<br>The characters have mostly good back-stories but you won&apos;t know them unless you manage to get them to open up, which means inviting them to dine with you by spending some of your supplies (which are expensive to buy just like fuel) and possible a rare item which you will need to use in some kind of quest later on and then going of to some obscure island to complete part one of their story makes learning the stories of your officers a chore.
<br>The speed at which the game is played is the slowest imaginable. You can buy different engines if you somehow manage to turn in a profit but even then the change in speed is barely noticeable. The increased fuel consumption on the other hand is more than noticeable.
<br>The music is one of the few redeeming qualities of this game but there is only so much good music and eye candy can do before the ludicrously slow speed, repetitive combat and the repetition of playing the early game again and again because of the permadeath feature make any sane player turn the game off. Although permadeath can be turned off it doesn&apos;t help much as you will mostly die because you failed a  skill check (you start of pretty much useless with the exception of one skill of your choosing at which you are the least useless) after an unfortunate turn of events and this can&apos;t be medicated by way of save scumming (not to mention that save scumming should not be essential in order to progress).
<br>In the end this game has a great setting and nothing else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunless-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=6211066">Expand</a></span>

I actually died only once when I was already deep in the game and it was a bit of a pain to make it through again. Luckily it was all a bit different while at the same time same enough to help you progress much faster. I can&apos;t wait till sunless skies.</span>
