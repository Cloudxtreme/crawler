It may not be to everybody&apos;s taste but you can see that a lot of effort has been put into the art. It&apos;s  colourful, pretty unique and more importantly it fits perfectly with the general cartoonish atmosphere of the game. I really liked the fact that this game does not take itself seriously.<br>You punch fratboys, you spank bankers, you punish corrupt cops and more generally you bring justice to white collar criminals.There again, it might not be for everyone&apos;s taste but personally, I really appreciated this effort. It&apos;s not so often that we have a game who is tongue-in-cheek and not afraid to be politically incorrect. It was especially true for the ending of the game which really  surprised me and reminded me of a silly version of Streets of Rage.<br><br>Apart from that its a pretty standard beat&apos;em up with a lot of action and some effort to make the levels as varied as possible. Good thing is, you can play in co-op with a friend on the same screen and use some pretty funny collaborative attacks. I must say however that II was disappointed the game  did not have some kind of XP system to unlock new moves as well as suffering from a few  glitches.<br>It&apos;s good, funny and original but it could definitively be much better : 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-asskickers/user-reviews?user_review_id=2148733">Expand</a></span>
