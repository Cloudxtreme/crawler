What is annoying in this game is the fact that no one plays the game because is fun or enjoys speed, people play only to earn reputation (works as XP, like in RPG games) that make you unlock stuff. The game doesn&apos;t have much cars, circuits, racing modes, personalization, what makes this game even worse. The only thing that makes this game fun is the cop chases.

Since I wasn&apos;t able to I checked the status, it said: &quot;The servers are up and running&quot; in green with the little green light. Well, it also said, &quot;We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Thank you for your patience.&quot; It&apos;s been 4-5 days later and it still says the same thing. Tried to reinstall, did everything all the FAQs and suggestions that were E-MAILED to me AFTER the fact that someone on their live chat told me I&apos;d have to wait to play the game. Well there have been a few posts that people have made so I guess some people have been playing it. I can&apos;t even log into the thing. The oddest part of all is that I was told I&apos;d have to wait a couple of hours and try again. I don&apos;t really fancy sitting around to find out how horrible it will be in game. They did a promo with Tony&apos;s Pizza recently and I realize it may be that promo overloading the servers. However they should have known that might happen. Furthermore the free $5 is really $5 off. The free to play, I have confirmed with many people isn&apos;t free past level 10 and the game isn&apos;t worth 10 cents. I will never be purchasing any EA game in the future, least of all their most expensive ones. If their customer service is that bad, why should I continue to purchase their games on my consoles either? It just shows them that the consumers are pushovers and that they can take their money and then deny access to the game to these players, hide their posts in the forums and in general, act like immature little children instead of business running adults. Time to grow up and take some responsibility for your screw ups. Sorry guys, that&apos;s the lay of the land. Besides you should have some honor!<br><br>Time for us to take the power back guys, frankly I&apos;m sick of this dodgy crap. Why you ask? Well I tried to resolve it with them and they replied with vague responses instead of simply confirming that there actually is a problem in the game, they just lead me in circles. Do yourself a favor and find a better free to play game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757446">Expand</a></span>

Graphics is ugly, and u must pay for everything... I don&apos;t recommend.</span>

<br>Low-quality, poor production value sales gimmick for &quot;boost&quot;, and by that i mean you pay real money for any performance. This is utter trash and simply a scam to sucker kids.</span>

It has a huge open world consisting of both Rockport and Palmont City. It has quite a selection of cars and they all handle fairly predictably, as you would expect. Unfortunately, this game is the absolute essence of &apos;Pay to Win&apos;, with powerups like Nitrous and the ability to turn the car in front of you into a Traffic Magnet, and the ability to purchase almost every car in the game directly with Microtransactions. Many of the customization options are also only available to those with fat wallets. This turns the game from a fun and competitive racer into a frustrating race to open your wallet so you can win. The game also seems to have a problem with hackers.<br><br>Overall, if you own any of the earlier Need for Speed titles and two controllers, you will have infinitely more fun than you ever will here. The Pursuit modes are quite entertaining, but largely unchanged apart from the ability to play them in a multiplayer mode. And generally playing them with random people can be as much fun as it can be frustrating.<br><br>It&apos;s unfortunate, it has a lot of potential but the removal of the Drag Racing and Drift Modes in the game means you can only ever race or do pursuit on the same tracks in Most Wanted and Carbon, minus the Mountain tracks. The removal of the Roll-Up races from Free Roam mean that the enormous place you have to drive around in is just a Lobby and much of the multiplayer Races are plagued by people who use as many powerups as humanly possible, hackers or people who just try to smash everyone off the road. They should have taken some hints from Burnout Paradise and went with their own game but instead they just turned a great concept into an undercooked Pay to Winfest.<br><br>There aren&apos;t many online racing games, but try to avoid this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2236856">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros: Palmont City and Rockport maps from NFS: Most Wanted (2005) and NFS: Carbon together with tweaks and a full day/ night cycle.
<br>
<br>Cars from previous NFS titles.
<br>
<br>Offline races and police chases.
<br>
<br>Cons: The free-to-play model this game completely discourages players unless they spend lots of actual money.
<br>
<br>Many, many hackers and cheaters that are not being banned and instead are banning paying players.
<br>
<br>Poor server performance with many glitches including losing your own profile.
<br>
<br>Very repetitive gameplay.
<br>
<br>Same game engine from NFS:MW and Carbon which has defiantly aged.
<br>
<br>NFS: World&apos;s map combining Rockport and Palmont City is great. It is nice to see both maps put together with a few tweaks in the scenery and modifications. Although it is somewhat disappointing to see just small stretches of road to connect each city without any long stretches of new road to make the cities feel &quot;distant&quot; from each other like MW and Carbon portrayed them. The scenery is very copy-and-paste looking and nothing very exciting. The day/night cycle looks good, but all the weather effects give a feeling of a cold, northern region which makes the palm trees and cactus of Palmont City look really out of place.
<br>
<br>The physics/ graphic engine looks like a tweaked version of the engine from 2005&apos;s NFS: Most Wanted so if you&apos;d played that game or Carbon, there is nothing new here. The cars, the police chases, and races are the exact same experience just with different cars.
<br>
<br>The cars that they keep updating with are nice in regards to variety, but are simply imports from other NFS titles and slapped with an unrealistic price tag.
<br>
<br>The free-to-play model this game runs on is what ruined it all for me: except for exploring, 3 races, and single player police chases, there is nothing else to do in this game. You need to win races in order to unlock more races in other regions of the map, new cars, and money to upgrade your current car. This is nearly impossible because the price tags for everything in-game is so high you need to play the same race over and over and OVER again to earn the money because the wining cash prizes are so low....and that&apos;s if you can win a race. There is no balance between you and other players. You are constantly at a disadvantage of higher ranked players or hackers/cheaters and boy are they rampant in this game. It makes the painful grind of earning money and unlocking content literally impossible unless you dive in with actual money.
<br>
<br>The server is unreliable, it has failed almost every time I played the game and happen at any given time (Sometimes 20 minutes in, sometimes an hour in) and I lose all my progress. I even lost my profile and EA never revived it, since then I never touched this game because unlocking and progressing through this game is simply not worth it.
<br>
<br>This game constantly requires an online connection even though the game offers single player events. I find no point in investing anymore time or any money in this game because whenever they stop supporting this game (and EA will someday) the server will be shut down and everything people invested into this game will be gone....and that&apos;s the biggest reason for anyone to stay away from this game or any game that relies on an online server such as EA&apos;s other monster failure which was SimCity - that game will fear the wrath of an unsupported server some day.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: NFS: World as the game itself is not bad, decent quality, and a nice throwback for MW and Carbon players such as myself, but the online dedication, many unaddressed server issues, unfair competition, terrible customer service from EA, and price-gouging content to progress makes this game very discouraging to players.
<br>
<br>If your a fan of NFS: Carbon or 2005&apos;s Most Wanted, your not missing out too much. Those two game still are great to this day and as long as you have a copy of those games, they will truly be free to play, not rely on an internet server, and last forever.
<br>

Well guess what - they didn&apos;t. The cars are jerky and the cars are jumping all around. Both the player&apos;s and the other player&apos;s. I selected manual transmission and got some retarded hybrid that shifts from the buttons but if I don&apos;t shift manually shifts automagically anyway.
<br>And my internet connection isn&apos;t slow or laggy, I played many other mmos alright.
<br>
<br>I played it for 5 min and it was just for a good laugh at what a dumb idea it was to make an MMO out of a racing game.
<br>
<br>In all honesty, the graphics are kind of nice.
<br>
<br>Oh and $150&apos;000 for a Mitsubishi Eclipse? Really? ;-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=5312402">Expand</a></span>

The net code for multi-player games is horrid, cars will zip all over the road often ramming you to bits. Sometimes they will disappear entirely only to reappear a few seconds later as they zip by you at a 1,000 miles an hour and give you a whack on there way back to where they should be if they hadn&apos;t disappeared.<br><br>The customization is average at best, there are pretty basic performance parts for the cars you can buy, and you have a chance to win better ones from the card system at the end of races. Other than the parts you cant customize your cars performance really at all. Also the numbers that supposedly rate your cars stats (Acceleration, Top Speed, Handling) are utter bogus randomly useless numbers. They have no meaning when compared to any other car from what i was able to see.<br><br>The graphics are pretty good, but not amazing. There is NO WAY to rebind keys, or setup game-pad/Driving Wheels to be used with the game aside from the ones that are listed on there website.<br><br>The pursuit portion of the game is OK, its nothing new, and not any better than previous NFS games.<br><br>They constantly push the &quot;Speedboost&quot; in-game currency you pay real money for to get an edge up. If you really enjoy the game it would be worth it for the Rep/Money multipliers, otherwise I cant justify giving away money for game in such a poor state.<br><br>In closing it seems like its only about 1/3 of a game, like its a early beta test; sadly its been live for about 7 months. Still needs a lot of work, but all they are interested in doing is creating more things to spend the &quot;Speedboost&quot; currency&apos;s on. The best feature of Need for Speed World: it&apos;s technically free...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=1482001">Expand</a></span>

I would recommend this game since it is a good free racing game for anyone interested in them.</span>

The cars have rotations and you can buy something new the next week if you got enough cash. You can race, evade cops, do a drag race and do a team pursuit. Any mode is fun and you also get achievements from stuff you do (Racing a lot, evading road blocks, collecting specific cars and even using power ups too much), and there are 4 servers with two different regions for Europe and America. All fun if you can take things with a grain of salt and don&apos;t get bothered with people who are sometimes rude in chat, simply close the window if it happens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4089817">Expand</a></span>

This game truely is however a solid and could grow into something so much better if EA actually wanted it to. So im playing on the chicane server and have had absolutely no issues what so ever with lag or disconnects that others have been reporting.  I also have herd alot about people hacking and cheating yet once again I have not witnessed any of thus first hand so maybe they now have things under control. Im playing on a high end system and with the graphics on max with the high resolution textures the game looks very good for something that is about 4 years old now.  Game play is solid, arcade style racing and very fun.  Now alot of peeps complain about the free to play model, personally I think its fine, while i would like to see more cars available with IGC there is a good balance with bi weekly rotations for cars to purhase with in game currency. All I can say is try the game for yourself, I have out in about 100 hours over the past 4 weeks and really enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4624404">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s NEED FOR SPEED! And the first free MMO. Back in the early stages in 2010-11, there was a level cap. But they removed it and you can advance up to level 60, and it&apos;s not easy either. Second is speedboost. That sh*t was annoying, but the community found a way around it and made IGC rotations where some speedboost cars became IGC for a limited time, so everyone could try them out. The map was huge, combining Rockport and Palmont together. Lots of hackers and cheaters around but punkbuster had that under control. The best part was doing team escapes. That had you do a sprint with 3 others plus angry cops, and you had to work together to get to the finish before you use all the strikes, or busts. Then powerups. Instead of refillable NOS, World introduced single use NOS, plus some other cool things like juggernaut which makes your car a tank for a specific time. All these can be extended by skill mods applied to a car. Finally something called treasure hunt, which you search a part of the map for 15 gems. Completing the hunt everyday gives you rewards (usually skill mods or performance parts) and it gets better by getting day streaks. Sadly that EA shut down this game....it had quite alot of potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=5830244">Expand</a></span>
