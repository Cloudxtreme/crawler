There are many glitches (most annoying being the map telling you to go to the wrong places for quests), and some sequences feel clunky, like many of the melee combos. I didn&apos;t let that get to me though. Battles are still lots of fun, and better than they were in the original(less tedious feeling). The story of Zeno Clash gets exponentially better as you progress through the game, which really helped drive me to finish the game in one sitting as I did. The open world environment isn&apos;t as open I interpreted from ACE&apos;s booth at E3. My best comparison would be that it is about as open as any of the 3D &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; titles. Zeno Clash 2 has a way of fast-traveling though, so you don&apos;t have to run through half of Zenozoik just to get into town. The campaign is around 2x~ larger than the first, and paces itself just right to keep you going. The visuals are about the same quality as Skyrim, but the art style makes very beautiful levels, not as boring as Skyrim&apos;s half-forest-half-mountain environment, which barely ever changes outside. The shadows are very good and the day-night system is fun to see. Being a huge fan of Zeno Clash 1, and having waited for this game some time, I have to say I am not at all dissapointed. The developers stayed true to the original and didn&apos;t try to completely mess with the feel of the series (Portal 1 to Portal 2). I do not regret getting this game. If you liked the original, just get it now. If you&apos;re a skeptical RPGamer, buy it on sale or wait for a few bug fixes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3142908">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Zeno Clash 2 is a very unique and different first person fighting game with lots of areas to explore and enemies to fight. The combat is very smooth but I would have liked some more variation in weapons. And some of the puzzles can be very confusing when you first encounter them. But the art style and fighting are so good that the flaws aren&apos;t very noticeable when you are playing.</span>

This game is far from OK. This game is symbolic of the unperturbed vision an artist conceives. It represents the hard work and dedication of artists trusting in the purity of that vision and following through on it.
<br>
<br>What you get is an incredibly fun, simple game with a decent amount of depth, and amazing ambience, all for 20 bucks. Oh and I forgot to mention, it&apos;s open world. A simple open world, but still breathtaking in places, with plenty of little nooks and crannys to hide things.

<br>
<br>To anyone one on the fence that isn&apos;t afraid of trying something new I implore you to try out Zeno Clash. There is absolutely nothing like it. The fact that people have to reach as far as the melee in Condemned or Chronicles of Riddick to describe what kind of game it is is self-explanatory on the unique flavor the game brings. It&apos;s nothing like those (apart from punching) either.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a shame that reviewers do not realize or emphasize on that point. Not only is it something brand new; it&apos;s done very, very well. The work presented (especially in Zeno Clash 2) seems to have more work put into it than many AAA studios are able to put in. And this is only at $20, another point reviewers seem to forget. There are hundreds of different Characters you encounter that add a spice of life and immersion. From complete and awe-inducing variation of environments to unique weapons and abilities never thought of before, it&apos;s something I wish more studios would at least take a little inspiration from.
<br>
<br>The lore and story are destined to be a cult classic. Zeno Clash 1 creates many questions. Zeno Clash 2 answers them and leaves more. At face value it seems to be intelligible with no depth. You need to pry it open to realize exactly how much was put into it. The dialogue (Especially among Zenozoiks) is cryptic yet simple for a reason. Many are plagued with habits, deformities, and behavior that can be understood at least on a basic level.
<br>
<br>Please, please, PLEASE support this kind of innovative entertainment from a company like this. It pains me to see the poor reception and likely lack of sales from them when it feels like they are focusing on the game entirely wrong. Technical aspects are talked about and quite frankly are poorly researched. Complaints of locking on, when the option to do it automatically can be turned off. The AI fits the behavior of the world. Sometimes hitting eachother to get them out of the way, but also working together enough to put up a fight. It honestly doesn&apos;t feel broken or bad as some reviews have stated. It feels real and the feedback of fighting is fantastic.
<br>
<br>Anyone who has capability to understand what a game is portraying and looking beyond the face-value mechanics will find this game beyond exceptional. If you&apos;re the type of gamer who simply wants to play another game to waste time and kill things, ignore story and message, and rush through things  then please save it. Your criticism is drawing away from those who will have one of the best gaming experiences in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3148817">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s despicable how publications like IGN give this a middling score and yet every rehashed COD game (w/ 6 or 7 multiplayer maps &amp; a 5 hour singleplayer) is always guaranteed at least a 9 every year. Could it have something to do with Atlus not &quot;buying ads&quot; for their site and other gaming sites like it? I wouldn&apos;t doubt it one bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3148212">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This time the world is actually open, with day/night cycle and lots of things about the nature of Zenozoik and its inhabitants are revealed, so if you&apos;re fan, this is going to be just as great adventure as the first one and I really wonder where ACE could go with the third one, because this level of epicness may not be sustainable, given the circumstances. Combat is no longer frustrating, but I woldn&apos;t call it great either. There are collectbles with rewards, stats to upgrade, some (very simple) puzzles to solve and more. I did encounter a few bugs, but none of them were gamebreaking. ZC2 could still use some more polish, but does not really need it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3140288">Expand</a></span>

Possibly a syncing issue more than bugs?

This game has one of the best melee system for an fps in a game. Combat is varied, you can unleash different combos and throws to your enemies and it all feels right and not clunky like in Skyrim. The graphic is ok, though there are some parts in this game where the environment is beautiful. Storywise it continues after the first game and you have to play the first game to understand it. Voice acting ranges from ok to pretty much bad, but after a couple of hours into the game it gets better. Must be me adjusting to the crappyness. The game is open world this time around, so there&apos;s plenty of locations to visit. You have a map, but there&apos;s no mini map, it&apos;s all just layouts of which part of a large area you are in which makes navigating around to quest spots annoying. Overall it&apos;s ok.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3139069">Expand</a></span>

Better interface, better controls, better fight system (it&apos;s not a clusterf*ck anymore), underpowered fire weapons (finaly!!!). The plot is more about the world which is even more amazing and surprising. Great side missions (moth collector). Much better engine than valve&apos;s, which grew old very fast.</span>

<br>The iconic gameplay is still there, as it was in the original, fueling the whole game and making every fight feel fresh and challenging the visuals are excellent.

<br>The iconic gameplay is still there, as it was in the original, fueling the whole game and making every fight feel fresh and challenging the visuals are excellent. The RPG elements feel out of place to me and I&apos;d prefer a linear game to the open world game, although that&#x2019;s a personal preference.
<br>Critique:
<br>- Sound Design was pretty bad
<br>-Having your allies disappear for travel sequences and magically reappear on cut scenes, was just poorly designed
<br>-Ambient Occlusion is under sampled and/or badly filtered, no options to change it, resulting in a lot of AO flicker here and there (PC, minor complaint)
<br>The first ZC was a completely new and very underrated experience. The second can&#x2019;t quite live up to the original and the story is VERY hard to pick up, when you missed out on the original.
<br>I say:
<br>Play the original, and then buy this one.
<br>Either way, to me, this was a very good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3385157">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s scope is broadened in relation to the first, so progression is slightly less linear. But the gist of the game remains the same, with the player traveling between areas searching for items to collect and enemies to beat up (and occasionally shoot). The game has pacing problems and the combat feels worse than it did in the first one. The storytelling and world-building, which many consider the stronger point of the first game, are also less impressive this time around. Since this game doesn&apos;t necessarily do anything different from the first game, all the extra running space feels like it has no real purpose: If the intention was to foster exploration, it was not a huge success, as it looks considerably worse due to its larger areas, and that fact greatly undermines any sort of touristic pleasure. In addition to that, the rewards for exploration are poorly hidden, so you never really feel you found anything special, just another conspicuously placed power-up. I have a hard time recommending Zeno Clash II to anyone. I feel it is not nearly as good as its predecessor: It&apos;s ugly, clunky and unnecessary, and sure to be forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3140393">Expand</a></span>

There are plenty of new ideas that have been thrown into this game but all of them are poorly fleshed out or terribly implemented. They added a leveling system, but the only way to level is to find hidden totems throughout the world and you&apos;ll get a skill point. This system would have made much more sense if they gave you XP for killing an enemy, finding collectibles and maybe a big boost for finding these totems. This poor system intertwines with the terrible health system. You no longer regain health naturally, you have to get weird health-replenishing items that rarely drop from enemies but can be somewhat commonly found in random cheats placed throughout the world. Since there is absolutely no benefit to killing enemies, and you&apos;ll pretty much only lose health you won&apos;t be able to regain back by fighting them, your best bet is to just run through the level, bypassing every enemy you aren&apos;t forced to fight. The combat is more complex than it was previously, but it is also terribly clunky, slow, and unresponsive. Combos are now a big part of combat, but your character takes a second before he replies to your inputs. So, you have to input the keys you want to use first and then the character will do them a second later. But guess what, if your enemy moves away before you can input all the keys, you lose all the stamina because you missed those hits. Stamina, also a mechanic that makes absolutely no sense. You lost stamina for hitting an enemy that is blocking or missing when trying to hit an enemy. But you lose no stamina when you successfully land a punch. Hit detection is bad and the lock-on system is worse than it was previously. The game however has good textures and optimization and the same fantastic art design that was in the previous game. Also, they really made an effort to improve the story telling and you&apos;ll definitely have an idea of whats going on this time around. However, these few improvements are not enough to outweigh the drastic failure of all the new systems that have been implemented. Zeno Clash II is without a doubt worse than its predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3970327">Expand</a></span>

These are questions I asked myself during Zeno Clash 2. It is truly a wonderful and unique experience, and a beautiful game. I liked the combat flow but the story was very hard to follow and the game is short, length-wise (I got to 8 hours). Characters are neat and very inventive. The settings (my favorite is Rath-Bird Fields) look like Dr. Seuss places. Very interesting. There are guns and grenades plus a hammer to hit with. I never used the grenades. Some parts of the game are completely hard. Like I was in the End-World and I didn&apos;t know what to do at all. You have to shoot stuff at the sun, use green gas to connect orbs, light candles with moving spheres-- it&apos;s all extremely weird and hard without a Walkthrough (recommend GameSpot&apos;s). It gets pretty intense. I loved punching enemies off of cliffs and stuff. The guns are unlike the ones in a modern fps game. Pistols have no more than 12 bullets. A shotgun would surprise me if it had that much. The missions are a hit or miss. I was sometimes stuck not knowing whether to go to the cave or the End-World, canyon, or both. Some glitches here and there (I could see through protagonist&apos;s shoulder when he swung a hammer at a bird). Boss battles are a hit or miss. Sometimes very hard, sometimes easy. In the final boss battle I couldn&apos;t really tell what was going on. There are a lot of combat-combos. I can never memorize them all in games. Sometimes I just marveled at the developer&apos;s creativity. Like seriously, if there was a creativity award it would go to the Zeno Clash series. Birds hooked to a string used as beacons for fast travel? That&apos;s pretty cool. Overall an 8, this is the most amazing world I have ever experienced in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3410855">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s predecessor was &quot;that other&quot; Source Engine game, the one no one talks about, like E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy in a way. It tells the story of two adopted siblings, Ghat and Rimat, in a truly bizarre, primitive, Stonepunk world that, visually, reminded me of everything from The Neverhood to Sam &amp; Max to Sacrifice, and probably a dozen other oddities. Maybe a bit of Oddworld, I&apos;m not sure, as i&apos;ve not played those games. There is not much I can describe about the plot and setting without spoiling either this game or its predecessor. The first one has a demo, you should go check that out, at least. Suffice it to say, the siblings are on a journey that will reveal startling things about their world.

<br>Mechanically, the game is easier to explain. Combat is largely melee, good old fisticuffs. You can punch left or right, mixing them up for combos, holding down the buttons for charged attacks and using them both for specials, depleting a rage meter beneath your health. There&apos;s a lock-on function, but I found it easier to fight without it, actually. You can sprint, tackle, and kick enemies while they&apos;re down, and you can find a number of special tools to assist you, beginning with explosive skulls that you can throw like a timed grenade. The combat reminds me of nothing if not Condemed: Criminal Origins, complete with occasional melee weapons you can find in the form of hammers that do a lot more damage then mere punches. There ARE guns, but they are limited to what ammo is in them when you pick them up. Conversely they allow you to all but skip some enemies thanks to their high damage and accuracy.

<br>I recieved this game as a birthday gift from a friend insisted it was worth playing, and now I have to agree. Unlike the first game, this entry also has two-player coop, making most fights signifcantly easier then they would be otherwise. The game features a a chapter-based system where you can resume play from any previously completed point in the story, as well as collectibles and secrets to find, and a &quot;localized&quot; difficulty system wherin what difficulty a player chooses affects only their damage dealt and taken, irrespective of the other player. There are also some bonus modes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232782">Expand</a></span>
