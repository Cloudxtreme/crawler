First off, it&apos;s too short. There are only 12 levels that might take 5 minutes to get through, or even less time later on when repeat articles start to show up at your desk.
<br>
<br>The characters&apos; stories could use some work. Even though you only have 4 reporters at your disposal, I feel like I still barely know them, even after playing the whole game. The cutscenes in between levels could have been a good way to build their characters or comment on the player&apos;s decisions, but instead they never really discuss anything relevant to your progress.
<br>
<br>And speaking of progress, I never really felt that my decisions had any meaningful impact on the game. Aside from a few notes slipped onto my desk, or a staff member disappearing, the effects were fairly mild. There didn&apos;t seem to be any special events that stemmed from your editorial choices, such as disruption of delivery, or boycotts. But I did notice that some articles changed over time to reflect the effects of your choices, so credit for that.
<br>
<br>I wish there were more mechanics to the game. Edit articles, drag them onto the paper template, then drag the sliders for marketing, that&apos;s it? I feel like there were still many things to add: paper delivery, staff hiring, ad revenue, etc. If not, at least the current mechanics could have been more complex as time went on, like the increasing number of documents in Papers Please.
<br>
<br>Overall still enjoyable, but could have been much more thorough and engaging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-westport-independent/user-reviews?user_review_id=7263725">Expand</a></span>
