It gets repetitive after the 3rd level as it&apos;s usually protect/destroy then protect/destroy then protect/destroy and then sometimes there is a dogfight. The difficulty on the highest setting is more like a normal difficulty and casual is almost too easy. Though the game is indie and i don&apos;t want to be too harsh, I have to give it a 7. For other consoles it would get an 8 but it&apos;s very harder to set up a Local co-op then it is with consoles. It&apos;s an ok game if you want to just shoot some stuff, but don&apos;t expect high end story, voice acting, or humour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thunder-wolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805818">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like this game in that it&apos;s simple and yet graphically gorgeous.  You are a sketchy army helicopter pilot sent on missions to destroy the enemy.  This game in no way takes itself seriously and it&apos;s a triumphant weaving of humor and action.
<br>
<br>In terms of pros, the graphics look great, the explosions are sweet, the effects are fun, and I have yet to find a building in the game I wasn&apos;t allowed to destroy.  In terms of plot, the events of the game seem disparate at first but pull together later.  Flying the copter is quite comfortable.
<br>
<br>In terms of cons, the voice acting is supposed to be overdone but sometimes it comes at weird and inconvenient times where you&apos;re engaged with multiple enemies and don&apos;t have time to catch the plot.  Also, they need to let us rebind our keys and the menu screen is dangerous  one wrong click and you&apos;re suddenly launching a new game.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a fun game to have if you&apos;re looking for a funny action title to just sit back and unwind with.  You should check this one out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thunder-wolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207779">Expand</a></span>

The controls are very casual and the gameplay is more focused on the constant action and explosions than having depth and worrying about the plot. That said, the plot is lame, voice acting is shoddy, but who cares. Great simplistic fun packaged in a way that games just arent done anymore. Give it a whirl.</span>

This game is fun.  It caters to the roll-in blow stuff up badass hero that my inner child loves.  And it does it far better than a well known major franchise. *cough* Ace combat  AH.  Especially with rail shooting.  God, I hate rail modes.  They are nothing more than novelty. But I don&apos;t mind them in this game.  Hell, even one of them was fun.  I think it&apos;s because they are used to accomplish a part of the story, and then that&apos;s it, they bring you back to the cocpit.  (the correct spelling is blocked by profanity filters.  ha ha.)
<br>
<br>I chose to use an xbox 360 controller for this game.  I had some issues with keeping the targeting reticule on small troops.  But, and this I wish more games did, the mouse was not disabled by using the controller.  I just moved my hand to mouse targeting to get those hard to reach places, and moved back to the controller.  No effort, no pausing.
<br>
<br>I would like a profanity filter option.  I like the foul language, but I also have children under 10, so I can&apos;t let them play or play it myself while they are around.
<br>
<br>I also have not finished the game, so I can&apos;t say anything about re playability or end game pacing.
<br>
<br>Overall, not the best game, but great when my mind is shot from work and I want simple thrills.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thunder-wolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3883142">Expand</a></span>
