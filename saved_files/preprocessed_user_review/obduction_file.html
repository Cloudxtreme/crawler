You should definitely consider them before buying too. First - loading screens. Yes, lots of games have long load times but it particularly hurts Obduction because of one of its core game play mechanics. It features several worlds, which you regularly have to teleport between to solve puzzles. In some sections, you&apos;ll be teleporting between them several times in a space of about 5 minutes. On a high-end machine, these can be up to a minute long each time. As well as being very frustrating, it makes the game much harder. Games like this encourage you to try everything to solve puzzles. But if you&apos;re unwilling to try teleportating (which is the answer quite often) because you don&apos;t want to sit on your hands while the game loads, you&apos;re going to spend far longer solving puzzles than you might have and you&apos;ll feel very frustrated when you do. The second thing is the story. For much of the first half, there&apos;s quite a bit to read and learn and the game gives the impression of great depth, in the vein of games like Bioshock and Alien:Isolation. But later on this depth disappears. By the time what you learned at the beginning becomes relevant, you&apos;ll already have forgotten it all, leading to an ending that feels abrupt and left many people (judging from the forums) wondering what the hell happened. Whilst many of the puzzles are clever and challenging without being unintuitive, they are spread a bit to thinly between much easier puzzles that mainly involve travelling a great deal (which makes me wonder why on earth they would include a &apos;point-and-click&apos; control option).
<br>
<br>This isn&apos;t to say Obduction isn&apos;t worth playing. It has more content and engagement than 90% of puzzle games out there. But I can&apos;t help thinking there was some last minute corner cutting that results in a finish product more like vanilla ice-cream with chocolate chips than a full fat, triple chocolate masterpiece; the fun parts are there, but you&apos;ll have to dig to find them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679885">Expand</a></span>

As true successor to Myst, Obduction really delve into those core principles but sadly most of the time it&apos;s execution is flawed by some really bad design decisions.
<br>
<br>The exploration part is good, not quite linear yet focused enough and most importantly: the environments are diverse, grandiose and sometimes beautiful (other times: awkward and clunky). Where the game fails, as other reviews mentioned is mainly in the puzzles. Most of them really are simplistic and few require some form of lateral thinking. Most of the time, the solution is outright given upon discovering some piece of paper that will connect the dots for you. When puzzles do require a bit of logic, most of the time they are not really complex nor ingenious but rather extremely tedious given the time/loading time required to perform some step of the solution (imagine solving a simple Sudoku problem where you need to take a 15 minutes stroll across the park prior to the writing of any number). As for the subtle details, there are some (some directly copied from the ol&apos; Myst formula) but most of the time, the clues are plain and obvious. To be sure, the Myst series feeling remains but it surely, this is no Riven. (A side note, for puzzle aficionados: the puzzle quality is far below of what can be found in Talos Principle, The Witness, Braid, Tetrobot and Co., Stephen&apos;s Sausages Roll, etc. to name a few).
<br>
<br>In terms of graphical quality, to be honest, given Myst&apos;s legacy, my expectations were also a bit higher. For some reason I spent a lot of time adjusting my gamma settings for it never felt quite right (below some threshold, some places looked just perfect, others were too dark, and vice versa). In some worlds the meshes/models resolution felt quite poor giving an overall impression of 2010 era graphics. As for the textures and lightning, it&apos;s mostly good and if you have a machine powerful enough: do crank the resolution scale up to 200 - it&apos;s really worth it on the texture side (otherwise, the whole game might look blurry). One good point: the game seems performs quite well and because of the resolution scale mechanism, it seems it can fairly accommodate a wide range of hardware specs. Overall, I was expecting something on par with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter but got something quite below.
<br>
<br>As for the sound ambiance, this is one of the highest points of the game. The music itself is bland, nothing to fall for but the sound effects are very well done.
<br>
<br>Overall, it took me 13 hours to finish the game and found most of it to be a somewhat tedious experience. I appreciate the effort cyan has put into this and in itself, the game surely is a nice technical achievement but it would surely have benefited of more though into it&apos;s puzzle design (not to say it&apos;s an easy thing).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6691874">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re someone who remembers playing Myst for the first time then Obduction from Cyan, their brand new offering, brings flooding back those feelings of wonder, mystery, excitement and spine tingling anticipation. Hunrath is a whole new world to explore, puzzles to solve, questions to answer, mysteries to unravel. The graphics are stunningly beautiful and the music haunting as you find yourself transported to a place of desolation and decay. Why are you there, what has happened to everyone? That&apos;s for you to discover. I&apos;ve waited a long time for this game and the wait was worth every minute, I cannot rate it highly enough. Yes it is demanding of your computing specs and I&apos;m sure it will be demanding of my time, but it&apos;s not often you come across a game so unique, so beautiful and so rewarding. Seriously, if you&apos;re only going to get one game this year, this has to be it!! Oh, and for MOUL fans, it has cones - brilliant!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6663533">Expand</a></span>

If a game is entirely dependent on its spiritual successor then that is a Fail. This isn&apos;t Myst or Riven and I don&apos;t want to HAVE to have played those games in order to appreciate Obduction.
<br>As an exploration game this is quite a reasonable title with some pretty graphics and nice environments, and there is initially an intriguing narrative and plot premise that unfortunately takes a nosedive rather rapidly.
<br>As for the puzzles, despite other reviewers proclaiming eureka &quot;Ah&quot; moments, on the whole they are dull and without any real logic. Found an intriguing box with lots of switches buttons and numbers to interact with? Don&apos;t worry, you won&apos;t have to do any code breaking, just explore a little more and the code to unlock it will be found on a slip of paper. Some of the puzzle solving has to be done by swapping to different worlds which due to unnecessarily long loading times becomes tedious a chore and ultimately is a gamebreaker.
<br>Part of Obduction&apos;s charm may well be the Open World Exploration aspect, but without any real driving narrative or focus, navigating around aimlessly becomes frustrating.
<br>Think hard before you buy this title at its present price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6682814">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cyan has created worlds that, while strange, new and alien, they make sense. Every object works the way it does for a reason and if you explore and observe enough, you will figure it out. If something doesn&apos;t simply work, then you know that you are required to find a new way around it. These are lived in worlds and it shows.

<br>I couldn&apos;t stop playing after firing it up 4 hours ago. Yikes. I can&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve played something that has made me feel this way. This game is well priced and totally worth it. If you have doubts just download it on steam and play it for less than an hour, if you don&apos;t like it, get a refund. I think you will keep on exploring though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6664268">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m incredibly impressed by Obduction, Cyan has done it again! The game has the familiar myst-like feeling that brings me right back to my childhood when I first got to explore the Myst Island and I had no idea why I was there and what was going on, arriving in Hunrath has the exact same feeling. It also brought me back to taking my first steps in The Cleft and Minkata in Uru (even the footsteps sound suspiciously alike). Except this time things are alien, even eerier, even more beautiful, even more awe-inspiring, even more confusing.
<br>
<br>The game feels like a more matured version of the Myst games; you can tell that the developers have taken everything they learned from the previous games and with that experience (and perhaps the wisdom gained with age) have crafted a story that has a new kind of depth - where puzzles are not just intricate parts of the environment, as was the case in the Myst games, but that feel truly handcrafted with purpose by different civilizations, puzzles that takes it one step beyond the Myst games in how they merge with the setting.
<br>
<br>PERFORMANCE
<br>
<br>I have a GTX 660 graphics card, i7 2600k processor, 8gb ram, SSHD, and Windows 10 x64 which basically puts me at minimum spec with my graphics card and above recommended with processor. The game is pretty well optimized provided I play on low settings with the exception of textures that I put on medium. I experienced a few lag spikes and long loading screens here and there but nothing major or that I can&apos;t live with but it definitely seems the game is graphics intensive.
<br>
<br>That said, I get the feeling this game would still be playable with a graphics card one tier below mine but it&apos;s hard to say so don&apos;t take my word for it. The graphics aren&apos;t super amazing on low settings with some pixelation, especially with the shadows but it&apos;s still a fairly pretty game. If you really care about good graphics for your gaming experience I would suggest playing this game with the recommended or above specs, I believe at that level this game will be absolutely astonishing.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>
<br>* Myst-like
<br>* Fun unique mechanics
<br>* Beautiful graphics, textures, sounds etc. the ambience is just superb
<br>* Nostalgic moments and great easter eggs
<br>* A riveting and unsettling story that leaves you guessing throughout
<br>* Pretty well optimized for the most part but not perfect with minimum spec graphics card
<br>* Good mix of easy, medium, and mind-boggling hard puzzles that make you want to rage quit in a good way like good old Riven. A couple of things are pure evil and I think the devs had a little bit too much fun torturing us poor Hunrathians but at the same time it&apos;s kind of funny in hindsight.
<br>* Great to play as a family or with multiple people to help solve puzzles. While the rating says 10+ it&apos;s probably okay with adult supervision under that, but that&apos;s just my opinion. I think the Cyan games in general are great educational tools for problem solving, patience, and out of the box thinking.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>
<br>* Occasional lag spikes with minimum spec graphics card
<br>* Occasional long loading screens
<br>* a few minor glitches/bugs here and there but nothing major and most are hardly noticeable, a couple of small slightly irritating mechanics but again nothing gamebreaking.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. If you love puzzles, mystery, eerie atmospheres, casual exploration, and an immersive environment - you do NOT want to miss out on this game. If you are new to the genre this game will be a great example of a stellar casual adventure puzzle game. If you care a lot about graphics play on recommended or higher spec. Overall, very much worth every penny. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6661470">Expand</a></span>

The scenery is stunning, the story intriguing, and the puzzles elegant in their simple complexity -- if you&apos;ve played their games before you know all about that and, if not, you are in for a real mind bending treat!
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t run into any bugs in the game or problems playing with my set up: GTX 780, i7 4930K tray, 32gb ram, SSHD, Win 10 x64. I did the auto detect for graphic settings in the game (all epic with water at high) and the graphics are amazing.  I have noticed that if I am by the water for a long time the fans step it up but the temps are doing just fine at this resolution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6665261">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been fortunate to have had that experience five times in the past twenty years.
<br>
<br>...until Wednesday, when I finally got to experience the beauty of the worlds of Obduction, Cyan&apos;s sixth game. The trepidation I felt that morning as the game was installing was because I assumed no game could live up to the personal hype I&apos;d created for myself by waiting for this game for three years... and for ANY Cyan game for at least twelve years.
<br>
<br>Imagine my delight, now that I&apos;m fifteen hours into the game, to realize that I had not given Cyan enough credit (despite their having never let me down before). I&apos;d readied myself appropriately: upgraded my old graphics card and RAM months earlier (specifically for this game), then on Wednesday cleared my schedule, ignored the phone, turned down the lights, and hit PLAY.
<br>
<br>Within minutes, one thought glued itself to the back of my mind: This is why the other 100+ adventure games I&apos;ve been buying in the past decade completely suck. THIS is why I have spent too much time and money since 2004 trying to recreate something that would never be recreated by anyone but Cyan.
<br>
<br>My only concern now is that I will greedily devour this game in large chunks and it will be over too soon. So I am deliberately slowing my pace. You only go around once in this life... and in these worlds. I don&apos;t want to miss anything.
<br>
<br>Cyan Worlds, welcome back. You&apos;re what I&apos;ve been waiting for. Just don&apos;t make me wait another twelve years for the next one.

One &apos;puzzle&apos; in this game is remedial, it&apos;s essentially just an average board of Pipe-Mania, nothing special. This puzzle, if you had all the tools in front of you to solve it, would be completed in ten minutes. Instead, they purposefully obfuscated it and separated the controls by loading screens. They also separated how you could view the puzzle by more loading screens. On top of that, you&apos;re forced to take pointlessly long walks (for minutes at a time) and endure more loading screens just to reach more &apos;pieces&apos; used to solve the same puzzle.
<br>
<br>Whereas a good puzzle game will give you everything you need in the same area, this is more like a point &amp; click. Except that imagine you had to walk for a few minutes to go get multiple objects because your inventory could only hold one at a time, now imagine that this point &amp; click adventure had loading screens that could last for up to ten minutes for every time you had to trek back. That&apos;s what it&apos;s like.
<br>
<br>So, instead of being able to solve this puzzle in ten minutes (because it really is a remedial puzzle), it&apos;ll take you hours of trekking along, going through loading screens, more loading screens, more trekking, more loading screens, more loading screens, more trekking, more loading screens, more trekking, and then it glitches out! Yes, this is a puzzle that&apos;s so bad it can glitch out and become unsolvable, and that&apos;s lead to some... fiery threads on the forums, that&apos;s for sure. You can actually end up in an infinite loop of loading screens and long walks.
<br>
<br>Essentially, they managed to create a first person Skinner box puzzle. It&apos;s going to addict people to it to solve it and see what&apos;s past it. It&apos;s almost Candy Crush Saga but in first person. It&apos;s truly remarkable, but also horrifying. If you like grinding, feel free. And the game, in general, is just broken, uninspired, and has many more Skinner box elements to trick the weak minded. I&apos;m not weak minded, so I just let it rest. I have better games to play. I don&apos;t appreciate Skinner boxes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6681402">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and movement system are much better, but the puzzles are too hard for most of us. You could spend the next year, full-time, moving randomly through this gigantic maze and never find the way out. It comes down to using a cookbook for a fine-print recipe 8 pages long written by somebody on the Internet who&apos;s not proficient in English to get through the game. The story is engaging but the puzzle-making is inept. Puzzles should be soluble logically, not through random variation. An example of one of the easier puzzles: There&apos;s a locked door with a rotary phone dial and an LED display. Nearby is a hodgepodge room that serves as the mayor&apos;s office, but nobody&apos;s home. On the mayor&apos;s desk is a compass. If you pick it up, it looks just like what I had in Boy Scouts. If you think to turn it over, the name of a US state is inscribed on the back. Suppose it says &apos;Maine&apos;. You may recall that in the abandoned service station a few blocks away are some license plates nailed to the wall. That&apos;s if you&apos;ve already managed to find your way inside, which is not trivial. You may have &apos;photographed&apos; that wall, but the game&apos;s photo album is buggy so you can&apos;t see the one you want. So you go back to the service station and copy down the license plate &apos;number&apos; -- let&apos;s say it&apos;s YOU FUL. OK, now it&apos;s time to think of the rotary telephone dial you saw yesterday in a distant location. Translate the letters from the license plate into numbers as you would in dialing one of those memorable 800 numbers like 1-800-CALL_TODAY. The door opens and you&apos;re ready to figure out what to do next, which will be a random exploration of a puzzling environment. And that was a relatively easy and logical puzzle compared to most in this chaotic maze of old and new technology and unfamiliar cultural references. It was a noble effort but I think you&apos;ll find there are better ways to waste your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6680255">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like taking a great crossword puzzle (the Witness) and having the best writers, illustrators and puzzle designers do a makeover (Obduction). They even managed to have it feel exactly as Myst or Riven (only in Unreal Engine 4). Not a score of 10 because they really had deadline stress and did not manage to fix loading and UI bugs properly. Can&apos;t wait to try this on the Occulus Rift, this will be nerd-gastic. Love to see that Cyan&apos;s back.

I&apos;ve been a die hard fan of Cyan since Myst first came out.  The only issues I&apos;ve had with this game so far are some technical glitches but honestly on the day of launch every PC Game I&apos;ve had at launch has had issues.  And the ones that it does have are not gamebreaking for me and I&apos;m running a setup that&apos;s a little under the min specs for the game.
<br>
<br>Even with that it is an absolutely gorgeous game and the puzzles blend in with the environment seamlessly so far and I&apos;ve only found once in 9 hours that a rather odd leap in logic was needed to get one of the passcodes.  The music is also a perfect fit for the environments.  All in all I have to say that Cyan has done it again.  I can&apos;t wait to upgrade my hardware to see just how pretty it can get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6663927">Expand</a></span>

<br>On top of being visually and musically stunning, Cyan has taken the unique in the gaming world step of providing a point &amp; click movement option, not only for the Myst nostalgia factor, but to allow players with inner ear issues, vertigo and other motion-sickness causing issues to play the game. Given the sheer number of games released that are impossible to play for people with things like VIMS, Obduction is a breath of fresh air.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6674400">Expand</a></span>

<br>I must admit the Myst/Riven-o-phile in me was excited, delighted, and yet a bit ...hmm.. &apos;will-this-be-as-great-or-will-it-tarnish-my-fond-memories&quot; feeling as I watched the downloading bar.  Am pleased to say memories intact, wonder piqued, and immersive level just as I would have wished. Tip: you may want to turn off &quot;backer reward item,&quot; setting if you don&apos;t want your immersed feelings dinged.
<br>
<br>Gameplay has been smooth, Cyan has been quickly responsive to bug fixes already, the game feels true to those of the past in complexity -- thank you Cyan for not having dumbed it down -- and the graphics are as beautiful as one would expect from the team who defined this genre.

<br>GTX 960, i7-6700, 16GB RAM, Windows 10 x64.  All settings on epic including water, running smooth.

I also love Uru. So, it was with great expectation that I awaited Obduction - the first Cyan game in years and a departure from the Myst series. Happily, I can say that my expectations were not only met but wildly exceeded.
<br>
<br>Graphically, this game is absolutely beautiful. Its not just the high quality of the unreal 4 engine rendering, either - its the attention to detail in every little thing - the art and the art direction. The worlds of Obduction are breathtaking.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are typical Cyan masterpieces, too. No one else has this kind of cleverness and finesse. In Obduction there is what I would call an &quot;ecosystem&quot; of puzzles - everything is logical and organic. None of the puzzles feel like or look like puzzles, because they are fully and rationally integrated with the environment and story. Some of them are very challenging; some of them are easy but rewarding. Every step forward feels like a discovery and an accomplishment.
<br>
<br>The story is intriguing, and the voice acting is wonderful.
<br>
<br>The music is, as always, perfect.
<br>
<br>Really, I could not ask for more, and if it continues to be this good right through to the end, this game could easily rival Riven for me as an experience - something I never thought I would say of a game again.
<br>
<br>Whether or not you have played any of the Myst games, if you like games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or The Talos Principle, high qaulity, contemplative, thinker&apos;s games, then you really must play Obduction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675259">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_7269956"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Silly old me thought for the longest time that the title of the semi-spiritual successor to Myst/Riven/All-That-Good-Stuff point and click adventure was a mere typo or perhaps creative indifference to the spelling of abduction. As it stands, I think it rather ironically would encapsulate the narrative in either its present spelling or that alternative. Obduction instead refers in no small part to something along the lines of opposite subduction, or rather oceanic lithosphere forcing itself over continental counterparts.
<br>
<br>All that scientific banter aside, Obduction really is a fitting title for this game and since I&#x2019;m seeking to avoid spoiling the majority of the narrative, I&#x2019;ll say little more than that. At first glance it seems like just another adventure seeking to cash in on this newfangled idea of nuevo-retro. What I mean by this is that it takes an old gaming concept and places it into a new gaming era and melds the best of both worlds, or in this case multiple realms. The narrative and lore behind Obduction is certainly one of its strongest points and like the Myst saga, I really enjoyed how it was fleshed out and how things are rarely as they initially seem.
<br>
<br>Even with Cyan Worlds having developed the game with the thought in mind for it to be a spiritual successor to Myst/Riven, the only ways in which it is truly similar stem from the gameplay and some of the ideas of travel and various worlds and time displacements and similarly intriguing alien technology. If you know anything about the Myst series- whether it be lore or gameplay or overall narrative, then you may find this particular title engaging as well. The most interesting of all the narrative elements and potential in Obduction is definitely the meshing of several worlds and several time periods. For example, there is an advanced alien subculture lying dormant right alongside a displaced wild western town straight out of the late eighteen hundreds.
<br>
<br>Perhaps another of the unintended and yet awesomely interesting elements of the game is the ambiguity surrounding narrative and character choice. Certainly, some things will undoubtedly seem and in fact be very linear throughout the adventure. However there are also particular points littered throughout the story where your character&#x2019;s journey or the concurrent adventures of the few other beings you encounter may come to an abrupt and even brutally twisted end. I won&#x2019;t say much more for fear of ruining some of the finer endgame moments, but suffice it to say few things are as they seem.
<br>
<br>Obduction, if it aspires to be anything else or anything other, is certainly a game revolving around unintended consequences and brilliance of simple design. I think that is probably one of its other admirable traits, and it is definitely something we don&#x2019;t see as much nowadays or perhaps ever. I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure itself for the feelings it elicited, the narrative tropes it trod, and the lore it hid slightly beneath the surface. It is always invigorating to experience something along the lines of a thrill ride in such a seemingly archaic and simple adventure game revolving around core mechanics such as light puzzle solving and information gathering. Yes, it can inevitably have its boring or even low points, but if you stick by it then the payoff is totally worth it.
<br>
<br>For what it&#x2019;s worth, I have only good things to say about this particular title as a whole and I would probably give it somewhere between an 8.0 and 8.5 out of ten. That&#x2019;s high praise coming from me and something I believe it is entirely deserving of as well. I implore you to give it a whirl if you&#x2019;re into old school adventures, an interesting story, or simply want to branch out into a new genre of gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=7269956">Expand</a></span>

(Instead, they&apos;ve invented a new backstory that&apos;s similarly mystical and weird, and just as interesting.) I don&apos;t know why some people say the puzzles aren&apos;t as challenging: I&apos;m finding myself just as stumped (and occasionally frustrated) as I did years ago, with the older Myst titles -- if not more so. (Maybe I&apos;m just getting dumber in my old age?)
<br>
<br>The artistry is great, the technical execution is really smooth, and the mysteries sci-fi plot elements are fun to gradually unravel and explore. I really hope this game is commercially successful enough that Rand Miller and his Cyan crew come out with another game soon!

By trying to cater to the attention span of a modern audience, the puzzles and obfuscation that make up the gameplay of a classic adventure game get compromised.
<br>
<br>Obduction is very much an exception. (Actual puzzles, in 2016?!) Cyan manages to capture the difficulty and atmosphere of their classic 90&apos;s titles Myst and Riven, while still creating a game that contains new, ingenious ideas, and feels technically modern. Obduction looks and sounds beautiful, in the same way Myst and Riven looked and sounded beautiful back in 1994 and 1997, respectively.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m delighted to say that I actually got stuck a couple of times in this game. This might sound weird to some younger people, but getting stuck is actually what makes up gameplay in an adventure game. The feeling of satisfaction you get from finally figuring out a difficult puzzle after traversing the same area over and over in search of missed clues, is unparalleled. In this area, Obduction delivers. More so than most entries in the adventure game genre as of late, that hold your hand way too much in the name of keeping unfamiliar players interested. Make no mistake, this is a game for adventure game fans.
<br>
<br>Cyan has a way of telling stories backwards in a way. When you start the game, most important events in the storyline have already taken place. The only way to understand any of what is going on is by paying a lot of attention to your surroundings and by reading documents and journals scattered throughout the game world(s), left behind by characters that are no longer anywhere to be found. This is very much optional. You could complete the game without taking in almost anything of the story, but that would probably leave you very unsatisfied by the ending. A penchant for detective-work is almost a requirement for having a glimmer of a chance of understanding even some parts of this rather complex (but certainly very interesting) universe. This is, in my opinion, the only potentially negative aspect of this game, that is a wonderful return to form for the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6681667">Expand</a></span>

<br>Try this instead: if you&#x2019;ve ever considered giving puzzle-solving adventure games a try (and your computer can run it), please do so by playing Obduction. It&#x2019;s sleek, it&#x2019;s modern, it&#x2019;s decades of self-taught lessons on game design coming to fruition. It&#x2019;s so dense and organic that you never run out of stuff to try out, and it all meshes and intersects in such fun ways, one &#x201C;a-ha!&#x201D; moment after the other, separated only by jaw-dropping strolls through magnificent environments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6681672">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s remarkable that there are not many modern examples of Myst &quot;clones&quot;, considering that it was the best selling PC game for almost a decade until The Sims came out. There are however two recent examples that, while interesting games on their own, never really captured the wondrous nature of Miller brother&apos;s games. The Talos Principle and The Witness both tried to represent the legacy, and while both have incredible attributes, I like Obduction better. It has a far more compelling and interesting lore than either, and less brain-aneurysm causing puzzles than The Witness.
<br>
<br>The thing that those games didn&apos;t get, and what Cyan does - even after 20 odd years - is that to make an engaging world full of wonder, the puzzles and the history of the world have to be intrinsically tied. If you took every puzzle in The Witness and stripped it away from the context of the world, you would you would be left with a fun set of puzzles on one hand, and a quiet world to explore on the other. This would be impossible in Obduction or Myst or Riven because the puzzles are the world. The feeling of wonder and mystery you get from these worlds comes from trying to understand how the strange technology and logic works around you. There is a moment early on in Obduction where you have to learn an alien numbering system to solve puzzles later in the game. This doesn&apos;t feel &quot;gamey&quot; or contrived because there is a reason for it to exist in the logic and lore of the game.
<br>
<br>So yeah, check it out if you&apos;re looking for that kind of experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6683309">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, the loading screens are a bit long, and yes, the FMV is a little retro, and yes, there are some bugs at present time.  My feeling is that as the devs patch the game this will improve, but for now these minor flaws are enough to hold me back from a 10.
<br>
<br>The game is a niche game, aimed at a niche audience that appreciates this style of game.  If you hate puzzles and have a short attention span, this game is not meant for you.  If, however, you like puzzles and have some patience for putting everything together, you will love Obduction and find many things to enjoy here.
<br>
<br>The graphics are beautiful - detailed and imaginative, with superb art direction.  On a higher-end PC or in VR, you will frequently find yourself in awe of the spectacular design work here.
<br>The sound design is likewise compelling, especially the beautiful and eerie ambient music score.
<br>Even the puzzles - they&apos;re hard, yes, but mostly they&apos;re very logically constructed and definitely solvable if you think things through.  I appreciate also the fact that as with Riven, the puzzles aren&apos;t tacked on.  They seem to be a large part of the world and make sense within it.  Sometimes they&apos;re clever, and the realization of how these worlds operate (in several ways) is going to give you a sense of wonder or at least a bit of surprise.  It&apos;s also key to solving these puzzles and moving forward.
<br>The story is a fragmented thing told through exploration and observation of the gameworld, audio recordings, documents on paper, holographic recordings and other FMV.  It actually adds up fairly well if you pause to put the different details together, but it is at times hokey and at others absorbing and surprising.  But definitely you&apos;re left to connect the dots on your own at times and it won&apos;t add up if you didn&apos;t put it together on your own by reading and filling in the blanks.
<br>
<br>There are also a lot of details and easter eggs scattered in the game which are clearly meant for Myst fans (or for backers of the game who requested this or that object on a shelf somewhere) - and this can be both entertaining and slightly confusing as these items do add slightly more visual clutter to the game, and make it that much harder to parse what objects matter for a puzzle and which are just red herrings.  Easter Eggs and hidden items vary - my reaction was sometimes &apos;this is goofy and mildly distracting as far as immersion goes&apos; and other times &apos;that&apos;s cool&apos;.
<br>
<br>All in all, I am quite happy with how Obduction turned out.  I can&apos;t help but wonder what worlds and stories Cyan will pursue next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6683703">Expand</a></span>

You will routinely be confronted with locked doors that frustrate until you scour the land to find their obtusely hidden codes/keys, this can be maddening yet it&apos;s quite satisfying once you finally start popping them open and discovering what they hide.
<br>
<br>I can understand some people hitting a wall and giving up or looking up a walkthrough to get past the odd section, sometimes the path to progress is in another world and will take several jaunts back and forth to get everything &apos;right&apos;. The loading screens during those times can become tedious even if your PC is up to snuff.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s certainly worth a look all the same, it&apos;s very pretty in places and the desire to see the various contraptions come to life becomes quite compelling pipe-dream early on. I&apos;d recommend playing it until it stumps you then coming back a week later, that way you can appreciate the slow-burn rather than uninstalling it in a fit of pique as I nearly did and would have regretted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/obduction/user-reviews?user_review_id=6786517">Expand</a></span>

The environments are varied, detailed and beautiful, just like any Myst game. The exploration is great, with an integrering story to dig into in order to learn what the place is about and what is going on. The puzzles are not too easy, and not too hard, and you feel real satisfaction making your way through them. No story related bugs what so ever and the plot progresses in a nice organic way.
<br>
<br>My only complaints are that the teleportation is slow. I realize that they are in place to mask a loading screen, but frankly, I&apos;d prefer that to those flickering spots, especially since you have to teleport a lot at one point of the story. A little something to read - an interesting fact or a little tidbit about the plot - would greatly improve that particular issue. Also, the camera movement &quot;stutters&quot; when the game loads new graphic which can be a bit disorienting at times and I&apos;ve experienced one or two crashes too many to give this game a higher score. Some improvements stability and efficiency would be welcomed.
<br>
<br>However, despite its issues Obduktion is a great game! if you&apos;re a fan of Myst, you&apos;ll like it for sure.
