There were the usual frustrations inherent in the adventure point and click genre, the sometimes slow and tedious running about and all that. But none of that detracted from my enjoyment of the story and ambient music.
<br>
<br>Definitely a recommend for anybody who loves a good noir ghost story.</span>

<br>
<br>The game is an emotional rollercoaster with interesting plot twists. It has likable characters, plenty of great dialogue, great atmosphere and music. The user score here baffles me - this is one of the best games for those that like story based games. Puzzles are reasonable - the game has basically no vices of adventure games of old (pixel hunting and such).
<br>
<br>A must play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-blackwell-epiphany/user-reviews?user_review_id=4864234">Expand</a></span>

<br>What really must be addressed about this</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A great ending to a great series, with a lot of twists that will make you see the end at all costs, especially if you&apos;ve been waiting for it for all this time. It is also the longest chapter of the entire series, if I have to say, finishing it in about 6-7 hours (the others are shorter, with 4 hours tops if you replay them for the achievements).
<br>
<br>What really must be addressed about this game is, if you haven&apos;t played the first games, you &quot;might&quot; be confused for some parts or some scenes, since it&apos;s heavily tied up with the other games. In addition this game is definitely more expensive than the previous chapters (I paid 15 euros) and I don&apos;t recall the other games to be all that expensive at launch (although now you can buy the first 4 games in a bundle, which is a must if you want to enjoy the games fully). Aside that, the graphics are similar, if not the same, of the fourth chapter, which was kinda weaker than the third but much more fluid in movement. Voice acting is still pretty good, and puzzles are not hard but still challenging that you have to think up, since you can control two characters and they work differently.
<br>
<br>And the ending is definitely something to see...and kinda unexpected, I won&apos;t spoil though, but It was rather bitter sweet.
<br>
<br>Best chapter so far, and a great ending: must try if you have the previous ones, give it a look if you&apos;re curious...but make sure to get the other chapters as well, if you plan to fully enjoy the entire series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-blackwell-epiphany/user-reviews?user_review_id=4158766">Expand</a></span>

<br>the story is mature, the puzzles may be too easy for an adventure pro, but they fit in. the length of the title is appropriate actually and the graphics - at first i had my doubts. i think the graphical presentation should always support the story and setting - and i was not so sure about the retro pixel art look at first but started to love it.
