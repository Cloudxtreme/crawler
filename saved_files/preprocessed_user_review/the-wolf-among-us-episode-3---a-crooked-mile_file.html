<br>
<br>A crooked mile starts out at a tense and brooding pace and does nothing throughout its length to ease the player of its dreary tale. Gone is Toad, with not one in person appearance. :&apos;( Overall with the exception of a bar sequence with Grendel and Holly, is there a laugh to be had. This is for better or for worse as I am torn between satisfaction and dreariness. I do understand that this is a dark tale but it could have done with a moment where the player can reflect a bit on the story before moving on. All is well though, as the episode ends with an epic and inviting conclusion just right at the line of uncomfortable.
<br>
<br>The choices this time around feel less substantial than before, however, and it was slightly more predictable story wise. Also, there isn&apos;t hardly as much player interaction outside of mashing q a few times, and I played the majority of the game with one hand. This all being said though, the series strongest card to play is the story and there is so much here that all of these flaws are easily forgivable. However much I wish the gaps in between releases were much shorter, I am looking forward to continuing on and seeing where the tale leads. Another solid release and much better than smoke and mirrors. I am going to go play it again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-3---a-crooked-mile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4124861">Expand</a></span>

The Episode is one of the best Telltale had ever brought to us, and if it was alittle longer then it&apos;s 1.5 hour length, it would have been in my opinion the best episode Telltale ever made. With it&apos;s length, its &quot;only&quot; one of their best.</span>

Episode 3, while still not as amazing as episode 1, manages to offer yet another wonderful experience, building up more intrigue and with some really tough choices to make. It is not the best thing Telltale has put up yet, but it was a good time nonetheless.
<br>Firstly, this episode is all about character bonding. The characters you were introduced in the first two chapters that you thought didn&apos;t matter  do matter in this episode, especially talking about Holly, the bartender slash troll. We also get to meet some amazing new characters, by far the best of all and most interesting villain Bloody Mary played wonderfully by Kat Cressida.
<br>There are not many intense action sequences like in the first game, and I happen to found lots of framerate slow-downs at the beginning, and a very frustrating glitch at the end which made me take a decission I didn&apos;t want to. Still, the choices the game presents you, while storywise pretty much nonexistent, are mind-bending anyway.
<br>The ending, finally, is not much of a cliffhanger but more a clean, confusing scene where are suspicions and our minds are completely puzzled off (Seriously, any character in the game can be the murderer at this stage). Telltale delivered another memorable chapter on its impressive portfolio of games, and as always, I am excited to see what&apos;s next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-3---a-crooked-mile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4129138">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>All in all, A Crooked Mile is probably my favorite episode of the season thus far and one of my favorite Telltale episodic releases to date as well, beating out even several Walking Dead episodes in recent memory. The pacing, the outcomes of decisions, and the data all streaming together make it a worthwhile episode to experience and the continuation of an interesting narrative truly is a beautiful sight to behold indeed. Just when you think you can see how the cake will bake, you realize you&apos;re in fact peeling an onion and that for each layer gone there are several more thin ones beneath. If the series here were a beast, it probably be a hydra- for every one problem fixed two more or even three, in this case, seem to show up. Even better, there&apos;s a slight revelation at the end of the chapter- well two really, and I&apos;m interested to see what they will entail in the final two to come...
<br>
<br>Concept: Are you ready to beat some heads, investigate some new leads, and take the law into your hands as the Big Bad Wolf once more? You&apos;d better come prepared for the axe to drop if you&apos;re planning on playing this episode.
<br>
<br>Graphics: If you thought the previous episodes were dark and gritty, be prepared to embrace an even darker narrative series of twists as Bigby and Co explore the leads they&apos;ve been given and encounter some...unexpected circumstances.
<br>
<br>Sound: The voice acting is still very well done, the diverse characters you encounter really feel like different people- and sound like it to of course. All in all the tense moments play to the perfect beat and the soundtrack elements never miss a thematic shuffle about hitherto thitherto.
<br>
<br>Playability: The controls are tighter than before, which is an added bonus even though they worked pretty much perfectly already. Also, the dialogue has been significantly beefed up and the role-playing elements increased further to boot.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: The story continues to evolve in interesting and mostly unexpected ways, and you&apos;ll have to hold on for dear life if you want to make it all the way to the final destination it intends to bring you to- roaring full tilt the entire way. I have a feeling we won&apos;t be getting a mellow ending anytime soon...
<br>
<br>Replay Value: High.
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 8.75</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-3---a-crooked-mile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4143727">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>All you do is choose what sentences to say that has a timer attached to it that creates an illusion that what you are doing/saying is extremely important . . . it is not. There really is no consequences to your actions.
<br>
<br>In the previous episodes there was actually quite a few things to do, many things to discover and learn more about the characters that fills this story, but this? 3 to 4 places to &quot;search&quot; for crane. This episode just felt like a filler of some sort, be it a bad one at that.
<br>
<br>The story (esp episode 1 and 2) does draw you in, but that is all that there is here. There is nothing to solve, not by you by any means. You are simply riding along and you choose how the hero reacts to things - that is it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-3---a-crooked-mile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4262461">Expand</a></span>

This is in part because the anticipation of the event tends to be just as exciting as the execution. But this is also due in part to the fact that once you do partake in these exploits, you are that much closer to the end of them.
<br>
<br>As we pass the halfway point in the releases for the episodic adventure for The Wolf Among Us, nothing could ring more true.
<br>
<br>A Crooked Mile begins after the shocking revelations of Smoke and Mirrors (starting to see a pattern here?) with an enraged Bigby looking for Ichabod Crane.
<br>
<br>Without spoiling too much, the hunt for Crane is the end goal of the entire episode. This may sound like it would result in a linear and boring episode, but it manages to stay fresh due to a variety of different variables to sway the usual path of linearity (and by linearity, I mean Telltale linearity, because though they give you multiple options to reach it, the path still usually ends at the same stop).
<br>
<br>The art style and soundtrack also feel noticeably more refined than the previous episodes. The frame rate issues and bugs I encountered in earlier instances were non-existent or were not evident enough to take away from the scenes (aside from Stripper Bigby SPOILERS). The scenes also receive more applicable non-diegetic soundtracks, almost double the amount, that help add tension and emotion.
<br>
<br>Once again, the bread and butter of The Wolf Among Us is in its characters and their interactions with one another. The reason these characters are all so entertaining is because they don&#x2019;t adhere to the fairytale, perfect versions of themselves, and are actually quite the opposite. Just about each one is vulgar, rude, and downright ugly in some way, shape, or form throughout interactions with them in previous episodes, and most increasingly so. A Crooked Mile does a great job of taking these interactions from the previous episodes that made you view those characters in a negative light in those episodes, and subsequently changing your viewpoint and opinions simply based on the interactions with them in this episode. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean that there still aren&#x2019;t bad guys, and that&#x2019;s a good thing because the ending introduces two new ones, in such a badass way that you can&#x2019;t help but be excited to see where it all leads.
<br>
<br>A Crooked Mile does a phenomenal job of continuing the story of Fabletown while still managing to remain fresh and exciting. Based on the revisions to an already fundamentally sound and phenomenal series, it&#x2019;s going to be hard to top this episode. With that said, A Crooked Mile has managed to build even more anticipation towards the next episode&#x2019;s release, where another journey awaits.
<br>
<br>Final Thoughts
<br>
<br>Gameplay: While sticking to its base routes, Episode Three manages to throw in a few variation and surprises in the gameplay that keep it exciting.
<br>
<br>Appearance: Aside from the erant stripper wolf here and there, the game looks as good as ever.
<br>
<br>Sound: With the addition of some much needed diegetic tracks combined with the usual great voice work and dialogue, the sound is the best it&#x2019;s been in any episode.
<br>
<br>Bottom Line: A Crooked Mile is the best episode yet, and moves the Wolf Among Us one step closer to being an elite game and franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-3---a-crooked-mile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4226041">Expand</a></span>
