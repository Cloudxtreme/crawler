There are no fun energy or big guns to be had here. Though molotovs are around! The game is somewhat fun and I enjoyed going through it, but it&apos;s lack luster for a primary point: It&apos;s very, very, incredibly short. YOu can enjoy it, but it should have been more.</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_1803842"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Extremely short DLC, comprised mostly of fetch quests which are pretty much irrelevant to the story. You are basically thrown in the middle of a war of tribals against tribals, the good guys led by Joshua Graham (the Burned Man of Legion fame) and the bad guys led by someone who&apos;s just in the game to get his head blown off. Sounds interesting? I didn&apos;t think so. The quests are extremely bland and the terrain, while well made, shows off some of the problems of the engine (such as enemies walking erratically when on slopes, and AI spawning inside geometry). The tribal characters aren&apos;t interesting at all, Daniel is uncharismatic and Graham does not look like the badass that he is or used to be, just a regretful guy who keeps spewing religious **** Worse of all, the reason the games gives you to play the DLC is pretty much because Daniel tells you that &quot;either you help us defeat the other tribe or I won&apos;t tell you how to leave Zion&quot;,and the only good aspect of this DLC is that you can then blow his head off, grab a map which shows the way off the zone and there you go, the end! In short: uninteresting quests, characters and story, and short too, so nothing to see here, move along.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803842">Expand</a></span>

You barely get to interact with any of the tribes - the moment you meet them you&apos;re immediately put on generic fetch / kill quests. Fortunately, the environment is excellently done. The introduction sequence was also done very well, but I found it to be a downhill ride from there. I felt the ending sequences were very anticlimactic, mostly due to poor scripting, and the endings themselves didn&apos;t have any effect on me. Besides Joshua Graham, all the characters are very two-dimensional and feel like cardboard cutouts, especially one of the main characters you will meet called Daniel. In contrast, I found all the characters of Dead Money to be very interesting, and also felt it had a much better story. The endings of Dead Money are also much more satisfying and had a far greater effect on me than Honest Hearts&apos;. Gameplay wise, Honest Hearts is very much like the base Fallout game - very open-ended and sandbox like. Unlike what seems to be a lot of people, I don&apos;t judge DLC based on the items / perks / whatever you get from them (would you pay $10 for a DLC that added a 9000 damage pistol and nothing else?)... and I think that Honest Hearts&apos; narrative is on the weak side. If you don&apos;t have either DLC yet and want a more story and character-driven experience, get Dead Money instead. On the other hand, if you want to learn more about the Burned Man or think the very powerful guns in Honest Hearts is worth $10, get this instead. (Or just get both).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=1627627">Expand</a></span>

I liked the setting far more than Dead Money&apos;s morbid landscape, liked it better than New Vegas. I play at greatest difficulty and hardcore, and it&apos;s still not hard enough, but in Honest Hearts it&apos;s not easy, and I had to carefully watch my ammo and supplies, even with a few perks that let me make my own. I do wish Zion was fully realized, more depth and development, more interaction with the various tribes, friendships, and perhaps even a little romance. On the minus side, Honest Hearts crashes Fallout-NV more than usual (for me it&apos;s uncommon for FNV to crash, but it crashed about 5-6 times in the whole HH playthrough), companions utter their convo lines too often, and, like I stated, I really wish there was more to this world-within-a-world, more depth. Regardless, gave it a 8, and I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=1687396">Expand</a></span>

The beggining is also pretty dark but in a good way.</span>

Joshua Graham. The Malpais Legate. The Burned Man. The man who defied Caesar&apos;s death order.

Whatever you want to call him, this is the guy, perhaps Ulysses apart, that we all wanted to know. Was he really still alive? Well we all figured he would be, that&apos;s just how storytelling works. Does he live up to expectations? Probably not.<br><br>But why am I talking about one man and not the rest of the DLC? Well, that&apos;s how hyped this guy was in online communities. But then we find him, embroiled in a petty war between three tribes, remember, this is the guy who ruthlessly killed many people, He&apos;s still an intruiging character, but when you meet a character for the first time, that you&apos;ve only heard of in references, they&apos;re never quite as good as in you head are they? Just sat in a cave? Hm. At least, from a story point he holds an interesting bent. The idea of flushing out the evil people and creating a &apos;good&apos; society from scratch. Zion.<br><br>Ah Zion. My favourite locale in the whole of New Vegas. If you had to identify New Vegas, and indeed the whole of the Fallout series in general by a colour, it&apos;d be grey. Grey grey grey grey grey. A splash of plant green here and there, and some grey-red if you&apos;re playing Dead Money. Zion remains almost untouched from the great wars. Plants grow everywhere, the water is beautiful, the canyons steep and gorgeous. It wills you into following Graham&apos;s idea that this could be paradise,<br><br>Unfortunately the story, while at a good pace, isn&apos;t that gripping. The choice? Kill the bad guys and stay in Zion, or run away. Duh, kill the baddies of course. Wow, that was a tough choice, might need a lie down now. The quests are pretty poor mostly too. Go and find 5 lunchboxes? Oh yeah, totally man. The only thing that forgives this is walking through the lushness.<br><br>Honest Hearts is a welcome break in a new direction for New Vegas. Joshua Graham is a good character, but no way did this Graham kill many many people in the Legion. The best looking DLC and a new refreshing slant in New Vegas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115938">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In terms of world design, the change in scenery is certainly refreshing. However, the Zion Valley in which Honest Hearts takes place is unfortunately void of much interesting locations. At least a third of the area is littered with caves and there isn&apos;t much incentive to explore the 30+ different marked areas on the map.
<br>
<br>In terms of story, the introduction of Joshua Graham and the two tribes that are vying for control of the region is interesting, albeit brief distraction that I was able to finish all available sidequests within 3 hours. Nothing is different much in terms of gameplay, which is a good thing. The biggest disappointment comes in the underwhelming content. What&apos;s available is serviceable, just not groundbreaking in any way and at times, boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=6509511">Expand</a></span>

<br>In conclusion i think that this whole dlc was an sketchy work and had a lot of things to bean added!!!

I thought you should be able to have more choice, to choose which side you want to fight for. Sorrows or the White Legs. And not just be lumped with The Sorrows. This DLC could of been much better.</span>

The troubles of society, however, do not stop here as they plague the tribes that inhabit the land, forcing the courier to take sides once again.
<br>
<br>Now, Honest Hearts has got to be one of the most interesting entries in the Fallout lore, because it deals with opposing ideals from two morally ambiguous characters, sharing the same roots, belief, and goal. Unlike the base game where you create a web of relationships with a myriad of problems, the DLC instead focuses on two individuals: Joshua Graham and Daniel, who are former missionaries with a clean slate, caught in the middle of a tribal war. Faith is a prominent theme throughout the whole story, and you&apos;ll hear constant references to Mormonism from both of the major characters, sharing their experiences with the old world religion. Later on, you also find out how faith created the worst enemy that the NCR ever had: Caesar&apos;s Legion.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise, it&apos;s the easiest among the DLCs. The enemies are just tribals with guns, and some Yao guai pop up occasionally - no different from the raiders and Deathclaws that you encounter at the Mojave. If you&apos;re playing in hardcore mode, or going for the Desert Survivalist achievement, the land of Zion has plenty of consumable resources, and you&apos;ll more likely going to get over-encumbered from the amount of food and water that you&apos;ll be hoarding, than starving or dying from dehydration.
<br>
<br>And there you have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=6945350">Expand</a></span>

<br>Arguably one of the worst DLCs in New Vegas, Honest Hearts is a more down to earth part of New Vegas, where the standoff between most factions of the Mojave is nearly nonexistent, and the beautiful scenery gives a nicely needed break from the ruins of cities and other parts of old pre-war civilizations. The story behind the DLC is very heavily focused on Joshua Graham, as well as adding subtle and well placed foreshadowing to other events in further DLC and the late-game. If you are not very big on the story of New Vegas, or the character Joshua Graham, then the player will not find the story satisfying. Besides the story and environment, Honest Hearts is a mediocre DLC, adding a new area to explore with new and unique weapons and armor. If your buying the Ultimate Edition of New Vegas, or if its on a good sale, I recommend buying and playing through it at least once to see what it has to offer to the story of New Vegas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---honest-hearts/user-reviews?user_review_id=7462968">Expand</a></span>
