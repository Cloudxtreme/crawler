At first, having tried the demo and a taste of what DoW2 has to offer, I was sorely disappointed by the drastic change from the gameplay of the original game. HOWEVER, I still decided to give it a shot and I&apos;m so glad that I did. The game plays differently, (there&apos;s no building, and more about squad abilities and tactics) but this is by no means bad. The campaign is quite engaging and you&apos;re given a number of varied squads to improve and upgrade throughout the game, and that is by far my favourite part. There is choice involved in missions, outfitting and strategy, making an overall flamboyant single player campaign. The co-op is just as sweet. But wait there&apos;s more. The cream of the crop is the multiplayer and The Last Stand where you take on hordes of monsters with 2 other heroes. Great additions all way round. Long story short, yes it is a massive departure from DoW1&apos;s style but it is fortunately just as good in its own right. I certainly have respect for the devs for changing things up and trying out something new, and I&apos;m glad that they&apos;ve still kept the strength of this series and its ability to constantly impress me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544616">Expand</a></span>

My real problem with the game is how hard it is. I can&apos;t speak for everyone as I&apos;m naturally bad at RTS games, but I do believe that there has been a problem with this game for not just me, but a majority of people who try to play online and usually end up fighting against people 10x better than themselves. This causes a lot of new players to be put off meaning that other new players don&apos;t get a chance to fight against equally skilled people. I suppose it really just takes perseverance but it&apos;s still tough.<br>The graphics of the game are absolutely lovely, definitely best out there, on par with, if not better than Starcraft 2&apos;s graphics.<br><br>For originality of gameplay how ever, this game is basically Company of Heroes, set in WH40k, and a smaller viewing angle with a closer in camera.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1447986">Expand</a></span>

With great eagerness, i picked up this game the day it was released.  EDITORS NOTE-All in all, i fear change so my review may be seriously biased but here it goes anyway.<br>DOW 2, is a game that will please you and frustrate you at the same time.  To me, it is just company of heroes meets DOW and that aspect bothered me a lot.  It took me a while to get over that.  Also, the fact that you have to have an internet connection, and you have to get windows live bothered me a lot too.  Well, what if someone doesn&apos;t have an internet connection.  I am sure there are some people out there who still do not.  I am lucky enough to have that.<br>For those of you who are huge DOW fans, you might be a tad dissapointed at what is going on in this game.  For starters, there are no more base building.  You have an galactic map which shows you all the planets that you can travel too.  there are three of them in which you are to initiate warp travel to reach.  You start out with yourself, the commander, and a tactical squad.  Mind you, the squad consists of only 4 space marines.  then, as you progress you get other squads, a devestator squad(heavy weapons, 3 space marines), a scout squad,(3) and an assault squad.(3).  As for the assault squad well, what can i say about the assault squad?  I have had it on missions and he is always usually the first to die.  He kinda sucks in the first DOW 2.  He gets better in Chaos rising.<br>During missions, your squad earns xp, and upon leveling up you can unlock new powers for your squads to use, some of which are pretty bad ass.  But it seems to me, you can only have one and not the other, as there is a level cap of 20, so choose the right path you want for your squads, as you will not be able to get those points back.<br>Personally, i stuck with the same for guys more or less the same time, varying upon the different missions parameters, which aren&apos;t really that different at all.  You are going to either attack or defend, and most defend missions, you will have a time limit to do so, in which if you miss it you have to wait for a later point to go resecure that sector and what was lost.  At times, i also do feel very overwhelmed.  I know space marines are all powerful to an extent, but sometimes it is just insane. I do believe before the first patch, the weapons were a bit different and did more damage, as i get confused, when a bolter says it only does 11.6 damage per second and my squad which does 9 damage, goes down.  I thought higher damage was better, call me crazy.   Which includes power weapons.  Most power weapons, which although do more damage then a chainsword, do not actually do as much damage on the field, due to their attack speed i am guessing?<br>anyway, all set aside i have fallen asleep during the single player.  The same type of missions do tend to get a tad mundane and repetitive, and sometimes the war gear rewards aren&apos;t even worth doing it in the first place.  But it is a decent campaign.<br>The multiplayer is pretty engrossing, but once again highly modeled upon the COH engine, with holding of victory points, and anniahalte.  No base building, so dont even think about that.  It is definitely a far cry from the DOW.<br>the army painter i was dissapointed in as well, as it seems to me there is less detail you can do from the first one.<br>the last stand?  I don&apos;t even know what to say about that.  It&apos;s as if someone said, no no, we want the game to be harder so they did.  It gets repetitive.  The leveling up takes too long.  DONT EVER PRESTIGE BECAUSE IT SUCKS AND YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING AND GET SOME CRAPPY REWARD.<br>do i reccommend it?  if you&apos;re new to DOW yeah, you can go in this with a clear head.  If you are into DOW?  Sure, just be prepared to be let down a bit.

The stand alone campaign is interesting and replayable.  What makes this game really good is the co-op game &quot;The Last Stand&quot; and you can co-op the campaign games too.  It is worth getting all 3 games together at $60 on steam but  you can buy the first 2 games for $20 each.</span>

Gone is the base building and resource management and you only focus on the combat.  For me, that&apos;s fun but I can see where some people were let down.  Since I only cared about the combat and paying attention to how much of this or that I have never appealed to me this game works really well.  Other than that fundamental change its very much a RTS where you control each of your units from a top down perspective and each has a few unique abilities.  This game adds a slight RPG element in that you collect loot as armor and weapons and customize your squads.  You also spend points on very simple talent trees which adds a little extra to the game.  Want your giant mech walker to kill from range or do you want him to squish units in melee range?  You decide.  It&apos;s got decent voiced story parts and the graphics are not bad either.  Points taken off are for awkward keybinding which you can&apos;t change and missing graphical elements such as Vsync.  These things can be modified if you want to go into the files and feel comfortable editing code and game files, something I think the devs should just put the stupid button in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739288">Expand</a></span>

Last Stand is incredibly fun, constantly having me come up with new and interesting ways to slaughter hordes of enemies (although there&apos;s some loadouts that are clearly better).<br><br>Some may not like the squad based gameplay, and I was a little confused with it at first, but it grows on you. Instead of most RTSs where individual units are usually expendable, keeping units alive in this game is crucial (multiplayer). As long as one squad member survives, you can replenish the squad, so their upgrades and levels don&apos;t go to waste. The entire squad gets gibbed, you lose their vital experience. That&apos;s not to say that you can&apos;t beat higher level enemies, but it&apos;s certainly harder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1829467">Expand</a></span>

Having played all of the previous Dawn of War games I had pretty high expectations for this one, especially with all the epic fails that all the expansions for the previous dawn of war ended up being.
<br>
<br>Just to start I&apos;ll go into the single player campaign. The game mechanics are very similar to the first Dawn of war, which were fairly easy to pickup within the first mission or two. It became very obvious to me  from the beginning that the guys at THQ have actually started to listen to some of the fan base of the original game. They have implemented and in depth story line that does the books justice but still allowed for some choice on how to develop your characters, and how you proceed along the liner story line. &quot;You must remember while playing the game that yes, the game play is important but they are trying to tell a story as well.&quot; The cover concept was add back into the game, well maybe that&apos;s a bad way to put it. A better way to put it is that they made cover important again, basically there is no more mad rush tactics that were so common in the previous expansions.  Basically the campaign it&apos;s self is pretty solid all around, keeping you interested right till the end.
<br>
<br>The RPG element of the game, they have made vast improvements in this compared to it&apos;s predecessor. Now I&apos;m not saying that it is anything new that we haven&apos;t seen in other games, but it works, it&apos;s simple and it keeps your focus where it should be... on the Mission map. Simply there is two RPG elements common to all RPG games leveling your characters and they&apos;re load out of equipment. The equipment load out is pretty simple you&apos;ll figure it out for your self. The leveling of your character can be a little trickier, you have to choose between being a jack of all trades or leveling up in very specific areas. This being said if you are not adaptable and can&apos;t move away from a certain play style your are not going to get much replay value out of DOW 2.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer, sorry I can&apos;t really comment on this part of the game. This is mostly because, the very hard-line multiplayer focus of the previous DOW was what ruined the game for a lot of fans of the first game, so to be honest I really had no interest into delving into that part of the game.
<br>
<br>In all I gave the game and 8 because THQ took and old game that people love and made it new again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2762169">Expand</a></span>

After having tried the single player and multiplayer mode, I am hugely disappointed. Frist of, the single player campaign is boring. It is the first time in my life that I fell a sleep while playing an RTS (literally). All you do is just looking at your same tiny Squad, moving them around the map, setup a good position, let them do automatic shooting, heal, then occasionally use their special ability, and repeat that throughout the game. Multiplayer is almost unplayable. Most of the time the match will be disconnected due to somebody&apos;s slow internet or computer. However, the new mode, The Last Stand, was pretty fun to play once in a while. I really try to like Dawn of War II, I have install and uninstall the game more than 4 times, but every time I started playing, it bores me. It is great that Relic try new approach on DOW2, but it lost a lot of the charm from the first game while doing so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=744360">Expand</a></span>

This is a step down from DOW I, where you could actually command armies. In DOW II, you get a few squads, and that&apos;s it, you&apos;re stuck with them. No building squads, no calling in reinforcement squads, nothing. You choose four for each mission and you&apos;re stuck with them. This needs a serious fix in the next game.<br>Second, the campaign is more of an RTS/RPG hybrid rather than a true RTS. You choose equipment for each character, and decide what each character brings. In regular RTS&apos;s, you don&apos;t get to do that, each squad has a specialty, and you know their abilities. So it&apos;s not a true RTS, but rather an RTS/RPG hybrid.<br><br>Hopefully the next game will be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1513135">Expand</a></span>

But like many of the other people who expressed frustration with this game, I felt like it just barely missed being exceptional with a few short-sighted mistakes (including lackluster AI, early-launch bugs, and unbalanced play).  The fatal blow to the game in my mind was the repetition.  Did they really launch a game with only a handful of maps (campaign) and  then expect you to play each one until you can recreate it in your head down to the very last pixel?  This is one of the few times that I&apos;ve been very disappointed with the professional critics because I think they missed the mark in a major way.  I understand that they want to support a company who tries something new (i.e. blend multiple genres), but the game simply doesn&apos;t rate as well as the critics claimed (which is evident in the fact that, for once, the professional critics have a higher rating than the users).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1609890">Expand</a></span>

The battles aren&apos;t epic, the lack of base building isn&apos;t fun, and the races are all the same and boring. I had really high hopes for this game, I seriously wish I could return this.

What this turns into is bassicaly an RTS for the console, there is no defence just attack attack attack, there is no base building just attack attack attack, indeed while attacking is the key focus of this game i find it so slow and repetative that i get board watching my heavy bolter team waddle slowly towards some cover, while my oponants attempt to slowly waddle towards my position only to be instantly supressed and for there commander to hit the recall button for them to return to base. The multiplayer matches last a max of 15 mins each if you have played C&amp;C 3 multiplayer before and im assuming that you have, and have probebly stopped playing it along with everyone else becouse it gets boring FAST! this game gets boring FAST! I got board of it in the Beta thats how fast you get board. Over all as far as RTS go the multiplayer and skirmish is not fun, if you on the otherhand have ever thought hey I wish RTS got rid of all that boring base building and got strait onto fighting, but you wished the fighting involved eldely men who will die at any second of high colestrol and can only amble around the battlefeild at walking pace while screaming about the good old days of Halo 2 when games lasted only 3 minutes this is the game for you, infact I emplore you to buy it becouse you will buy the craptastic DLC relic will spew from its anus every 2 weeks for live points. All in All its probebly becouse im a turtler in RTS which is a valid tac in team games, however this game removes all defence style strats, so you cant really do that... therefore alienating half of all RTS players in one go, if you play defence in RTS&apos;s you will HATE this game dont even bother, go play company of heroes as the brits and artillary people from the otherside of the map behind you massive stronghold of AT guns and morters. SINGLEPLAYER!! yea this is the big thing... well not according to relic its not but it is.. bassicaly this plays like one of those standard issue C&amp;C or starcraft or infact any RTS game mission where you dont have a base, theres multiple objectives with multiple paths and you have to decide, theres also loot so bassicaly your playing world of warcraft except less fun as a group of slow waddling old people in armor, this is what saves the game for me, yes its repetative, yes the gameplay gets boring quickly as with the rest of the entire game, but the storyline drives you along, you really want to see what happens to this group of eldely &quot;BURN THE HERETIC&quot; marines on there slow quest to collect there pensions. So pretty much, if you liked dawn of war you probebly wont like this, if you liked company of heroes you probebly wont like this, if you liked homeworld you probebly wont like this, however if you enjoy smashing your face into an xbox controler while screaming FAG over the microphone to a bunch of 13 year old mexicans on a game of GTA4 this will be the RTS for you, infact its not really an RTS its more of a QTE becouse you just mash the build devasator squad and then mash the move to commander button over and over till you win/lose it wont really matter eitherway becouse itl be 10 minutes over and then you will go off and play some TF2 or subcom or a game that takes more tactical thinking like pong! over all 6/10 I was gonna give it a 7 but found out I coudent make space marine chapters with a dick or nazi symbol or a middle finger on there shoulders, this is largly down to relic releasing these 3 chapters in the &quot;community pack&quot; later this year for 599 microsoft points, there will also be adding realtime weapon change while there at it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=421897">Expand</a></span>

If I wanted Warhammer 40k Real Time Role Playing Tactical Simulator I would have bought that. DOWII was supposed to be RTS. At least I thought it was. Guess Im the sucker. 5. I now have to listen to my 3 freinds who also are disappointed with the game whine constantly about it. I hope to god Starcraft 2 doesnt follow DOWIIs example. If I could return the game I would.

The first Dawn of War was incredible, and got better with each installment. After waiting so long, after all the hype...I wish I would have waited till this hit the bargain bin at walmart while I continued to play the original in the interim. The campaign was fun, a lot of the features are hard to use and not as effective as the simpler ones (there&apos;s really no point in having cyrus other than to laugh at him during his holier than thou monologues between missions). All this talk about &quot;you really have to use tactics&quot; is nonsense. the controls are clumsy, and you&apos;re tactical options are pretty small. &quot;Well...dropped all my bolter turrets, time to try to clumsily select cover that they&apos;ll just leave when i tell &apos;em to switch targets anyway, or will get blasted by a grenade, then i&apos;ll have to make all my boys run back to base to reinforce again.&quot; The running back to base or comm array or whatever to reinforce is lame. The only real strategic decisions you&apos;ll make are &quot;flamers, bolters, or missile launchers for this one?&quot; When you&apos;ve got something that works, stick with it, improve it. There&apos;s a reason there&apos;s such a rabid fan base for the first one.

The inability to save has made me angry on more than one occasion. Further I feel the game would benefit if more of it were on an individual&apos;s computer, rather than through the internet.</span>

Dawn of loot drops by races that don&apos;t even use that loot. Its silly really, insted of building cool bases you just get unlimited units by moving them close to a &quot;beacon&quot; then they pop out of nowhere..MEh just don&apos;t buy it trust me.

I&apos;m a die hard skirmish map player, and the skirmish maps in this game are impossible. The population cap is ridiculous, leaving the player with too few troops to defend the strategic points.  The bases are TOO heavily armored and take years to destroy. Even in the Retribution Beta it took 4 leman russ tanks, 1 manticore, and 1 baneblade nearly 15 minutes to destroy the base.  The campaign mode is..just anti-climatic, there&apos;s little or no strategy involved.  What is the point of gathering up all this war gear if you just lose it at the end of the game? Why not have it unlock the gear for skirmishes? Of course that would require the skirmishes to actually be playable.<br>I don&apos;t know HOW this game scored so highly, it&apos;s the worst version of the DoW franchise to date. I&apos;ll stick with Dark Crusade thanks. At least till they fix this pathetic game.<br>About the only good thing I can say about this game is the graphics are decent..when they aren&apos;t too busy bogging down the computer.<br><br>This is not RTS. It does not &apos;re-define&apos; the RTS genre because it&apos;s not RTS. It may as well be turn-based.  I think the only other time I&apos;ve been SO disappointed in a game sequel was the pathetic excuse for a sequel to Deus Ex. Now THERE was a genre-bending, innovative game.  But, like this game, the sequel was a pale shade of the original game.  Don&apos;t pay more than $10 for anything involved with this game. It&apos;s worth ten bucks. Maybe...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1486760">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>GFWL is a complaint? It&apos;s free. I honestly do not understand why people think it is such a hassle. Aside from the automatic sign in as the game launches, you wouldn&apos;t even notice that GFWL exists until you play multiplayer. Making an account takes a minute unless you&apos;re handicapped in some regard. I&apos;ve had GFWL for 7 years now and never in my entire usage did I encounter the kinds of problems people commonly complain about. I get it, it sucks having to use it. I completely agree, but that alone doesn&apos;t make it bad.
<br>
<br>Retreat is definitely an issue, but this is more of a Relic issue, not a DOWII issue. Relic did the same **** in COH and they realized people were upset by it so they&apos;re changing it. I agree, the current retreat feature is completely oversimplified.
<br>
<br>Aside from &quot;it wasn&apos;t like the old game&quot;, the removal of base building can be seen as a good thing. Your focus is shifted completely off of bases and onto combat. This allows for combat to be significantly more intricate than before, but as several others have pointed out, the Orks and Tyranids don&apos;t play very uniquely.
<br>
<br>If you believe the singleplayer is overly easy and you can spam retreat to save yourself, you must have been playing on Normal. Try that on Primarch. I dare you. Yes, you can complete the campaigns on Normal with almost no thought involved. As soon as you start trying to maximize tokens (&gt;80% of units killed, no squads incapacitated, very short clear time), as well as playing on Primarch, the single player becomes very challenging and thoughtful.
<br>
<br>As for other simplifications from the original DOW, these criticisms are completely valid. The game easily could have had more content and customization. The lack of scope in the game is a completely valid change, as it places more importance on individual units and how you use them in combat instead of &quot;amass X number of unit Y, use this build order, rush&quot;. Those kinds of &quot;strategies&quot; can be just as repetitive and if you won&apos;t admit it you&apos;re lying through your teeth.
<br>
<br>I could have sworn PLAYING THE FULL GAME was a prerequisite to writing a review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544486">Expand</a></span>

If I didn&apos;t need his squad in the game, I would never bring them on missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1801594">Expand</a></span>

I normally beat games, but this travesty was so horribly produced it had almost no RTS value at all. Strategy is non-existent in this &apos;real time&apos; piece of junk. I&apos;d just like to iterate that i&apos;ve never played a game with such a horrible saving system, unrealistic fighting scenarios, or horrible jerky controls (That you CANNOT reprogram, by the way). Slamming the escape button does nothing, and hitting ctrl alt del will do nothing but save the game. I uninstalled this after trying to give it a shot, but it was just so horribly made I couldn&apos;t continue any further. Real Warhammer doesn&apos;t consist of 4 heroes and 4 squad-mates taking on entire battalions of Orks. This is a flaming pile of **** Pirate it if you truly want to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2024800">Expand</a></span>

You think you&apos;ve got better and better gear, however for some reason the enemy gets just 10x faster upgrades or something. At midgame, my entire team got entirely wiped out from a single attack by a boss. It makes you angry because it&apos;s no strategy or tactics involved whatsoever. Feels like a cheap and crappy android pay-to-win game. As a former Warhammer player, I am sad to say this game has wasted 5-6 hours of my life.

I understand they plan on expansion-ing in the future (who woulndn&apos;t) but I would of liked to see more units, or failing that, better units such as actually having more than ONE ranger/devastator with a weapon....anyway, 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422193">Expand</a></span>

Good graphics, but thin on Multi-Player content and possessing a redundant Single Player. No support for game modifications and no mention of a map editor in the future, combined with an aggravating setup that requires both a Windows LIVE account and a Steam account, it comes off as very unfriendly for the unsavy. The requirement to locate and download another unassociated program just to redeem pre-order and promotional keys is another flaw worth mentioning. Not like the first Dawn of War in any way shape or form except for core material on which they&apos;re both based on. The core material calls for squads, objectives, Space Marines, and aliens, and that&apos;s the beginning and the end of the comparisons between the two Dawn of War titles. Users will also find the Army Painter has has it&apos;s options reduced down to only a sparse selection of the paints you can buy from a Games Workshop retailer; there is no RGB palette, and the importing of custom insignia and banners is no longer a feature. There are many people who state this game is a reinventing of the RTS genre, but the features are all present in titles we&apos;ve seen in the past. Cover systems, setting up and taking down heavy weaponry, and unit leveling are hardly new and can be seen across a huge number of titles and settings ranging from the historic to science fiction. Straight off the bat I can name Ground Control and Blitzkrieg as boasting most of the systems present in the game, however, both of those titles have many features Dawn of War II simply does not. As for the Single Player game mode&apos;s RPG elements, they have been done in Namco Bandai&apos;s Warhammer: Mark of Chaos title, with the difference being the RPG elements in Mark of Chaos were also available for online play. The RPG elements in Dawn of War 2 are simply not present in it&apos;s Multi-Player component. For the sake of originality when compared to the RTS genre as a whole, this game lacks absolutely all of it. Many of the systems are seen used in Relic&apos;s other RTS Company of Heroes, so if you did enjoy that title you may enjoy this one. It does not break any ground in any field except for what the Dawn of War series has offered thus far, while many players feel it is taking a few steps backwards in the process.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422310">Expand</a></span>

I am a big DOW fan...I loved the last few games and when i learned that DOW2 was coming out i damn near $#!+ my pants, however when i finnaly downloaded the game and played i was a tad dissapointed. First the instillation took forever second the video wasnt skippable (was fine the first time but it didnt save so i had to watch it again). third i dont like having to sign up for anything just so i can play a game...i already had steam, the idea just buggs me. the next problem was no building system, which was a big wake up call for me, cuz i dont know about everyone else but i like to master all the diff races and learn all of there units upgrades and buildings before i fight them so i went to skirmish and theres no way to build stuff so i was like WTF! anyways i finnaly figured out that thats not how things work anymore and that just made me loose alot of interest right there, and i know there are alot of people out there going its a great game anyways and in alot of ways i agree. ive only had an opertunity to play singleplayer as i downloaded it but to me it seems good. the story line is interesting the leveling system is new and the wargear variations makes for some interesting strategies. The way the game playes itself only made me want to give it a 6-7 at most...however then i thought about it and realized that this is exactly what the first dawn of war needed, to me this game is great because its a step in the right direction, what i want in DOW3 is the combination of the ideas. im hoping Relic brings back the tech trees building ideas and the large amount of race selection (especially the Necrons, they hauled ass...they where also my fav army) and adds in a sort of vetren system so that you can equip diffrent war gear to your squads as well as the foundry, temple, and comm tower ideas. So all in all it was an ok game with a bit o replayablility to it but what makes it great is the hop for the future and the combining of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422378">Expand</a></span>

Be warned that if you think RTS skill is definied by how well you can micromanage haverster units to gain an economic advantage you will be dissappointed. This is a game that emphasizes tactical manuever not extremely large armies.

Same with this game. there are no longer those massive build and smash battles its a more integrated take care of these uber squad game. Yes i feel they should have put MORE into the campaign.. even though watching the ship jump thru the warp is pretty it still seems a bit lacking compared to the last 4 frakkin games, letting you command and attack the enemy with the little bot armys smashing your rears. However i feel there on to something and this game does not dissapoint... this was not meant to be a starcraft 2 clone.. and i feel they have done an excellent job of proving that. ALSO if you know ANYTHING about Relic is that they are ADDING more and MORE into this game 4 expansions of the last game lemme spell it out for you M-O-R-E is on the way. And that my friends could change anything my little fanboys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=86004">Expand</a></span>

This is not a RTS, it&apos;s more like the good old commandos games, only lot worse and shallow(commandos was very good indeed). No real tactical thinking is required to play, just the basic knowledge will do (like: spearman on front, archers behind them). You have undying characters at your disposal, no base or unit building, maps and missions are easy and same, all have end map bosses which adds more to sameness. I advise people who are looking for a real RTS to play medieval total war II or dawn of war I again. (This not about the game: I also advise people who think roleplaying games means/consist only of developing character stats to look wikipedia for a definition or play fallout I) I &apos;m a true gaming fan but I&apos;m very dissapointed over the last couple of years because the games that are being produced are getting worse and worse. Mostly because simplifications of them. Last word: I advise King&apos;s Bounty over this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=421930">Expand</a></span>

With a very well created loot/exp system, there&apos;s not much to not like. Do not let the fact there is no base building shun you away from purchasing this game. It makes up for it with other well created mechanics. A definite MUST BUY.</span>

First of all I&apos;d like to state I have nothing against the lack of base building nor the squad-like mechanics. I simply dislike how this game not only failed to improve upon what was poor in the first, but utterly ignored the specific issues completely. The story is a cliche and the way it&apos;s told by audio briefings doesn&apos;t help in any way. Cutscenes or any other noteworthy methods of storytelling are nowhere to be found in Relic&apos;s title. The plot is predictable, the characters are stereotypical and the writing is simply dull. It&apos;s like they didn&apos;t even try - a shame, for the IP is great. The singleplayer is a borefest to normal players. People which enjoy grinding for XP and Items on the same maps time and time again, might enjoy it though. After playing the same maps over and over, either defending or seeking a boss, you&apos;ll start wondering why you bought a 50 Euro game rather than downloading a Korean MMO for free. The gameplay, is not particularly bad, but for those that played Company of Heroes, it&apos;s nothing new either. However, I personally found DoW 2 more enjoyable than the first game in this respect, so Relic&apos;s idea was commendable. The only problem that plagues both the singleplayer and the multiplayer are the mildly unresponsive units. When you&apos;re seeking to destroy your Eldar friend and your 3 tanks get stuck without any means of getting them out, it&apos;s slightly irritating. Dawn of War 2 had great potential, yet it feels like a rushed and unfinished product. The interface, is rather uncomfortable and has a grotesque 90&apos;s look. Matchmaking is a pain, despite the use of Live. There are very few maps to be having fun in multiplayer, most of which you&apos;ll already be sick of after finishing the campaign. Ultimately, the game doesn&apos;t deserve anything above an 8 even if you&apos;re completely uninterested in story elements. If you&apos;re expecting an epic, engaging and sentimental tale in DoW 2 and value storylines a great deal, this is a 5-6 grade game, and that&apos;s being polite.

The cool visuals and the outstanding interface on the galactic map is also a beautiful touch. The only thing that was missing for me, was just a little more customization for your character, not necessary but would make the story and the events in the game more involving such as face customization, thats it really.

I believe the vast majority of negative reviews are from people who expected it to be just like the first game. When I look at this game I see the good elements of DoW1 combined with the good elements of Company of Heroes. The campaign is pulled of artfully and is truly innovative and successful in its innovation. The lack of base building blends in perfectly with the tactical play style of the game and the interface is beautifully streamlined making micromanagement a breeze. Sure there may only be 4 races and 1 campaign but if history is any sort of teacher, we can count on expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422448">Expand</a></span>

The game looks and plays great, and the campaign is breath of fresh air into genre; a welcome change of pace from most RTS games which only include a campaign mode for posterity. In some places, however, the game feels unfinished. The multiplayer, in particular, is in need of balancing on more variety, but remains pulse-pounding and entertaining when you find a good match. One has to think of this game as more of a starter pack to be expanded upon in the months and years to come through DLC and the inevitable expansions. Much like the original Dawn of War so many years back, Dawn of War II is a work of art, but also a work in progress, and it may take time for it to reach it&apos;s true potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=422714">Expand</a></span>
