There&apos;s not much in the way of puzzles to be solved, and the ones that exist are pretty rudimentary. It&apos;s really just a very well-crafted virtual reality space station (or Titan station - whatever) environment for you to explore (in alternating realities), while occasionally coming across weird and sometimes creepy clues as to what happened to the station&apos;s crew, concluding with an extensive, Space Odyssey-inspired VR roller coaster ride that looks amazing, even on a flat screen.
<br>
<br>Perhaps my experience was better because the game is included in Nvidia&apos;s Geforce Now streaming games package. I might have enjoyed it less if it cost me real money to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/p-o-l-l-e-n/user-reviews?user_review_id=6459188">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and audio and cool rarely visited setting are awesome and that was what got me excited about the game in the first place. But the game is way too short for the price they&apos;re charging - something like 3 or so hours in total, with no real replayability. The story is pretty weird and confused and the ending is rushed and really left me dissatisfied, one of the voice actors got badly on my nerves doing some European accented Dana Scully impersonation or something, and other than some really basic puzzles and walking around there isn&apos;t much to the actual gameplay... I threw a space basket ball at a space hoop for a while. Then there are the technical problems... playing with rift was sort of immersive and there are features to help the player be less sick (so I might not be the only one who couldn&apos;t really enjoy that experience too much) but still it left me feeling really dizzy in a way VR hasn&apos;t made me feel before and even on a normal monitor it doesn&apos;t run all that well with some framerate issues and weird texture problems at times.
<br>
<br>If the game had have been an hour longer, or 10 dollars cheaper, or had a satisfying conclusion instead of the &quot;ohno! we need to release this game but don&apos;t know how to end it, so let&apos;s make some fractal demo thingy!&quot; ending, I&apos;d have rated this a 6 instead of a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/p-o-l-l-e-n/user-reviews?user_review_id=6330126">Expand</a></span>
