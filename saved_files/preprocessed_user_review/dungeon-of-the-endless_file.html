<br>I find myself quite unable to stop between floors, and always coming back for one more play-through. Addictive, I tell you.</span>

It&apos;s one of those games that requires you a few tries to finally get it. You&apos;ll likely die on the very first floor on your first attempt, but as you play again and again, you start to witness how much strategy and team micro-management is actually required to succeed.
<br>
<br>The premise of the game is as follows: There are 12 floors in the dungeon. After every 2 floors you&apos;re in a new type of zone with new types of enemies, each time getting harder and harder. There&apos;s a wide choice of heroes to pick, though most are locked at the start. You can pick any 2 to begin with, and over the course of dungeon crawling you&apos;ll be randomly coming across others and able to recruit them to make up a team of 4.
<br>
<br>Now here&apos;s where you have to get tactical. You have a crystal that is your power source, which you must protect at all costs, and as you make progress through the dungeons, you find Dust, which is used to power up the rooms. Rooms where you&apos;ve restored power allow you to build researched modules that generate resources for you or act as buffs, whereas rooms without power are dangerous and can randomly spawn mobs every time you open a door anywhere on that floor. The goal is to find an elevator on your current floor and to bring your crystal power source there.
<br>
<br>So the game involves a lot of planning, strategy, tactics, and team management, as well as a bit of luck. As with most rogue-like games, if you lose at any time (team gets wiped out or crystal gets destroyed), you have to start over from the very beginning again. Losing in this game can feel rather demoralising if you&apos;ve gotten far, since a single dungeon run could take a few hours rather than half an hour that many other rogue-likes have.
<br>
<br>A bit of trial and error is required to grasp the mechanics of the game and learning from one&apos;s mistakes, particularly where hero combinations are concerned, as some can result in unexpected cutscenes in between levels where one of the party members gets killed off by another.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is really addicting if you like tactics and turn-based mechanics, but as I mentioned, it is hard, so be warned. There are two difficulty levels - &apos;Too Easy&apos; and &apos;Easy&apos;, but they&apos;re more like &apos;Normal&apos; and &apos;Hard&apos;, so don&apos;t be fooled by the wording. If you don&apos;t mind the challenge, then this game is definitely worth getting. You can play it both solo or multiplayer co-op.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=5892401">Expand</a></span>

You try to guide a group of up to 4 heroes through a hostile dungeon environment while gathering ressources and equippment. One of those ressources is dust and it&apos;s used to light up dungeon rooms. Lit up dungeon rooms can be used to build generators for other ressources and other supportive machinery. More importantly, those rooms will be safe.
<br>
<br>Every time you open a new door, there is a chance that monsters will spawn in unsafe rooms, charging at your heroes and your core. To defend and transport said core is your main objective. Once you found the current dungeon level&apos;s exit, you can unmount the core from its start position and carry it all the way to the exit. If you reach the exit, you may advance to the next - more difficult - dungeon level.
<br>
<br>The game has a singleplayer and multiplayer mode for up to 4 people to cooperatively try and fight their way through the 12 levels of the dungeon. It can be frustrating at times, but it glued me on my chair for hours and is well worth its money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=5127227">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a living chessboard that pushes you to spend each resource available as wisely as possible in each level.  Each time you open a door you can trigger an event, and each dark room comes with a risk of spawning monsters.  Do you place your hero to light a room you don&apos;t have power to keep online, or do you keep them up with the door opener to support them in combat, or even place them in a room to use their wits to boost your next resource tick?  Do you defend a main hub room or keep them split apart with your resource producing upgrades?  Do you use that food for leveling up a hero, or save it for an instant heal that might just save your playthrough?  Do you go for the glory at the end of a map, selling off your precious turret and light providing dust (power) to itemize for the next level and try to survive your way through the waves of monsters?
<br>
<br>This game is honestly brilliant, and I&apos;ve been picking up games randomly in Steam since the platform came out.  I&apos;m absolutely excited to see where development takes it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=3918338">Expand</a></span>

Some distinct graphics and sound are appealing and make you take an interest, but it is the game play that makes you stay. DotE is a roguelike with RPG and tower defense elements thrown in. Controlling a team of up to four convicts/guards from a crashed escape pod, you need to explore the dungeon to find the elevator leading up, to eventually reach the surface at the twelfth floor. While doing this you must manage four resources; one for building stuff, one for leveling up, hiring and healing your &quot;heroes&quot;, one for researching new turrets and modules and one to power the rooms in the dungeon.
<br>Each door you open acts as a turn, and you can plan for as long as you want before opening one. This also makes the game a bit of a turn based affair, although everything happens in real time. Each door opened creates a randomized event, from finding much needed resources, vendors, recruits or the all important elevator to gangs of hostile aliens. Additionally, each door you open has a chance to spawn mobs in any room you have not powered and which is also unoccupied by one of your cons. The more rooms you are unable to power and/or guard, the worse these mass waves of aliens can be. If everything goes well though you will be able to safely transport your power source to the elevator - a tense affair at times - to get to the next level.
<br>As for the aliens they are all very interesting, with highly surprising behaviors. For example, there is a sort of fly which totally ignores all your cons, all your modules and even your power source. All it wants to attack are active research projects at alien artifacts. Others will run to the middle of a room full of expensive modules and turrets and blow itself up there. If you fail to evacuate your cons they are likely to die in the blast too. Some are runners seeking the fastest route to your power source while others are brawlers who chase your cons around and pretty much ignore everything else. The worst variety is a sort of rhino, which runs around opening more doors, each of which can spawn more aliens unless you can find and stop it. This evil alien is probably my least favorite because of the endless times it has killed me by doing this.
<br>And since the cons are highly varied as well, it all makes the game feel like it has a lot of personality even if there`s not much of a story. Some of them are lightning fast and work well as scouts and mobile defensive support while others are slow and lumbering, best suited for stationary posts on defense or perhaps standing in a choke point repairing modules. Some have high wit and can man the modules for a resource bonus while others have mad dps and ideally need to be in combat somewhere. And all of them have both active and passive abilities they unlock as they level up, as well as stats and whatever gear you manage to find. And then there are the modules and turrets, which come in four categories: major, buffs, dps and support. These must be researched and can all be upgraded for added effect. And you need most of them too, because your cons alone have absolutely no chance against the enormous waves of aliens you will get on later levels as soon as you become starved of power. And you will, so setting up turret defenses is absolutely crucial. It is also tremendous fun! In short, this is a highly involved, nuanced and dangerously entertaining game.
<br>
<br>There are two difficulty levels: very easy, which is indeed very easy, and only recommended if you want to rush through the game and never look at it again, and easy, which is certainly not easy. In fact it is brutally hard, and the difficulty one must play at if one wants a challenge and for the game to last more than a couple of hours. In addition there are cons, different escape pods and pictures to unlock as well as a 2-4 way multiplayer. Since the game generates levels randomly there is the usual roguelike replayability as well, which is always nice.
<br>There are admittedly some flaws; the characters are pretty shallow, and the dialogue mostly forgettable. Slightly better writing wouldn`t have made the game itself any better, but it`s a bit uninspired. The multiplayer is quite buggy so far and the scoring is a bit weird: it is possible to beat any high score on the first level, provided that you manage to place enough turrets to prevent the aliens from ever getting to you while you wait at the elevator. This can take forever and yield an infinite amount of points depending on just how unbelievably patient you are, since each alien killed in this pointless way counts toward your score, which is therefore also pointless. Something to do before going on a two week vacation to Turkey or something I suppose. Your high score will stand for all the ages.
<br>Apart from these small issues, some of which will hopefully be addressed in a patch, the game is highly recommended if you like either genre or want to try an original and very successful blend of all of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=4684912">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Difficulty it&apos;s quiet high and almost entirely artificial. Of course your mastery over game mechanics and skill is a factor. But as you reach around 40% of game, ramdomnes is way to big. For example on earlier level monster were able to cut my heroes life at most by 15% and on another level I was decimated. In essence you play lottery where your skills just hedge your bets. I prefer games where I am source of my failure or success instead of random number generator.
<br>
<br>Another major problem is that after playing this game half way you done it all and just change level and monster graphics.

The thing that sets this apart from so many others in its genre is how you keep your party alive; major slots on dungeon floors allow you to build Major Modules (used to harvest resources), along with minor slots for offensive, defensive, and supportive modules. Three resources are harvested per door opening and modules add to their production: Food for healing, leveling, and recruiting heroes, Industry for constructing modules, and Science for researching upgrades and resetting your party&apos;s ability cooldowns. A fourth resource, Dust, is much rarer and is used to power the crystal you are escorting, which in turn powers rooms for modules.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is both turn-based (new resources are harvested from when you open a door to a new room) and real-time (combat, movement, healing, etc.), keeping you constantly engaged despite the AI-controlled combat. The first few floors are simple enough to clear out but about halfway up you need to decide which is more important: risking your party&apos;s lives and possibly the crystal itself or running to the exit ASAP? Keeping a balanced party and wisely spending your resources will make or break your runs. Luck is always a factor but I felt that once I knew how to control the flow of spawns and properly construct defensive chokepoints that most of my losses were admittedly my own fault. This game rewards planning and strategy instead of demanding you get lucky unlike other recent Sci-fi rogue-likes (looking at you FTL &amp; SotS: The Pit!).
<br>
<br>Newcomers will be overwhelmed easily and probably give up easily because the tutorial is terrible and most of the game&apos;s systems have to be studied on the wiki, even with the extensive tooltips in-game. Although it practically plays itself at times and still could use some polishing and TLC, Dungeon of the Endless is a very unique Rogue-like and is worth checking out for fans of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=4885801">Expand</a></span>

Still feels like a prototype in many ways. Later floors suffer from major balance issues.  Multiplayer has several problems and I would currently call it incomplete.  Multiple pods provide gameplay variety that bloats the game and are completely unnecessary - game is at its best in the standard &quot;Escape Pod&quot; mode and it would&apos;ve been better if they focused on ensuring balance there instead of having several game modes and none of them playing anywhere near optimally.
<br>
<br>However, it is an interesting game due to its mashup of a few genres (roguelike, RPG, RTS and Tower Defense), so it&apos;s worth checking out, although I&apos;d suggest waiting on a sale before buying it, as it just doesn&apos;t come together very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=4634243">Expand</a></span>

<br>Managing became a hassle mid way through the game when you have to zoom in and out of the sprawling map a billion times to handle all hell breaking loose.  The ability to pause doesn&apos;t make this any less annoying.  This ultimately killed it for me despite the near addictive &quot;what&apos;s behind the door&quot; type crawl.

<br>
<br>To be fair, I&apos;ve discovered the &quot;rogue&quot; genre pretty lately, with Darkest Dungeon (that already sucked more then 130 hours) and Dungeon of the Endless is very satisfying, pushing me to experiment with heroes, objects and modules all the time (I even made an Excel sheet to keep track of and analyse all game elements !)
<br>
<br>DotE is also an ambitious game, with several many core gameplays : Rogue (you explore random generated dungeons and gather objects), Party-RPG (you command a group of 2 to 4 heroes that can level up and acquire skills over time), Tower Defense (you can build module to create resources, buff your characters, attacks or debuff your enemies), and probably a spicy hint of &quot;Civ-Like&quot; with the industry / science / food and fog resources to manage.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to share with you some strategy tips to help you get pass the first hours with the base ship :
<br>
<br># Level layout
<br>You start in a single room along with your crystal holding Fog resource that you can use to light up rooms. Then you must explore the dungeon in order to find the only elevator to the next level.
<br>In a really door-monster-treasure fashion, you open a door to enter the next room. Opening a door acts as a &quot;turn&quot; to generate resources, research new modules or improve them, and cooldown heroes powers.
<br>Lighting up a room allows you to build and activate modules, and enemies cannot spawn in lit rooms. Since Fog is a scarce resource, it&apos;s important to decide what rooms you keep lit, and which ones you take the risk of leaving in the dark (that way, you can decide from where the enemies will come, and how many enemies might come in a single turn)
<br>
<br># Resources
<br>You need Industry to build modules (both major and minor), Science to research new modules and upgrade them, Food to either heal or level up your characters, and Fog to light up rooms. So it&apos;s a good idea to build an Industry module first, to create enough Industry in order to build Science then Food modules.
<br>Later in the game, at the beginning of a level, depending on how many resources you have stored, you might change this order. Sometimes it&apos;s better to build multiple modules, sometimes it&apos;s preferable to build one with a hero than can Manipulate and add its Intelligence to boost the module.
<br>
<br># Heroes
<br>There are many heroes in the game, sharing similar stats (hp, regen, running speed, defense, power, intelligence) and DPS based on weapon speed and weapon power. It&apos;s really up to you to play them in order to know what are their strengths and weaknesses. On my own, I prefer to play with :
<br>- 1 character than can run fast to open doors, eventually running back to a fall back fighting room or crystal room, and finally carry the crystal to the elevator.
<br>- 2 characters than can each stay in a fall back fighting room to operate major modules (productivity boost) and eventually kill enemies and grab Fog.
<br>- 1 last character than is usually slow but very powerful in the the crystal room, to eliminate the enemies that succeeded in reaching the room and threat to destroy the crystal.
<br>
<br># Enemies
<br>Well, there are all sorts of enemies : the one who preferably target heroes, modules or crystal ; and the ones that debuff heroes. At the beginning it&apos;s preferable to use all your heroes packed to eliminate the enemies, then as you progress through the dungeon, identify fall back room that will support heroes in combat and leave here a guy who can operate along with one major and minor modules (the choice is up to you), and first-contact rooms that will tenderize the enemies for the hero to finish.
<br>- For the tenderizing room I usually combine modules that can target every enemies with low to mid damage like Lacrymos (Reduces Defense &amp; DoT) with Neuro (Slows), Seblaster (Explosion) and Tesla (Shock). After than, each enemy hp is pretty low so it&apos;s easier for the hero in the fall back room to finish them.
<br>- For the fall back room I usually combine support modules like Regen and high rate fire weapons like Blaster, Machinegun.
<br>
<br>With that, you should be prepared but there are no decisive strategy and many times you&apos;ll have to take risks and react quickly to not be overrun by enemies :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=5979802">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game somehow manages to get a lot of different gameplay elements which are rarely seen together and thread them seamlessly in the same game experience.
<br>From Orcs Must Die it takes the Tower Defense/ RTS hybrid, letting you fend off hordes of monsters by strategically altering the environment and gearing up characters to send in battle when your towers and traps aren&apos;t enough to stop them. From FTL it takes the management aspect: much like the ships, in this game you not only claim territory to put more distance between the resources you want to protect and the enemies, but also build modules that aid you one way or another and can even leave certain characters behind to improve their efficiency. The characters themselves are delightful, tongue-in-cheek shout outs to several sci-fi universes, from Doctor Who to Duke Nukem to Metroid, each having their own strengths and weaknesses which make them more suited for certain roles both in combat and in the long run: in particularly challenging runs it&apos;s often a good move to fire one of your heroes and hire one that&apos;s better suited for your situation should you bump into them while exploring.
<br>Gamers trying the game for the first time should also be watching out for the sudden changes of pace: while inbetween enemy waves you can plan and build to your heart&apos;s content, when monsters attack you&apos;ll need to either have the perfect defense planned ahead or be ready to move your heroes around to ward off surprise attacks and any monster that manages to sneak past your turrets. And the biggest change of pace happens every time you have to leave the floor: as soon as you trigger the event which opens the way out, unlimited waves of monsters start attacking nonstop, making it a frantic, mad dash for the exit which requires quick thinking and a careful plan to get everyone to the elevator before they&apos;re overwhelmed.
<br>Replayability is high. While the game is a decent challenge at the easiest difficulty setting and on the higher one it makes a very good (maybe too good) job of keeping players on their toes since random events and monster spawns can spell doom for your entire party in seconds if you don&apos;t react quickly enough, beating it under certain conditions enables several game modes which all affect one major aspect of gameplay one way or another, either by changing the healing mechanics, giving you different items to work with or even disabling random hero spawn meaning you have to be very careful not to lose the ones you start with. Unlocking heroes also adds replayability: to unlock a hero you merely have to have them survive for three floors straight or win the game with them in your party, so even in a losing game you can still make progress. Certain heroes will also have special dialogue when paired up, and seeing those dialogues to the end eventually unlocks more content in the Album, a board which doubles as flavor text and artwork gallery and fills up as you unlock more heroes and meet more enemies.
<br>
<br>All in all, a game that is very generous with the quantity of content related to the price. Even with all the DLCs, which don&apos;t really add a whole lot to the game besides some more challenges and a couple game-breaking characters, its price is still more than reasonable for a game of this magnitude.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=5847407">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;d like if the in game tutorial was better, and I&apos;d like the characters to have a little more flavour; more text to flesh them out would be great. It seems like some work was put into giving some of the characters little stories that play out over the course of a game.
<br>
<br>Voices would be a nice addition, but would obviously incur much more work.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s what seems like a spike in difficulty as I get close to the end of any given game, which can sometimes feel unfair, and just makes some runs incredibly frustrating
<br>
<br>The easiest mode feels too easy, until you get deeper into the longer runs, where they get silly.
<br>The default mode starts off challenging and then just escalates.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know, but I feel like I need more options here, or the difficulty curves need tweaking.
<br>
<br>It could be that I&apos;m just not picking up on how to deal with the difficulty. But if so, then the game is quite obtusely not clueing me in, or I&apos;m a dimwit. Oh well
<br>
<br>After a while, runs feel routine, and I found myself doing repetitive actions for too much of the game.
<br>
<br>I think I&apos;ve completed as much of the game as I&apos;m going to at about 40 hours of play. I&apos;d be pleased to see updates or patches to the game, which might entice me back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeon-of-the-endless/user-reviews?user_review_id=6291819">Expand</a></span>
