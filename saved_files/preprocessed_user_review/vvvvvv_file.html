Its amazing, the chiptune fits so well with the puzzling world of pixels and perplexion and FRUSTRATION!!!!<br>Its a hard game, and honestly i would download it just for the pure fun it implies. Its a good timewaster and everything, and it really challenges you. You can actually unlock challanges and things, if you hate doing the story mode. Did i mention the soundtrack?</span>

The first aspect of the game that took me by surprise is the superb 8-bit chiptune music. The only problem with that is that it does get repetitive only because it replays one single track for about 30 minutes at a time, until you complete each level. The graphics are imitating the general style of the Commodore 64, including its startup screen. VVVVVV&apos;s main platforming mechanic is the player&apos;s ability to flip the character&apos;s screen position vertically, going from bottom to top and vice versa. This makes for some complicated platforming in general, as well as some challenging and entertaining rooms. Because of the game&apos;s incredible difficulty, the developers have cleverly implemented checkpoints liberally throughout the game world, which cuts down on rage and frustration. With that said, VVVVVV still manages to be extremely difficult, and you should expect to die hundreds of times, if not one thousand times by the time you complete the game. The platforming and controls are not badly designed, as in Super Meat Boy, so do not confuse this well crafted, yet simplistic game with that developmental disaster. Younger generations of gamers may find the overall presentation of VVVVVV to be unique and hip, but as we all know, these graphics have been done before, about 30 years ago. One serious flaw is that there are no audio options for volume. The in-game default is quite higher than usual, and requires turning down in Windows. While the majority of the levels&apos; rooms are a lot of fun, and well designed, some are simply unreasonable and require too much luck as opposed to actual precision and skill. Because of this, you will die many times and spend far too long attempting single rooms. Which also means being forced to listen to a single song on a loop, for the entire duration of your trials. This is something of a shortcoming and should have been avoided completely by the developers, as these uncalled-for rooms only add negatively to the experience. Even though you get unlimited lives and unlimited continues, having to repeat a single room hundreds of times in order to pass it gets boring, repetitive, annoying, and only serves the purpose of replacing actual content with limited and mundane game play. While the music is once again, excellent, there are only a few that repeat over and over, as the rest must be unlocked by finding and collecting certain orbs within the game world. There are also a few more game modes for the player to experiment with once the campaign has been completed. The storyline and ending are endearing and delightful, and once you complete the game, there is an overall feeling of satisfaction. VVVVVV is short but perfectly sweet. It took me about 3 hours to complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=2318830">Expand</a></span>

Bad: it is tainted by some of the worst controls of a platformer I&apos;ve ever had the frustration of using.  The game itself is not hard, but the controls have been designed to be awkward.  The time it takes to accelerate and decelerate is far too slow and so the handling is quite screwball.  This would be forgiveable if the content did not sometimes require millisecond timing and precision within a few pixels, but that&apos;s exactly where most of the game&apos;s challenge is concentrated.  The game gives you a very narrow and winding racetrack, but then puts you in a WW2 Jeep with rusted, stiff steering.<br><br>The game tries to compensate for this by dumping a snowfall of save and reload points all over the place, but this does little if anything to reduce the frustration.  It genuinely baffles me why the makers decided to inject so much potential frustration into it.  Making the controls awkward does nothing to add to the game, it&apos;s the shallowest way I can think of to make the game seem longer.<br><br>For improvement, you&apos;ve got a great concept here, I loved the exploration and music/theme combo.  But the physics of the controls are appalling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=2428814">Expand</a></span>

Today, I am pleased to announce that VVVVVV stands proud among those titles as one of the the best games of 2010, and one of the most inovative inde games since Braid!    VVVVVV is an inde 2D platformer developed by Terry Cavanagh with a retro 8-bit style, something shared by it&apos;s spiritual sister game Super Meat Boy, which I had not played at time of writing, but from what I understand is very well desighned as well, and definatly deserving of your time! Now, when 8-bit visuals show up, their buddy, brutal dificulty, shows up to the party as well, and I&apos;ll warn you, like another of my favorate games of 2010, Dead Rising 2, will lose points with some people crying about the dificulty. But you know what, the difficulty balences itself out, theres a check-point every screen and the gameplay is very rewarding, every screen is an accompishment in and of itself.    the gameplay centers around your ability to shift your character&apos;s gravity from the floor to the cealing and vise versa, it really reminds me of old game on the NES called Metalstorm, which had a very simular mechanic, but it was a contra style side-scrolling shooter, this is a combat-free puzzle platformer. Now the developers clearly took a few pointers from Portal when making this game, IE: the idea of making the whole game eighty percent tutorial, becoase it&apos;s always introducing new play mechanics expanding apon the gravity manipulation concept, this ensures that the gameplay never gets old or overstays it&apos;s welcome. another thing it seems to have borrowed from portal is it&apos;s length, becoase it can easily finished in a couple hours if you try, but this is a five dollar steam game here, on a rediculusly tiny budget, so what do you expect?    Anyway, this game has incredably modest eystem requirements, so if you can read this, chances are you can play VVVVVV, and I highly recomend you do, there&apos;s so much to like here, and also it stands to be mentioned that once you beat the game you can re-play with the entire world map fliped on it&apos;s head Castlevania: Symphony of the Night style, which is practacly like an entirely seperate game. But the two biggest reasons for buying this game are: 1- it&apos;s FIVE BLOODY DOLLARS, and 2- you can take relish in the idea that you have suported the independent developers, instead of put more money into the pockets of the AAA industy fat cats. I emplore you, DO NOT pass this one up!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=1559333">Expand</a></span>

<br>For whatever reason, the go-to &quot;modern retro&quot; style is the one employed by I Wanna Be The Guy.  WHY?! That game is absolutely terrible. Objective. Fact. Yet here&apos;s VVVVVV doing the &quot;Retro is Hard&quot; BS. There&apos;s a difference between &quot;Hard&quot; and &quot;Showing Active Contempt For Your Audience&quot;
<br>
<br>The graphics are terrible. You can&apos;t even use the &quot;retro&quot; excuse because even old ZX Spectrum games (the system I assume it&apos;s trying to replicate) had better detail. You want a ZX Spectrum throwback? L&apos;Abbaye Mortis is a far better game because it&apos;s not trying so hard to be a &quot;hardcore platformer&quot;. Also, you don&apos;t waste money because it&apos;s free. Screw this noise. 2/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=3731537">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>While there is a decent handful of good puzzles based aroudn timing in this game, the overall amount of challengeand difficlty of the game is based on really cheap trial and error mechanics.
<br>
<br>This is due to 2 flaws. First of all the game is heavily based on quick screen changes and a wrapped up map system ( ie. if you go out of the far left end of the map you will for example pop up on the far right)
<br>
<br>This screen changing mechanic/refresh rate however is overly used in the games puzzles besides just exploring around and while it does open up for creative puzzles it does sadly however also works as the games main difficulty tool and is the cause of alot of punishing deaths. The problem with it is the fact that the refresh rate of these screen changes robs about &#xBD; a second of the player to calculate his movements and with some of the harder puzzles in the game using multiple screen changes (the hardest one was about 10-12) then it turns into a complete mess of a challenge and relies solely on a mass amount of deaths caused by trial and error and eye memorization. There are a great amount of puzzles where you will fall into spikes due to this update rate and it leads toa tedium of simple deaths due to exhaustion of this design choice.
<br>
<br>Secondly theres the control of the main character. The character is overall easy to control and is only causing problems at puzzle which is simply due to a overly sensitive movement. Theres a good amount of sliding (about the width of the main characters body) that makes landing on narrow ledges and platforms a bigger hasle than it should be because of this abrupt sliding. The worst part is that the acceleration in a still position is too high, he will take a long leap forward unless you decide to only tap the dpad/controller once, meaning you will end up in spikes under narrow platforms once again too often.
<br>
<br>The game should have been about timing and easy but challenging memorization not about a difficulty mechanic thats solely based on loose character response and the eyes adaptation of quick and constant screen changes and the game fails at this.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>+Cute style/Characters/Sound effects/Story/Dialogue
<br>+Soundtrack is amazing
<br>+Decent amount of nice Puzzles
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>-Challenge/Difficulty incorporation Mechanics are cheap and not based on timing in a fair way too often.
<br>-Map design can be a mess, should have been made so you could get access from multiple ways to certain areas/secrets.
<br>-Sliding controls+alot of narrow ledged puzzles= Bad difficulty incorporated combo
<br>
<br>Verdict: 4.5/10
<br>Soundtrack: 8.0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=4368791">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t know if it gets more interesting later... I only completed a couple of the levels before I got sick of the tedium. If you&apos;re into old skool, reflex-driven, platformers... you will probably like this. It is presented fairly well for what it is supposed to be.

Also, the world really does not need another gravity shifting arcade game. We have a billion games exactly like this. Honestly, sure I&apos;d play the game online or in an arcade, but I would never pay full price for it. I got it from the bundle, but it really wasn&apos;t as good as the other games in there. I want to like it, but the blinking lights and electronic music just makes me want to barf.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=2109285">Expand</a></span>

Lots of unique fun for a few hours, doesn&apos;t take too long but I could see replaying it for better times or scores. Even the 3-score review is halfway in love with the game haha, give this one a try.</span>

You are the captain of a ship which has come under some technical difficulties and your whole crew teleport off of the ship, but you&apos;re teleported to different areas and must re-unite your crew and escape the alternative space you are now in. The gameplay revolves around rooms with obstacles that must be overcome by changing polarity using the action button. When you change polarity, the roof will become the floor and vice versa. The game is rather difficulty and you will feel great for completing it, but sadly even with the collectibles in the game (Shiny Trinkets) It won&apos;t last you very long, but still well worth the money it costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=1444940">Expand</a></span>

Never before have I felt such a sense of accomplishment, than when I collected the trinket in &quot;Doing things the hard way&quot; (try looking it up on youtube!  [Also know as Veni, Vidi, Vici]).  It&apos;s brilliant fun and brings a lot of charm to what otherwise could have been more mundane, the challenges constantly change and you never feel that you&apos;re repeating yourself.  Also, can&apos;t help but think my positivity is due to the character&apos;s big smile and ever-upbeat music!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=1452938">Expand</a></span>

Nothing like &quot;Super Meat Boy&quot; for example, which I sadly say I&apos;ll never finish 100%. As for replay value, you won&apos;t play this game every day, but from time to time, surely.

Switching gravity instead of jumping in a platformer? Fun! The gameplay mechanics were intelligently placed into the map, to make the game &apos;that much&apos; harder. The graphics are well done (they are meant to look bad), and the music improved the standard of the game a lot more. The difficulty in the game was perfect, and the checkpoints were well placed to make this game not-as-frustrating. The reason, though, I didn&apos;t give this a ten out of ten was because it was: 1. too short, 2. &apos;the hub&apos; (is what I like to call it) was too big, and it was easy to both get lost and not know where to go next. I wouldn&apos;t say this game is non-linear, but you can do challenges in different orders. This was the main problem. Even with the map, the hub was very hard to navigate through. Otherwise, this game is very good (though I wouldn&apos;t say it is worth $5 - I&apos;ve seen cheaper games with a lot more content.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=1746283">Expand</a></span>

So many possible answers... Some say it&apos;s because you keep hitting the &apos;V&apos; letter in the keyboard to make your character flip from the ground to the ceiling and vice versa through messing with gravity (the core mechanic of the game); others say it&apos;s because of the names of your crew&apos;s officers (Violet, Vitellary, Verdigris, Victoria, Vermilion, aside you, Viridian) who got lost in dimensional warp zones leaving you behind with the mission of going after them for the rescue; maybe it&apos;s because of a long row of rooms which form a &apos;v&apos;ertical tunnel and whose names are &apos;V&apos;, &apos;VV&apos;, &apos;VVV&apos;, &apos;VVVV&apos;, &apos;VVVVV&apos; and &apos;VVVVVV&apos; respectively (you can see the sequence as you &apos;fall up&apos; there); or it can be a tribute to another indie game, &apos;Aaaaa...!!!: A Reckless Disregard for Gravity&apos; (there&apos;s room named AAAAAA for that). Whatever can the real story be VVVVVV stands out among indie games not only because of its weird name.<br><br>To be honest VVVVVV practically could have been done for the Atari 2600 since there&apos;s only one action button (for the already mentioned gravity mechanic) but that&apos;s not just a coincidence; ultimately it&apos;s founded on the difficulty concept used in many tough Atari games at the time, which was &quot;be quick or be dead&quot;.<br>Some younger gamers may not know it but the original Atari console has a switch behind it with two positions: &quot;Difficulty A&quot; and &quot;Dificulty B&quot;. Only the most freaking hardcore gamers would dare to switch it to the &apos;B&apos; position, because doing so would be just like opening a portal for unlimited frustration--and such feature was achieved by simply raising the CPU&apos;s clock! Yes, just like that: no extra enemies, no alternate paths. Just pure lightning reflexes. (go for some video footage of Frostbite, Demon Attack, Dragonfire or Jawbreaker on the &apos;B&apos; setting and you can see for yourself--I have a feeling that Jawbreaker was an inspiration here even for the characters and enemies design.)<br><br>Digging down the best hardcore source from the past and adding a couple modern tweaks--Metroid-esque map, secret items, quick respawn with no lives limit after death--turned VVVVVV into a blast. Yes, the game is undeniably hard (at least for today standards) but those tweaks make it as much compelling. Chances are you&apos;re even going to laugh at how hard some parts are instead of becoming infuriated.<br><br>Another strong point here is the variety of the environments and puzzling platforming sections, both showing how great the level design project was. Aside the tweaks mentioned above, level design itself makes you believe that reaching the next checkpoint is possible, no matter how bad things look - and as a result you&apos;ll be sucked in to the end.<br><br>Not that it&apos;s immune to downsides. Level design left something to be desired when you&apos;re out of closed environments--the outer space is cool for taking advantage of the &apos;endless screen&apos; feature (just like in Pac Man you can go from one side of the screen to another instantly by just pushing it forward) but unfortunately the result feels just plain uninspired.<br>Also, the game rests a little on the short side--it took me exactly 2 hours for finishing it, finding every secret item and opening the Secret Lab. The later challenges can&apos;t do much for raising the game&apos;s replay value either since they are mostly pretty much unattainable (seeing the &quot;last 1 minute on the Super Gravitron&quot; challenge made me nearly fall off my chair since I can barely stand 10 seconds; even worse, &quot;no deaths mode&quot;?!?! My death counter has shown me an humiliating 700 at the end of my main run!)<br><br>In the end VVVVVV is an unique game not for its name, not for being retro--we got plenty of that out there already--but for being hardcore AND compelling in the same measure.<br><br>- Reviewed for the Autonomous Regime Union</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=2126798">Expand</a></span>

The few frustrating bits took some of my enthusiasm away, as well as the fact the the story is minimal and it&apos;s essentially another (revolutionary) platformer.

<br>
<br>VVVVVV is incredibly cheap regardless of the platform you purchase it for, and for a rough $10 max- a perfect choice for a decently shaped and sized indie game to play for a few hours and then return to every once and a while. The story of a doomed space ship and its crew being teleported to the far regions of the cosmos, and then being sought out by their ever-faithful captain is kind of touching at times, and the platforming proves to be addictive and intense.
<br>
<br>Remember, as already stated via the GI review of the game, this &quot;isn&apos;t for the faint of heart,&quot; and you will easily test your wits and patience, as well as skills and story-telling and following throughout the run-through of this little gem. While quite good for an independent game, and clocking out at around 4-5 hours should you search every nook and cranny of the game, the game falls just short of great- but makes for a good experience nevertheless.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the &quot;GI&quot;-type scoring I&apos;d give to the game:
<br>
<br>Concept: Simple concepts that create excellently crafted challenges varying in difficulty revolving around the one main tool: flipping gravity.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Very minimal details, and use barely any graphics save those of Flash players on the PC versions.
<br>
<br>Sound: Complete with all the nostalgia of those old games  you love, however repetitive they may seem.
<br>
<br>Playability: The character&apos;s speed is annoying at times, and the character- albeit rarely, can encounter glitches that speed up or slow down momentum at weird and unfortunate times.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: While entertaining and utilizing an interesting concept, the game could branch out  a bit more- but the game was independently created, so some leeway can be given possibly...
<br>
<br>Replay Value: Medium
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 8.0

<br>Want more challenge? Then challenge the game and try to get all the discs to unlock more hardcore content.
<br>Mad enough? Then get to play one of the most balanced, fair, and difficult arcade platformers ever made (yes there are speedrunners too).
<br>
<br>Everything I wrote above seasoned with an intense mixture of 8-bit music and graphics that are just perfect, nothing more to add.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re unsure you may like the game or not (if you don&apos;t then probably you don&apos;t understand what&apos;s good and bad and you don&apos;t deserve this game) you can try the first two levels on kongregate, somewhere.
<br>Anyway I recommend this game to everyone, even just to understand when you can really say that a game is GOOD and not just fancy or cool like most games nowadays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=5755254">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is just brilliantly simple and yet hard as balls. It doesn&apos;t have photorealistic graphics, massive complex action, RPG skill trees or sprawling dialogue and still manages to have presence and a well constructed world/narrative. Albeit a SIMPLE narrative but still a narrative none the less and one that is more interesting that most AAA games at the moment.</span>

<br>VVVVVV is actually a really fun ultra-retro style puzzle platformer. With its unassuming story and gameplay, it turned into quite the challenge.
<br>
<br>In essence, you are Captain Viridian, who is lost in an alternate dimension aboard his spaceship, and is trying to locate the other members of his crew (all with names starting with V. There you go). Instead of jumping around, you can control the direction of gravity. This presents some interesting and unique gameplay when trying to traverse this basic, fluoro, and incredibly dangerous landscape.
<br>
<br>The music is entirely chiptune, to fit in with the retro style, and is extremely funky and addictive.
<br>
<br>Grab this one. It&apos;s great fun, even if for a short while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909114">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I spent 4 hours one morning trying to complete one platforming puzzle in VVVVV. After hours of frustration I finally completed the game 100% and was left with a feeling of satisfaction few games manage to evoke in the player these days. Excellent game, could have done with a stronger storyline.</span>

<br>The game has a story that goes deeper only if you look at the games terminals, which is completely optional. The basic story is, you and your crews ship has a malfunction, and when you try to escape, you all get separated. You have to find all 5 of them. The game starts with giving the player the simple idea of the game, then gives the player an open world to find areas that lead to other linear paths. The game is also visually stunning for an 8-bit. One of the games strongest points is its pumping soundtrack that&apos;s catchy tunes will be stuck in your head. Too bad you can&apos;t buy the soundtrack on steam.
<br>The game has a lot of additional content as well. In the main campaign, there are things called trinkets that add more challenge to the game. There are 20 in total and if you collect them all, your pain will be worth it. There are also time trails, a flip mode which is basically playing with your computer upside-down, and a no death mode, which is playing through the whole 2 hour campaign without dying or saving.
<br>Overall, VVVVVV is a challenging, fresh experience that you will finish. However, some additional things will be missed out on because he campaign is promoted the most. This game is absolutely worth the $5 price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vvvvvv/user-reviews?user_review_id=7407777">Expand</a></span>
