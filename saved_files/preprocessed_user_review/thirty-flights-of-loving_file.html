I&apos;ve played &apos;artistic&apos; games like Dear Esther and The Path both of which played like the creators put a lot of thought and effort into an over all nice experience that made you really think about what was going on while leaving it&apos;s impression on you. However with this....&apos;game&apos; i walked up to the &apos;The end&apos; block and seriously thought they were joking. The only impression I got left with here was complete disappointment.
<br>
<br>the short scene it&apos;s self is rather nice but had it been really drawn out more over maybe a good hour or two, i would have been able to appreciate it more. There were games made in the 48 hour game festival more captivating and content full then this. I don&apos;t honestly believe this took more then a week to make.
<br>
<br>Oh and the whole &apos;it&apos;s indie and cheap&apos; thing does not excuse this. Just because it&apos;s an indie game doesn&apos;t mean they can make any crap they want and it&apos;s &apos;ok because it&apos;s indie.&apos; I&apos;m sorry but i am just too disappointed to be susceptible to this incredibly short story...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2909714">Expand</a></span>

Rather than having a consistent player space where content can indefinitely be admired, the player is trusted threw the narrative with no indication when a transition will happen; creating an interesting flow of player driven direction. Many subtleties will leave your face left with a smile during the developers commentary.
<br>
<br>This game is overlooked, and very short, but that&apos;s the point. The developer knew that many players would bash the game while leaving a very passionate niche. The game doesn&apos;t waste your time with it&apos;s very short completion time, and leaves room for re-playability with it&apos;s mind-boggling transitions and subtitles. I hope the developer doesn&apos;t read this because I haven&apos;t played it enough to completely wrap my mind around the game, but there is much to be desired.
<br>
<br>Thirty Flights of Loving is worth your time and money if you have the ability to differentiate video games from interactive media.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639758">Expand</a></span>

Your five dollars will net you a fifteen minute experiment in storytelling  nothing more, nothing less. The game absolutely accomplishes what it set out to do, and successfully manages to tell an involving story (well, as involving as you can get in a little over ten minutes) with no dialogue or character text. A separate playthrough with developer commentary  which I found very interesting  is also included, which provides insight into the development process and what the developer intended to achieve with certain inclusions. All in all, if you&apos;re interested in the advancement of storytelling in video games, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

<br>I digress, I will have to join the side of the critics. This game is fantastic. The art style and overall graphics are beautiful and very well done. The story is great, but blink and you&apos;ll miss it. In terms of gameplay, it&apos;s basically walking, but the experience is so quick that it is almost -fun- to do it.
<br>
<br>But here&apos;s my one minor gripe with the game, and the reason people were not happy with it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s short. Very, very, very, VERY short. On the first run, it takes about 15-20 minutes (I&apos;ve beaten it in under 5). But that&apos;s what&apos;s so great about it. You play it once, and most people will try to get through the game to just beat it. But because it&apos;s so short, you go back and play it again, and see something you missed. And then you play it again, and there&apos;s a new detail. Sure, for 15 minutes, $5 is a bit high. But the experience is worth it. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But is it great? You&apos;re goddamn right it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=3739873">Expand</a></span>

Its construction is sh!tty, its plot is non-existent and its characters are flat. Nothing about the content of the game moves you to play on or to feel interested in any way. You are thrown into a scene and world that has no background other than a quick run-down of your companions skills through bold text and vague jump-cut scenes which depict moments before and after a heist. Nothing is explained to you, which may have been alright had they not chosen to skip around chronologically while also leaving out key points of the plot (i.e. the game is about a heist, but you never even see that occur or participate in it). But since they did, the viewer gets jerked around and has to make sense of mundane or confusing moments that have no dialogue or text for explication. So now you&apos;re playing through a second time, wondering if there&apos;s any point at all, but all you&apos;re finding is a completely non-interactive world with a mildly interesting art style. in fact, the mildly interesting art style is the only thing that earns this title a single point. The critics write reviews saying it&apos;s good that this game doesn&apos;t hold your hand or act like a normal game- well it&apos;s not. Why don&apos;t other games base themselves entirely on jump-cuts? Because they&apos;re not avant garde enough? No. They don&apos;t do that because making a game that way wouldn&apos;t make any sense and it would rob the game of it&apos;s story and details. That is exactly what happens with TFOL. Also, what does Thirty Flights of Loving mean? Is it referencing the fact that they own a plane? That the characters are in love? Who knows! It&apos;s just a non-sense title to go right along with a non-sense game. You go into TFOL wondering what kind of experience you will get because the trailer is well constructed and the art style looks interesting, but you leave confused and annoyed because the end comes too quickly and you&apos;re still wondering what the point was. This game is basically bad sex. The only reason I see this getting a good review is that there are a handful of people who thought it was good and everyone else is too embarrassed to look stupid disagreeing with those people because they&apos;re considered &quot;professional&quot; opinions. This feels like the era of shock art where &quot;artists&quot; upset their viewers and tell them that what they&apos;ve seen and experienced is both good and art. Spoiler alert: It isn&apos;t. Save yourself a few dollars and go do something enjoyable. Or if you really want, you could also pay someone to slap you in the face- that is the equivalent of what you&apos;ll be doing in buying this game anyway, only you&apos;ll actually save some time just paying for the slap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2857723">Expand</a></span>

Engaging and intriguing, Thirty Flights of Loving is a bite sized dose of methodically and expertly crafted narrative. You&apos;ll be confused and disappointed, but also transfixed with the puzzle of riddling out what truly happened on your fifteen minute journey. Were this game free or less ridiculously priced I would give it an eight and be on my way, but such a high tag for such little &apos;game&apos; cannot be ignored. Give it a go if experimental narratives fill you with glee, but seriously consider the price for value ratio if the previous statement does not apply to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2611496">Expand</a></span>

Most of all I was expecting to be able to enjoyably play it for at least a couple hours worth of time. How wrong and disappointed I was. The story lasts approximately 20 minutes and there is no replayability to it. What makes the medium of art and story telling that is known as &quot;video games&quot; is their ability to let the user interact with the game. The level of interaction introduced in this game is dreadful; Google Earth is more interactive and it&apos;s free. I not only spent more time at the beginning just tweaking the graphics, but in the end I also enjoyed setting up my graphics more than the actual game. If you are looking for a good indie game of some sort, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Go buy something like Machinarium or LIMBO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2762742">Expand</a></span>

When I read the reviews before buying it, I thought the claims of 5-15 minutes of gameplay were the usual reviewer exaggerations, but the game is really that short! Double it because it comes with its equally short prequel, Gravity Bone. Yet, for all its brevity and infantile graphics, there&apos;s something to this game: little twists in the plot that you don&apos;t see coming and a storytelling style that feels a bit like a 1960s psychological drama. As the extremely skewed reviews show, this isn&apos;t a game for everyone. You have to come at it like a wine tasting. Sure you pay too much for a small glass, but you get a taste of something you don&apos;t get every day. If you&apos;re an aficionado of the subtle things that go into a game and not just playing the games, you&apos;ll probably get something out of it. If you&apos;re looking for a game for the sake of playing it and you want a bang for your buck, you need to look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2887635">Expand</a></span>

Played from a first-person view, there is virtually no traditional gameplay, aside from being able to interact with the environment and explore its nooks and crannies. The soundtrack and the sound design are great, as well as its graphical presentation. The blocky characters, the usage of color, and the varied environments all mesh together into a game that looks quite unlike any other.
<br>
<br>But yes, there is nothing the player really does in the game, at least, not in the traditional sense. The real reason to play this game is for its story and, more specifically, the way the game presents its story. By employing the mechanics of film editing and cutting freely between events and scenes without any sort of input from the player, Thirty Flights of Loving spins the classic yarn of a heist gone horribly wrong in a wholly unique way. Its non-linearity and hectic pace is a refreshing change from the banality of most video game narratives, and the player truly has to work in order to understand everything that&apos;s happening. While the game can be completed in fifteen minutes or so, the scope and depth of the story told is one that far exceeds its actual runtime. Multiple playthroughs are not only necessary but also inevitable.
<br>
<br>Thirty Flights of Loving is certainly not for everyone. Many players have expressed outrage or frustration at the fact that the &quot;game&quot; isn&apos;t really much of one at all. Brendon Chung, the creator of the game, has himself described it as &quot;an interactive short story&quot;. Ultimately, it does not matter. Thirty Filghts of Loving is a very important game, because it makes a legitimate attempt to tap into the vast potential for video games as a narrative medium. If that sounds at all interesting to you, go play Thirty Flights of Loving. It&apos;s an experience that you won&apos;t soon forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=3173559">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would recommend this if it were free (not as good as Stanley Parable, but still cool), but my god do not pay money for this.</span>

Also, for the very little time you&apos;re playing you have no impact on the story.  It&apos;s a straight hallway where you can&apos;t even so much as walk 10 feet away from the predetermined paths.
<br>
<br>I honestly question whether the &apos;experimental&apos; part of this was the gameplay or seeing how little work they could put into a game and still get away with charging money for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2620109">Expand</a></span>

<br>Agreed, this is not really a game. This is a short story. Or their equivalent in video games.

Maybe, the simple fact that so much work is put into 30 minutes of gameplay? Maybe, the livelihood of the worlds they create? Maybe, the &quot;You wake up and see yourself sleeping&quot; type stories? I&apos;m not sure, but I think everyone can find something to love in this game.</span>

But, if you are a fan of Dear Esther, Home, The Path, Fatale and similar, this one is up there in newness and difference. A narrative that has some lovely moments, but alas requiring little interaction by you except to push things along. Enjoy the 10 minutes and think, odd but amusing.</span>

<br>It&apos;s not really worth &#xA3;4, but neither is a pint of beer in Central London.</span>

<br>
<br>My first experience was disappointing.
<br>Being someone who usually enjoy art games or interactive experiences, i start it thinking about a cool, deep story-driven game, but i found me just watching disordered short scenes of a shallow and confusing story, instead of really playing something. It ended really fast, abruptly and letting me with a &quot;wtf?!&quot; in mind. The graphics, lights, colors and music are really cool, but it was not enough to make me enjoy.
<br>
<br>Then i try it again a few days later.
<br>Knowing what to expect, the experience was far better, and i used to enjoy it and understand it. Using the commentaries feature, i found it was a developer experience, something really personal using his experiences on gaming design and pieces he previously wanted to use in other ways.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t read all the comments yet, and i still having to play better the Gravity Bone bonus, who seems to have more gameplay elements, but if you&apos;re ok with all that i said before, i can recommend this experience to you, it worth your time. But i&apos;ll not recommend to everybody, mostly without that explanation about what i feel in my first contact with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=4015150">Expand</a></span>

Whilst I would recommend a play through I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s with &#xA3;3.99.  Although if you have played any of the other Blendo Games&apos; games, several of which are still freely available on their website, then it&apos;s easier to justify the big outlay for such a short game.</span>

There are other games for puzzles and platforming. This one is about walking through a carefully crafted short story, and it&apos;s very entertaining because the story is crammed into the short form. I think the developer took a lot of time decorating the different rooms and figuring out how to show the story in an attractive fashion. I don&apos;t get the fullest out of the story because there&apos;s a lot between the lines (the bird theme that is reflected in the title) and the title crashed at the end so I had to watch the last minute on Youtube. Still, recommended for a dollar or maybe two.

Thirty Flights of Loving was clearly made with the purpose of making the player think of all that he sees and does in the game - and it&apos;s very competent at that, as long as the player is willing to slow down the pace and try to connect to the story and the characters. There&apos;s a great deal of art and creativity to the environments and interactions the player can make, and the music/sound itself is brilliant. The story itself is only as good as the player&apos;s imagination - if you&apos;re not a creative person, you&apos;ll definitely not enjoy this game as much as I did. Unfortunately, the game crashed to the desktop about 4 times in 2 playthroughs - that&apos;s not nice. Also, although it&apos;s evident that a lot of effort was put into it, and even though it&apos;s a unique and clever experience, I don&apos;t see this game being worth $5. So, I give it an 8/10, it seems like a fair score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861485">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not elitist; it&apos;s simply trying to show a few things. There is no challenge to overcome, nor anyway to actually lose (except by killing yourself). Its more like a first person &quot;take a look on what we built&quot;. It will be entertaining for those thrilled by the visual art choices and people who love to look into details. The directors commentary can be a lesson for those interested in building narratives. For anybody interesed in &quot;classic&quot; video-games, that is, win-lose situations, avoid this by any and all costs. You will hate it. For those interested in little details and an interesting approach on how to set a narrative in games, its great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2888374">Expand</a></span>

The Citizen Abel series continues to prosper with this extraordinary title, especially considering that it was built on the QUAKE2 engine, given that nobody has even touched it in years. To the average gamer, there may not be much to see here, but to pass up a title such as this would be a mistake, for I have never seen something so refreshingly different in a while, being that the only other time was when its predecessor, Gravity Bone, came into existence. In short, the Indie genre triumphs once again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2859501">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you&apos;re still deciding if you want to get this or not, go play Gravity Bone, which is the free prequel. If you enjoy that, you might enjoy TFOL too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2887551">Expand</a></span>

This is the first game in 25 years of gaming that I truly thought deserved a 0, and it&apos;s because it isn&apos;t a game.
<br>
<br>What you will find in most of the high reviews is a lot of vague, flowery language used to champion the storytelling and quality of plot. I thought it was like 21 grams: a boring, predictable story that would have been so obvious and boring if told sequentially that they had no choice but to try and faux-art it up. So I would caution you as a reader to always look for the actual points made and examine them for content, rather than form.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s an example. &quot;It&apos;s a portal to one&apos;s own imagination, the only lock on which is the limit he would impose on his own dreams--let go of all expectations to find it so much more than it first seemed.&quot; I just described a door hot glued to a solid brick wall. Not only will if take effort to remove the door, but when you do, you&apos;re still faced with a brick wall, whose function is antithetical to that of a door.
<br>
<br>When describing a game, your first concern should be gameplay. If it isn&apos;t, you&apos;re not a gamer. You can care about other things, like plot/character, quality of voice-acting, graphics, price, etc, but gameplay is the fundamental reason why an idea becomes a game and not a movie.
<br>
<br>A blogger put it best (and I paraphrase) that it seemed like an attempt by someone who is confused by art and assumes that others are likewise confused, to reproduce that which confuses him. It&apos;s just a heist story with characters that don&apos;t even achieve one-dimensionality. The mountebanks that tell you otherwise are responding to their ill-informed gut instincts that the game is art, and as people are given to do, they oversell it as brilliant and groundbreaking in an attempt to somehow internalize those misperceived traits. These same mental gymnastics allow some to continue support of &quot;Indoctrination Theory&quot; in 2013.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a half-story told though asynchronous set pieces separated by jump cuts. It has a kind of Diabolik era look to it, but each set piece is simply walked (or run) through with the occasional static activation of an object. In the opening scene you can grab bottles of liquor, a gun and some ammo, but you will never use them.
<br>
<br>As I approached what ultimately was the end, I thought it was a fun way to introduce elements of the back story before launching the actual gameplay. And then it was over, 10 minutes of absolutely nothing.
<br>
<br>I considered calling Steam and requesting them to remove it from my account, but its presence serves as an albatross around my neck and reminds me to always do my research.
<br>
<br>Dust off your copy of Out of This World if you&apos;re old like I am, or buy it from GOG if you still have your youth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=3049569">Expand</a></span>

Unlike the other games I mentioned, Thirty Flights of Loving is annoying to play, triggers no emotion and features no attempt to immerse the player. It is true that this game is as long as it should be, but only in the fact of telling a story. The game has plenty of pointless &quot;gameplay&quot; elements, annoying sound effects and confusing mechanics. The title goes for 10 minutes, for a 5 dollar &quot;game&quot; it is a pretty damn big rip off. 10 minutes of confusion, 0 gameplay, linear progression, pointless features and no player impact of the story begs the question of why the player was given the controls in the first place. The new scene of art inside gaming is an interesting and for the most part a good thing, but Thirty Flights of Loving takes this scene to beyond ridiculous. The whole title is basically a waste, the story told in the &quot;game&quot; can be told a hundred times better on paper, or in a cartoon. The whole experience of this game can be summed up in confusion, and when the end credits smack you in the face after 10 minutes, you can&apos;t help feel like you have been hypnotized, then mugged for your lunch money without realizing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2966995">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>30 Flights is definitely an arthouse game. It has an interesting approach to interactive storytelling that may be worth seeing, but unfortunately, the story it tells is unremarkable. From what I could tell, there just isn&apos;t much substance there. What&apos;s much more interesting is playing with the developer&apos;s commentary on, so you can see some of the thought that went behind the experience.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s prequel is also included, and while it&apos;s a longer game with more gameplay elements, it&apos;s designed clumsily, and you might be left with no idea where to go.
<br>
<br>This game has a very niche audience, and to them, this game will be worth far more than the asking price. It wasn&apos;t for me, though, and I get the feeling that it&apos;s not for most people, especially because the price doesn&apos;t pay for much content. It&apos;s worth experiencing if you have a few extra minutes, but I wouldn&apos;t pay over a dollar for this. If this looks interesting to you, I&apos;d recommend checking out The Stanley Parable instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=2973512">Expand</a></span>

Theres no gameplay to speak off, and while there are a few interesting segments, the game is largely just filled with a bunch of ****
<br>
<br>Might make for an interesting flash game thats &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;FREE</span>

<br>The story is confusing (what&apos;s with the wedding scene?) and the graphics are not so interesting.
<br>I don&apos;t regret the money I spent for this (less than 2&#x20AC; on Steam) but I surely regret those 20 minutes I spent running it.</span>

<br>Play The Stanley Parable  that is a good game with interesting narrative. Not this...</span>

It masterfully paces the story, using fast cuts and transitions, environmental clues, and efficient level design. While there is little for traditional &quot;gameplay&quot;, I often hear the line that Thirty Flights of Loving tells &quot;a better story in 13 minutes, than some games do in 13 hours&quot;. It&apos;s exactly this feat which the game should be judged on. It&apos;s exactly the fact that the developer had in mind to make the most enthralling game (no matter the length) he could, that the game should be judged on. And, that he had the courage, bravery, and balls to resist lengthening the game artificially, deserves huge credit.
<br>
<br>In every other medium, be it film, or books, the standard is to be as concise as possible. A 90 minute film which can develop the same amount of story and emotion, is always preferred to a 120 minute film doing the same. They criticize books or films having meaningless redundancy for scenes which don&apos;t have any significance or plot building. Only in videogaming is there a standard which says the Art needs to last longer. Just think about that, and if it is a rational standard to have. Try giving this game a chance to see what it means to break that standard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=6717700">Expand</a></span>

But the simple fact is that it promised me a unique game, yet after I had handed over my money it turned out to be a short, uninteresting, completely linear story about some heist or something. I honestly can&apos;t even remember, that&apos;s how great it was. It is more like an interactive short story than a game, but not in a good way. Interactive only means you make you character walk somewhere with your keyboard sometimes, and sometimes you click something with your mouse. You don&apos;t do these things because you want to, or because you have the option to, you do them because you must.
<br>
<br>There is no depth to the characters, no incentive to continue other than wanting to get this the hell over with, there&apos;s no voice-acting, no text, nothing. The developers made the characters moan from time to time, that&apos;s it. All of this no doubt in an attempt to come of as &quot;artsy&quot;.
<br>
<br>For me, that pretty much sums up this game: arty-farty for the sake of being arty-farty. At the end of the game you get to walk around in a museum of sorts, where the devs display all the assets and explain about the creation of the game. Like you would do with something that actually deserves that extra attention. This piece of software doesn&apos;t. It feels more like a high-school project for Game Design 101 than anything else. Only thing good about it is that it is over quick.
<br>
<br>You know what all these &quot;professional&quot; critics with their high scores remind me of? They remind me of people who know nothing about art, but who, when they are confronted with some questionable modern work of art which they know nothing about, frown, stroke their chin, swirl their wine, and say something like: &quot;I really like the depth and the balance of colors&quot;, or some vague stuff like that, just to make it seem like they know what the hell is going on. They don&apos;t because there is, quite simply, nothing going on at all. Same with these critics who don&apos;t know what this game is supposed to be. &quot;I clearly don&apos;t understand this **** but I&apos;ll give it an 8 anyway because it seems &quot;arty&quot; and I want to seem cultured, and I don&apos;t want to admit that I have no clue what&apos;s going on.&quot;
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a difference between art and arty-farty, my friends. Art MOVES you. The only movement this game creates is me walking away from my pc.
<br>
<br>1 point for simply existing, that&apos;s an achievement...I guess.

I would call TFOL an experimentation, a prototype; a look into how storytelling can be changed. Saying that, I understand what Blendo was going for, they were attempting something new and trying to tell a story in under 20 minutes, but honestly it just didn&apos;t work. Maybe if they did something different this technique could&apos;ve worked but it&apos;s just not polished enough and it feels broken or incomplete. There&apos;s even a couple random scenes that have nothing to do with the story they&apos;re trying to tell, like why do I need to know how wings work? I learned that in highschool and I didn&apos;t care then either. I just feel it&apos;s irrelevant and was simply to add a couple minutes more to the game so people can&apos;t say that it&apos;s less than 20 minutes (took me 24 minutes to complete both games (Gravity Bone and TFOL)).
<br>
<br>What I&apos;m getting at here is if a developer wants to make a unique game, or an artsy game, throwing a couple stylized 3D models together in a few random consecutive scenes is not the way to do it. I love art indie games, I&apos;m almost ashamed to say it since so many people hate them, but I like the art subgenre game that&apos;s been somewhat popular in the past few years (I loved Dear Esther). But TFOL doesn&apos;t do it right, and that&apos;s why I&apos;m giving it such a low grade. I don&apos;t understand how the critics can rate it so high, call this what you will, but I think there&apos;s a small possibility that the critics were paid off, and some users jumped into the critic bandwagon (which happens pretty often around controversial games) and gave TFOL high scores to show that they weren&apos;t &quot;too stupid to figure out the story.&quot; I understand the story, and I still think TFOL is a bad game. While playing it I could sense a fresh breath of air hiding under the badly put-together game, but until that refreshing feel surfaces, TFOL remains a complete mess. Hey, at least Blendo didn&apos;t make the character walk really slow to extend the length of the game.
<br>
<br>In short, these could be some reasons this game is rated so high:
<br>&#x2022;Critics paid off, users jump in bandwagon
<br>&#x2022;People want to pretend they understand it, even if there&apos;s nothing to understand
<br>&#x2022;Purchasers can&apos;t face the fact they got ripped off, trick themselves into thinking it&apos;s good
<br>&#x2022;Developer needed some cash and had an incomplete prototype laying around
<br>&#x2022;Definitely not because the game is good</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=4137932">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>ENGLISH: A surreal (or &quot;hyper-real&quot;, in his own words) game, made by a single guy who really wanted to tell a story in 15 minutes without dialogues or voiceovers or any text besides signposts and newspapers (not even the notes found in every indie horror game nowadays). He also used Quake2 engine, which means that the graphics are all blocky and low-polygonal as hell, which the developer addressed by making everyone look like they were made out of cardboard boxes. I wouldn&apos;t say the end result looks good by any means, but you do get used to it, and it fits the setting.
<br>
<br>After all, this is a game where you can literally walk through people (and a few other objects as well): they won&apos;t notice that, or react to pretty much anything. A dramatic scene in the airport literally has you drag a wounded friend on your shoulder through a dense crowd in the airport you just tried to attack, yet nobody reacts in any way. Stuff like this is one reason why the story hardly sticks: another is that it just isn&apos;t substantial. Sure, it&apos;s non-linear and does hit the notes of love and betrayal, throwing a twist or two, and the &quot;in-game editing&quot; they pionereed inspired last year&apos;s Virginia, but there still isn&apos;t much on the whole. The setting is kinda nice, though: it&apos;s an authoritarian Argentine in alternate 50&apos;s with dry laws, Mecha-Presidente who quotes Hobbes and police cameras flying about everywhere, yet these same cameras observe a rooftop party (illegal because of fire safety rules) where plenty of alcohol is drunk, yet no-one gets arrested or punished afterwards. I could call it an oversight, but I like to think it&apos;s a grounded representation of authoritarianism, far more realistic then the hysterical writings of Orwell or his imitators.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thirty-flights-of-loving/user-reviews?user_review_id=6926702">Expand</a></span>
