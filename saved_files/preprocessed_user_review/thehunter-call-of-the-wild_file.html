You can expect realistic animal behavior, different weather conditions and ballistics. If you are expecting an extensive tutorial, you won&apos;t find it here. What you will find at the beginning of the game is being dropped into the hunting world with a gun and a map. Do expect some limited initial voice overs and tips, but expect to be pretty much left to your own devices.
<br>
<br>We&apos;ve found the tracking mechanics to be both frustrating and exciting at the same time. theHunter creates an immersive experience that feels very real. Also, be forewarned to be on the edge at all times because many of the animals can turn and attack you at a moment&#x2019;s notice. We must say, it was very exciting once we finally lined up that shot and pulled the trigger. Accuracy matters a whole lot as the ballistics really alter the success of each shot based off distance and trajectory.
<br>
<br>The issues that we found with the game are as follows: We found theHunter to be sometimes laggy, due to the sheer size of the map and it being rendered all at once. We noticed that while in the prone position, that the grass does not connect to the ground, which caused clipping and obstructed the path at times. Note that the most noteable glitch during our gameplay was a moose that was stuck in a hillside that just would not die until it was shot five times. This is a big deal when ammo is limited and weapons are difficult to unlock in the beginning. There is also an auto walk feature, which is nice when walking great distances, but problematic when collecting trophies. This is because when doing so the game does not pause and you can walk off a cliff, be attacked by a bear, or both in our case.

<br>
<br>I&apos;m running it on a 980ti though so maybe some of the glitches are on cheaper graphics cards.
<br>
<br>As for the game itself, I am ridiculously addicted to it, much more than I ever expected from this kind of game. There is something about running around the woods by yourself looking for animals to shoot, and actually shooting the animals and occasionally shooting a whole bunch of animals in a row that I find very addictive
<br>
<br>The controls are very similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare in my opinion and it was very easy for me to start racking up kills.
<br>
<br>Lastly I want to mention there are two DLC packs you pretty much have to buy , ATVs and tents, that should have been included in the original game. I didn&apos;t buy the game at full price because of this and waited until there was a 30% off sale on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thehunter-call-of-the-wild/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468066">Expand</a></span>

This is aiming more towards being a sim than arcade game. You take your time stalking. You use your tools/calls, you be patient, you place your shots wisely. You can also level up certain abilities which can help a lot. Many different animals to hunt. They all have different AI that is supposed to make them act accordingly. There is even a little bit of a story to move you along at times, if you care for that. I just like the hunting and so far have ignored story side bits. Also, no crashes on 3 diff computers. My 4790k, 16GB Ram and GTX 1060, My Ryzen 3 1200, 8GB ram and 1050 and even my G3258, 4 GB ram (yeah, its under the min req and plays fine!) and another 1050. All played great without any bugs/crashes. The g3258, 4gb, 1050 runs it on low at 1080 well over 30-40fps. Wouldnt want to go much lower on specs, though. The RX 460 or a 750ti would probably be OK, but less/older than that, an older dual core, or less RAM and youre out of luck.

<br>Thehunter call of the wild is a hunting simulation with tons of promise and potential..
<br>the world is beautiful, there are cool mechanics to make hunting intriguing&#x2026;
<br>but call of the wild ultimately forgets to make this game feel like a game&#x2026;
<br>You starts call of the wild by choosing youre character then youre set into the world and get a quick rundown on how things work..
<br>theres a mission structure here, but you can ignore all of this and just go hunting on your own&#x2026;
<br>I was impressed with the lighting and graphics of this game&#x2026; there are ubisoft like outposts that mark locations on your map to uncover for experience or fast travel points to buy new weapons and ammo with the cash earned from completing missions or hunting on your own&#x2026;
<br>there are blinds oyu can build with your cash to lure animals into an area and take them out&#x2026;
<br>and the idea of hunting in this game at first seems really cool..
<br>as you walk around youll see tracks all over the place and you can examine them and by doing so the game will tell you which animal these tracks belong to.. really helpful for the games missions&#x2026;
<br>you then follow these tracks and depending on how old there are they can lead you right to the animal.. their resting area or where they eat..
<br>and while youre hunting them down you have to be cautious of both the wind and the amount of noise you make..
<br>theres a compass telling you the direction the winds blowing and if an animal picks up on your scent they&#x2019;ll run.. they&#x2019;ll also give you warning calls if youre close and making too much noise..
<br>I was ready for all of this..
<br>however hunting here is far more tedious than that set up makes it sound..
<br>it isn&#x2019;t like a witch contract where you search an area for a while..
<br>tracking down animals can take you thousands of kilometers away from your starting point
<br>only going off of a cone on your cell phone which acts as your mini map to find the next point of interest&#x2026;
<br>tracking down just one animal can easily take 30 minutes and its just not fun..
<br>youd think maybe youll run into other animals while hunting this one, but it doesn&#x2019;t happen..
<br>the world feels like a ghost town&#x2026;
<br>the rarity of animals makes this feel more like a hiking while animals in the distance mock you simulator&#x2026;
<br>and again you can find where animals feed and the time they do so..
<br>so I went to a resting place. .waiting until the time an animal I was hunting for a story mission was supposed to eat and I waited for a 30 minute window and they never showed up&#x2026;
<br>how are spawns not frequent in this feeding window&#x2026;
<br>make this simulator at least a little video gamey..
<br>its hunting without the reward of food at the end of it all&#x2026;
<br>so at least let me have a little fun with it..
<br>there are 2 separate reservers here.. though each reserve shares the same 12 animals specials.. though 6 of those 12 being a type of deer.. so the hunting variety is pretty lacking&#x2026;
<br>the 2nd map is less beautiful and much smaller.. and felt a little too populated&#x2026;
<br>but I cant complain ive been waiting 5 hours to see an animal to shoot and when I went here I was seeing like 20 all bunched up..
<br>and I shoot.. and theyre just not falling&#x2026;
<br>the lack of realism when it comes to shooting the animal is the most annoying part of all of this..
<br>when you do finally track one down.. theres no satisfaction of dropping them&#x2026;
<br>you shoot them and chase them until they bleed out
<br>and while wounded they all of a sudden turn into speed gonzoles..
<br>theyre out of there and you have to get your vanessa carlton on and follow their blood trail for 1000 miles
<br>though youre ranked on how little they suffer.. so aiming for vitals through this games ridiculous amount of sway is rewarded.. and youre paid and earn xp accordingly
<br>xp that goes into a leveling system and gives you skill and perk points to dump into your weapons and hunting abilities&#x2026;
<br>The world again is beautiful and varried&#x2026; but this game is really for the patient type that don&#x2019;t mind the tedium of checking how fresh deer poop is just to come to a dead end and start again on a new track&#x2026;
<br>I give Thehunter call of the wild

<br>-Beautiful and very realistic graphics, sounds, ambience, weather effects
<br>-Very accurate and realistic bullet ballistics and trajectory
-Hunting and tracking are slow and require patience, so this is NOT call of duty hunting.
-With each animal you kill, it shows you where the bullet enters and what organs are hit along with other statistics.

<br>-Beautiful and very realistic graphics, sounds, ambience, weather effects

<br>-Hunting and tracking are slow and require patience, so this is NOT call of duty hunting.
<br>-With each animal you kill, it shows you where the bullet enters and what organs are hit along with other statistics.
<br>-Each animal reacts to every sound, smell, and sight differently and with realistic outcomes
<br>
<br>However, the game lacks any content other than hunting..
<br>-This hunting game released with NO placeable tree stands, ground blinds, tents, or transportation (which is very risky on the developer end of a hunting game..) however, you can now purchase these items with real money many months after release.
<br>-This game does NOT include any purchasable property such as a cabin where you can hang up your trophies or process your kills.
<br>-There is NOTHING to do in this game, other than hunting and tracking animals.
<br>
<br>-In the item shop, some of the item descriptions scroll a bit too fast to read.
<br>-In the player menu, it sometimes takes multiple clicks to open the map/inventory/skills/perks
<br>-In the item shop under rifles and rifle ammo, excessive scrolling is needed just for it to show duplicate items which may be confusing at first
<br>As of 11-29-2017, I have not experienced any other bugs or glitches with this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thehunter-call-of-the-wild/user-reviews?user_review_id=7810166">Expand</a></span>
