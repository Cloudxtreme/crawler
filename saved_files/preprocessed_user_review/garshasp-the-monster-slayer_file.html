However for the first try of the developers the game is good and the art is great. It was really enjoyable to play it, I think Dead Mage has a great future.

(I&apos;ve also played God of War, but saw no similarities with this game) Garshasp (the protagonist) looks EXACTLY like the Prince, and combat, movement, graphics - everything looks like Prince of Persia, allbeit with a different scale, lower quality graphics, and a poorer engine. The skybox was nonexistant, and the sound was bad both in quality and choice. It was painful to listen to.<br><br>Combat was absurdly easy and simplistic to the point of being boring, and the graphics just caused the game to be an eyesore. It straddles this awkward line of being more advanced than a 2d platformer, but so unpolished and simplistic that it became ugly. Aliasing was a HUGE issue, and movement felt clunky. There were several times I would be attacking an enemy as it approached, only to end up ON TOP of the enemy - LITERALLY standing on its head.<br><br>Understandably, it&apos;s from an Iranian indie studio, which carries its own set of connotations, however they could&apos;ve really stood to do some further playtesting to iron out small (but annoying and longstanding) bugs and to improve game balance to provide something more challenging and fun to play. AND SOMETHING MORE ORIGINAL PLEASE.<br><br>It loses most of its points for me strictly for being an obvious ripoff of Ubisoft games that predate it, and loses the rest of the points for general lack of polish. This FEELS like it&apos;s from an indie studio, unlike other indie games that are very polished, beautiful, and fun to play. Instead of inventing their own &quot;gimmicks&quot; to draw players, they rely on ones created by other companies, which entirely ruins the game for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/garshasp-the-monster-slayer/user-reviews?user_review_id=1611576">Expand</a></span>

Sometimes the game goes really slow and with that poor graphic isn&apos;t a great thing. The game is not too bad in the first minutes but it loses all the appeal after 10 minutes... really annoying.</span>
