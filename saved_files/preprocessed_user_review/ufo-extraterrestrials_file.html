Playable out-of-box, but like in TES4: Oblivion, the game transforms from good to excellent with a good modpackage. After you try couple of those, playing without &apos;em is like driving a bicycle with your hands tied behind your back.</span>

Something about it, I just couldn&apos;t get into it. I am a massive fan of the X-Com series, and it rings fairly true to UFO Defense. The controls are annoying, but manageable, and from what I can tell, there are mods to take care of that problem. Some of what I&apos;ve seen calls this UFO Defense with a graphics update, but to me the graphics are ugly and horrific. They honestly ruined the game for me, I&apos;m not one to be picky about graphics, but they completely ruined it for me. I realize this isn&apos;t a major studio game, but that&apos;s no excuse, there are games from outside the main studios that still look good. I actually uninstalled this and started searching for user-made patches for X-com so I could run it on my computer. As for the complaint calling normal difficulty like insane, if you played the old X-Com games, then you expect it to be hard regardless of what difficulty setting. If you can get past the ugly look of it, and the unwealdy controls, there is something good underneath. As for me, I&apos;ll stick with UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep(which by the way is on steam for $5).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-extraterrestrials/user-reviews?user_review_id=405858">Expand</a></span>

I bought it from Gamersgate and played it a bit, though probably no more than an afternoon. I would have given it a 6 at the times, though looking back 1 of those points might have been for the nostalgia of the game it tries to emulate (X-Com)<br>What the Gold edition offers is just about every improvement that the community asked for with the original. Better ranged combat, better AI, better UI, tweaked graphics, moddability (some hard coded into the game - you want turn based or real time combat? It&apos;s an option. You want  immortal, mortal or VERY mortal troops, select them)<br>In fact it turns out that the developers took the contents of the top community mods and (shamelessly but quite understandably) hard coded them into the game along with the existing bug fix and improvement patches (of which there were either 2,3 or 4 depending on how you bought your original game)<br>The result is a FAR better game. The graphics will still disappoint some (though they are much better than the original X-Coms form 17 years ago) and the first really good tribute to the Microprose/Gollop brothers legacy.<br>I will add that if you have no money what-so-ever then UFO Alien Invasion is an option. It is not as good as this, but for free it&apos;s not too bad at all.<br><br>nyway, the original release was worth 5 or 6, this one is worth a solid 9 for fans of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-extraterrestrials/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600131">Expand</a></span>

If you haven&apos;t played an X-COM game, I don&apos;t see how you couldn&apos;t enjoy this for the amzing strategy/rpg game that it is...  If you have played X-COMs, then you would have to be compelled to say that his is by far one of the most challenging, yet fun one in the series!</span>

<br>There is nothing special to say, you know the genre, you know how the game works.This game is a remake of the original X-Com and stays close to the course material.I know the game had issues when they released it, i had no bugs at all!THe gameplay is old-school, keep that in mind!
<br>
<br>Visuals:The game is not a beauty, but it fullfills it purpose.
<br>
<br>Sound:Some good backroundmusic, weaponsounds are ok, nothing special here.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:Like i said, very oldschool.It takes X-Com and adds some features, most of them work very well.A good example is the resistance type that armor and enemys have.Some are immune to fire or poison, others are weak to that damagetype and so on.That adds some tactical depth i think.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:I had so much fun with the game.Much more fun when i compare it to the new x-com or Xenonauts.The reason is that this game takes the best parts and adds something new, something that i missed in Xenonauts.The artstyle is nice for my taste.Without the bugs this game comes close to the first X-Com and maybe is better in some points.But some things are clunky, because of that its only a 7 which is much higher than my score for Xenonauts ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-extraterrestrials/user-reviews?user_review_id=5234005">Expand</a></span>
