However, from WRC in 2010 to WRC 4, I can see little progresses being made each time new game is released.
<br>
<br>WRC 4 is not that different from WRC 3 in gameplay aspect, aside from more sensitive arcady handling. Although this may disappoint some hard-core rally gamers, it is welcoming to see that Milestone&apos;s WRC game is trying to appeal to more broader audiences rather than constricting their games only for die-hard rally fans. If you are one of sim-racer and is disappointed with how car handles, you are welcome to stick to your glorious Richard Burns Rally. Aside from handling of the car, the engine sound of car has changed. Now, driving car actually sounds like 4WD metal beast pumped with turbo, rather than generic racing car with turbo whispering here and there.
<br>
<br>Although game features three periods of time (noon, dawn, and dusk) it quite perplexing why they haven&apos;t added option to adjust weather. Although weather is featured in this game, it seems like weather only changes in certain stages. However, it is good to see that little progress is being made over time.
<br>
<br>Well, biggest problem with this game is that it doesn&apos;t changed whole lot from WRC 3 other than the elements I have just pointed out above. Rally tracks in this game didn&apos;t changed a lot from rally tracks of WRC 3; this almost feels criminal. Expect to see a lot of familiar landmarks during rally if you played WRC 3 before. Although funky extreme sport-esque vibe has been removed, it came with cost of complete banishment of &quot;Road to WRC&quot; career mode and goofy mini-games such as outrunning helicopters and smashing blocks. Although I never really cared much about those mini games before, but to see it completely removed, it feels, well, empty. Also, it should be noted that classic WRC cars are also completely removed.
<br>
<br>Well, Milestone is adding little bit of changes over time, but it seems almost too little changes are being added into this game each time, and WRC series still has long way to go to match Codemaster&apos;s racing game. However, it is good to see at least improvement is being made each time. I hope Milestone adds more changes next time. One can only hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wrc-4-fia-world-rally-championship/user-reviews?user_review_id=3791989">Expand</a></span>

Wheel support is improved... however 900 degrees is a joke (causes huge deadzone), pedals are required to be in combined mode (or causes a huge deadzone), and force feedback is just variable center spring strength (no rumble, vibrate, etc).  Even if you turn off all assist options, there&apos;s some form of traction control that is always on (hard to spin tires).  It&apos;s no Richard Burns Rally replacement... but if you don&apos;t mind the arcade physics, it can be an enjoyable game.  But there&apos;s still plenty of room for Milestone to improve, unless they lose the WRC licence... we can only hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wrc-4-fia-world-rally-championship/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674961">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are perfectly acceptable and I would give them a 9 out of 10  only the spectators are not as crisp but are you here to look at pretty spectators or experience the thrill of rallying?
<br>
<br>Overall this is a fantastic game and for the scope and variety it has  EXCELLENT value for its very reasonable price. There are a few minor issues with uploading your stats which I am sure they will fix and an easy fix for NVidia drivers if like me you have an Intel and Nvidia driver together. If you love rallying and feel you have been left in the wilderness by the DIRT series in the last few years  snap this up you won&apos;t regret it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wrc-4-fia-world-rally-championship/user-reviews?user_review_id=3671790">Expand</a></span>

First dirt was an excellent rally game with some nice additions but totally lost the way. I have played all the other wrc games and this is the best by a mile, graphics are NOT the be all and end all of good games....rant over! 8/10</span>

<br>Very enjoyable. Great tracks and good variety. Finally a true rally game for sim fans that are tired of Dirt owning this genre. You&apos;ll only find pure rally events here along with your British co-driver.

<br>Engine/Exhaust sounds, environment, and these physics are the worst part of that &quot;DLC&quot; But i had a new surprise, there&apos;s absolutely no advanced video options like previous series.
<br>Milestone&apos;s and BBI laziness this year was astonishing and i fear they&apos;re losing ground to Rally Sim fans and even to those who really hoped milestone did actually change something.
<br>I wouldn&apos;t spend my money on a game that has been recycled for 4 years now to see the same stuff over and over again. The devs could at least improve their game engine and add a proper FFB and a proper advanced controller options! We&apos;re in 2013 for god&apos;s sake, we do not play on keyboards anymore, there&apos;s something out there that looks like a a giant donut and u can connect to the PC. It&apos;s called a Steering Wheel Milestone, give it some attention...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wrc-4-fia-world-rally-championship/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670708">Expand</a></span>

The series would be better spending more time between releases, with more time spent adding to and refining what is already available, as opposed to regurgitating the same content.</span>

I like how I have to repair my car if I damage my car every 2 stages because it&apos;s more realistic, and using a single car to complete the whole season is also realistic. The handling is a lot better when compared to WRC1/2. Also there&apos;re more weather options.
<br>However, there&apos;s a main problem in the game is that I cannot try other cars during a season. That&apos;s a big big minus to me. Also, I actually feel a bit boring when I try to complete the whole WRC. It&apos;s pretty time consuming and therefore this game is not my pick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wrc-4-fia-world-rally-championship/user-reviews?user_review_id=3879052">Expand</a></span>

BUT other than that, the rest of the game is a cheap experience. The sound effects are bad, the career mode is dull and boring, but the worst thing is, its suposed to be 13  Rally comptetions with 6 stages/courses each, wich should be 78 stages/courses total right? WRONG, in reallity its just like 20 or so original courses, the rest they just use the same stages on reverse or with some minor side road diference, even thou they use diferent names and try to pretend its an entirelly  diferent  new course. I mean  how cheap is that??!!
<br>SO i think this game is only  worth buying on some 10$ sale. More than that is just a rip off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wrc-4-fia-world-rally-championship/user-reviews?user_review_id=3892795">Expand</a></span>
