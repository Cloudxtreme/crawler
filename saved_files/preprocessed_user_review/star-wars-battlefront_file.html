The game itself is where it falls short.
<br>
<br>The gunplay needs much more depth. It&apos;s just too simple. The only modifiers to the guns effectiveness is reduced damage at range, to the point where if you want to to long or even medium range shooting you have to use the sniper cards. At close range most guns will kill in a few hits, at longer ranges head shots will do around 10% HP.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know why this is.
<br>
<br>The other main issue I have with it is the random spawns. This game is called Battlefront, but there is no actual battle front if you know what I mean. You can clear an area only to have the enemy team randomly spawn behind you and the whole thing ends up feeling very spy-vs-spy.
<br>
<br>I really hate the direction they chose with picking up powerups off the ground. The vehicle controls are abhorrent. Strangely it seems like the targetting reticle is not actually zero&apos;d at certain angles/ranges for nearly every vehicle. In turrets, the AT-ST, or AT-AT I would sometimes have to put the reticle well above an enemy&apos;s model to actually hit them close up or at some angles.
<br>
<br>I am generally pretty above average at the games I play, and my Origin profile gave me a 3.24 KDR on Battlefront before I refunded, but the game still felt very much like a spawn-and-die affair. Even with the quickly regenerating health, your shelf-life as a trooper seems like it&apos;s always going to be pretty damn short. It just feels like a McDonalds kind of gaming experience. There just doesn&apos;t seem like a lot of room for tactics and strategy, like the game was designed to keep the skill ceiling low to the floor.
<br>
<br>I think it&apos;s fine to appeal to casuals but I believe every successful MP game needs to be competitive to have any longevity. Why couldn&apos;t we have the current battlefront in a casual mode and then a hardcore mode with more in-depth mechanics to appeal to the competitive crowd? It&apos;s not for lack of interest, the most popular games are always competitive and e-sport like. Even if you don&apos;t like competitive MP you can&apos;t deny that.
<br>
<br>Even with its current simplified mechanics, if vehicles spawned on the ground, powerups removed, classes introduced into the game and the spawn system completely revamped to eliminate the spy-vs-spy spawning, supremacy and walker assault would be far superior.
<br>
<br>The other modes are extremely lacking though. Most of them are way too similar to offer any real value. Heroes vs Villains could have been cool, but in my opinion why is half the team made up of essentially fodder for the heroes? It&apos;s like playing that mode you have to take turns on having fun at all. You can&apos;t just play a hero. A whole new meta game could have came out of this mode but it the effort was a pretty big fumble. There is a lot of potential to make the heros have a lot of depth and a hero vs villains mode being very fun to play, perhaps even something along the lines of a MOBA, but it falls really short. The saber mechanics are pitiful and pretty much just end in one saber hero trying to stun-lock the other through spamming. The gunning heros are far better though and Boba Fett is really fun to play. Dice could have really expanded on this but again missed the boat.
<br>
<br>So to sum it up, this game should have been designed both around the competitive multiplayer and casual crowd instead of just a theme-park Star Wars shooter that gets old in a few hours. This game is salvagable in my opinion with a large patch that could revamp the controls, spawns, vehicles, weapon attributes, etc - but we all know that will never happen.
<br>
<br>So what we&apos;re left with is a lot of really pretty Star Wars assets that will probably end up in another game at some point. Maybe then us detractors will get something we want to play.
<br>
<br>This game is one giant missed opportunity. Dice threw in some pretty graphics, skinner box mechanics, and a little social engineering in the hopes of crafting EA a new money tree with the Star Wars name. That&apos;s all this is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5789568">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>6. No space battles, or galactic conquest (which was one of the CORE features in previous games)
<br>
<br>7. No previous ERA&apos;s in-game (Clone wars...)
<br>
<br>TL;DR
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy, or wait till all DLC&apos;s are released and buy this game at low price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5798024">Expand</a></span>

They worked lines from the movie into other characters&apos; dialogue to the point where it sounds like the people in the game saw Star Wars recently and are reciting lines to each other like an inside joke, while fighting Star Wars battles. &quot;We&apos;ve captured the point. ALL TOO EASY!&quot; Han Solo recites lines we&apos;ve heard in a dozen other games, but only heard once in the movies. The game wasn&apos;t written to fit in within the SW movies, it was assembled verbatim from them. Worse, it was assembled from the Star Wars movies we&apos;ve seen a hundred times. Conveniently rushed to shelves in time to see a new one hit theaters in a few weeks, but we don&apos;t see any of that one here.
<br>
<br>The problem is that if you were to strip away the Star Wars theme from these battles and reskin it with pretty much anything else, the game is not good. Sure, it feels like the originals, but they&apos;re a decade old. There&apos;s no excuse for this game to be the least bit shallow in terms of content, but there it is. You&apos;re running around looking for glowing tokens like Crash Bandicoot looking for fruit.
<br>
<br>It comes down to people who are happy with what we were handed here, and the people who see what this could have been. It could have expanded on things like Jedi Knight or KOTOR, could have had gameplay options and freedom like the Arkham games did for Batman (tell me using the grapple hoist line Luke used to grenade the AT-AT, but free to use anywhere creatively wouldn&apos;t have been amazing) but instead we got the standard EA movie tie-in treatment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5804830">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pro:
Graphics are beautiful.
Sound is great
Great optimization for PC

Con:
Gun play is weak. Have a gun meant for long range and someone gets moderately close to you? Better just hang it up. They will win 90% of the time. Range damage drop offs (too close and too far away) are so extreme that its frustrating.
1000x grenades. Everywhere.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I wanted to like this game. I really did.

<br>1000x grenades. Everywhere. Constantly. Grenades. How many red icons can you dodge.
<br>SPAWN. So many spawn deaths. Why can&apos;t games figure this out? I spawned sever times directly in front of shooting enemies (within melee range).
<br>
<br>I played about 6 hours. That&apos;s how long a game with great graphics and poor game play will keep me happy.
<br>
<br>I returned it, unfortunately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5788724">Expand</a></span>

<br>The rest is unfortunately mediocre at best. Let&apos;s start with the obvious in that  there is no single player campaign or Galactic Conquest, and prequel content is made to sit on the sidelines this time. This means that genuinely cool planets and heroes can&apos;t be included because DICE and EA have either limited themselves or been limited by Disney.
<br>
<br>Gunplay is bland, with little to no recoil. Vehicles are clunky and hard to control on some maps (of which there are disappointingly few), and there are only three heroes per faction. Overall, I am disappointed by this game.
<br>
<br>One last thing I forgot was that it was promised there would be no DLC, and then now there&apos;s a 50 dollar Season Pass. Knocking a couple points off for that one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5786456">Expand</a></span>

They consist of skirmishes on 4 maps, with generic game types. For example, one of them consists of you getting kills and gathering tokens the enemies drop; first team to reach 100 wins. They repeat the same game type and map with heroes however. There is no campaign like the old BF games, if you don&apos;t know what i&apos;m talking about pick one up on steam and try it out. No story driven battles, you just join and fight. Generic FPS game, and I know many say the same thing, but really, it&apos;s GENERIC. It&apos;s beyond casual, as anyone can pick it up and just shoot, there&apos;s no recoil and hardly any punishment for playing bad. The game obviously looks beautiful and sounds great, however, it&apos;s not worth the price tag. I will be returning my copy for a full refund, and i&apos;ll also be very disappointed. I was waiting on this game ever since BF 2, as a child. If you want to earn my money and me as a customer, make a full campaign with story driven conquest batles like before. Also, i forgot to mention that maps are literally tiny and disconnected, it&apos;s nothing like the old games. An example would be using battlefield, imagine if battlefield were taken and the maps were cut down by 75% compared to the old ones you played. Do not Buy, last warning. If you don&apos;t believe me, try it yourself, hopefully you enjoy it, however i doubt anyone true will enjoy it..
<br>
<br>0/10 - No I will not give it a 1/10 simply because of the graphics, many games have beautiful graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5787703">Expand</a></span>

<br>On the other hand, being a SW fan I must say that I&apos;d never expend my money on it. The map are totally unbalanced, there&apos;s literally no skill gap, and EA Games will make you swallow down tons of DLC to continue being able to play the game normally.
<br>
<br>Oh, I almost forgot to mention: there&apos;s no campaign! LOL, how can a SW game have no campaign?
<br>
<br>Stay away from this game, it will look amazing in the first hour, but will be forgotten in a few months! Glad I could play it on the 10 hours trial from EA Acess and didn&apos;t buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5783300">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics are nice but thats about it,save your money from buying this and stop rewarding lazy and  ignorant developers and gready corporate suits at EA.
<br>
<br>Total failure in a long line of dumbed down games from DICE.
<br>Thanks for ruining Battlefield 3,Battlefield 4 and now Battlefront for us gamers Dice. I am pretty sure that you wont see another dime from me or in the very distant future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5786465">Expand</a></span>

A short pro con description is listed below but a more lengthy review is listed even further below.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Graphics are stunning
<br>- Art design is great
<br>- Sound effects are great and well mixed (but slightly to bass heavy)
<br>- And the score while partly original it is very well mixed
<br>- Beautiful sky boxes
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Fps mechanics are terrible for many reasons (full list below)
<br>- Map design is liner and bland
<br>- Weapons lack variety and all feel the same
<br>- Ability cards are for the most part useless (out side of one or two)
<br>- No Co-op / multilayer vehicles
<br>- Complete lack of game modes
<br>- Complete lack of maps
<br>- Few vehicles to chose from
<br>- Terrible vehicle controls
<br>- No space battles
<br>- No galactic conquest
<br>- lacking map variety (most maps are completely liner and empty)
<br>- NO SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN FORM A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>- No single player campaign
<br>- No single player campaign
<br>- No single player campaign
<br>- Why no single player campaign???? WHY???????/
<br>
<br>No for the real review. This will mostly be elaborating on the points above. To start with the game looks and sounds stunning but that cannot save the CORE GAME FROM BEING LESS THAN AVERAGE. Unfortunately the game itself is far less than average. There are many reasons for this a few are listed above. To start with the problems of this game the shooting mechanics are THE worst I have played with this year. This is due to all weapons having little to no recoil at all (And I am well aware that the guns shoot lasers not bullets) but even with the guns shooting lasers Fallout 4 and halo 5 manage to make laser weapons very satisfying to shoot and also require skill to shoot. The guns also lack punch and also eliminate impact because of it. This makes it feel like a weak spit ball killed the enemy not a futuristic laser weapon form STAR WARS.
<br>
<br>While on the topic of game mechanics the vehicles feel like sliding an ice cube over a bathroom tile. In short the vehicles feel terrible at best. This is also true for air vehicles. They are tedious to control and just a pain to find some meaningless coin on the map that FORCES you to deploy a vehicle at what possibly could be an inopportune time if you want to use one. That brings me to my next point the &quot;pick up&quot; system in the game makes you run around the map scavenging for one of these god forsaken things only for you to be killed while your deploying one.
<br>
<br>The next considerable problem is campers and Oh boy there are a LOT of them in this game. Not only do campers make the game un-fun but also hurts the player base potentially turning some people of the game completely. Another issue to consider is the games life span (I&apos;m predicting not very long). The game lacks variety and only has a hand full of &quot;fun&quot; modes. This will most likely lead to a considerable portion of the player base drop in less than a month. To be completely frank I think peoples hype will ware off and people will see what a lazy cash in excuse of a AAA game this is. Unfortunately this is just a lazy attempt by DICE (who are also to blame) and EA just a SAME FULL DISPLAY. Spend your money on fallout 4, whitcher 3 or MGS V instead not only do you get a single player you also get a good bloody game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5789038">Expand</a></span>

<br>The amount of maps you get without Jakku is slim. There is only 4. If you play the other modes. You can experience different parts of those planets, which feels like you have more variety. But if you only enjoy one game mode, then you get the same old 4 maps. For 100+ hours.

<br>
<br>The character customization is a cheap tactic. The heads are just copied between rebel and empire. There is only 3 full body armor customization selections for Empire. You get maybe 50 human heads and 3 aliens on Rebels. You get 50 human heads and 3 different stormtroopers on Empire. I would have loved more variants of the Stormtrooper armor. Not just heads used from the Rebel side.
<br>
<br>There is not chat window when you are dead. This is hurts you if you want to share information while dead. A sign that this game was made for console first.
<br>
<br>Flight controls do not work that well with KB &amp; M setup. It really feels like it was built ground up for a controller.
<br>
<br>The worst of it all. The 50$ Season Pass will have 16 maps, while we got 4 in vanilla for 60$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5781672">Expand</a></span>

Trust me you will get bored after 30 minutes of playing it once you realise there is no complexity to this game outside of just pointing and shooting at something. What did you expect from EA and DICE though really? The casualisation of shooters has never hit such a low before. Shame on you EA and shame on you DICE. Your quest for making sure shareholders get paid out over making great games is a huge black eye on the face of the games industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5796772">Expand</a></span>

If you want BF4 with no story mode and only multiplayer only maps then this game might interest you, but to me Star Wars is always about the story.</span>

<br>Stopped at 9 hours because this is game boring as hell and couldn&apos;t stand running just straight line. Now there are campers because of it, these bastards are cheap.  The game is too lacked, limited, and where&apos;s the **** contents?
<br>No mods support and no private server.   And btw, you&apos;ll need to cough off $50 more to get  16 maps.
<br>
<br>Battlefront 2 had 34 maps for $50 and ten times more features you&apos;ll have and good community even mods communities.
<br>
<br>The game is pathetic and not happy with it.  I guess the developer and games are getting too shallow
<br>because they care more about money over the quality of the game.  I&apos;m pissed and this is pure trash.  I tried to think of anything good about the game but damn this game is disappointing.
<br>
<br>Dice need to be fired for being too lazy.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give 2 for graphic but nothing else special.  Too Lazy and Cheap for a High price game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5787927">Expand</a></span>

Consider the fact that EA is milking players with early access garbage and you KNOW it&apos;s a cash grab. This game is rushed to the market right before the next Star Wars movie comes out.
<br>
<br>Star Wars Battlefront sullies the name of another classic game. I wish EA would stop &quot;reviving&quot; classics. Please.</span>

The gunplay and gamemodes are seriously lacking. There isn&apos;t enough variety and it get repetitive very fast. There just isn&apos;t enough meat to the game to keep me interested beyond a few hours of gameplay. And just to think that they are going to charge even more money for extra content that should have been there from the beginning...sickening.

You could work together taking out the AI opponents or you could play against each other and have an intense but fun all out war. You could also play a mode called galactic conquest where the goal is to conquer 10 plus planets that takes over 20 plus battles (some of them into space.) You could unlock abilities for your team, new ships giving you more pieces on the chessboards, or new soldier classes to help give you the advantage over your opponent. Speaking of Character classes, remember you could be a sniper class or a explosives class or even an engineer? There were also countless other game modes to play a lot of them can be played on most of the maps. You could of even played as ewoks, wampas, geonosians, and even gungans. Those were good times...

The native support for 21:9 resolution is appreciated as it looks amazing at 3440x1440. Hero classes are reasonably balanced, as are most game modes besides walker assault.  Not everyone likes the power up or card system but I feel they fit in well with the game.  And the most important thing about the game is that it runs smooth as butter and is very well optimized. Totally stable, no lag or micro-stutter, runs well on even low-spec PCs.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the game has several major issues all relating to simple features missing or control scheme choices.  Also the game is quite lacking in content for the price.  Something that doesn&apos;t bother me but certain does for many other players. As far as gameplay issues go, the most serious issue we have on the PC is the lack of team balance, or team shuffling. Teams are never randomized and there is no way to switch teams manually.  What we&apos;re seeing in nearly every match is a stacked team dominating one side game after game. For example you&apos;ll have 6 players in hero assault for hours on end with no changes on one team, while the opposing team cycles 50+ players through the meat grinder who join and leave.  The number of matches where it&apos;s 10v20 or 2v6 for often the duration of the entire match is far too many.  At the very least teams should auto balance with each match change.  Certainly this can be done while still maintaining parties.  Even if it isn&apos;t a full team balance, something is still better than nothing whilst still maintaining friends/parties on the same side.
<br>
<br>Other major issues include the PC control scheme for flight controls. In beta the controls were great, with direct mouse input to vehicle flight control.  Very precise and a pleasure to fly. However now we&apos;re discovering that the flight controls are a sluggish joystick emulation style control. Basically flying an x-wing feels like driving a car on a sheet of ice. It&apos;s a mess.  A huge mess. Most fighter squadron matches are just chat rooms of players complaining about how the beta test flight controls were better.
<br>
<br>Lastly we&apos;re missing common features like the ability to see players ping, or even a server browser.  There&apos;s not even a way to kick or ban cheaters who blatantly use hack software... instead relying only on the automated mechanism which could take days or weeks to work.  Something i&apos;m sure we&apos;ll sorely miss in due time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5775308">Expand</a></span>

<br>Alas the latest incarnation from DICE/EA failed to hit the mark for me in a number of areas.
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong it looks and sounds stunning and so it should as EA had access to the Lucas Arts archives and for the price point you would expect it to look amazing.
<br>Game play is very repetitive and after 15 hours I don&apos;t see much point in carrying on playing with only emotes and skins to unlock.
<br>They have removed most of the &quot;cool&quot; things from the series like Space Battles, galactic conquest and the clone wars era...Clone wars is a part of star wars even if it was not well received back in the day, would have made more sense to see some of the old Star Wars heroes/villains brought back for this reboot.
<br>I do feel a burnt after spending so much money on this title, I see no value for money and feels like a expensive cash grab.
<br>The game play makes me think of old call of duty with constant grenade spam and one sided fights, no classes so you can&apos;t switch on the fly to the changing battle.
<br>Lack of customization, yeah you can unlock different skins but most all look the same and only result in a head/hair change.
<br>Think the game has a total of 15 weapons to unlock which is just not enough.
<br>The game feels like a slice of burnt toast, it runs like butter and looks great covered in cheese but it tastes awful and only lasts a short while.
<br>Really expected a lot more EA/Dice, Disney need to give the licence to someone else,
<br>Just not good enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5795437">Expand</a></span>

<br>SWTOR space combat on rails handled better than the Battlefront aerial fighters on km or joystick.. etc, etc..

<br>And yet, after these negative comments.. these users go on to give the game a 10/10..

<br>I would have rated a 2/10 for the graphics, true to movie scenery, and audio.  But I must award a 0 since rabid star wars fans have decided to run a muck today.  I have returned my game and received a refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5787548">Expand</a></span>

<br>No bugs so far
<br>Great graphics
<br>SW feeling ( sound/models/vehicles)
<br>No origin !
<br>Nice servers
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Generic FPS with SW theme, nothing more.
<br>COD style, I would like to have Battlefield style.
<br>Spawn campers already knows where to camp.
<br>
<br>Wait for a sale. I&apos;m getting more fun from BF4
<br>
<br>Getting refund with origin&apos;s &quot;great games guarantee&quot; as I did with Titan Fall</span>

<br>
<br>The gamemodes are all the sames, expect Walker Assault and Firefight which are a bit different, all the other are classics
<br>&quot;capture that&quot; or &quot;kill that&quot;. The gameplay become boring very fast, it&apos;s like the level 0 of a skillbased FPS (which is not bad,
<br>but it&apos;s kinda boring...). They cut EVERYTHING from what an old battlefront II fan wanted.
<br>
<br>No vehicles (expect AT/T TB/T)
<br>No Campaign (only stupid survival missions vs waves...)
<br>No Galactic Conquest
<br>No other race than stormtroopers/Rebel.
<br>No space Battle, only over planets.
<br>Some few map (4 big map cut in many pieces)
<br>And let&apos;s not talk about Jedi vs Sith battles which are completely brainless...
<br>The customisation is dumb xD They didn&apos;t event made something great, you have the face of actual IG character (leila/luke/Han) and some hairstyle. Even that is bad and made fast...
<br>
<br>I would PAY MILIONS for a battlefront II Remastered edition, but this game is just crap.
<br>Take out Star Wars and it doesn&apos;t reach 3/10.
<br>
<br>Now I&apos;m sure that after 10 DLC, the game will be good, and most of this lack of content will be fullfieled, but I won&apos;t be part of it.
<br>I have played enough with the EA access (that I bought for this reason, test crappy EA games (expect sports games) and not buy them), and I won&apos;t buy this crap.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY 4/10
<br>GRAPHICS 10/10
<br>SOUND 10/10
<br>CONTENT 2/10
<br>
<br>RESULT 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5779961">Expand</a></span>

<br>

<br>
<br>Amazing graphics

<br>Amazing attention to detail.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s where the pro&apos;s end, this game is nothing more than a showcase for showing off how great the Frostbite engine can run in a Star Wars universe. Dice know exactly what to do when it comes to graphics and sound and usually gameplay as well. However this game lacks a lot of the other ingredients to what could have been an amazing game.
<br>
<br>This brings me on to the con&apos;s:
<br>
<br>Lack of content - this includes maps, game modes/types
<br>Gameplay/mechanics are too simplified/too casual.
<br>No tactics involved, just run of the mill &quot;run and gun&quot; type game, which can get very boring, very fast.
<br>No massive space battles
<br>No single player (the reason why I have put this as a con is because if a game is just multiplayer focused, then you are to expect something worth while to keep the longevity of the game appealing and refreshing. This game is none of the latter. Therefore having a single player campaign might have been able to salvage that)
<br>No 64 players - this seems like a lazy approach to only have 40 players max, so they didn&apos;t have to create larger maps to cater for 64 players and therefore the content is severely lacking.
<br>
<br>This game is a huge disappointment and it seems that people are quite happily to pay full retail price for a half finished game. As soon as you slap a well known franchise label on a game, then &quot;fanboys&quot; will defend it to high heaven and have the inability to comprehend anything constructively criticizing about this game.
<br>
<br>Buy this game, but only when it hits the bargain bin</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5778929">Expand</a></span>

It is another cash-grab from EA of a massive brand which has been executed in shambolic fashion. It feels like nothing more than a Battlefield Hardline reskin and will probably die just as quick.
<br>
<br>Battlefront promised so much but gamers have been left with a content-starved title that consists of a few bland and barren maps, a selection of uninspiring modes and very mediocre combat mechanics. The game looks reasonable at times but the lack of substance and a grand experience especially when compared to Battlefield 4 as of now makes this product feel utterly pointless even for die-hard Star Wars fans. Regular FPS fanatics will feel short-changed at what&apos;s on offer as after just a few hours of play; you&apos;ve seen everything this game has to offer.
<br>
<br>The most unforgivable aspect of Battlefront is the lack of a campaign or Story. This should have been a mandatory inclusion but has ultimately rendered the game a missed opportunity and just inflates the fact that this is nothing more than DICE and EA grabbing cash to satisfy their shareholders before the bumper year-end payoff. As usual; the season pass will provide future content but you will be long bored before then as the game will be soundly removed from your hard drive and never to be touched again.
<br>
<br>Star Wars and FPS fans should avoid at all costs as this is nothing more than a quick cash-in and an opportunity to milk a popular brand without delivering anything that constitutes to a satisfactory experience. The multiplayer is a shallow experience and the product itself falls considerably below standards in terms of quality and material. A huge insult to gamers, fans and the Star Wars brand alike. Pathetic showing from DICE and EA all round.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5778615">Expand</a></span>

It sounds like Star Wars.  But holy **** is it boring, shallow, janky, irritating to play in general, and downright silly when you have &quot;heroes&quot; spamming their abilities against each other.  The beta should have been a good taste of what was to come, because the &quot;full&quot; game has barely any more variety (two new map types - oooh, aaah).
<br>
<br>No campaign.  No co-op.  No space battles.  On-rails vehicles and aircraft.  Sickening!  All features from previous titles in the same series, stripped for this dumbed-down cash-in from this once-great developer.
<br>
<br>What an absolute waste of my money, my hype, and my time.  This game and its execution make me so angry that I&apos;m giving it a zero.  At least pretend you care about gamers next time, DICE/EA/Disney.  You are so far from the mark with this title that it makes my stomach turn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5778474">Expand</a></span>

Your recoil, and spread doesnt even get effected by jumping. REALLY? It gets boring after the first 30 minutes, the content isnt lacking especially for a $110 game. Theyre already talking about multiple sequels when this game isnt even finished, no server browser, only 48 players max, no clone wars, like 9 maps. ARE YOU SERIOUS. This is like a $20-$30 game. Id wait until then before buying and even then its still a bad cash grab.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5775200">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>none. This is epic. This is most importantly FUN ! Yes it may be simple . but its fun ! How much more in depth can star wars become.
<br>
<br>MY biggest gripe will be lack of content - Yes they hid all this behind a paywall Season Pass. =(</span>

<br>This game is meant for the Star Wars fans. All the maps portray perfectly the landscapes, sounds, etc of the Star Wars universe. You just feel like you are there. While the gameplay is indeed shoot and gun (as all the FPS are), you have a sh*t ton of ways to play it. I had played the Beta for 20 hours. I admit I got bored in the end, but thats what happens when you play the same map and same mode for 20h straight.. The full release though has yet to bore me. I have played for about 7 hours straight since midnight and I always had tremendous fun with it. There are some various glitches which I witnessed but they were not enough to stop the fun I was having, sometimes it only boosted it a little! So if you want to have a good time, buy the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5776140">Expand</a></span>

<br>All the maps are filled with stuff Also they are very detailed and true to the original movies.
<br>The feeling when you get while playing this game is almost as if you were in the game-movie-Star Wars
<br>The 3rd person is how its meant to be played AND ITS AWESOME.
<br>The soundtrack
<br>The vehicles
<br>The sounds
<br>True to the previous Battlefront games.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>The one liner voice overs are terrible.
<br>
<br>No its not repetitive. No its not a generic FPS. Its not meant to be played as an FPS. Its just an extra feature. The game is easy to learn, but its not by any mean &quot;soulless&quot; and &quot;casual&quot;.  For the usual metacritic scum who are here just to destroy this game ratings, i have no comment. For the rest Star Wars- Sci Fi fans I say only this : Buy it. It worth&apos;s  it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5789413">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s
<br>Good graphics and performance on most if not every machine, it is very well optimised.
<br>Sounds are great, especially if you use a good quality sound device.
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>*Lack of maps, 4 in total, and in those 4 maps areas are used for game modes, but in the ends its just copy paste.
<br>*Lack of balance, it is shocking at how bad the balance is in maps, I heard Imperials won mostly in beta and now its rebels.
<br>Air vs Air between the two are also very imbalanced, Rebel ships are far superior.
<br>Ground vs Ground looks okay at first, but players who have level&apos;d ahead will have a large advantage over new players. With unlocks and the likes.
<br>*Lack of customization and progression, you can upgrade &apos;cards&apos;(really cards...) and buy emotes and or a different looking head. But gun wise, altering its way of use, no.
<br>*Lack of variety, after doing Walker assault 4 times I already got bored, its small and linear. Because the maps share everything pretty much, you seen it all after your first 4 matches.
<br>*Lack of control options, cant change half of the keybinds I would like to change, options to control mouse sensitivity seems to work on some things and then not ( for example zooming in with a ATST increases senstivity instead of decreasing.. QA failed there.
<br>*Flying is impossible with mouse and keyboard, they broke it after beta from what I can read.
<br>*Lack of any tactic, its just spawn, shoot, die, spawn shoot die. No flanking options, not enough tools for any kind of teamplay.
<br>*To many instant kill ways, there are just far to many oneshot things in the game, it isn&apos;t any fun.
<br>
<br>Now the worst thing of all. Considering they wear the name Battlefront, how could they have removed or ignored all the great things of Battlefront 1 and 2, how is this possible? How can they ignore or the good things about Battlefield, being Dice and all? How could they come up with a CoD in Star Wars, and then done it so poorly.. it baffles me. In every area of gameplay and map design there are issues. But DLC is coming I read often, it doesnt matter I spend 60 euros, because I can pay another 100 and finally have a decent game. Remember, this game offers 1/3 of the content the last Battlefront game offered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5838242">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll go back to Battlefront 2 if I want a decent Star Wars shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5852966">Expand</a></span>

There is no point in going into specifics,  other than graphics and sound this is the worst game I have played in the past 15 years.  I&apos;d say the closest game that is this terrible (and is still better than battlefront) is dead rising 3.  I am awestruck as to hell they screwed this up so bad.  It is like they intentionally went out with the mindset of how can we make the worst game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5861242">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game feels more like Call of Duty: Star Wars than a battlefront game. If you&apos;ve played CoD now imagine all the guns shoot lasers and they added vehicles, you&apos;ll pretty much know what this game entails.
<br>
<br>Spawn points are awful, I&apos;ve lost track of how many times I&apos;ve spawned being shot. Maps are designed to funnel players into awful chokepoints leaving large swaths of maps unexplored. It&apos;s like they wanted us all to take 2 types of grenades and just sling them into tiny corridors all day.
<br>
<br>Looking forward to playing Boba Fett? Not this match as there is no timer on heroes so one person can camp at the back of the map and snipe people with Boba all match long. I&apos;ve seen dozens of games with Boba&apos;s going all game and scoring 50-2 or better.
<br>
<br>If this was a Beta game, I would give it 10/10. And it feels like a Beta. Unbalanced and with little content. The game feels 1/4 finished. And we should expect more. Even CoD launches with more maps than this game and twice the weapons and customizations. But seeing as it&apos;s a &quot;finished&quot; product I give it 1/4 of the score, or a 2.5 rounded down.
<br>
<br>What a joke. EA ruins another game franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5880924">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Star Wars Battlefront is a shooter even more generic than Call of Duty, with a pretty little Star Wars skin layered on top. Its stunning visuals, and somewhat smooth gameplay are degraded by it&apos;s atrocious servers, lack of variation, lack of gameplay features, and complete disregard for balance. It can be fun, at times, but it&apos;s far more commonly frustrating.
<br>
<br>Why Digital Illusions and EA decided to go this path with the game, I can&apos;t really guess. Maybe they just wanted to put in minimal effort, because they knew they&apos;d get a huge return out of it. It&apos;s a reboot of one of the most beloved Star Wars games, after all.
<br>
<br>AND HEY THAT 50$ SEASON PASS RIGHT GUYS? Maybe this game would have felt complete with that included in, with all the extra maps, vehicles, weapons, and gameplay modes they promised, but the Vanilla game is not worth 60 USD. Hell, I got this for 45$, and I still feel ripped off. This is not a complete game. Breaking the game in two and requiring what amounts to what is essentially buying the game again is **** business practice. For the love of god, don&apos;t buy that. You&apos;re only encouraging unfair business practices if you do. I honestly doubt you&apos;ll play it long enough to justify buying that as well.
<br>
<br>As I mentioned before, the game itself looks great, and it plays okay, but the charm wears off quick. You&apos;re paying 60$ for an online shooter, because the single player is absolutely paltry, and it is still sub par. Spawning is awful, balance doesn&apos;t exist, and the game is completely inconsistent. Wait for this game to go on sale if you think you have to have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5811811">Expand</a></span>

<br>So, for a lot of people, the game was a disappointment, and it probably could have been worse, but it isn&apos;t the worst game out there. Now, for those who enjoy the **** out of the game, go ahead, I&apos;m glad you enjoy it, but do realize there is actual flaws with the game that others are irritated with. The biggest complaint I have seen is content, and I absolutely agree with this. The game becomes repetitive after a little while, and makes the game feel empty.
<br>
<br>Graphics/sound- This game is a great example of how graphics aren&apos;t everything. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the animations are perfect, and the sounds are on point, but that is really the biggest pro to the game or seems....which is sad.
<br>
<br>Co-op Survival- So as far as i can see, you can only have 1 other person with you in this mode....like really? Am I only able to have 1 friends now adays? This could have been fun as hell with 3 other friends, but i cant play if more than one is on, because why leave your friends out because of a stupid design choice?
<br>
<br>Maps- Now, I understand there is a decent amount of maps in the game, but I think the real issue is the lack of variety. Id prefer to have ten completely different landscapes then 4 landscapes that are slightly different on ten map. Some people don&apos;t have a problem with this, but when you think of the amazing environments they could have had...its just disappointing.
<br>
<br>Space battles and dogfighting- Now, what really made a Star Wars for me was the huge battles in space. Why Dice and EA decided to leave it out is beyond me. The space battles were alright in BF2, but they had so much to improve on. Flying through space in a huge firefights with explosions everywhere just was an amazing experience, and would have made this game so much better than it is now. Imagine being able to dogfight around capital ships firing lasers and cannons left and right, then landing in the hanger and engaging in huge firefights across the ship as you made your way to vital parts of this huge ship....that would have been an amazing experience. As it seems, the dogfighting is alright in the game, but seems too easy, all you need to do is lock on and hold fire, no huge outmaneuvering and aiming is really involved.
<br>
<br>Clones and Droids- Alright, let me just start out by saying that if you hate the clone wars due to the prequels you need to dig a little deeper. The clone wars was a huge part of star wars and the way it played out was fascinating. Dice had a huge opportunity to use the Clones and Droids in this game...but they just dumped it. For those of you(like me) who enjoyed the Clone Wars better than the Rebels and empire, all I can say is we were pushed aside and thrown into the garbage. If you dug into the lore behind this with all of its heroes and villains and all of its huge full blown battles, I guarantee you&apos;d be impressed at many times. Taking this part out basically rips half of Star Wars out of the game, and I find this disappointing and unacceptable to a certain extent.
<br>
<br>DLC- I mean...really.....50 dollars of DLC planned before the game was even released? And don&apos;t tell me I can play without the DLC, as it almost doubles the content in the game(that should have been in their originally). The fact isn&apos;t that their is DLC, its the fact that it charges an extra 50 dollars(almost the cost of another game) just to make the game what it should have been. If one of my friends buys it, then ill either miss out on so much, or be forced to go throw $50 dollars in EA&apos;s face. Some people out there cant afford a $110 dollar game, and for those who can, congratulation, but not all of us want to spend $110 dollars just to get a completed game. This is a rip off, and I urge you too see this as well, EA didn&apos;t have everyone&apos;s best interest in mind when they created this.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this game is meh, definitely not worth the ten years we had to wait for it, or the $60-$110 dollar price tag, maybe $30-$40 dollars for the base game. People say its a must have for die hard Star Wars fans....but I feel like that is false. For the people who love the franchise and really care about this, they wont spend all this money supporting EA, as we all know if this game makes them loads of cash, they will continue to release games after this with even less content and effort, as they find it acceptable since we shower them in our money. I could have added so much more to this review, but I feel this covers a lot of major topics(And I&apos;m lazy AF)
<br>
<br>Well, I hope you all enjoyed my two cents on this game, feel free to let me know how you feel about this(whether you agree or disagree on any of the point)
<br>And for those who were looking for a Battlefront III, &quot;This isn&apos;t the Battlefront you are looking for&quot;- 100% accurate words from Obi-wan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5812841">Expand</a></span>

I kept trying to enjoy it I wanted to enjoy it hell its star wars but the more I played the less and less I wanted to I felt like I was forcing myself to play, its almost like they where trying to be overly safe because it was Star Wars and made the game soulless and a chore to play. Now another thing to address in Canada I payed after taxes $90.02 for the game and it has four maps they say its 12 but its four maps and small variations of those four maps for $90.02  EA stop being so greedy, why dose the expansion pass have 16 maps for $50 and the base game for $90 have four.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5820454">Expand</a></span>

I am currently rank 13 and i do not plan to continue, played for 9-10 hours and i am already bored of it. As a shooter, it is very silly, you get very limited options and they are tied to a cooldown. Shoot once, wait for reload.... shoot again, wait for reload and so on. Blasters heat up pretty fast so you get into &quot;reload&quot; mode no matter what.  I find this game totaly frustrating to play, if you value games where skill is needed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5860831">Expand</a></span>

Massive battlefields, loads of teammates, 0 coordination. No easy of communicating with your team. It&apos;s a FFA-Team-Deathmatch. X-Wing/Tie Fighters fights are boring as hell.</span>

<br>
<br>The progression system is awful.
<br>The gunplay is garbage. Get shot at long range by pistols. Extremely inaccurate sniper style weapons?
<br>The vehicles... hooo boy.... Rebels have NO GROUND VEHICLES.
<br>The spawn system will frequently spawn you into an area already taken over by the opposing team OR so far back it&apos;s going to take you 45 seconds to a minute just to get back to the action.
<br>There is 0 diversity in kit loadouts. The star cards are garbage and half of them you need to REBUY after the charges deplete. That&apos;s right, not find ammo in game but REBUY from the unlocks.
<br>I didn&apos;t preorder this game but rather got sucked into the hype machine by friends who did and I wish I hadn&apos;t
<br>
<br>It&apos;s quite clear by the 50.00 season pass and the fact that they&apos;re already working on a sequel (WTF!?) that this game is going to be doled out piecemeal along side the next 3 films and EA plans to make bank on gullible Star Wards fans.
<br>
<br>Graphics and Audio 10/10 though. Only positive thing I can say.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5852246">Expand</a></span>

Here are some things that were in Star Wars Battlefront 2, a game that is a decade old, that are not in this game: Space battles, a singleplayer campaign, anything from episodes 1-3, balanced spawns, and an actual chance to use the heroes. And for a price tag of $120 for the &quot;ultimate edition&quot; is disgusting.

Saying that, some of the new music is uninspiring and the voice acting, especially, the &apos;heroes&apos;, is laughable at best.
<br>
<br>Limited and inexcusable content on launch means this game gets old and boring fast. The imbalance on some of the maps is still problematic (Endor Walker Assault for example) .
<br>
<br>Customisation is, well, where to start? If unlocking haircuts and beards is your &apos;Star Wars authentic&apos; thing for your helmetless Stormtrooper, then roll right up. This game will cater for your every need. Whilst doing that, don&apos;t forget to load up  with the FOTM DL-44 blaster,a pulse cannon sniper rifle and a jump pack for hours of endless COD Advanced Warfare goodness.
<br>
<br>Spawning is horrendous in this game - I&apos;ve lost count of the number of times I&apos;ve spawned right in front of an AT-ST or AT-AT or yards from an enemy player . Spawn, BOOM, get down. At least sometimes you get a break from that by having to run from 200 yards back to rejoin the battle.
<br>
<br>THE extra cost of the DLC is quite frankly disgraceful given what&apos;s in the base game. The new free Battle of Jakku DLC map is as forgettable as the rest of them after a couple of hours play. It&apos;s just more of the same, with a ridiculous grenade spamming pistol shooting toe to toe royal rumble at the end for the last control point.
<br>
<br>This game has been touted as the best Star Wars game ever. I disagree. It&apos;s without doubt the best looking one, but that&apos;s about it. My advice is go find something else to play for the meantime, be an informed consumer , read the reviews, watch the video reviews too , and if you must buy it, wait a bit for the price to come down considerably. Good games don&apos;t get this much negative publicity without good reason, so you have to ask yourself why? Put the inner need to satisfy the Star Wars fan in you to one side for a moment, and let your head rule your heart before getting your money out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5853542">Expand</a></span>

While Battlefront gets most of it right, huge fails that break the game keep me from recommending this game. From the looks, sounds, music, even some small stuff like Han Solo&apos;s shoulder charge power (taken from 1 scene in the movies).. this game is impressive beyond impressive. But while that stuff was obviously handled by experts, you get the feeling that the rest of the stuff wasn&apos;t. 1) No real communication ability at all with other players just ruins the game (the in game chat is only during the actual game and is useless as you will be killed if you try to type something, plus it allows curses and racial slurs, really?) 2) Obvious issues. Enemy players can get behind your spawn area, get in a turret, and just kill your team over and over and over with no way to stop it. How was that missed? 3) It is only fun if people play along. Some hide in a bush in a map and kill you when there is no chance to even see them. Is that fun? No. Some hide on top of a mountain behind a peak and step out just to snipe you, Is that fun? No. You get the idea. If everyone just plays the game.. it can be fun. But most times, someone exploits a map problem. Overall, I guess it comes down to that I love everything about this game.. except the fact that it is online. If it was a single player game, it would easily be 10/10 game of the year. Add online with the above problems, and the score falls flat. Sorry, but you can&apos;t have an online game without fixing known online issues (see racial, cursing above, map exploits, etc)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-battlefront/user-reviews?user_review_id=5818494">Expand</a></span>

Since there is only a small multiplayer and no single player; I expect it to become of huge cash grab of season pass and micro transactions for EA.
