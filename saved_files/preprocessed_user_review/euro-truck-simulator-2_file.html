I never felt like writing one before; you either have something good to say or you simply ignore it. Well, this game is surprisingly good. I wish I had spent my money on it before instead of wasting 60 bucks on other over hyped games that fail to deliver. Anyway, I am not a huge truck simulator fan. In fact, this is the second simulator of its kind that I put my hands on, but it&apos;s also a business simulator of sorts, which is pretty cool, fulfilling and HARD to manage. As you slowly accomplish your own set goals, the game feels very rewarding. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous. You can see landmarks that distinguish every other city in Europe. There are LOTS of cities to go to, explore, get jobs, hire personnel, buy trucks and garages. I was shocked the first time I saw the pedestrians walking by. It all feels very alive and beautiful. The star of the game itself is the truck, or rather the plethora of trucks. You have very detailed and extremely customizable trucks to play with. Driving the truck is relatively simple and easy (I recommend a gamepad), and the real challenge comes from maneuvering the truck in tight spaces like real truckers do. It takes a lot of time and practice to get good at it.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2761404">Expand</a></span>

I played every one of them, all made by SCS software and also the Rig n Roll failgame. I waited for this game to come out, I was patient when they postponed the date of release. What can I say - this game is beautiful and made some of my dreams related to truck driving come true, but it lacks in main core of the game. The first and biggest flaw is lack of truck physics - trucks don&apos;t behave like a sports car and here they do. The springs are stiff as hell and it is really hard to fall out of the turn (the trailer doesn&apos;t &quot;drag&quot; You enough). There is absolutely no feeling of &quot;bumps&quot; - even Agrar Simulator 2012 has this so why SCS couldn&apos;t do it? Another huge problem is the map - Netherlands, Poland, Italy - YES, these countries are interesting and well made. But when You play the game You will find Yourself driving for endless hours through Germany which is the main core of the map. And here You find another fail - Germany roads are copy-paste from German Truck Simulator! Adding new graphics didn&apos;t help - these roads are so bad as they were in GTS so they are: 1. Unrealistic, 2. Boring, 3. Boring, 4. Unrealistic! The trailers - most of them copied from GTS, fail again. SCS needed over 2 years for this game - we could at least expect new, realistic models - but no. They&apos;re not here. Economy? This one doesn&apos;t exist. You can earn huge amount of money just driving - there are almost no costs, there are no oponnents, there is no real market and finally the payments You get are 5 times as big as in real world (at least You can mod that). No wonder why there was a payment nerf mod released 2 weeks after game release date. Finally - the biggest fail of all - lack of AI cars and lack of pedestrians (they are only in 3-4 cities but I can live with that). Endless hours of driving and You don&apos;t see any random accidents (SCS Promised that but it&apos;s not here), You don&apos;t see random roadworks (promised - not here, all I can see are the same roadworks everywhere). Finally there is almost no AI cars which could make a traffic jam and a trip harder. 3 lane German road to Berlin and You see 3 cars around. Seriously?!
<br>
<br>The goods: 1. Truck modification options
<br>2. Nice graphics (although AA is terribly ugly and the MSAA filter SCS have used should land in a trash)
<br>3. Interesting sounds in part of trucks
<br>4. Nice countries (except Germany and Austria)
<br>5. Well made truck models 6. Lots of mods which make game better but not as good as it should be. Final grade - 6/10 for 2012 quite big budget for the simulator game. Comparing to products released before - 9/10. So let&apos;s say final decision is strong 7 - but a lot to fix. And finally the biggest fail of all - economy and lack of</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731379">Expand</a></span>

Logitech DFGT wheel works fine in this game.. 150.00 usa new about 50-75.00 used on ebay usa..I assume equal value or less in uk.. Euro truck also allows you to combine controls.. I use my Saitek rudder pedals (saves room under desk with just one set for both sim types) as brake and gas while using the DFGT to drive.. stick shift works fine for forward reverse and no clutch really needed as the trans is synced as in real life.. Truck drivers use a clutch rarely while shifting thru the gears.. mainly at lights and to go into reverse.. oh and TrackIR is something else to look into.. works fine here as well..the game is also very moddable.. The onscreen navigator/GPS will have you owning the roads in no time.
<br>
<br>The graphics pull you into this one.. it looks very nice. I drove a lot of USA Volvo trucks in my day and the interior although different than USA im sure..does have that layout and feel.. the mirror system works great as does the synced transmissions.. I found myself down shifting and using the mirrors like real life within minutes..backing to hook and unhook with total mirror control.. was very close to the real deal.. trust me.. I know..
<br>
<br>Besides the work for hire mode, you can also start your own company while hiring other drivers to work for you. Although there is much variety and views&#x2026; at some point the countryside may seem like the same old thing after a bit.. but to tell the truth.. once you hook and get down the road.. they all look like the same old thing more times than not&#x2026; so acceptable for this type sim, if not demanded&#x2026;Time is not Real life timed and again trust me.. you will appreciate that. There is a fatigue and miles capable of driving per your experience level.  This is a very good thing.. a log book would be another nice feature.. maybe I missed it.. but by law is required at least on this side of the pond. Which keeps up with hours driven and locations. You can legally drive for only so long.. and sleep is another law. Don&#x2019;t complain about the AI traffic jams because again.. traffic happens.. and more times than not. it&#x2019;s pretty close to life&#x2026; and much better than I would have ever expected.. the rain on the windshields works great as does night driving..
<br>
<br>They have a nice Music system allowing for your personal mp3&#x2032;s etc set into a folder for game play along with &#x201C;steaming&#x201D; internet music. Although I would like to see a CB simulator added along with maybe a LTL delivery system put into play as well as multiplayer added just for road fun..
<br>
<br>Additional thoughts would be to add some deer and animal jump outs across the roads.. and tire recaps on roads (alligators) as it happens and some of the more accidental problems of road drivers..  A walk around at rest areas so the driver can inspect his unit and kick the tires.. also happens.. on a two hour schedule if you&#x2019;re a smart driver.. for what you get&#x2026; its very well done and worth the buy in..[GS] 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3279378">Expand</a></span>

I thought i&apos;d just try the demo and they give you enough of a demo to want more.

<br>
<br>There is obviously a business element to the game which works quite well,I felt the game could have had a bit more &quot;action&quot; on the road though. The Ai is a little dumb and on rails, I would have liked to have seen fire engines racing past or cops cars on a chase here and there  or your brakes failing because you havn&apos;t taken the time to service your rig  resulting in you becoming a runaway truck  stuff like that. It can get a little mediocre.
<br>
<br>But overall its a good little game, try the demo at least, you&apos;ll get a nice feel for the game and i bet most of you will want more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272519">Expand</a></span>

I wish you leveled up slower, and a few more options for trucks and accessories but this game is a solid 9/10 add some mods to make things more realestic and it&apos;s a 10/10</span>

<br>The Good:
<br>
<br>It is not just a driving simulator, it is also a business simulator, a resource manager, and a game of exploration.
<br>
<br>For those reviewers who mention a lack of views from inside the cab, look into buying a TrackIR, building a Freetrack system or installing FaceTrackNoIR (free) for headtracking. Head tracking is fully supported by ETS2. It allows you to look around the cab just as if you were sitting there.
<br>
<br>Others have commented that the trailers have no weight.....try stopping a 45 ton load when that blankety blank blank AI pulls out in front of you. Pull that trailer up a steep grade and then say the trailer has no weight. True, with a huge 750HP 3200KW motor it is easier to do so but with a stock 360 HP? I have found myself looking for alternate routes because the load is too heavy for the grade that I am attempting to pull them up, or I go up in 1st  gear. Heavy loads means using the entire range of gears, not starting out in 4th gear or 5th gear like I would running bobtail (no trailer).
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>I do have to agree that there seems to be no reason to upgrade your chassis from a 2-4 to anything else as you can indeed pull any load with the 2-4. I would like to see that changed in future patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3641842">Expand</a></span>

In my first two days of this game, I achieved 14 hours in it. It is very silly that a truck game could be so good, but honestly? This game is addicting as HECK. I really do recommend it.</span>

<br>
<br>Nutcase driving delinquents could do with a few hours hauling 18 tonnes of diesel between cities to see what it feels like to have cars passing them dangerously close or even dealing with the idiots trying to kill them!
<br>
<br>Perhaps traffic management  and road designers should do a minimum of 50 hours &quot;community service&quot; on ETS2 to learn that 30 foot trailers do not go well around 90 degree corners covered in guard rails and street lights.
<br>
<br>It took 585 hours to decide that ETS2 only falls short in the commerce and driver management department  the rest is pure eye candy and amazingly addictive gameplay.
<br>
<br>There are indeed some AI issues, occasional GFX stutters and a lack of depth in the commerce and truck  and driver management but as a driving simulator it rates an easy 10. I understand that the talented but small team at SCS are working on the management aspect and tweaking the AI. If they can pull that off, it&apos;s a game with a lifespan of many, many months  possibly years.
<br>
<br>If you simply want to smash stuff and look at pieces of trucks and cars or even blood flowing across the road, this is not for you.
<br>
<br>Straightforward, easy to learn but no two trips will ever the same. SCS is on a long term winner if they get that management longevity and perhaps  just perhaps, even MP  or at the very least  co-op</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3083838">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it is about trucks, but i believe it sets a standard for future &quot;driving games&quot; (not to be confused with racing simulators).
<br>Proper force feedback wheel support, a good dose of realism, a massive explorable map with beautiful landscapes, high detail vehicle models with equally impressive interiors, EPIC engine/turbo sounds that make you feel you&apos;re driving a real truck, attention to detail from the developers, etc. All that in ONE game. Another popular driving game, Test Drive Unlimited lacked in many aspects compared to ETS2 and it probably had a 10 times bigger budget, so i consider this to be a high quality piece of software, not your average  Simulator 20xx&quot;.
<br>I give it a 9/10 because unfortunately there is no multiplayer mode (that would&apos;ve been so epic).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3191108">Expand</a></span>

The game isn&apos;t complicated in the slightest which enables you to pick up and play straight away without worrying about minor attention to detail that in other simulators you may have to adhere to. This game provides a realistic experience but retains the fun which is a major factor for its success.
<br>
<br>The presentation is simple but slick with a well organised menu and beauitiful visuals. The trucks look fantastic as do the other vehicles and weather effects. The world map covers Great Britain and a large part of Europe on a watered-down scale which is a truly excellent accomplishment considering how big this game is regardless of being scaled down. You can go from Edinburgh to Warsaw in under an hour but this helps keep the gamer interested and allows you to complete several jobs in a single session.
<br>
<br>The career mode sees you starting off a truck business from scratch where you are presented with a rundown shack as a base. You need to raise money to buy your own truck to further your bank balance or you can just grab a loan to kickstart your venture off with that extra bit of captial. You can improve your base, customise and improve your truck, buy new vehicles from numerous real-life manufacturers and hire staff to enhance your growing company. You can rank XP to unlock extra items from new engines to even extra mirrors and minor truck accessories. You also have a skill tree to unlock more lucrative jobs and longer distance trips.
<br>
<br>The driving side is absolutely fantastic from manual to auto controls, filling up petrol, taking a rest, speeding fines and crashes. Everything is there that you&apos;d expect. You can even be penalised for a late delivery. All these factors add to the challenge and ensures that you don&apos;t take crafty shortcuts in trying to complete your job. The sleeping and fuelling element also adds some tactical spice to the game so you have to plan some jouneys beforehand else you may have an accident or breakdown which can lead to penalties such as fines or unnecessary expenditure.
<br>
<br>Overall this game is a perfectly balanced sim that isn&apos;t overly serious but is executed superbly so it appeals to all gamers who enjoy driving experiences. The excellent presentation and learning curve makes this instantly playable with a well-designed career mode and brilliant driving physics. Definitely the best simlator out there and highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833489">Expand</a></span>

I think that the only thing that is lacking within this game is physical truck damage when the truck take damage other than that this is one of the most well crafted simulation games made. I would love to see an American version of the game, but I found the details in the European version very accurate. I was surprised of the lack of any police in the game, however in Europe the is not a heavy presence either as most traffic violation are captured by cameras. I was glad of the GPS in the game as this was a very much needed when I lived there since highway markings directed you to large cities so you needed to know where to go. Overall this game is a must have if you enjoy driving games or a good simulation game. The company management in the game is good and I really like the leveling aspect of the driver as this is also realistic to gain prestige with companies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106387">Expand</a></span>

Now i have a family with 5 sons that also play this game, i hope when they grown up they can become a driver like papa here. Thank you developers for changing my life!</span>

                                        <span>Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the games i always keep returning to. I basically like it but the gameplay soon gets a bit boring due to it&apos;s simplicity. It&apos;s more about cruising thru Europe with a truck than anything else. So if you like that, then it&apos;s your game. For a 10/10 it would need more gameplay complexity and better motivating balance in higher levels.</span>

This game is worth the money and i am prepared to spend money on the add ons that keep getting released.

I was cruising outside Paris one day and tuned into a station in England when the DJ started talking about how his program had become a hit among the Euro truck sim players and it made me laugh. The game handles well and the steering wheel calibration was very nice (the game already had my old wheel set up for me) even if you don&apos;t have the latest logitech wheel. Only downside would be that as an American, who is used to the stone-age measuring systems that we use, getting used to speed limits, distances, and traffic signs take a few minutes but are easy none the less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3017277">Expand</a></span>

Found the driving to be enjoyable and although it isn&apos;t the most realistic in terms of physics and handling it is pretty decent, one thing that does stand out however is the fact that in this game you have to drive rather than race - obeying road traffic rules, signalling, etc, which makes for a pleasant change of pace. The sim side of the game also turned out to be more detailed than expected and I am having fun running my own truck business with 2 other drivers working for me. The graphics are good and the sound is adequate - my only gripe is that inside the cab there isn&apos;t much engine noise to hear, maybe SCS could add an option to roll the window down or I have missed it somewhere? Overall I am enjoying this game a lot and cant wait to see what new features are in the games future and where the series goes next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732429">Expand</a></span>

I remember the plain and edgy games from the past ... their new baby is everything but that. Of course there is plenty room for development but with limited resources, it&apos;s just huge what they accomplished. Remember, it&apos;s not Ubisoft, Sony, Capcom, etc. They&apos;re just making something that a lot of us need, and they are making it good.
<br>I was waiting for its release for a long long time, and I&apos;m glad it&apos;s finally here. Also I appreciate that it&apos;s in constant development. The ability to customize the trucks is an enormous plus in the game, also the live streaming via the radio.
<br>Some say, that it&apos;s a boring game. I tend to disagree. I was expecting to drive long roads, among cars that drive by you. It&apos;s not a race game, it&apos;s not a derby game it&apos;s a truck simulator, and you receive just what you are promised, a truck driving simulator with huge potentials. Be loyal to the game and be patient. This game is on the road of becoming BIG, hopefully with a lot more publicity!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2733373">Expand</a></span>

Imagine listening to your favorite music while driving big rigs across thousands of kilometers of western and central Europe, all the while managing your own trucking network of more than one hundred other drivers!  All of which is possible in Euro Truck Simulator 2 by SCS Software.  This simulator starts you off as what I guess would be called a &quot;driver for hire&quot;.  You own the clothes on your back and a passport willing to drive quick hauls for anyone that would have you.  You drive more routes to gain cash and experience.
<br>
<br>The cash can be saved for your first truck, truck upgrades, and later used to upgrade your garage to house more trucks and employees.   There are several truck manufacturers offering one truck model each, but with deep customization options.  There is very little different between the performance of these trucks, however, there are multiple mods that address this issue.
<br>
<br>Experience is your basic leveling system, at certain thresholds you &quot;level up&quot; and can put that one experience point into several different areas of expertise.  For instance, you can specialize in long hauling covering massive distances, fragile cargo, high value cargo, or get certified to transport dangerous materials.
<br>
<br>Driving the trucks can be a chore without a game pad or steering wheel.  But when everything is clicking, who knew that driving steadily across varied landscapes could be so much fun.  It&apos;s not a game that will keep you at the edge of your seat, rather, you&apos;ll be relaxed taking in the scenes and slowly but surely building a very profitable trucking business.
<br>
<br>Very happy to have picked up this game, although the full retail price feels steep.  I&apos;d recommend shopping for a deal for this title to get the most bang for the buck.  All in all, you can feel good about getting 30 hours of gameplay from this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2879254">Expand</a></span>

Though I had tried ETS1 back when it originally came out it didn&apos;t grip me or work well with my Logitech DFP wheel.  I&apos;m more of a fast paced Motorsports Sim driver racing Sims like GTR2 and rFactor etc!! When I saw the guys at SCS were making a 2nd ETS title I watched with interest and planned to give it a go and see if they had improved on the original games failings. In real life I have experience in Driving Trucks (Not 40 tonne artics though) and I love working behind a wheel, so part of me couldn&apos;t resist downloading ETS2 on the day of release. Now the only day I haven&apos;t sat down at my computer for at least 2 hours to play ETS2 since that moment was my Sons Birthday (trust me I wanted to play it) it is that addictive!! I haven&apos;t even played a race sim since either and I&apos;ve been playing those for nearly 20years!! My Son who is now 8 has a copy on his computer and even my 10 year daughter was playing it for over 90 minutes the other day!! Yes the game isn&apos;t perfect, but it does have a lot going for it.
<br>
<br>First of all the controller support is far better. My Logitech DFP wheel and G25 pedals are perfect straight from the games setup and I have all my needed controls like wipers, lights etc exactly where I want to have them! I&apos;ve also tried it with the keyboard which was surprisingly good too and the SCS team obviously spent a lot of time getting this area right. The only problem we had was trying a control pad as my son and I found that far too sensitive to steer accurately enough, but he does have a wheel of his own to use, so it&apos;s not a big issue.
<br>
<br>Graphically the game is very nice and runs smoothly on my system (I5 2500K, 8gig ram, ATi Radeon 4870 512mb) at max settings in 1680x1050 and works well even during night driving in the rain. I&apos;ve not noticed any real issues with the game myself in that department. It also has some lovely touches. The first time I had to drive through roadworks and saw the little fella in his yellow high-vis gear working away with a pneumatic drill I was genuinely surprised at how many little features SCS have lovingly added to their Sim. And they are not all the same either, some have surface rollers, cranes, diggers or the whole road fully excavated!! Cyclist riding on cycle paths, trains, planes and even birds in the sky!!
<br>
<br>Sounds are good to, though in the cab it&apos;s a little too quiet, but the modding community have already adjusted that. The ability to load your own MP3&apos;s or play real streamed radio whilst driving along is fantastic and really adds to the immersion.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is just so enjoyable. You start with a run down depot in your chosen city and you have to log onto a job finder to pick up work driving other companies in their trucks to earn a salary. Once you have some successful runs under your belt, you can purchase your own Truck. You have a bank who will offer you business loans and you will get emails from companies and truck dealers to help you on your way. The map though obviously can&apos;t cover real distances as this would need years (probably decades) to make it does have a genuine feel of realism. Each country you visit has it&apos;s own look and feel. Each City is different though some roads and junctions etc do basically look similar it doesn&apos;t take away the feeling of being at a new place. As you travel the map you discover each place by driving through them. You&apos;ll see on your GPS roads you haven&apos;t driven on and will have question marks over places of interest that you need to drive past to get access to. These are normally Truck Dealers and properties you may be interested in purchasing for your expanding company. You&apos;ll have petrol stations with parking when you need a rest break etc as well as hotels. There are also ferry crossings and the Euro Tunnel train!!
<br>
<br>Career part of the game is where you can get so much pleasure playing. Building your company up from a single Truck to having several trucks and drivers who you hire through employment agencies is really great and makes you work hard to earn more money to continue expanding. You can have multiple depots with many trucks and drivers all under your watchful eye. Hire, fire, train them how you want. Modify the trucks to your liking from the body, paintjob, lights, accessories, axles and their engines. They all have an effect on how profitable your company is!! You can oversee everything your company is doing in game. See each driver or trucks daily profits, keep the Trucks maintained etc. Ok some people who like management games will pick holes at how certain areas lack detail, but this isn&apos;t a management game, it&apos;s a driving Sim with a nice bit of management thrown in!!
<br>
<br>I could go on forever, but all I can say is, I&apos;m a Sim racer who has never had any interest in management games, but I&apos;ve not been able to put this game down and I look forward to playing the next day and continue building my virtual transport company up.
<br>
<br>Well done SCS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2740619">Expand</a></span>

Then I installed the game and was rewarded to find that the game fully sports my Logitech G27 steering wheel, shifter and all pedals, Oh and what&apos;s this ? Range and Splitter ? What like on a real truck ? 12 gears to deal with. This is all getting very interesting now.
<br>I finished setting the game up to suit my system then stepped into the virtual cab of the truck. It feels like this will be my new home for a little while. I&apos;m hauling a load of something to some place and I need to get it there on time and safely.
<br>SCS Software has really hit the nail on the head with ETS2. They&apos;ve created a very pretty looking graphics engine that is convincing enough in conjunction with the sound and physics that I feel like I&apos;m driving something that weighs  20 - 30 tons. The game aims to be realistic in many ways but is also balanced out for practicality reasons as well. For instance the passage of time is much faster and real time travel distances are much shorter then real life. You might cover 1km every 200m or so relative to the real world. That might not sound realistic but we must be realistic about what people want out of a game. I doubt anybody is going to want to sit at a computer for 18 hours to travel 1300km.
<br>
<br>Look out for bad drivers, bad weather and beware the night and inattention and be extra careful and read the road up ahead, you don&apos;t want to roll your rig. Who wants to explain to their employer why they rolled the truck on a country bend.
<br>
<br>All in all I&apos;ve found ETS2 to be a immersive experience and surprisingly fun as well as being quite relaxing. It&apos;s very enjoyable to play some music and drive across the countryside.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2733274">Expand</a></span>

Excellent graphics, a large map and accurately modeled trucks all help to put this very niche genre on the map. That said, there&apos;s still a long way to go in terms of making the series live up to its true potential. The map could use more varied sceneries and objects, the economic model could be greatly enhanced to reflect supply and demand, and a damage model is desperately needed (or, at least, a better implementation of ongoing wear and tear than simply having your truck shut down periodically). If you&apos;re looking for a somewhat relaxing alternative to the much more popular run &apos;n gun games out there, I&apos;d definitely recommend ETS2. There&apos;s nothing quite like hitting the open road and slowly building your trucking empire one kilometer (or mile) at a time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2765154">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a great time waster!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2911049">Expand</a></span>

<br>ETS 2 has superb  graphics and insane realism  kind of like the  Arma  of the driving game genre. The AI of the other vehicles is clever  and responsive  The vast array of controls for keyboard  wheel or even controller makes the game a fun experience   without confusing the setup  It is quick to load up and you can continue where you left off  as a trip from the tip of Scotland to the bottom of Italy will keep you intrigued until its time for you to turn off for the night  either in game or in real life!   The ability to take out an in-game loan from the bank at any point makes it easy and non stressful to have a comfortable sum whilst you repay the money back daily  not to mention the jobs that already have equipment provided  even a truck  )
<br>Overall  this was certainly worth the money  and has plenty of replay ability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3095709">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have owned this game since release and i am still playing it to this day there are good mods out there and game play can be extremely fun.
<br>
<br>The surroundings contain a high level of detail but is still low end PC friendly i am extremely glad to see this game arrive on steam just activated mine today This game delivers everything it promises plus more but it does require high level of patients at times as AI traffic can be annoying at times and truck physics could use adjusting but some people are coming out with physics mods They do updates which is good there are mods but always test careful because not all mods are perfect plus mods are made by normal people so modded version may lack SCS support
<br>
<br>Overall its excellent game i have had over 3 months game play so i have scored it a 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2903625">Expand</a></span>

I have absolutely no interest in European trucking and I think it&apos;s important to point that out. Many people vote these games high out of bias towards their personal interests, that is not the case here. ETS 2 is straight-up a very well designed game. --PROS-- The map size is quite big. I reckon it would take 2 hours or so to drive from one extreme to another. The cabins and trucks are designed with variety, even turn signals sound different in each truck. The physics are not perfect but are quite realistic. It&apos;s quite difficult to go on a long trip without doing anything wrong the whole time, making it a rewarding experience when you do. The way the economy works and your career progresses is as well well done, allowing you to work for companies or start your own. The world feels open and alive as opposed to just a blank canvas to drive on. There are car dealerships, recruitment agencies, gas stations, rest stations, service depots and more. You can discover and access all of these on your own, giving the game a true open-world feel. The functionality of the trucks is also full-fledged, allowing you to adjust each individual mirror, access hazard signals, and there&apos;s even a function to flash your lights specifically as a means of saying &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;go ahead&quot; to the other drivers. --CONS-- The physics seem to have been toned down just a bit for ease of use. I imagine true pros will find this a bit unnerving. The audio inside the cabin is glitched out, ends up sounding like the cabin is basically sound proofed. The AI drivers can be frustrating. There&apos;s a few glitchy things about them, for example they often slam on the brakes and stop when lanes merge 200m ahead despite having room to merge. In terms of immersion there&apos;s two things to note: One is that there is no way to get from town to town yourself if you don&apos;t own a truck and the open world aspect is removed when taking jobs. In essence you&apos;ll arrive in a city to finish a job, open the menu to take a new job in a different city, and magically arrive there. We should have to drive there first. Or take a bus with the option to sit and view the journey. Secondly your sleep resets when you finish a job. This ties into the whole teleporting to your new job... they&apos;ve removed the aspect of continuity, which sacrifices immersion gravely as a result. Overall the CONS are more pet peeves and don&apos;t do enough damage to affect the game in any appreciable manner. I wish I could expand on technical details however my ignorance towards trucking prevents me from doing so.

<br>The only thing lacking is an &quot;official&quot; community forum on the Euro Truck Simulator 2 website, instead they use a series of blogs and comments which truth be told sucks as a way to communicate interactively with your customers.

It has big potential to make big game but it need some work. Work with optimization, adding more countries and diversities, multiplayer and so on... My hope is also to get on steam.
<br>
<br>But its really fun game.  And i recommend to every people to try free demo from their page.</span>

Un camino de declive, donde la importancia grafica es absoluta. Analizanco este juego  es un arcade no un simulador. No tiene f&#xED;sicas  ni tampoco IA   con lo que  en diversas ocasiones  te comer&#xE1;s a un coche que se ha quedado parado en medio de la carretra ,justo en direcci&#xF3;n contraria, o los adelantamientos bruscos sin previo aviso. No importa nada lo que pongas a cada cami&#xF3;n  ya que realmente no afectar&#xE1; en nada al mismo  Apenas puedes realizar fucniones y no se penaliza de forma realista los accidentes ni los golpes. Cuenta con la licencia de tan s&#xF3;lo 3 marcas  el resto no son originales  por lo tanto  no comprendo porque se dice que tiene licencias si es falso. No importa en absoluto la carga que lleves en el cami&#xF3;n  ya que  al conducir  siempre tendr&#xE1; el mismo comportamiento. Gr&#xE1;ficamente es muy bueno  pero dejan que desear los pa&#xED;ses, que de ellos tan s&#xF3;lo tienen el nombre  porque conducir en Polonia  es igual que hacerlo en Italia o Francia, ya que lo escenarios son exactamente lo mismo un Copy/Paste. El sonido tambi&#xE9;n es el mismo para todos los camiones y la conducci&#xF3;n es puramente arcade. La duraci&#xF3;n es m&#xE1;s que correcta  ya que  para lograr tener una buena flota  deber&#xE1;s muchas horas para lograrlo. Otro punto interesante  es el subir de nivel al obtener una determinada cantidad de experiencia al terminar cada misi&#xF3;n o al recorrer una cantidad de distancia determinada. Si este juego se llamar&#xE1; de otra forma y lo anunciaran de forma diferente  no estar&#xED;a mal  Pero es que esto no es un simulador  ni tiene licencias  ni es realista y esta cargado de bugs. Creo que tras jugar casi 100 horas  me queda un agradable sensaci&#xF3;n, ya que  a pesar de todos sus fallos( en en muchos casos no son fallos en s&#xED;  el recuerdo que me queda de haber surcado miles de kil&#xF3;metros de carretera  es tan real  que recomiendo este juego, a todo el que busque nuevas sensaciones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2945502">Expand</a></span>

The customization is only aesthetic, you don&apos;t need the big cab to get the big engine, 6x2 and 6x4 axles configuration have no advantage over the 4x2 configuration because you can load ANY cargo with any number of axles and any engine for the simple reason that the cargoes have no weight. The night lights are pathetic, you cant see the flares of the cars above 30 meters of you. No damage indication, you can ham a hundred cars and your truck paint wont show any signal of scratch or dirt. The AI is horrible, dumb and stupid and all the 3D models and textures are ugly, but the game runs lick a brick with stuttering and micro freezes in a rig that manages Crysis 2 and Anno 2070 in his &quot;Ultra&quot; settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805271">Expand</a></span>

A trucking simulator could be an important application for the PC, but two flaws stand in its way of achieving any form of usability.
<br>The first critical flaw is simulated head-turning. When navigating actual traffic you need to look around. ETS2 does not have a working solution for doing this, instead offering the possibility to slowly and inaccurately turn your pow around. As a result you won&apos;t be able to achieve proper speed of decision-making.
<br>The second flaw is the &quot;realistic&quot; turning wheel, which does not translate well into PC-controllers. This makes controlling the truck actually quite a bit harder than in real life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3606225">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s fun to get a truck, improve it, buy a new one, start your own company, evolve it, travel, a relaxing game indeed, but that&apos;s it, nothing else.
<br>The first problem I have is with the map, its like a repetition of a repetition, all streets look equal, all the background scenarios look pretty much the same, but at least near cities you can see iconic buildings in the background image. When you arrive to cities, all you have is like two extremely small city blocks, feels really lacking.
<br>Traffic is horrible, absolutely unrealistic, traffic AI is not better than any mid 90&apos;s game, everyone drives at the same speed, no one breaks the law, no one passes a yellow light, there&apos;s no overtaking&apos;s, just absolutely boring and repetitive.
<br>
<br>For a game that has &apos;Simulator&apos; in its name, this is a pretty bad simulation, driving the truck feels nice, but that&apos;s it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3846797">Expand</a></span>

It is an OK game but I have to remove a few points as it is NOT a truck simulator at all. The graphics are quite good and you can manage your own garages and employees, which are great things into the game. This game is very addictive and it is a good thing because you spend a lot of good time trying to upgrade your trucks and your skills. However, there are a few things that makes it lose so many points. Every simulators start with the principle that you start without any experience and you learn how to pilot or drive your vehicule so you become better and better each time you practice. Euro Truck simulator 2 is nothing of that. You will start being the best driver on the planet and soon enough, the traffic commits so many infractions that you are getting 10 tickets and 20 vehicule collision per run, which is quite irrealistic considering the fact that most of the real truck drivers never get an accident of their life. Also, the ticket system is quite weird and stupid at a certain point. For exemple, if you have a collision with another car because the other driver stopped in the middle of the highway after overtaking you and getting back on your lane, you are the one who reveive a 400 Euro ticket for hitting him. Basically, the game is good until you arrive at level 20 and people around you starts driving like headless chickens.
<br>
<br>So basically, it&apos;s a good game. However, it is NOT a simulator. It is ONLY a good game which will give you many hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3974826">Expand</a></span>

Graphics perfect, we seem to be actually driving a truck. The map is huge, with Europe scenario played very well. Deliveries of the game makes you have plenty of time to achieve a goal, but the gameplay that does not get seasick. The SCS software constantly updates the game and facilitates improvements with the installation of MODS. The menu is very easy and interactive. Missed only buses on the roads and more people on the streets, to give more reality to the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732505">Expand</a></span>

Tutorial is simple and you will learn the basics easily. World is huge, so discovering every detail what is hidden there will take time. Every land has common stereotypical roads. Germany freeways after freeways. Alps offers challenge to drive your truck and trailer through serpentine roads.
<br>
<br>A bit disappointment was when I noticed that hired drivers works almost automatically without any coaching. And I haven&apos;t discovered that I could do contracts with companys like It was used to be in earlier scs softw games.

<br>Playing the game, enjoying and waiting updates and DLCs to kick in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732942">Expand</a></span>

<br>The trucks are very detailed, I like the little touches of using indicators and the use of headlights plus the radio :D The environment is realistic, particularly the thunderstorms and of course you&apos;ll want to turn on your windscreen wipers! I also like taking the truck onto the ferry, across the channel then remembering to drive on the correct side of the road when coming off it!
<br>Like some others It would be nice if the truck sounds were a little louder in the cab. Perhaps the AI vehicles could move more fluidly too, they seem to make handbrake turns around corners!
<br>Overall though its a great game to relax too and makes a pleasant change from guns &amp; explosions :) I recommend it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2755749">Expand</a></span>

I like truck tunning ,company building .. also day and night thing. I can not forget variety of online radios you can listen to and also how easy mods are instlled . You just save them in folder. Its really great game if you are fun of simulators or trucks ,but also if you are not , you should try demo ,because this game is very relaxing ,so special among other games and something differents from rpgs or shooting games..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2906277">Expand</a></span>

The game is a charm to run from A to Z Graphics all on Ultra are very good, beautiful landscape from all over Europe, and the skill progression is simply perfect to go get all that you need to become a pro trucker! Now add some web based radio stations, or your own music via the game itself, and its a big plus, full customization of the trucks is also very impressive with working beacon lights, or alternative ones, horns and mirrors etc. Last but not least, is the ability given for you to have the possibility not only to drive for other companies, but also to buy your own garages, buy your own trucks, hire drivers, and start your own business!
<br>
<br>To conclude, i the only reason why i didn&apos;t went for the big 10, and for a 9 instead, is the immersion factor. I would love to see a lot more different kind of weather regarding the system, just rain isn&apos;t enough, we need snow, gusts of winds, icy roads etc, and also more realism with the sound effects of certain upgradable horns, different upgradable motor sounds etc. And that is my only complain.
<br>But i&apos;m sure SCS will work on it :)
<br>
<br>All and all 9/10 for the best Truck driver game to date!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/euro-truck-simulator-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2930031">Expand</a></span>
