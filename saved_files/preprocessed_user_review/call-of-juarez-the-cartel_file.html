Whilst you can play 3 different characters there are essentially 2 very unsatisfying endings, a bad and an even worse one which I won&apos;t spoil. Most of the time you will gun down generic cartel thugs which look all the same and act the same. The AI in the game is ridiculously stupid and your partners can&apos;t keep up speed with you. Worst about it, sometimes they will spawn right in front of you, this happened to at least once in every single mission. There is no real free-roam, this shooter plays like on rails and is completely linear, the HUD and GUI look terribly pixelated. Whilst Techland can make godlike games as Dead Island, they completely messed up this one. Save your money and get something else. Zero stars to equal out the anonymous votes of users who left no review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-the-cartel/user-reviews?user_review_id=1752748">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s on-rails, has gray pixellated dots for you to follow (as if you can get lost in the first place, it is completely linear). Stereotypical, boring characters. Just stay away... what a waste of a great franchise.</span>

The frustrating is the simple things like picking up your fallen team mates animates you from cover into the line of fire, putting you on the same dirt your friend was just on. As for the fundamentally flawed. Well a game where you have to search around looking for items but on rails so narrow the game resets if you explore too far.... a child could explain the problem with that. That all said, it looks pretty cool. Driving is fun. It all works [had to grenade my team mates a couple of times to reset a stuck room entry] and functionally is almost up to a Valve game. But things like constant in game phone calls, texts and slow cross hair switching, the depth of field focusing far too slowly and usually onto something invisible right in front of you. Oooh it&apos;s so infuriating, there&apos;s a good game here. Under the stupid.

I&apos;ve been playing almost all first person shooters since Quake 1 (1996) and this is just another one with a great atmosphere. South of U.S. and Mexico in a hot sun and a lot of criminals.</span>

See, those of us who view games as having the potential to be just as artistic a medium as movie or books have gotten a bit lazy when dealing with Jack Thompson-like characters: It&apos;s always kneejerk reactions about freedom of speech combined with Whack-A-Mole-esque dismissals of insane, completely fabricated claims like we saw with Mass Effect. Anything else, such as acknowledging shortcomings in a game, start to feel like a show of weakness. This does not push the medium forward. Well thankfully we can put those days behind us (As well as laugh at the true blindness of Game-haters who have overlooked this piece of garbage), because fellow gamers here is a game that is genuinely racist, sexist, and de-humanizing, worthy of all the Fox News reports we have seen dragging comparatively responsible games through the muck.<br><br>Most other games that deal with excessive violence fall into 3 categories. First is the justified violence camp, where violence is at least arguably the only solution. You are killing things that need killing. Second, you have the over the top, ironic violence that frames itself as parody. You don&apos;t take your Serious Sams, Duke Nukems or Postals seriously, because how can you? Then you have your games where evil acts are there to provide a larger, philosophical context. You kill little sisters because that is consistent with the objectivist philosophy underpinning Rapture. You shoot Russian civilians because you believe it is for the greater good, and the player must question if this is right. CoJ manages none of these. By simply plastering the mechanics of a shooter over a topic they may have heard of by reading the title of an article somewhere, they completely neglect to ask themselves what this all means. What you end up with is a game about the evils of Mexicans and other minorities overblown to the point where it deserves a place next to &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; as racist propaganda. Except it lacks even the historical significance of such propaganda, since it will neither have the emotional impact of such trash, the fun fundementals of even the trashier mindless shooters, nor does it manage to contain even a cursory connection with facts.<br><br>If Techland understood even the most rudimentary concepts of design, then frankly, that is terrifying. It means they knowingly have endorsed the viewpoint of a misogynistic Klansman. Frankly I hope that the truth is the more likely scenario, where the creative minds behind this game have no business making games. At least then, we can perhaps hope for an apology. This game degrades the Drug War, the travesties within, minorities, women, the players themselves, and the very idea of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-the-cartel/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803672">Expand</a></span>

<br>First problem was a sound problem. Turns out it has something to do with the microphone/headset. After a good while figuring that out, we both plugged in old earmuffs and an old microphone - thank god we still had them around.
<br>
<br>So finally he joins me and we start playing. First things that comes to mind are the ugly graphics. The pixelated symbols leading to the next waypoints. Then comes the horrible AI.. its just laughable for a game of 2011. The shooting itself feels.. well.. its just not fun and precise. And then there is a constant vertical sync happening, something that bothers me alot (screen tearing). No option to turn it off, and forced vsync through the graphic card is ignored.
<br>
<br>Despite all those shortcomings, despite the fact that this is the only game we&apos;ve ever cooped where we DIDN&apos;T HAVE FUN, we still kept at it. After all, we bought it.
<br>
<br>Then after playing a while we both start feeling somewhat dizzy from all the screen tearing and decide to leave it be and accept that its probably the worst game we&apos;ve ever bought.
<br>
<br>I can look over a cheesy story. I don&apos;t mind colorful words, and I don&apos;t think that killing guys from a (Mexican?) cartel qualifies as racism, if its just the setting. It wouldn&apos;t make much sense to have mostly caucasians in such a cartel.
<br>
<br>What matters to me primarily is the quality of gameplay. And that quality is horrible. Don&apos;t buy this game, ever. If you want to coop something with a buddy, there are many older coop games out there which are actually enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-the-cartel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2329170">Expand</a></span>

The boring wave after wave of black and latino badguys, the achievement for killing 40+ black people in one level,  this all has a damaging psychological impact that actually does decensitize it&apos;s player to the gory racial, and gender violence that is being committed, and without any honest context.<br><br>This is the worst part. When you are chasing down the missing stripper, after strangling TWO OTHER STRIPPERS TO GET INFORMATION (this is so offensive, but it doesn&apos;t even matter because of what comes next), they paint the picture that human sex trafficking, one of the most heinous crimes in the world, has the cartel kidnapping American women and selling them in Mexico?  Whoah. Whoah. Whoah. That has no basis in reality and is an INSULT to the women and children sold as slaves in the United States. It&apos;s Mexican women who are kidnaped and sold in the U.S. and other countries. To even entertain the opposite without recognizing the actual truth of it is so... brainless and I will say it. Misogynistic and Racist. I don&apos;t know if the game designers actually are stupid, bigoted and hate women, but they definitely think their audience is. Glad I didn&apos;t buy it and just watched some play through. No money should go toward this game.

The games share some locations and resembling characters but that is that. Now that we have sorted that out is Call of Juarez :The Cartel good or bad? The game is sadly a technical mess. Expect constant framerate problems that really screw up your experience. Expect annoying blur, extremely limited graphical options, nonsense enemy and ally spawning, glitches, stupid one liners, bad car chases, annoying checkpoints and a overall unfinished feel to the game. The sad part is that the game could have been alright. Not great, but an alright shooter. You fight in a ton of different environments and some of them are actually quite cool. There is a decent amount of weapons in the game, the selection of hand-guns is especially nice. The story though cheesy is actually quite decent when you get into it. Who know, some more months in development could have made this into an alright police shooter. But that is not the case today and considering the all the problems, especially the problems with the framerate makes it impossible for the to recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-the-cartel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786590">Expand</a></span>

No, thats stupid, really risky and not nearly as profitable.. they are bringing Mexican women into American to sell as sex slaves), the blatant racist violence, level where you kill nothing but black men because... they live in a slum neighborhood and you&apos;re trying to start a turf war to destabilize the gangs? Yeah I suppose that could work
<br>BUT ITS RACIST.
<br>A achievement to kill as many black guys as possible in that level.
<br>It gets facts wrong like the phrase &quot;Gold or lead&quot;.. thats not  the real phrase,  it&apos;s actually Silver or Lead and was coined by Escobar.
<br>The games about 3-4 hours and even that felt painfully long. Terrible controls, AI are stupid, they don&apos;t even know how to drive cars and the guns feel flimsy pee-shooters. The games design is for coop so all the good guns are now allowed for us singleplayers, not that I care enough to be angry.
<br>It&apos;s linearity wouldn&apos;t be an issue if it could back it up with a stellar narrative, but it&apos;s got a paper thin storyline with very weak justification for every new intel you find. Characters are stereotypical that you really care nothing for.
<br>
<br>Its probably one of the worst designed, short, boring, and misinformed games I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>Why in the 7 hells does it have Call of Juarez in the title, I&apos;ll never figure out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-the-cartel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186581">Expand</a></span>

<br>It wasn&apos;t ported perfectly on PC, that&apos;s true. You almost can&apos;t set up the graphics at all, there&apos;s a motion blur and a depth blur that can be annoying, but you&apos;ll get used to them pretty soon.
<br>But for the rest? It&apos;s a simple action fps like tons of others, with badass characters &quot;maxpayneing&quot; their way against an army of bad dudes, a lot of gunfightings, explosions, car pursuits, a story that&apos;s maybe a bit confusing but overall good, great voice acting, the same easy controls as every fps... It may not be the most original fps of all times, it&apos;s very linear and doesn&apos;t allow you to explore anything, but.. who cares? It&apos;s fast paced, funny and entertaining for all its length, and never bored me.
