Game don&apos;t have to be realistic to be fun, but this game is neither realistic nor fun. Get IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 instead, where you not only can be a bomber gunner, but also fly one too, and with mods, control a B-17. It&apos;s both realistic and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/b-17-gunner-air-war-over-germany/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608317">Expand</a></span>
