<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.

<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation.

The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work.

<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.

<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation.

<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.

<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation.

<br>Each year we are facing with the same issue, EA sports releases a new version of FIFA which is partially or completely broken. The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work. People tolerated it for years, but sooner or later it has to end.
<br>
<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.
<br>
<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation. But it seems they forget that we already paid for the game, and had to get a quality product. We will do our best to make our voice heard and make executives who are responsible for what is happening respect their customers and players. Otherwise they will lose them, as well as reputation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7725888">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I dont even enjoy winning games like that as I prefer to play a passing type game. You just need pace and high pressure to win games on FIFA 18.
<br>
<br>Also another thing I am completely annoyed by is the number of times I try to play a through ball into the channel and the ball is almost always played in the direction opposite to the empty space. Even worse is the fact that the defenders are so retarded they dont even stop that through ball and my striker runs through on goal. Its ridiculous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7664025">Expand</a></span>

The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work.

<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.

<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation. But it seems they forget that we already paid for the game, and had to get a quality product. We will do our best to make our voice heard and make executives who are responsible for what is happening respect their customers and players.

<br>
<br>Each year we are facing with the same issue, EA sports releases a new version of FIFA which is partially or completely broken. The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work. People tolerated it for years, but sooner or later it has to end.
<br>
<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.
<br>
<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation. But it seems they forget that we already paid for the game, and had to get a quality product. We will do our best to make our voice heard and make executives who are responsible for what is happening respect their customers and players. Otherwise they will lose them, as well as reputation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7727824">Expand</a></span>

<br>#EA_Should_Respect_Customers #DontKillProClubs #EA_Fix_ProClubs
<br>
<br>Each year we are facing with the same issue, EA sports releases a new version of FIFA which is partially or completely broken. The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work. People tolerated it for years, but sooner or later it has to end.
<br>
<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.
<br>
<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation. But it seems they forget that we already paid for the game, and had to get a quality product. We will do our best to make our voice heard and make executives who are responsible for what is happening respect their customers and players. Otherwise they will lose them, as well as reputation.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7729815">Expand</a></span>

<br>Each year we are facing with the same issue, EA sports releases a new version of FIFA which is partially or completely broken. The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work. People tolerated it for years, but sooner or later it has to end.
<br>
<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.
<br>
<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation. But it seems they forget that we already paid for the game, and had to get a quality product. We will do our best to make our voice heard and make executives who are responsible for what is happening respect their customers and players. Otherwise they will lose them, as well as reputation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7790811">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>*The defending system still sucks, players don&apos;t take the ball in easy situations, they make strange moves to pressure, and is vital for a game that has improves of al kind to atack in tha past 4 years, that at least the defending mechanics and AI still sucks.

<br>
<br>In English
<br>The problem with this video game is that EA releases it to the market on an annual basis, which is why the quality is less than how it should be perceived by users. Otherwise with PES that apparently strives more in the development of the game. Even though EA spends millions for licenses. In addition, as a company is not very interested in the opinion of video game players because EA sees that you buy this product even with bad user notes. There is a public that buys each year the game I have even pre-ordered making this into custom every year. EA should care more about how players who consider themselves fans of the FIFA game perceive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7796670">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is just utterly awful quite frankly and is the final nail in the coffin for me... i won&apos;t be buying any more FIFA titles.
<br>
<br>FIFA 13 had it&apos;s issues... sure it was flawed but it was damn fun to play... Ever since then EA have continuously shat out crap with every release each year... sadly this release is no better than any of the previous titles since then.
<br>
<br>We have the ball defying the basic laws of physics...
<br>Goalie&apos;s simply not moving when the ball is coming towards them from a distance... I literally had a ball bounce off a goalies head and into the net as he stood there like a statue... it was hilarious!
<br>Goalkeepers are laughably terrible.
<br>Defending is near impossible.
<br>Maneouvering players feels like steering a boat in syrup.
<br>bump into another player and they go hurtling backwards.
<br>General control is clunky, heavy and very sluggish.
<br>
<br>AVOID at all costs...
<br>
<br>If you are silly enough to buy then then don&apos;t go via a third part (ie cdkeys)... you wont be able to get a refund!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7581452">Expand</a></span>

The game comes out to release with such bugs that it is impossible to play. People pay for the game 50-100$, and receive a product that does not work. People tolerated it for years, but sooner or later it has to end.
<br>
<br>This year a new version of the game has surpassed all it&apos;s predesestors. And a huge part of the community received a completely broken mode Pro Clubs. Critical bugs that not allow to play friendly games between teams and stopped all the international tournaments held in every country of the world. Hundreds of thousands of players spend 2-3 hours of their time to play only one game each evening struggling with the broken mechanics.And these efforts do not always guarantee success. Almost 2 months as EA sports knows about this issue. It released 4 patches to the game, and not one of them did solve this problem. Players tested all possible reason and the occurrence of this error, reported all this information to support, but they do nothing.
<br>
<br>They spend their resources to repair the small problems of the game modes which bring them money for the donation. But it seems they forget that we already paid for the game, and had to get a quality product. We will do our best to make our voice heard and make executives who are responsible for what is happening respect their customers and players. Otherwise they will lose them, as well as reputation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7724733">Expand</a></span>

<br>Slick presentation, animations are well done.
<br>
<br>Complaints about defending are by those that can&apos;t anticipate runs or understand positioning.
<br>
<br>They&apos;ve done some great work with the AI this year. Your players make more intelligent runs so you can get some great moments when playing the ball through.
<br>
<br>Sure, there are a few oddities, but nothing that warrants a zero score review on here.

You go will check drivers and you find out that everything costs the last and it is a game such not optimized piece of **** In general FIFA 18 has turned out contradictory and the career became much more reigrabelny, trasferny negotiations it abruptly. Have added strictly registered compensation in contracts. The updated design of MLS and La Liga it very abruptly, but why in the menu of model of football players in such disgusting quality as if I play on PS3? And bugs are enough in a gameplay. Hunter&apos;s history has turned out not bad, but as well as last year too affected. But for Therry Henry +1 point. Again a game will be completed and it will be possible to play it not earlier than winter or in general the beginning of 2018.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7569203">Expand</a></span>

Graphically it looks great, smooth animations, slick UI, absolutely great. This along with the fully licensed leagues and players make fifa what it is.
<br>But the sad thing about it all is the fact that they don&apos;t make an effort to improve.
<br>
<br>The journey was a fun introduction to the series, but it got boring fast last year. This year it&apos;s even worse, I would like to see better writing, but this is a sports game and I don&apos;t mind the story being cheesy. However, it doesn&apos;t make sense this time around. It&apos;s such pandering to the US market it&apos;s sickening. In FIFA 17 I started with a small club thinking I would be able to get transferred to any big club in the world, but nope it was completely scripted, so I was stuck at Watford. This time I wouldn&apos;t get burned so as an AMC I signed for Manchester United. Real Madrid is a great club, but I don&apos;t care for them irl, so it felt awkward being forced to leave United, and I was glad the deal fell through. The game goes on and the scripted event starts being 3-0 down. My difficulty settings were set way too low and I scored 6 times after coming on. But somehow the story acted as if the poor performance was my fault even though we won 6-3 after being behind. Those are things that happen in a scripted story, and I could somewhat live with that. But then the **** starts, the game pretending a first team player of United only has LA Galaxy giving a way out? Then pretending Galaxy are some kind of super squad with overrated players, Van Damme being a monster in defence while he now has a hard time making the squad for a small team in Belgium... It just doesn&apos;t make sense. Oh and never mind that after the American adventure I was transfered to Atletico Madrid, the club of my dreams while Real being the club of my dreams 6 months earlier. (Do these devs even understand football) I did like the implementation of the womens game though, but on a whole it&apos;s a dud again. And frustrating as the entire game, it could have so much better if wasn&apos;t as scripted.
<br>
<br>So on to the game itself, controlling a full team, it feels the same as always, decent enough, but it never feels like a real football game. it&apos;s a game of one-two, threaded pass and speed your way to the goal. You have to force yourself to make it exciting. And this has been the case for years. I played PES 2018 a bit and the difference in playing the game is unbelievable. It&apos;s a shame PES isn&apos;t nearly as polished, has crap commentary, menus, graphics, licenses, ... so it&apos;s hard playing that game, but boy do they know how to make the gameplay fun and not nearly as grindy as fifa. This has been so frustrating for years, give me the gameplay of pes in the fifa polish and we would have the perfect football game. Fifa has copied so many controls of pes, but still unable to copy the core game, and it&apos;s a shame. And we&apos;re talking about 10+ years of the same complaints.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s one major complaint I have with the fifa polish, the end of the season is still infuriating. During your championship games, there&apos;s still way too little indications to know if you&apos;re going to be crowned champions or not. It can&apos;t be that hard to implement more tension in those last couple of games. Now you have to wait to the final whistle and hope the commentary and the cutscene start. Also make sure that the last games of the season are played at the same time. Last game of the season I won and was 2 points ahead of Real, but somehow real had still a game to play after that. I got an email to inform me of winning the championship... This isn&apos;t right.
<br>
<br>So all in all it&apos;s a decent game, but if there&apos;s one series that could benefit from taking a couple of years off, build the core gameplay from the ground up, it&apos;s fifa. EA Sports, you have a great example in PES on how the game can flow, so please use it for a change. Unfortunately reality tells me this isn&apos;t going to happen with a moneycow like this, but I&apos;m done giving out high scores for minimal development. Descent game, not worth the money if you bought the previous 4 versions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-18/user-reviews?user_review_id=7573074">Expand</a></span>
