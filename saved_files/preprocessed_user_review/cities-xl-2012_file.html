So, when Cities XL 2011 came out, I bought it right away, soon realizing that there were a few minor additions, but no improvements to the game, and no bugfixes. Severely disappointed, I chucked it in the cabinet, never to play again.<br>Cities XL 2012 is... exactly the same. Some minor additions, no improvements, and the original bugs are still there!<br><br>For those unfamiliar with the problems, here&apos;s a personal summary in ascending order of annoyance:<br>1) the game is badly balanced in terms of trading, making it ridiculously easy to come up with a profit. I.e.; no real challenge.<br>2) the public transport-system is broken, resulting in no real value of busses or metro.<br>3) the game suffers from a memory leak, making you restart the game every 30-odd minutes to keep on playing.<br>4) and finally, the game DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES! I&apos;ve got a pretty decent quad-core which can run anything from Theme Hospital to Crysis, but it struggles with Cities XL because it only utilizes a single core! This results in a very slow game, with seconds of delay between clicking a button and seeing a response. I find that to be a dealbreaker for a processor-heavy game.<br><br>While the potential is clearly there, the bugs make the game unplayable, and as such I&apos;ve applied for a refund (which I seem get, surprisingly).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=1833347">Expand</a></span>

But still it lags to the point of almost locking up. Through reading some of the forums, this is a common problem with the game. And the only fix or workaround seems to be having to quit and restart the game to play another 30 or 40 mins.

The learning curve was pretty gentle.  I did the tutorials and even though everything wasn&apos;t really explained perfectly, I figured out enough of it to get started pretty quickly.  Without having to work very hard, I managed to get a city to 50,000 population pretty easily.  Unfortunately, that&apos;s where things started going downhill.  The main reason why this game doesn&apos;t get a higher score is that it only utilizes one core. I have a quad core and it seems ridiculous that they couldn&apos;t figure out how to at least attempt to use a 2nd core to lighten the load.  I also have a good video card (GTX 460 which I upgraded to a GTX 570 with 1.2GB of RAM on it) and 4GB of RAM in my PC yet after 50,000 citizens the game still runs in the single digits on framerate?<br><br>Also occasionally I&apos;d run into situations where a house would report that it had no access to city hall even though it did, or that a bus line was broken (meaning it didn&apos;t make a complete loop back to the terminal) when nothing had changed.   These little events hurt the game as well...<br><br>I haven&apos;t really experienced all the game has to offer yet, but from what I can see it&apos;s great for casual players who just want to jump in and start making a city since it simplifies some things over Sim City (like not having to place water and electrical lines everywhere). It also allows you to connect one city to another  to trade some resources between them, allowing one city to specialize in &quot;holiday hotels&quot; and another to be more of a farm city, or industrial or whatever.  This is very nice, though if your cash flow is negative, the only city you can trade with is the NPC city that generally doesn&apos;t give you a very good deal in any trade.  I&apos;d say if you see this game on sale for cheap, give it a shot (unless you already have one of the earlier games in the series).  Otherwise it&apos;s probably better to pass on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2201503">Expand</a></span>

Regarding the highway (which you get only at 500 000 people), is useless!!! You can only make transition from Expressway to Highway and there is simply no freeway entrance (as they were in Simcity). In addition, no road can goes above or below an highway. So you&apos;ll end with a strip of highway that will divide your city, thus not helping your traffic problem. The transition support 80 car vs the highway at 320 cars, do the math.
<br>Something that could have been nice is that you have to specialize your cities but to achieve this, you have to create many cites (estimate to 10) and you&apos;ll have to spend little time in each since you&apos;ll share ressources. If one is growing too much, it won&apos;t be able to share. This will cause bankruptcy in the current city and the other that was using resources from the original city. They went too far in this specilization since a city cannot be self-sufficient even though it has all the ressource.
<br>
<br>Regarding the user interface, for unknown reason they limited the panel to 6 items, then you&apos;ll have to click to see the next 6 and so on. So, once most of the feature are unlock, you are expanding your menu all the time.
<br>A set the 7$ price because I don&apos;t see beyond 500 000 people the goal, it becomes frustrating to play. You better try to create another city from zero. Regarding bugs, they are a few and the one that is a killer (maybe just for me), if you press ESC while the autosaving is trigger, the game crash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633855">Expand</a></span>

Due to it&apos;s buggy nature the game will either freeze or shut my top of the line computer down. It&apos;s enjoyable to start, but doesn&apos;t bring me back for more as often times their user interface is late in telling you what you actually need to improve your city.

It is a shame as there are not many city builder game available. With the introduction of modding tools in Cities XL 2012, the game really has potential for a classic but Focus has to focus on fixing the technical problems first.</span>

Some of the new buildings are even bugged. If you play for more than an hour or so the game bogs down and a restart is needed, an issue that has stayed over from 2011. If you own a Cities XL or Sim City 4 already, don&apos;t bother.</span>

Trade is buggy and poorly optimized.<br><br>At the same time, though, the game is actually fun. It&apos;s a great way to kill several hours, building unique cities and taking advantage of the new features in this version (which are mostly just new buildings, but it&apos;s still a fun addition). The game is consistently challenging, in all the right ways, and this falls well into line with the projected difficulties for each map type, so it&apos;s possible to play at exactly the level of difficulty you&apos;d expect. Setting up bus routes and organizing cities to minimize traffic problems and environmental health is a satisfying task. And the difficulty grows organically as your city expands, requiring you to manage an ever-increasing set of variables in order to satisfy your citizens&apos; needs.<br><br>In short, the game is well-designed, and it is fun to play. It&apos;s just a shame that it&apos;s not better optimized. Perhaps once they slap next year&apos;s number on it, the game will have addressed those details.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994419">Expand</a></span>

Focus Home Interactive is the leading example of a publisher that doesn&apos;t care about the quality of a game and fans. It baffles my mind that their is three games yet nothing is fixed from previous releases. So.. (poor+bias alert) general knowledge would suggest that their was ever be one player in the city-management sim genre which is obviously Simcity. Its been ages since Simcity 4 and the failure of that god-forsaken game. In that period between the glorious return of Simcity fans would really have one choice if they ever wanted teh 3D graphics and modern glamour for a City sim. Cities XL could be a nice alternative but the people behind it have borked it. As its broken in many places so yeah for the future its failure to address the issues that&apos;s been complained about many &quot;times&quot; should&apos;t go unpunished Simcity is 2013 apparantly how will they respond? Oh, let&apos;s release another game with minor additions! Just don&apos;t buy the game from these guys srsly until they learn the harshest of lessons...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2462711">Expand</a></span>

The graphics is good, and the depth is much greater than Sim City which is the only real competitor in the genre. The cities can be done very realistic because it doesn&apos;t use a limited grid system. Theres also quite a lot of mods available. I would probably give a 10/10 but theres one big problem: The game is poorly optimized and doesn&apos;t support multi-core cpus. In other words, good luck trying to build a metropolis.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789933">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a game, there are bugs, the graphics are plain ugly. Even the caption of buttons are not propertly aligned. The text effects are horrible. I really wonder if they could not afford a descent graphic artist to make the game look like its been developed in the 2010&apos;s. Plain disapointment.</span>

I have enjoyed the game for about 12 hours now and can say that there is a small memory leak but it only affects me after about every  1.5 hours. just a quick back to the menu and back into the game solves the problem. If you have never played any of the XL titles, I recommend it. If you are upgrading from XL 2011 then I have read its not really worth it. A9/10 just because of the memory leak.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2293292">Expand</a></span>

By the way, this game only uses a single core (so your other one or three or nine hundred don&apos;t go to use, making the game lag severely and making alt+tabbing impossible without crashing) and has alot more technical problems than just that.</span>

<br>firstly, i have to mention the game looks better than most of other sim games
<br>up close all things look very detailed and pleasant to look at but without no simulation part to it, it feels meaningless quickly.
<br>for simulation part, it has severe flaws. the most annoying thing is leisure satisfaction level is always low even though i keep building parks and leisure building all around map.
<br>also city doesnt feel like its living world. even with 0.2 million people, my city feels like dead
<br>i think its from weak simulation. framemate problem is another minus of this game
<br>pro:
<br>-graphic is one of the best in city builders
<br>cons:
<br>- lack of variety of buildings
<br>- weak simulation part
<br>- huge lag after u hit decent popualtion</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=4704892">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are some options for resource trading that may make some players happy but personally not a big fan of them as they are unrealistic.
<br>
<br>Decent transit options.
<br>
<br>You can add mods and new maps but terraforming options are rather limited even with the former.
<br>
<br>A very annoying aspect with Cities XL is that you have to micromanage everything in order to make people&apos;s lives better. I can understand fire and policing, but hmm, entertainment? That is your responsibility too.
<br>
<br>Economically wise I found much harder (or slower) to make meets end (especially around middle game) than SC4 and much harder than the new SC and while there are mods and cheats available casual players who intend to build large cities may want to be aware of that before they jump in.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s menu interface is not very intuitive and suffers from bugs so that you do lose saves from time to time. The game starts to suffer perfomance issues when cities start filling the map as well even on a decent PC.
<br>
<br>Overall decent game if you are new to the franchise, or if you are new to the city building genre altogether.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=4560200">Expand</a></span>
