<br>No cool factions, no hammerites, no pagans, burricks and lobstermen replaced with dogs and birds. It&apos;s not cool with kids if modern game doesn&apos;t have doge.
<br>Freeform climbing and rope arrow usage replaced by scripted dev-approved location movement only. Combat blows, press X to not take damage from guards slow telegraph attack, no sword. Bopping guard on head from behind with blackjack replaced with scripted takedowns, doing it yourself too hard for consoles.
<br>Technically weak, linear small levels, loading every 2 minutes. Level design very meh. Mandatory 4-5 per level advancing forward in cutscene, cutting off previous part of level, because having level accessible fully and non-linear would be too hard for consoles.
<br>Prologue cutscene - zomg, you killed him, how could you, thieves don&apos;t do that!!!one. Chapter 1 - bonus objective, score 4 headshots on guards for extra money, because nothing spells thief quite like bow headshots. If you shoot guard from far enough, arrow flying will play out in slo-mo so cool kids can put 360 noscope thief videos with wubwub music on youtube.
<br>All in all, disappointment on the same level as Deus Ex HR, but I guess Squeenix ran out of money to pay off journalists this time, dxhr PC metacritic: 90, IGN: 90. Thief PC metacritic: 69, IGN: 68.
<br>Uninstalled after chapter 2, searching drawers in small dark rooms repeatedly is more boring than my real life work that I get paid for, no thanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3999417">Expand</a></span>

This, however, does not. There are not many locations in Thief that are memorable, it all feels pretty generic. They also seem to have largely ignored the heavy Steampunk art design of the previous games, which makes things worse. The story is also uninteresting. As for the graphics, they are a mixed bag. The lighting and fog are great, while texture quality is rather poor. The game also looks like it lacks the high contrast black of the previous games, it looks washed out and grey as if the developers were afraid of the shadows, ironically enough. &quot;Batman vision&quot; also looks out of place in a Thief game. Good things? The PC version runs well and the difficulty is highly customizable, if you turn everything apart from the vision indicator off you can have an experience close to the older Thief games, although unfortunately a more boring one. Overall, I don&apos;t think this is worth full price, but perhaps it&apos;s worth playing through when it goes 50% off. At around 8 hours to completion, it is also about half as long as one would expect from such a game. Even Last of Us took about 15 hours to finish, this game is definitely way too short. What a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988654">Expand</a></span>

That being said, it still is very lackluster and can hardly overcome its weaknesses to be a good game. In short, it is an average game, it isn&apos;t terrible like Ride to Hell but it hard to recommend unless you are desperate to play a stealth game and have already played Mark of the Ninja, The original Thief trilogy, The Deus Ex series with stealth runs and Dishonored.
<br>
<br>Level design:
<br>Levels, excluding the hub/city, are highly linear and the optimal route of the player is apparent. The best analogy for these linear sections is to equate them to hallways with cubbyholes on the sides with loot. Sure, you can go into the cubbyholes but they rarely help the player progression because many of them are dead ends and the player has to go back onto the path made by the developers. The question one should ask when playing Thief 4 is, &quot;how did the devs want me to play this level.&quot; Not, &quot;how should I beat this level.&quot;
<br>
<br>Player movement:
<br>The player cannot jump unless promoted too by the game, further limiting their actions to traverse a level and avoid traps that are in the game. As much as the developers want to believe, jumping is not a &quot;contextual action&quot;. However, you can &quot;swoop&quot;, an ability that is simply a dash that makes you hard to detect in lighted areas and can be chained in succession. Does it make up for the lack of an ability to jump without being prompted?
<br>
<br>Audio:
<br>After playing the game for a few hours, it will become apparent that the dialog and audio in the game repeats allot. The dialog itself in the game and cut scenes are uninspired. The audio transitions of being undetected and being engaged are poorly executed. Finally, the sound track for this game is hardly memorable, a shame from a triple A game.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>This is one of the few strong points of the game, it isn&apos;t ugly, and in fact it is atmospheric. The textures are decent and the particle effects bring this world to life. There is a good contrast between the light and dark areas of the game but the washed out grey shadows makes you feel like the enemies should see you because you are not immersed in total darkness.
<br>
<br>AI:
<br>The AI is highly unaware of the world around it unless you put out light sources or throw a bottle to draw its attention.  It can still detect you if you are not careful but it is easy to outsmart the AI.
<br>
<br>Combat:
<br>I do realize that this is a stealth game but it is poorly done when you are forced to do it. You can only attack with your blackjack, you cannot parry, but you can dodge. This close combat is highly repetitive especially in later levels where it takes 10-15 hits to kill an enemy. Finally, Garrett only has one audio file that plays whenever you attack which is, &quot;EH&quot;, which is very annoying when repeated.  It is quite clear that combat was not a focus of the game but it is neither enjoyable nor satisfying when you are forced to fight.
<br>
<br>Story (no spoiler mode):
<br>There isn&apos;t very special here, it is boring and does not help the player engage with the context of this world.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Thief 4 on its own isn&#x2019;t terrible but it isn&#x2019;t a good game either. It falls flat of the triple A standard and can hardly match other giants in the stealth genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3989905">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m really into stealth games that have a great degree of difficulty, because I think the difficulty is what makes it immersive. I&apos;m gonna start off by saying that that graphics, for the most part, are very well done. The map of the city is useless. Most doors are unable to be opened, which is terribly disappointing for a stealth game, and makes the game seem very linear. AI is abhorrent and provides no level of immersion whatsoever. You can look a guard dead in the eyes 5 feet away in the dark and he&apos;ll have no idea you&apos;re there. It&apos;s weird that the animal AI is made to be better than human AI. I like the fact that birds and dogs will be alerted at sudden movement or noise. I feel as though the human AI should act differently from one another, so one person would be more alert than another to movement in darkness or the slightest sound. That&apos;s what creates immersion for me. Moving on, the dialogue between guards and monologue of guards is pretty terrible. Walking around an area, you can hear the exact same dialogue multiple times. The voice acting is cheap and a weak attempt at creating a natural environment. The volume of said dialogues physically don&apos;t make any sense, and HUGELY break immersion. The fact that you can be facing a man standing 15 feet away from you and you hear his voice in surround sound defies the physics of sound. Another very important point, as this is the first of the franchise that I have played, I feel absolutely no emotions towards any of the characters (playing through about 4 hours), and I don&apos;t even know why I&apos;m a thief. I have no set purpose in this game, and that&apos;s why this game bores me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3997728">Expand</a></span>

<br>Conclusion:
<br>Save your money for when it drops to $10 or $15, because that is about all its worth.  More and more of these big time companies are just trying to make a dime, instead they should try to make a game, then they would make more money.   I have come to a point, that I will now wait for scores as to whether or not to buy a game, instead of buying a game and watching my hard earned cash go to waste, oh well, live and learn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994888">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This abortion is brought to us by the same studio who made Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but sadly they used the D squad and it shows. The contextual movement, which is &quot;totally not even a big deal&quot; according to every community manager, is horrible. It could have potentially worked, if EM was really that good at level design, but they aren&apos;t. Instead, they&apos;ve effectively made a series of long corridors that that you may take one of two paths to finish, but you end up at the exact same place anyway. If that seems like a daunting number of choices, don&apos;t worry:
<br>
<br>Garrett will pipe in periodically to tell you where to go! Speaking of Garrett&apos;s new voice and his dialogue, pass. I didn&apos;t realize that the City was part of Boston! Because the only exit isn&apos;t obvious enough, even with Focus and waypoints and a minimap. Speaking of annoying sounds, the music does not fit at all and get&apos;s highly repetitive. Which reminds me, did you guys think of maybe not giving NPC&apos;s one line to just loop over and over again? To further continue about sound, a key component in the original games was being aware of what surfaces you walked on. Tile, metal, stone could all be quite loud. Now, as long as you&apos;re not jumping in puddles and stomping on broken glass, each surface is treated the same: as quiet as walking on plush carpet made of baby seals.
<br>
<br>And Steven Gallagher, you are a hack! While the storyline of the originals would never win a Pulitzer, the amount of clich&#xE9;s you threw at this piece of garbage answers why you&apos;re a video-game narrative writer, and not an author of any note. Also, please fire all of your writers, because they are terrible.
<br>
<br>Do not buy this trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3991699">Expand</a></span>

Myself like others were quite skeptical of this game following the game play videos released. After playing the first mission, I am pleasantly surprised - especially after seeing some of the recent reviews on Metacritic/IGN and the likes &#x2013; the thing is, I really don&#x2019;t think they have been playing it correctly.
<br>
<br>Now, there are a few things to do if you want to enjoy this game. First - turn off focus. Play on master difficulty or custom difficulty, and turn off pretty much everything you think will break your immersion. The light crystal isn&apos;t necessary as you can tell when you are in the light or not - I mean seriously..
<br>
<br>Same goes for guard alerts. When they see you - do you REALLY need lightning spiking around their heads? No, if they see you, you&apos;ll know - we aren&apos;t stupid. Jeeze these modern gaming trends do get on my nerves. The point of this game is to be as immersed in it as possible.
<br>
<br>With these things set you are guaranteed to have an enjoyable experience. This is a first-person only Thief title unlike the previous installment (Thief Deadly Shadows) - which had the option for either or.
<br>
<br>So this is a reboot - Garret doesn&apos;t have his mechanical eye (at least not yet - maybe that happens eventually) and the city is well ... kind of like it was in previous games. Guards are still overly violent and rude. There is some kind of disease they keep talking about called the gloom &#x2013; which really reminds me of Dishonored.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay &#x2013; with everything set like I said above (thank god they put these options in). This can be one of the most heart beating experiences in gaming you can have.
<br>Lurking in the shadows trying to frantically pick a lock in time before the guard does his sweep near you.
<br>You WILL get caught, you CAN get away. And you can retry.
<br>The feeling you get when you successfully strip a house clean of all its valuables without anyone even realizing (even though you are right there) is just an experience that you will not find in any other games except &#x2026; well, the previous Thief games. And maybe Dishonored. But all HUDS and crap really got in my way. With stealth games &#x2013; you want it to be as minimalist as possible. All you want is Garret.
<br>
<br>As for what I&#x2019;ve seen, it is quite linear, this is a narrow corridor city you will be making your way through. Yet, I still felt like I had options. I could still go off and explore, take the rooftops, sneak past guards and pick the lock of the front door before anyone noticed. This is where Thief shines.
<br>Now for some negatives. I am going to ignore focus mode and everything of the likes as I have already stated my opinions on it.
<br>
<br>The loading. For a 2014 game, it isn&#x2019;t very impressive when every section of the city is barred off with a load screen. This is how it was in Deadly Shadows as well. But well... I guess I expected more. Thankfully these aren&#x2019;t very long.
<br>And the thing that really irks me; is the quick time events. Spamming &#x2018;E&#x2019; to open a frekin window. NO THANKS. THAT&#x2019;S NOT A GOOD IDEA. Just open the Window for us, spamming &#x2018;E&#x2019; really doesn&#x2019;t make anything better. This is something I really think should be removed in a later patch.
<br>
<br>The cinematics are OK. But gosh darn it the ones that aren&#x2019;t rendered in game are very chopping and often the sound falls out of sync. Again, this will be fixed in a patch.
<br>I am very early in the game, but based on my first impression. I am happy with my purchase. I will update this review as I progress..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3992552">Expand</a></span>

(Once all the reviews were in.) This one is better than that one was. Full stop. IGN&apos;s review was bordering on slanderous. (Maybe they didn&apos;t pay IGN enough this time?) Don&apos;t get me wrong, the game isn&apos;t perfect&#x2026; but I get the impression that a great number of the pro reviewers are simply too young to know what Thief is even supposed to be like. (Anyone who calls this story &quot;confusing&quot; needs to go back and play the earlier Thief games. Thief has always had a &quot;nebulous and highly interpretable&quot; narrative.) To the reviewer at IGN complaining of &quot;flat, drab&quot; characters&#x2026; I can only assume they mean the color palette of the clothes worn by the peasants and the dark grittiness of the city. They can&apos;t mean the spoken dialog. (It&apos;s not as good as the old voice actor&#x2026; but those are tough shoes to fill.) Is it &quot;good enough?&quot; I think so. However&#x2026; in some places the lip sync is annoyingly off. (But since you are usually in dark environments you hardly ever notice.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3995866">Expand</a></span>

Although if you were to judge it as its own game, you&apos;d be equally unimpressed. The AI is somehow worse than that of a game made in 1998; I&apos;ve had it where I&apos;ve been in the light and in a guard&apos;s line of sight for about 3 seconds before they even went into a searching phase. The rest of the gameplay is lackluster too. The combat is broken and all around terrible, and not the intentional kind of terrible seen in the first 2 games, and The Dark Mod. It&apos;s closer to the Deadly Shadows type of terrible. The stealing and hand movements, while impressive from a technical standpoint, actually do the opposite of what they intended to do, and actually break immersion. On the topic of stealing, nowhere is there a requirement to steal anything not related to the story. That&apos;s right, YOU DON&apos;T NEED TO STEAL AT ALL IN A THIEF GAME. The levels somehow manage to be split into smaller chunks than Deadly Shadows, and the levels themselves are more linear than ever; gone are the days where you can rope arrow wherever you want, or even JUMP wherever you want. The graphics, while all new and shiny, are rather lackluster. The City is your generic steampunk Victorian setting with no colours except for teal, brown, and grey. The story and writing is absolutely abysmal. Without getting into too many spoilers, the game features &apos;brilliant&apos; lines such as &quot;I&apos;VE ALWAYS BEEN A GHOST&apos;,&quot; &quot;I&apos;M NOT A FAN OF DOORS,&quot; and, of course, &quot;COCKRINGS.&quot; The story is about as predictable as this game being a disaster is.
<br>And that&apos;s just judging it on its own merits. While it&apos;s disastrous as a game in and of itself, it&apos;s the absolute worst possible Thief game.
<br>Take my advice; buy Thief 1 and 2, and play The Dark Mod. Already have them? Play them again, and keep your mind off of this. I couldn&apos;t recommend it to even people who enjoy playing bad games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3989522">Expand</a></span>

Linear levels, mantling only on few pre-set points and constant handholding make this unworthy of the Thief name. Go play The Dark Mod or Dishonored, both games that are much more closer to the original classics.</span>

I couldn&apos;t even get into the story at all...the ai sucks....and theres like a cutscene every 5 mins its like this game tries more to be a movie than a game....the combat controls are horrid not that it really matters though because the ai isn&apos;t smart enough to attack effectively. total waste of my 45 dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3990553">Expand</a></span>

<br>Looks like Eidos is paying people to set 10&apos;s on this game, so many generic &quot;Best game evar&quot; - 11/10 Comments.

<br>This game should lose money, no one should take something good, make it bad and still profit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994554">Expand</a></span>

This is such a mess I don&apos;t even know where to begin.
<br>
<br>Okay, so they ripped almost the entire sound element of Thief out the window, the only things on the floor that make any more noise than complete silence are shards of glass and water. Every NPC&apos;s voice volume is at the same level to the point where you can&apos;t tell if someone is right beside you or two rooms away. It&apos;s a fascinatingly large **** in the sound department, to say the least.
<br>
<br>Now on to the marketed &quot;amazing immersive AI&quot; that was in the Steam Store Page feature list, a FLAT OUT LIE. This game has some of the worst AI I&apos;ve seen in a modern video game, you can get seen by guards and hide in a **** cupboard and they will forget you are there and go back to their business. You can do this six times in a row and they&apos;d be as surprised to see you as they were the first time, and as entirely clueless at knowing where you are hiding as every consecutive time you had hidden in the same place.
<br>
<br>The loot aspect is entirely downplayed, Garrett is no longer a master thief, but a petty hoarder. He grabs absolutely everything, from metal cups and cutlery to scissors and magnifying glasses worth 1-5 gold each. This is the stuff that Garrett would quickly gloss over while looking for precious golden candlesticks and expensive wines in the old games.
<br>
<br>Not only this but loot doesn&apos;t even factor into the objectives of the damn game, and why would it, since the Garrett character has been so butchered and he&apos;s been put to live in an abandoned clock tower. He has no need for loot to pay the rent just to stay alive like our previous Garrett.
<br>
<br>On top of all this, and the rest about Garrett&apos;s character being butchered, which is far too much for me to fit into this 5000 word maximum review, the levels are linear as all-hell. Everything is a straight corridor, every place you have to break in to has one way that the developers planned for you to use, gone are the days of open-ended Thief levels, now it plays like a mix between Call of Duty and Uncharted as far as level design goes.
<br>
<br>Rope arrows have also been butchered, if you thought their removal from Deadly Shadows was bad, you&apos;re going to wish you had the Climbing Gloves. The Rope Arrows in this new Thief game can only attach to very specific roped wooden beam spots, not any wooden surface, they may as well not be a rope arrow at this point.
<br>
<br>The dialogue is atrocious, even if you don&apos;t count the two main characters acting like they&apos;re in a emo teen angst movie. The guards are constantly mumbling about extremely stupid **** like &quot;cock-rings&quot;.
<br>
<br>Please, save your money and help the industry by not buying this excrement. If you really can&apos;t stand the old Thief games because you feel they&apos;re dated and want to try a game like old Thief then the closest you&apos;re going to find is Dishonored. Buy and play that instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994525">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s no free play, just a couple of rails here and there. There&apos;s no creative player solutions.The open world to explore is an utter joke (or an outright lie).
<br>
<br>A game with no soul and a distasteful generic flavor with steampunk art and a  &quot;but you can steal stuff too!&quot; does not make it Thief. Judging by the end result, their idea of appealing to new audiences is to treat everyone as retards. Decent eye candy tho.

<br>I was really shocked when I got this game, There is not much to say but that this game is one of the few I will be getting a refund back with. I am happy at the very least many places that sell these badly made games will in-fact give you refunds and then in turn go back after the game developers with charge backs and sending back the unused and returned copies.

<br>When will game makes start making games truly worth while, I have seen such a huge decline lately and its sad. :(   well good luck who ever keep this game I for one will not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3990745">Expand</a></span>

The first reviews that have come out from bigger companies like IGN have really give this title a good kicking. The trolls have come along and joined in, just because I suppose they find it funny.
<br>
<br>Personally silly troll review of something stopped being funny got me about 4 years ago, but kids today eh what ya gunna do.
<br>
<br>So when we get past the usual crap from kids who probably don&#x2019;t own the game, and never will, what are we left with.
<br>
<br>Well the recent reviews, that came after the likes of IGN, have been certainly more positive. I think this can only be due to quite an unpolished copy perhaps that the first reviewers were given.
<br>
<br>The recent reviews match my experience a lot better which seems to be the more polished retail product.
<br>
<br>So when you read the negative reviews, the AI, voice sync, and voice volume or repeating issues I can confirm have already been fixed. I experienced non of those. So you can forget about all that.
<br>
<br>The games Atmosphere is great, I didn&#x2019;t mind the voice work at all, and the game play as a sneak em up is great.
<br>
<br>It is different to dishonoured as it&#x2019;s a slower pace, and more thought is needed. I&#x2019;ll also mention it&#x2019;s look and atmosphere also leave dishonoured behind, but then this is somewhat unfair as this is a new release.
<br>
<br>Anyway I enjoy playing Thief, it doesn&#x2019;t give you the freedom of older games no, but what it&#x2019;s taken away it replaces with content and some slick game play.
<br>
<br>You always feel like a stealth master and the hands in front of you while searching and leaning add such a nice touch it adds to the emersion incredibly. They aren&#x2019;t just hovering there they are truly interacting with the scenery!
<br>
<br>I think without me writing a small book here, or trying to convince you to avoid the negative reviews, which I know now are just for the sake of it or rage from fans of the original instalments, I will heartily say, like many have before me, just go out and play this game for yourself.
<br>
<br>I can honestly say I think you&#x2019;ll be pleasantly surprised. Just give it a chance.
<br>
<br>Thanks for reading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3993400">Expand</a></span>

To the game&apos;s credit, this can be disabled, but only at the start of every new game, it cannot be changed on the fly. This game has been made far too easy, enemy guards can easily be dispatched, meaning players have no reason to avoid and or fear them.
<br>
<br>In the end, this game has been far too modernized for a Call of Duty audience, who all expect a scripted adventure where the puzzles are solved for them. As the game progresses, the levels do become more open and sanboxy, but the game already faltered from the beginning, by pissing on the Thief legacy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3991173">Expand</a></span>

The AI is just as, if not more laughable. This new release is an absolute insult to the franchise and absolutely violates the concept of the original games.</span>

<br>It&apos;s not a great game,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I implore that you do not take the negative reviews here as an indication that Thief is by any means a bad game.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a great game, but it&apos;s far from bad. Actually, I would say it&apos;s pretty good if you&apos;re willing to ignore that its predecessors are better. The confined spaces, lack of terribly dark atmosphere, the modernization of mechanics, and addition of a progressive combat system are all a mixed-bag that you&apos;ll either dislike or appreciate. However, there are options to better tailor the game to your liking.
<br>
<br>Make sure to read both good and bad reviews before making a decision. Don&apos;t be influenced by the silly &quot;old thief soldiers&quot; roaming the web -- most of which have likely not played the reboot, or entered the experience with an elitist and negative attitude that lessened their enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988725">Expand</a></span>

That tells me you&apos;re so invested in the original game that you can&apos;t see past it.  The game is atmospheric and fun -- all the reviews say this, even the negative ones.  It&apos;s not hard to make a fair judgement here -- fine, you hated the game, but zero?  You&apos;re a fanboy, nothing more.</span>

Making a reboot with modern engines makes de game a quite diferent. My system is a AMD FX 8350, and 2X7970 Crossfire, the game runs at 60 FPS.</span>

The game puts a huge emphasis on stealth and is a lot of fun. I watched gameplay videos and came to my own conclusion before buying it. The Steam reviews reflect my thoughts as well.
<br>One of the best things about the game for me is the atmosphere and the sound. When you&apos;re creeping around a house, there is a real sense of fear. The fear of being caught. Because once you&apos;re caught(at least on Master difficulty), you&apos;re screwed. The music that plays when you&apos;re sneaking around is more about atmosphere than about being music. It really gives me the feeling of the original games.
<br>One of the best moments so far for me was trying to pick a safe next to a sleeping guard. If you miss a tumbler, you&apos;ll wake the guards and I nearly did a couple times.
<br>Other things that stood out for me were: I put out a torch to sneak around a guard. He noticed and re-lit the torch. That was unexpected and pretty awesome. Also, leaving doors open after entering a room can alert people that there&apos;s an intruder. This was one thing in the originals that didn&apos;t matter. I had to reload my game a couple times because this gave me away to the guards.
<br>This game is NOT about fast paced action. It&apos;s mainly about stealth and stealing things. The game is also a challenge on &quot;master&quot; difficulty. I haven&apos;t messed with all of the other extra difficulty settings yet, but the game can be made extremely difficult.
<br>
<br>Watch some gameplay videos and come to your own conclusion. That&apos;s what I did and I&apos;m loving this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3990204">Expand</a></span>

Anyways, i wanted to like this game, i really did, but with a poor ai, and game play that isn&apos;t that much enjoyable it was hard to do. Being able to customize the difficulty is a nice option, and the graphics for the most part are gorgeous, but there are too many flaws to this game. To start off the movement is ok, but i found Garret moving in ways i didn&apos;t want him to and sometimes it resulted in my death. The pathing is quite linear, sometimes you will find a side route, but these are usually just sewer or vent areas that bypass everything and leave little challenge. The ai in this game is more focused on the artificial side and less on the intelligent part. There are many parts when i should have been spotted and wasn&apos;t and when i shouldn&apos;t have been spotted i was. This brings me to my next point, the combat. I know this is a stealth game, and most people will go through this game avoiding as much combat as possible, but if you&apos;re going to put combat in this game at least make it decent. All you do after entering combat is dodge, bash, repeat. It is very repetitive and becomes very boring quickly. Throughout the game I came to find that it was filled with filler. For every time you go to steal an item or open a drawer there is a small, but lengthy animation. I find these interactions to be neat and they are cool, but when im stealing 5 or more items in a room and have to open at least four drawers on a desk it becomes extremely irritating. Finally my last point is that they point some things in this game that were unnecessary. For example when you are at the brothel there are about four places you can peek through the holes in the wall and see some special services being committed. I can see if they include sound, but the fact that they include multiple scenes made me feel like they were completely irrelevant to the game and they were included to try to bring in more people to buy the game. The other annoyance in the game which happens quite often is the screen flashing. When you move in and out of the light your screen flashes brightly and is quite blinding especially if you are playing this late at night. Even though you already have a small white orb in the bottom of the screen which tells you whether you can be seen or not. This blinding light also happens when lighting flashes, which almost makes sense to me, but it is just so bright and blinding it ridiculous! After all of this a can see why this game has the reduced price tag, and i hope you look up some game play and really think if you would want to be playing this game for hours and hours before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3995529">Expand</a></span>

<br>Each game can be set as one of three difficulty levels or a custom difficulty where you can then select from a myriad of different choices to enhance your gameplay experience so that you can play the game the way YOU want to.
<br>While some parts of the game are rather linear, this does follow most of the original Thief game&apos;s design and still manages to work quite well if you aren&apos;t insisting that every single game have &quot;open world design&quot; these days.
<br>Enemy AI can be buggy at times but overall works very well depending on the difficulty chosen and can be a real challenge to work around.  Few times was I ever spotted when I shouldn&apos;t have been or not spotted when I felt I should have.
<br>Overall it has a few rough patches but still maintains a mix of fun stealth gameplay and I would certainly recommend it if you enjoy these types of games and are willing to put aside all the negative reviews certain fans are giving it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3989312">Expand</a></span>

You can choose the difficulty , I chose normal and it&apos;s still a little hard to steal things without being noticed, you have to think before what you&apos;re doing and keep an eye on the movement of soldiers. The graphics are not spectacular, but they are beautiful. I ran the game with everything max, filters, etc, at 1920x1080 and rolled flat, the FPS ranged between 50 and 60. It took me almost 2 hours to get past the first mission , exploring every corner to steal as much as possible and trying not to be detected, which made me take more. About the negative reviews, including the &quot;big sites&quot;, I was not disappointed to read before playing, and now I played I&apos;m not unrepentant, as I said, I loved the game and I recommend for you that enjoy a good first-person stealth game. Ignore the reviews, play and give your own conclusion.

<br>This game is emblematic of everything wrong with AAA game design at the moment to me.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, its very very pretty.  That means absolutely nothing, especially in terms of story telling, but its pretty.  I stopped playing once I realized that I literally had nothing to fear when creeping high above a city street, you have to consciously make the decision to &apos;fall&apos;.  From what I&apos;ve read of other reviews it doesn&apos;t get any better.  No sword or dagger, just a quick time event to fight off guards.  An apparent aversion to killing, but an achievement for 5 head shots with arrows.
<br>
<br>I rarely write reviews, but I hope this studio doesn&apos;t get its hands on any other beloved IPs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4315151">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. No Jumping!!! or any movement outside of where the developers want you to go. This creates and extremely linear feel to the game. In a game where climbing and parkour is built into the mechanics free jumping is something that is a massive shame to be left out. I know Garret can jump but only where the developers want you to jump instead there are so many opportunities where a jump could have been so usefull and made the game so fluid but instead you fall to the round off a not nearly fatal enough height and die so instead of jumping you have to sneak past the guards on the street, and when running from one end of the city to the other about 20 times this gets kinda dull.
<br>2. Stop trying to be like Dishonored. A deadly disease takes the city, the works of ancient magical beings, one assassin/thief against a evil tyrant/dictator.
<br>3. More diversity, and less emphasis on looting. I know the game&apos;s called thief but in no way should the game encourage someone to go through every room in a mission to find all loot items especially when they&apos;re valued at 3 or 4 gold a piece. Less loot items but more valuable is my suggestion.
<br>4 And finally fix the AI, At hard they can pretty much see you no matter what, and on normal you can swoop right past them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4334389">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That&apos;s why, having played the first two Thief games in my youth: Dark Project and Metal Age, i was also able to play and love the third installment of the series, Deadly Shadows, which received a lot of hate from older generations at its release in 2005.
<br>Sure, Deadly Shadows was a different game regarding mechanics, but the charachters and especially the story fitted perfectly in the Thief&apos;s canon.
<br>
<br>As the main theme of the saga was the &quot;balance&quot; kept by the Keepers between Pagans and Hammerites, the third game related directly to the Keepers themselves, closing perfectly the cycle with an emblematic ending.
<br>
<br>Recently...i think i&apos;ve developed a sort of &quot;sixth sense&quot; regarding newest games. I&apos;m able to feel immediately if a new sequel or reboot would work or not. I was positive about the new installments of other stealth series, as Hitman and Splinter Cell, and their releases confirmed my impressions.
<br>
<br>The absolutely negative feeling i&apos;ve got about this Thief reboot, also has proven to be correct.
<br>
<br>The new Thief is a work which fails in everything... the atmosphere, the gameplay (too influenced by the mediocre Dishonored, which in turn failed to mimic what was best in the Thief saga) and most especially the story.
<br>
<br>Deadly Shadows  closed with Garret becoming the new leader of the Keepers, as he was always &quot;predestined&quot; to be. And he found a new apprentice, a young girl who tried to rob him in the same manner he did with his old Keeper mentor Artemius at the beginning of Dark Project.
<br>
<br>Then we found that in the new Thief he &quot;died in an asylum&quot;, the Keepers, Pagans and Hammerites are long gone....and now a new Garret with a female apprentice tries to make a living in a world menaced by themes dear to the old &quot;Deus Ex/Dishonored&quot; clich&#xE8;s... a plague, a conspiracy, a mysterious entity.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no explanation about how the world was supposed to develop in such a fashion....no explanation why there&apos;s a new &quot;Garrett&quot; with a new fence called &quot;Basso&quot; (why in the hell they took the names of people died centuries before and who probably even don&apos;t know!).....and the ending really makes no sense at all.
<br>
<br>The oldest saga also got its &quot;voids&quot; in the story or the environment...but they were used to amplify the mistery and atmosphere of the games.
<br>
<br>So in conclusion, Thief failed in the element which is the most important for me in a game: its soul.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4392203">Expand</a></span>

Full life of a mediocre cutlery burglar guaranteed.
<br>
<br>All the equipment will be available to you fairly soon, so there will be no incentive to gauge the money or steal at all. Which leaves you hunting for collectibles. Useless, boring, copypaste collectibles to store in dusty cases at your base. That you will barely even ever visit.
<br>
<br>What are the collectibles? Oh why, a great variation of them, ofcource! I.e. Ring with blue stone, ring with red stone, ring with white stone, ring with green stone, ring with purple stone, ring with light blue stone... (as you guess the model stays the same, its just the skin) Then we have a brooch with blue stone, brooch with red stone, brooch with green stone...
<br>
<br>What exciting treasures to hunt for, huh? You bet.
<br>
<br>The story and characters are a perfect match.
<br>Garrett is boring as all hell, an **** and a... nothing. I can&apos;t find anything to describe him with, since the game didn&apos;t give me anything. Garret is just a boring **** Thats it.
<br>
<br>The story is some simple go-on-search-for an unrelated character without any proper exposition, makes you wonder why the heck are you even moving on, and that paranormal sauce all over it made me cringe god knows how many times throughout the playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=5871823">Expand</a></span>

<br>The main problem with the game are the neverending loading screens, you can&apos;t even roam around the city without following predetermined corridors with a loading screen between every single one. When backtracking the enemies have all respawned as if it was a game of megaman back in the day, not that megaman was bad but it really breaks the immersion.
<br>Another huge problem is the clunky feel of the character, you&apos;re supposed to be a master thief and you can even make a simple jump when you want to, have to wait for a certain prompt/place to execute a jump.
<br>Do yourself a favor and buy Dishonored instead, it&apos;s a much better game in all aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4170467">Expand</a></span>

The setting interested me and, initially during the prologue, the looting interested me. That&apos;s it. Everything else was a disappointment.

I found the missions a lot more enjoyable than navigating around the &apos;city&apos; with its lifeless inhabitants. I feel it would have been a better game if they&apos;d dropped that part completely and concentrated on creating more interesting missions like in the original.</span>

<br>
<br>The basic gameplay aspects are just very underwhelming. If there was ever a game where stealing/looting should feel epic and fun this should be it, right? Sorry. Most of the time you steal stuff worth less than the value of a single arrow. The major scores you acquire you are generally forced to horde in your collection gaining you no money. Most major missions after requiring a huge effort also bank little if any cash. Loot a huge, massively defended vault; get a shard of something or other that makes you hallucinate and vault is otherwise empty.
<br>
<br>Stealth is also weak. This is another critical element for this type of game, and it just doesn&apos;t work all that well. Mostly it comes down to the mechanics just feeling inconsistent. Sometimes when your character is behind cover AND in the dark he still gets seen by random non-alert NPCs. Sometimes he doesn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>The graphics look great in general. Scenery is bleak but fairly realistic. Sound and dialogue are also decent.
<br>
<br>Upgrades feel sorta lackluster. There is some choice but skill points are few and far between, and total available options are minimal.
<br>
<br>Overall, its another case of all the development effort going to the console version. The PC version is not optimized to play to its strengths and suffers from awkward controls that are poorly translated from the console version.
<br>
<br>This could have been so much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=5416686">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>PROS
<br>-stunning graphics with crisp textures, detailed environments, and good lighting
<br>-tons of exploration
<br>-stats on all levels that are accessible at any point in the game
<br>-customizable difficulty and hud elements
<br>-&quot;collectible&quot; loot sets
<br>-bonus mission achievements
<br>-player skill and equipment improvements
<br>-aerial takedowns
<br>-unlike predecessors, can only jump when effective, so as not to create noise from failed jumps
<br>-&quot;swooping&quot; is fun and useful
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>-expansive but linear missions that don&apos;t allow backtracking to find all secrets. forced replay?
<br>-tedious but somewhat infrequent quick-time events
<br>-inexplicably inconsistent and limited saving leaves you frequently either unable to return to a specific part of a mission or redoing long sections because of one screw-up
<br>-unusual sound positioning causes some sounds (especially dialogue) to seem like they&apos;re closer than they are
<br>-occasional crashing
<br>-guard NPCs sometimes get stuck in place from loads, interrupted conversations, or disturbances
<br>-consolitis buy/sell interface
<br>-boss fights and action sequences that have no place in a thief game
<br>-the amount of clutter and environmental detail makes the focus mechanic a necessity
<br>-dumbed-down light levels mean you&apos;re either completely visible or mostly invisible
<br>-arbitrary lore and voice actor changes
<br>-cliche asylum mission that tries to be &quot;The Cradle&quot; from Thief 3; starts creepy but ends weird</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=5965764">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played Thief back in the day and I still recall trembling with glee as I saw its cover and realized that someone had really made the game I always dreamed they would. And it was everything I hoped for and then some. I&apos;ve played them all since then and even though Thief III started to lean towards the dull precipice of console gaming, I still enjoyed a lot of it and preordered this reboot. I shouldn&apos;t have and I&apos;m never paying for something they haven&apos;t made yet again. Ok so:
<br>
<br>Good things:
<br>The graphics capture the atmosphere really well.  Certain parts of the city feel exactly like I imagine old London or something felt and that&apos; very cool.
<br>
<br>Bad things:
<br>And that&apos;s why this is so bloody frustrating. They had the tools, they&apos;d made the setup for this game and then they dropped it on the floor. The story is weak and not particularly engaging. Garret isn&apos;t his old self and a bit too emo. The level design is far from inspiring and you&apos;re mostly dragged along a linear course with no planning and few options. Moving the character around feels a bit clumsy and ancient which was fine in 99 but not so much now. Worst of all though: the sound is utterly messed up. You can&apos;t tell where voices come from and that&apos;s just not ok in a stealth game. It breaks immersion and makes it really hard to navigate the darkness in a stealthy way.
<br>
<br>In the end we needed more missions, more planning, less moving back and forth over the same (admittedly fairly gorgeous) cityscape. We needed a protagonist with a cynical story and his good old sarcastic approach to everything and one that felt like you were moving around a master thief and not a clunky dude from 99.
<br>
<br>This game was a big let-down. It wasn&apos;t all bad, it&apos;s playable, but it had SO much potential and could so easily have been a lot more. Frustrating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4878283">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a lot of polish here, but at the end of the day it&apos;s just not fun. The Thief mythos has been redefined and the core mechanics have been changed.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy making a pile of bodies on each level in previous Thief games while slowly progressing through? Gone; now the levels are extremely linear and encounters tend to act as a checkpoint through which you&apos;ll pass and immediately forget.
<br>
<br>Enjoyed collecting loot and meeting those value goals each level? Gone as well. The loot will literally obstruct your path. Levels feel more like a Mario game than Thief--the loot will jump out at you (especially now that it shines *and* you have focus vision to make it pop). Sure you can go slightly out of your way and grab a few more coins, but it&apos;s hardly worth it.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy finding secret areas and the rewards within? Also gone. The secrets in this game are designed to be readily found so that everyone can find every secret during every playthrough. Worse still, the rewards inside tend to be unique loot which will go to your hideout to be stacked on each on a shelf or hung on a wall. Absolutely no gameplay rewards here.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy the variety of enemies in the previous games? Gone again. There are two. TWO! types of enemies in the entire game. One of which is just a lazy version of the other, with sensitivity to noise and other triggers turned way up.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy the AI of the previous games? Probably not, I know I didn&apos;t. Yet still it&apos;s worse here. Enemies rarely alert each other of events. Wandering civilians have been exchanged for caged birds and dogs. Yes, caged. They couldn&apos;t be bothered to make the dogs wander, so they just sit in a cage and bark.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy using a variety of arrows to take down enemies? Pretty much gone. There are fewer arrow types, you can hold less of them (especially starting off), and they&apos;re extremely rare. Expect to use one or two a level.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy knocking out opponents? Backstabbing them? Stealing arrows from an archer so he can&apos;t fight back? Gone. Gone. Gone. You have only a black jack now and there&apos;s no distinguishing knockouts from kills.
<br>
<br>Did you enjoy collecting keys and progressing through the level? Yup, gone. No keys here, just linear progression triggered by scripted events.
<br>
<br>I could go on, but i think you get the point. Is this a good Thief game? Definitely not. Is this a good game when not compared to the rest of the series? I&apos;m afraid not. It does have a couple genuinely enjoyable moments, but those are few and far between, and they certainly don&apos;t make the between bits worth playing.
<br>
<br>Do yourself favor and skip this game. Fingers crossed that the Thief series doesn&apos;t end with this stinker.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787998">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve also encountered lots of glitches, which was not fun at all. The stealth gameplay is enjoyable up to a point, but it gets repetitive quite quickly. A waste of time.</span>

<br>Thief is a stealth action game that I&apos;ve bought in a sale when I was playing Dishonored. I thought it was alike... well, it is, but is not as good as it could be.
<br>
<br>As the title suggests the game is based in stealing stuff, but we do it with no purpose. We are not Robin Hood, we just steal... maybe that&apos;s the purpose, but I think all this theft could have a meaning. It has not.
<br>
<br>The game goes in Victorian London, now ruled by a tyrant for some reason. After the opening scene we spend most of our gameplay trying to explained what happened then and after that. Not much of a plot, but it seems all the story is kinda weak. The voice acting and character building was not very good also.
<br>
<br>2- GAMEPLAY
<br>
<br>But the game is about stealing and stealth, and in that aspect it&apos;s great. We are often confronted with hard sections where it seems impossible to go through without being noticed by the guards. So most of the times I just knock them or put an arrow on their heads. The game is very difficult, and even on normal it was clearly hard for me to go through. Despite that, the AI is bad, with some bugs that I&apos;ve learn to exploit. That does not ruin the fun.
<br>
<br>The game is not open world though, and we have a lot of loading screens between sections. That takes some of the immersion, since some of those could take up to 10 seconds on my laptop.
<br>
<br>The controls are just frustrating, since we never know how to do something. Sometimes we are able to do an action just jumping, others we have to press a determined button...
<br>
<br>The graphics are good, and I have no problems running the game in medium setup, that helps a lot.
<br>
<br>The score mechanism gives the game some replay ability, but I warn that I do not know how can someone go through the game unnoticed. Well, maybe I&apos;m just bad.
<br>
<br>3- CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve enjoyed the game, but I&apos;ve never have that feeling of immersion. I&apos;ve quit before the ending also. The problem was that I was always comparing the game to dishonored, and he always lost. If you are able to ignore the bad story and the loading screens you will have a rather good stealth game where you will love to steal everything. But I&apos;ve noticed the &#x20AC;29.99 price tag, and even knowing that the game is on sale a lot of times, it&apos;s annoying that the producers keep it at so high prices, it&apos;s just unreal and that&apos;s the reason I thumbed it down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=6644647">Expand</a></span>

You can always do this, but the story forces you to places that aren&apos;t interesting, pursuing goals that aren&apos;t interesting either. Some of the levels are fun and expansive, with a lot of goodies to take home with you, and in these moments I genuinely enjoyed the game. It&apos;s very immersive, especially helped by always seeing your hands reach out to do everything. But there&apos;s just a lot of clumsiness in the game&apos;s design that takes you straight out of that.
<br>
<br>Garrett is portrayed as someone who doesn&apos;t kill unless he has to, but gets caught up in a bad situation and has to become an unlikely hero to save a girl and stuff. We know we&apos;ve heard similar stories before. But otherwise the game would just be about a kleptomaniac who really loves shiny objects and the rewards they bring; progressively steals bigger and shinier objects in more difficult circumstances, and eventually steals the biggest and shiniest object in the city and bathes in a pool of money... Actually that sounds *much* better, but it wouldn&apos;t fit the requirements of the &quot;Protagonist Morality Quota&quot; listed under Section 51A of the Videogame Mediocrity Act. The story very quickly turns stupid and incoherent, and I totally lost all interest. Most voice actors speak with an American accent they don&apos;t even attempt to hide, as well as using obnoxious Americanisms in their dialogue, and Garrett speaks almost entirely in cheesy one-liners.
<br>
<br>The game is quite buggy and glitchy; and has terrible, broken sound design. In a cutscene, nondescript NPCs will keep talking to each other, spouting off repeated lines, which play at exactly the same volume as the &quot;important&quot; conversation you&apos;re having with a major character, because Eidos didn&apos;t deem it important enough to cancel out background chatter in a cutscene, and because distance doesn&apos;t factor into the sound design; which is also evident in gameplay. Guards will talk to themselves as you&apos;re sneaking around, and often sound as though they are *right next to you* even though they&apos;re two rooms away. In the city, the same lines are repeated not only much too frequently, but often straight after they&apos;ve just been said, or *at the same time* by a different NPC... I&apos;m not really impressed by the story about Polly Adler, &quot;the sweetest smelling dockfrock in the entire skinmarket&quot;, and I don&apos;t think anyone is impressed enough to hear it 10 times in the space of two minutes (quite literally). But I am impressed by one Guard&apos;s rare vocal ability which he displayed on one retelling of the story, where he somehow managed to talk over himself and begin telling the story again before he&apos;d finished his first rendition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=7463415">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The A.I. is non-existent. They have very narrow field of view, ncps keep repeating the same lines of dialogue over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Houses are empty, levels are horribly designed and very linear with so many loading screens. There&apos;s no point in exploring multiple paths because they all get you to the same place anyway. Why bother going around the long way to get to your objective when you can just open the front door and literally end up in the same exact spot? The game is so incredibly linear that the idea of having different paths is just a joke.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s not forget that atrocious story... what were they even thinking? The plot is very loose and jumbled it makes the TV show LOST seem like it had a much more understandable and interesting story as ironic as it sounds.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s just how BAD it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4123120">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d go as far as saying that it feels like the developers went out of their way to create the coolest Thief ever but missed the genre completely.

Your tools are pretty good too, with ropes that can be deployed to gain high locations, water that can be used to quench light sources and other toys with which to make your way. If you turn off all the aids and guides, the game is even quite immersive. (I turned off everything save the highlighting of interactive objects and the lock-picking U.I.)
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the main story is drivel. It is incredibly contrived and, as a result, there is absolutely no reason to care about it. The city itself makes a rather good sand-box but that is limited and somewhat repetitive so it will not hold your attention for long. The side quests are variable - some of them are fun - but they aren&apos;t rewarding at all because they all end with brief thanks from the quest-giver, nothing more. Fetch item from place for person, person says thanks, rinse, repeat.
<br>
<br>Ending missions and transitioning between map areas both carry a great sense of discontinuity. I frequently abandoned a session after a level transition teleported me to an environment that felt completely different to the one I left, in which I entered the level heading in the opposite direction to my previous heading. After each mission, you are teleported back to your tower, free to set out once more.
<br>
<br>The much lauded options screen does not let you disable objective notifications and this is a major problem. The objective notifications turn the game into a work-to list, continually reminding you what you should do, next. They are redundant and unnecessary and they remove all the fun from working things out. Yes, you may pick up some documents and read them in depth to learn about the place you&apos;ve infiltrated. That is irrelevant - just do what the popup says. Similarly, you can&apos;t disable the obvious and repeated scratch marks below every climbable grate, the puerile bright-white paint splashed on edges up which you may mantle or the glowing blue highlights on ladders and climbable pipes. All of these are a slap in the face to those of us seeking an opportunity to think creatively, they break immersion and, perhaps, they&apos;re sadly necessary because there&apos;s a great deal of geometry you may not climb for no apparent reason. (The levels are all mazes of a few allowed paths.)
<br>
<br>The sound design is also cheap and nasty. Gone are the EAX-powered rooms of yore with echoes and direction and context and ambience. Today&apos;s Thief - a title in a series formerly considered the pinnacle of sound scapes - is played with background music and conversations from disembodied voices. When two characters are talking, one may sound incredibly near and the other be barely audible. The environments are flat. Sounds and volumes give no indication of distance or direction.
<br>
<br>The penultimate nail in Thief&apos;s coffin is the batch of scripted running sequences. They are at once frustratingly difficult - don&apos;t run too slowly, don&apos;t run too fast, don&apos;t deviate from the path, don&apos;t make any mistake, only one option works, everything else kills you instantly - and incredibly boring because of their linearity. They are out of place in a game called Thief, too, where stealth and ingenuity, not speed, should be key.
<br>
<br>Finally, Thief is scuppered by the blatant re-use and cheap duplication of content prevalent throughout the game. Every guard or threat spouts the same lines; even if the accent is varied. Conversations repeat endlessly to the point that one&apos;s driven to turn off the game&apos;s sound. The city is a mass of similar buildings that are so bland and forgettable that navigation requires the mini-map. Even the squeezing-through-hidden-passage sequence that I initially perceived as a clever disguise for an area transition is copied over and over, with the same annoying quick-time-event required to move the same wooden beam out of your way.
<br>
<br>As a footnote, I must also mention the desk fans. Steampunk environments are awesome, yes, but steam powered desk fans are just trying too hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4136737">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game system is very poor, no real challenge at the end. And if a guard see your character, you have to replay that moment again, which is very annoying after a time.
<br>And a stealth game in first person, it&apos;s a bad choice in my opinion.</span>

<br>Don&apos;t waste on your money on this game, it is not worth your time nor is it enjoyable at all. You will be constantly frustrated how bad the AI is, how **** the level design is and how annoying all the bugs and glitches including the horrible audio problems the game has. I wish this game wasn&apos;t so bad, gladly I didn&apos;t pay full price for it either.
<br>
<br>Buy this game if you&apos;re looking for a horrible gaming experience, horrible story, linear gameplay and awful gameplay in general.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m feeling quite generous by giving this game 3 out of 10...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4015710">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was so excited to play this game after seeing the trailer that made it look way better than it actually was. I was disappointed. The game has so many flaws, including the fact that you CAN&apos;T JUMP. You can only jump when there are certain objects, in a certain spot, of a certain height, right in front of you. Also, when you&apos;re standing on a roof or high wooden plank, you can&apos;t fall off. The game does this idiotic thing where Garrett just crouches over the edge and won&apos;t move unless you make him. That takes away any challenge or risk of falling off. It misses the whole point of being up high. The &quot;tips&quot; portion of the loading screen always hints to &quot;search around the city, because you never know what you might find.&quot; Trust me, it&apos;s completely predictable what you&apos;ll find; useless gold coins and cheap cups and silverware that&apos;ll take hours of picking up to actually accumulate enough money to buy something. Also, do NOT get into a fight with the guards. Garrett is unrealistically weak, and you have almost no chance of winning if you&apos;re fighting more than one person without using food that you barely have enough of, because your inventory can only be so small.
<br>The graphics are terrible. We live in 2014!!! They could have easily made the graphics so much clearer. It looks like they just got lazy.
<br>The story line is weak, doesn&apos;t add up, and so many things don&apos;t make sense or are left out. You find yourself thinking &quot;But what happened to ____?&quot; or &quot;What was the point of that entire scene?&quot;
<br>
<br>What I disliked most about the game was probably  the fact that guards can detect you, chase you, CLEARLY SEE where you ran off to, and then forget where you went just a second later. If someone watches you run and hide in a closet, they somehow have no idea where you went, and don&apos;t bother to check anywhere. Also, you can have the entire city after you one second, hide for a minute or two, go back outside, and everyone forgot that anything happened.
<br>
<br>Save your money and wait for an actual game that&apos;s worth what you paid for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4185106">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately, that is the only positive point I can give Thief. For want of a better word, this game is terrible. Starting a game unceremoniously plonks you in a brightly lit room with an unconcious man. Garret mutters something about there being too much light before proceeding to pocket everything that isn&apos;t nailed down (scissors? really? who&apos;s going to buy stolen scissors?) A few handy dandy objective markers later and Garret is being shoe-horned through a window onto a narrow beam. Don&apos;t worry about falling off the beam, kids; our good friends at Squeenix have made that impossible. At the end of the beam is a window into which you will need to jam your trust crowbar in and mash the action button frantically to open. Apparently, this is the only way to open any window in the game, even ones you&apos;ve jimmied open already. Anyway, continuing on leads you to a room full of birdcages and birds, Garrett gently guides you through the process of disabling a tricky painting lock, someone gets noisy on the roof and a roof chase with all the hallmarks of a rickety old ghost ride ensues. Throw in a few cut scenes for good measure.
<br>
<br>Rinse and repeat.
<br>
<br>Thief isn&apos;t so much a game as it a dull, repetitive hidden object game where nothing is really hidden. Everything is scripted and described prior to actual occurrence, so there&apos;s never any threat of having to think for yourselves. Stealth is achieved as long as you don&apos;t do anything so remarkably stupid as to run about in the light, and even then combat is easily evaded so long as you make it to a window. Mario tiptoeing past a sleeping pirhana plant exhibited better stealth mechanics than thief does. Avoid like the plague. Do not waste your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4013955">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s impossible to sneak your way through levels and stick to the shadows since all the levels are designed to cramp your style due to the claustrophobic nature of the places you&apos;ll visit. The game feels clunky and unpolished... I honestly enjoyed playing Rambo more than Thief.  The loading times....just god-awful, every 5 minutes it seems there&apos;s an interruption and voila, you&apos;ll be staring at a progress bar again and again.  There&apos;s no jump button...in 2014, I mean this isn&apos;t zelda ffs, if you are going to make a realistic game with some minor paranormal overtones then why remove a basic trait that all people with two healthy legs can accomplish? If Adam Jensen can jump, then why can&apos;t Garrett?
<br>
<br>The voice acting is ok but at times it&apos;s drowned out by the music OR the characters&apos; conversations get stuck in a loop and you&apos;re forced to listen to the same phrase repeated 20 times in succession. &quot;if they have a cure for the gloom, I&apos;ll put up with the throng to get my hands on it&quot;....Try listening to that repeatedly without getting annoyed.
<br>
<br>All the side-missions are the same, basically you&apos;re looking for a 2X4 that you can latch a rope arrow to which eventually leads to a window you must open with a crowbar and steal the loot. There&apos;s virtually no variation in any of them. Boring as fukk. Also, if I fire 5 fire arrows into an enemy, you&apos;d expect them to go down , dead on the spot. Not the case here, as one blow to the head from a blackjack is more effective than 5 piercing arrows doused in flame.
<br>
<br>The animations are sub-par as well, Garret and the rest of the lot barely make a facial gesture that resembles normal human emotion.... Performance is ok, but it&apos;s disappointing that Mantle wasn&apos;t released for AMD graphics card optimization because it was promised by the developer.
<br>
<br>All in all, you guys should not invest any time in this, just spend more time with your girlfriends instead.

These games have always been a quandary for me as I enjoy stealth games but hate the incessant collecting of loot in RPGs. With this reboot I saw the chance to build on what made the originals tense and addictive, and get rid of the repetitive game play dictated by the restrictions of earlier hardware.
<br>What we end up with is the exact opposite. The minute to minute game play is just as tedious as the previous iterations, but where those had a unique aesthetic, large open levels and great sound design, this has  countless loading screens and truly awful sound that is nearly always useless at letting you know where NPCs are located (more important than visuals in a first person stealth game). The story manages to be bland and ridiculous at the same time (quite a feat) and all the characters are dull.
<br>All that being said, some of the side missions are quite interesting and rewarding to play and at times manage to capture the spirit of earlier titles. These missions could have brought the score to a six if it wasn&apos;t for the last third of the campaign. My god, what a mess.
<br>In the last third you have a new enemy to contend with (I think they are called freaks) that have esp. You cannot sneak up on these creature without them being aware of your presence, and they sense when you use focus which nullifies most of you abilities. The absolute worst crime though, is the inclusion of TWO boss battles. Criminal in a stealth game.
<br>In summing up; Thief is a game that has aped many games, including it&apos;s predecessors, but has learned nothing from any of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4028784">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story - 4/10 - A really awful story in my opinion. Characters are poorly explained and I felt there was simply no narrative to explain what was happening properly. This game has one of the worst story endings I&apos;ve ever encountered. The game had its moments where it looked like the writers figured it out but quickly descended back into banality.
<br>
<br>Game play - 7/10 - Actually not surprisingly too bad in my opinion. Yes, there are a few frustrating design flaws in the game such as the lack of proper jumping (very dumb decision imo) and the annoying repetitiveness of opening windows all the time. But otherwise, when you&apos;re sneaking, this game really is a lot like the other thief games. I found the game play at its worst during some of the &quot;action&quot; scenes - which do not fit the overall game play and feel rather jarring.
<br>
<br>Graphics - 8/10 - I didn&apos;t find the graphics to be the latest or greatest, but none the less they were very pretty. The artwork in the game was very gothic and I felt it was very professional. It&apos;s a shame some of the cutscenes felt very poorly rendered, they never were really impressive like the other thief games (I still get Goosebumps watching the original games cutscenes to this day).
<br>
<br>Sound - 3/10 - Awful. Looping dialogue, broken cutscene audio, terrible voice acting, bad sound propagation. Half the time I had no idea where noises were coming from - a real shambles. Sound is what makes the Thief games so damn impressive after many years - sure the graphics of Thief 1 &amp; 2 have aged but their sound engines are still extraordinary compared to most modern games. You could literally close your eyes and hear when a guard was approaching, you could hear every tile under your feet as you tiptoed around banks and cathedrals. But this new game fails utterly to recapture that feeling. A terrible shame in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Re-playability - 6/10 - I felt the main story of the game was so bad I&apos;d never re-play it again. However the saving grace for this game is the &quot;side missions&quot; that can be played via Basso. Thankfully they don&apos;t seem too bad, in fact I felt they were closer to the spirit of the original games than the main story. It was just a shame there aren&apos;t enough side missions to save this game from the terrible main storyline.
<br>
<br>Overall - based on the five main elements I give this game 28/50 so around 6/10. For me the highlights of this game are the visuals and some of the sneaking game play is fun. But sadly I felt the game was badly let down by a terrible story, unforgivable sound bugs and some very odd design choices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4018658">Expand</a></span>
