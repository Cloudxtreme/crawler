Over the past 12 months i have played most of the new releases and a lot of WOW but as a mature gamer i am anticipating the release of the new MMO Conan game so i thought potbs would be a good stopgap until it arrives. I am largely disappointed in this game. It lags terribly and to say it is an online game the world feels very underpopulated with other players...and thats on a busy sever. The Trading/crafting is quite complex to begin with but as long as you pick up the draughtsman recipes you can progress quite well and make a profit. But make a profit to do what?The swashbuckling/combat i feel is a joke---requiring very little skill and giving you very little control. The only intresting aspects are the naval ship v ship encounters which do require skill and a lot of input and are quite pretty visually. These do get quite boring after you have done a hundred or so---and you wonder whether it is worth all the hassle to get a bigger ship with bigger guns just to engage in the same tedious battles. I am a good judge of games and agree with most of the game rankings on this site BUT please folks by all means try the game for the first free month but you have been warned it is no WOW killer. The other downside is ..because it is an online game-most game shops wont trade it in as a part ex on your next game..so your stuck with it. Hope you have more fun with it than i did---binned after 2 weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-burning-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=410679">Expand</a></span>

As players will find themselves running a gauntlet of endless grinding, game bugs, unbalanced PvP, as well as economic baggage that seem to be intentionally designed to make it impossible for solo players or players who can&apos;t find a good guild to join to obtain decent ships. The most infamous of which is the Lineship Structure Bundle. In addition to all this the developers at Flying Labs Software are less than helpful and tend to ignore player issues. I&apos;ve also seen some documented cases of FLS devs banning players accounts for simply expressing their opinions about how the game is operated and monitored. If you are a player interested in naval combat set in the age of sail I highly recommend you try either East India Company or Empire: Total War as opposed to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-burning-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=85077">Expand</a></span>

For fans of this genre this game is a dream come true, truely if you&apos;re a pirate at heart you will never find a better game theres little doubt of that. But the sword combat is very bad and feels tacked on and underdeveloped. But the ship combat and nation PVP is very cool and engrossing if you find the right server. Population is apparently an issue already. I wish the game the best though because it does fill the niche quite well, just don&apos;t know if there&apos;s enough of a fan base to keep a mmporpg afloat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-burning-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=410134">Expand</a></span>

If you have the patience for a learning curve, are a risk taking adrenaline junky and like the idea of naval combat in the age of sail you have GOT to try this game.

The graphics are fantastically beautiful. The missions are well written and engagine - particularly the career story arch missions. When I play this game, I feel like I&quot;m on vacation in the sunny Caribbean with beautiful skies and sun on my face. Love it.</span>

As one of the biggest and most experienced PvPers in the game, I can tell you tyhat this is the best MMO i have ever played, with a fantastic PvP Risk vs Reward system. Only downside is a fairly low population. Help fix that problem! Trev Macer, Blackbeard british</span>

<br>This game shares the grindfest gameplay model of most MMO`s complete with forced PVP against players many levels higher than you and with no chance of winning.When you lose a forced PVP fight against these higher level people you items and ships which takes days or even weeks of mind numbing grinding to replace. If you enjoy grinding for days or weeks just to able to pvp for 20 or 30 minetes then you`ll love this game.
<br>Finding an opponent to PVP against will take several hours since the game population seems to consist of only hanger on`s who have been playing the game since beta and have invested so much money into the game that they can`t walk away from it.
<br>PVP  and PVE are slow and glitchy.
<br>
<br>customer service is about what you would expect from any F2P MMO, it doesn`t exist.
<br>Bugs and glitches are the norm rather than the exception.
<br>end game content, there is none.
<br>For all intents and purposes this is a dead game that should have been buried long ago.
<br>The only reason the game is still up and running is because the few fanbois that still play it keep  throwing money at it  to keep the  two servers running.
<br>This is just another low budget independent cash cow game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-burning-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=2154530">Expand</a></span>

Not too friendly! There&apos;s enough realism and short-handed realism that you can get immersed in tall ship battles or a rich and complex economic game (crafting is utterly simple, this is no SWG, but figuring out why to craft and how to profit from it, or whether to forgo crafting and specialize in &quot;freetrading&quot; between ports is the key here). As far as atmospherics go, you know where you are from the minute you step out of the tutorial. Colonial ports, scummy pirate dens - and a rather elaborate visual character designer (think CoH/CoV) helps you fit right in or stand right out as you please. I haven&apos;t had firsthand experience with the strategic game yet as it&apos;s just going live today but I&apos;m having fun with the PvE missions, the roleplaying and the ship battles. Can&apos;t wait to see the economy and the PvP game fired up too. This is definitely aimed at an older crowd with functioning attention spans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirates-of-the-burning-sea/user-reviews?user_review_id=408664">Expand</a></span>

One of the very few games where you can run start to run an extremely successful business just a few hours in.  Very good job Flying Labs.  Swordplay needed some work and there should have been more bonuses for being one of the few utilizing obscure ports, giving them actual value.</span>
