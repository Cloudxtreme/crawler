The visuals are breathtaking, the game-play is stellar. It&apos;s an obvious MOBA game like DOTA so people need to cease the fan-boy whining. This at heart is a MOBA game, but they added elements that focus on areas of action and fast paced hot seat reaction. In Vanilla this game is perfectly fine, with a few mods and tweaks out there this has become my favorite MOBA game out there. I played Heroes of Newerth for a long time and LoL even longer. I played DOTA back in around 2004. Now i&apos;m in the DOTA 2 beta. But since this game&apos;s release on steam, the community is climbing and I&apos;ve fallen in love with this hidden gem. Stardock made a game I won&apos;t leave idle for long. They&apos;re still working to fix issues in multi-player. First thing is first though.  Like all MOBA games you need to know how the champs play. There are two kinds, Assassins and Generals. Assassins were designed to hunt down demigods and counter laners. While the Generals have abilities to buff their allies, summon minions from items in shop or their own abilities. This allows them to work as a carry or pusher based on how the character is setup.  The iconic Rook is an assassin and he is similar to Earthshaker in DOTA he makes a great initiate hero and does a damn good job on raining pain with that hammer of his. The multiplayer has a tournament event system that starts every now and again. The AI is a decent challenge that lets you practice your micro and this game is for anyone who has played the hell out of LoL or DOTA and want a MOBA game with more depth and customization. There is a techtree and your Nexus/Citadel that you can use to upgrade your minion waves, hp, armor, weapons and even new creeps. You can upgrade towers, and you can ensure your gold and exp flow is higher then the other team by capping points or upgrading it at citadel. The point capping system allows certain buffs like cooldowns, minion hp or dmg. XP and if a gold mine is present, more gold per second. This game has many many different tactics and with the limited heroes you begin to learn them all very quickly and focus more at hand. The strategy and not learning the ins and outs of hundreds of champions. LoL releases champions out the wall and makes it a pain to enjoy the game with so many heroes. But for those who want more action and less study. Demigod delivers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=2026063">Expand</a></span>

Duplicate game codes during launch week that prevented people from registering to play on-line. Telephone tech support suspended because of the launch of the new title forced you to use slow e-mail support that took days or weeks depending on your issue. Network play was bad and then became horrible after a slew of patches; one made the game constantly crash when you couldn&apos;t connect to other players. Don&apos;t know how many patches they&apos;re up to now (both client and server even though it&apos;s a bad p2p setup) but it seems to be a little better with perhaps a 60% success rate at getting a game going. Users&apos; machines, port forwarding (like almost all UDP!) connections, whatever is being blamed but it&apos;s the network element that is broken. Some people had no issues and then had issues after certain patches. Those with NAT in the EU beware and those in the US with DSL may also run into issues, still. Just check out their forums. Today is ANOTHER patch day! Microsoft has NOTHING compared to them!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=424347">Expand</a></span>

The connection problems continue to plague it over a month after release, so the reviews that panned it for connectivity issues are absolutely right. More importantly, the game lacks content, even in comparison to free custom maps. It suffers performance issues for no apparent reason, as well as CTD bugs and balance issues. It has no meaningful single-player and the multiplayer modes are mostly unenjoyable fluff. There really is no reason to buy this if you have even a passing interest in DoTA or similar maps, because you will find more content there.

If you are new to this style of game, never played DotA, yes, it is fun. It is fun to see highly detailed monsters level up and destroy other monsters. It is fun to watch yourself completely roll over competitors. But keep in mind that this is a VERY simplistic game. Use this only as an introduction to the genre, as it takes everything that made AoS games difficult and cuts it out, leaving only the fatty parts. What does this mean? It means this game will never be competitive. This game will not have the effect of Counter-strike or DotA. What this means is that the multiplayer base will probably die within a year or so. Gameplay 6.0 All issues aside, the game is fun, and is targeted at newcomers to the genre. This game is a great introduction to the genre. But if I were you, I would wait for League of Legends.

Nicely itemized, good leveling up process, very nice graphics even by today&apos;s standards whatever that means. This game is another game that is way ahead of its time and really needed a successor but we all knew that wouldn&apos;t happen because players these days don&apos;t know a good game. Anyhow I thought I&apos;d write this review up in case someone out there agrees with the most of my reviews they might go out and try it, its just too difficult to explain why this game is good, its just got it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=5071095">Expand</a></span>

If you liked dota, then u will surely like this. the heroes are a little unbalanced at the moment but teamwork is key. The pantheon mp mode gives you a reason to play online.</span>

The complaints about net-code and beta-style issues were mostly due to a certain retailer breaking street date, and the release servers not being available yet. I haven&apos;t encountered massive problems with lag or issues finding matches yet. Some tweaks are needed, especially to the UI and the way commands are issued, but it&apos;s generally very straightforward and easy to comprehend. No story to speak of, but Stardock and Gas-Powered Games both focus on game, not story as game, so it works quite well for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423611">Expand</a></span>

Stop being retarded. Outside of that, the game is solid fun, to a degree. You choose one of 8 demigods, either a General (Leader of a small regiment of an army or can go solo) or an Assassin (Like the general, but no army and more focused on killing then reinforcing, also, Assassin makes no sense, Champion or Guardian would of been more appropriate). The graphics are stunningly beautiful and the music score is grand. The levels are cleverly designed and balanced. So you ask, why a 7? The game is riddled with ridiculous bugs and game mechanics. First and foremost, online play is terrifyingly laggy, regardless of connection or system, and it resets favor points AND achievements, making those two systems bugged out the butt (some achievements are tough to get. If you get them in single player and decide to go multiplayer, all your effort goes out the door). The differences between Generals and Assassins are moot, there is no difference besides one can have a small army with them. You can play both sides similarly, which makes no sense. The general should not be able to be solo and do great on his or her own as would an Assassin. Finally, the favor system favors destruction. A few of the demigods aren&apos;t built to be offensive, and playing one hurts you. Such as Sedna, she&apos;s a healer as Oak is more defensive. If you play these characters they way they are designed, you&apos;ll earn enormously less points if you do otherwise, making it unfair or unwise to choose them. These bugs are in the game as of release, supposedly getting patched soon. I suggest waiting for them to do so before purchasing or before going multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423619">Expand</a></span>

If you like RTS and RPG games, but also love the fast paced action of a multiplayer FPS, this is the game for you! There are minor net code bugs involved connectivity with other players, but these should be resolved in the next patch, and the game is still very playable. One nice touch is that if a player leaves or disconnects from your multiplayer game a computer will assume his role, so you are not left with an totally unbalanced game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423490">Expand</a></span>

The problem is the game doesn&apos;t improve nearly enough on it to be a hit. We of course get better graphics (not terribly difficult when you&apos;re competition is a game released in &apos;02), finally have a variety of maps and a better fleshed out skill system. The problem is it lacks in the most key area, heroes. DotA has a LOT of heroes, all a little different and interesting in their own rights and years behind tweaking, balancing and making them fun. Demigod has 8. Now there is a bit more to the demigod heroes than the DotA ones but that&apos;s a huge difference for the main focus of the game. Next demigod has a very basic inventory/equipment system lacking the interesting upgrade paths of DotA. On it&apos;s own rights though it&apos;s not a bad game. I&apos;ve ranked it this low mainly due to value. At $40 USD it quite frankly stinks. Even ignoring how it stands against the basically free DotA map this is nothing more than basic copy of the game with new names and graphic engine. There is nothing innovative here and there is very little content (no single player campaign, just mp matches with bots basically) and the basic mp gaming. How much would I pay? Maybe $20-25 and that would mostly be in the hopes there would be future expansions or patches later to expand the heroe roster. At $40 price point I can&apos;t help but think it&apos;s really going to be hurting the amount of multiplayer matches available at any given time too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423504">Expand</a></span>

The MP issues described by the &apos;professional&apos; reviews have supposedly been fixed with the day 2 patch (I personally haven&apos;t tried MP yet). Judging by the forums, future patches will increase the number of maps and demigods available. If there is one thing Stardock is good at, its post release support.</span>

Lastly, this game is very very addicting.

I&apos;ve never played DOTA having never been too much into warcraft, but I&apos;ve found the game a lot of fun. There are the obvious and oft reiterated caveats, the multiplayer can be more than a little frustrating, and with so much attention paid to getting the multiplayer to work properly, other issues have gone by the waist side...hopefully the back burner is a more apt phrase. I&apos;m wondering if this will pan out as a genre is my biggest concern. When I play, I sometimes wonder if they couldn&apos;t have made it into an action game, either first or third person. You&apos;re reliant on real time actions and control only one avatar on the field. Is the point and click interface really the right one? It seems RTS are the way they are because you have to have control over a lot of troops/units. Whereas this seems to be an action game for people acclimated to the RTS gameplay...perhaps. I&apos;m a little put off by the idea that it&apos;s a strategy game, it&apos;s more of an animated board game with real time responses required. And the notion that it&apos;s an RPG is inappropriate as well. While you level up in game, the number of levels attainable is limited, and those things don&apos;t carry over to the next game (I&apos;m sure that is well understood prior to reading my comments). So deep down I&apos;m not sure what it is or why they did it, but I am having fun playing it. I wonder if it&apos;s genuinely a good game or if the novelty will wear off though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=424321">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a very vocal minority out there with connection issues, and it sucks, but it&apos;s not as bad as many claim. Currently, the major issue is the Crash to Desktop and problematic stat tracking. Overall the game itself is quite fun. I&apos;d like to give the game a better review, but it&apos;s certainly not fixed yet.</span>

As part of a new genre started by DOTA, Demigod really fleshes out every caveat of a RTS/RPG, its deep, innovative, and PERFECT for new comers to the RTS genre. Also with a cheap price $40, and No DRM, a self respecting RTS fan owes it to himself to get in on this fast paced thoughtfully deep game. Thank you GPG and Stardock, this game is great.</span>

It is amazing to LAN, and there isn&apos;t too much lag online. The game looks great and runs smooth. I would honestly give it a 10, but it can be a little tedious to find games that will allow you to actually join online. This is something that stardock is addressing and I do have faith (after seeing sins of a solar empire) that they will remedy these problems. The game is very balanced (Every demigod can be OP if used right), and the promise of free maps/new Demigods, and the fact that players can make their own maps (as it is the Supreme commander engine which many modders are familiar with) promise that the game will stay fresh and deliver new refreshing content. I couldn&apos;t recommend this more if you were a fan of DoTA, or if you just enjoy fast paced RPG/RTS PVP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423441">Expand</a></span>

Demigod is one of the first games that has drawn me to the online world, and I am having a blast with it. For those older, this brings back the days of playing Guantlet. Its actioney, yet very strategic. You have eight different Demigods to choose from. Each has almost two different skill paths to go down. You can mix and match, but for uber damage, you&apos;ll want to specialise. My online experience has been better than most because I play with a &apos;guild&apos;, per say, so its easier to play. People are also knocking the lack of a true single player campaign, yet they said this from the very beginning. It&apos;s also been priced accordingly ($40 msrp at the time of this writing, $10 less than normal releases). And for those who don&apos;t know, Stardock supports their games VERY well. As a matter of fact, head on over to the Demigod forums where Stardocks CEO, Brad (Frogboy) Wardell regularly posts and answers the concerns of the community. Know any other game companies CEO&apos;s who&apos;ll personally answer your questions? No, I don&apos;t know any either. This game is just plain FUN FUN FUN!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423533">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll figure out the networking issues. The bummer is Gamespots 65 and IGNs 50 may scare people away from one of the most unique &amp; creative gameplay experiences I&apos;ve had in a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=80782">Expand</a></span>

How do they expect to have any credibility being so short-sighted and self-serving? The first 3-4 days of a game&apos;s life represents .005% of its life span, yet the reviewers are such noobs that they judge the game only by the startup woes that ANY new game, much less one on a new platform will have. These reviewers need a trip behind the chemical shed. As to Demigod: Great fun, great action, and once the multiplayer settled down after 48 hours it became much easier to get a game and start having fun. The Pantheon is a great idea. There are some balance issues but they&apos;ll be worked out over time. Do yourself a favor and go buy this game. And Gamespot and especially 1up: GROW up. Do you have some reason you want the PC game industry to go away?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423666">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s sad because it brought down the overall rating of what is an absolutely addictive and engaging fresh strategy game. I would give it a 10 but I have to agree with the others that pointed out how helpful a built in tutorial would have been and that having a bit more of a storyline to the single player would have made it more compelling.
<br>
<br>However, when you set that aside, the pure experience of the game is outstanding. Before even getting in to the multi-player side of things, the game is worth the money just for the single player portion. Although their aren&apos;t a lot of maps, for this kind of game play it doesn&apos;t feel limited. No one ever complained that chess only has one board. ;-) 
<br>
You have 8 demigods to choose from and since each is completely different there are 8 very different strategies to explore across 4 different game formats. The nature of the game is one that keeps you wanted to go back and try a different strategy. It is well worth the money if you are looking for an original take on the RTS genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=83588">Expand</a></span>

All these &quot;issues&quot; however are not contributing in me giving this game a low score. This thing has sucked me in. You&apos;ll have a blast whether you play online or single player. A bit more micromanagement would have been great though. Don&apos;t trust all the reviews, give this thing a try, as I&apos;m pretty sure you won&apos;t be disappointed. And what&apos;s with the 1UP review? They clearly gave it a &quot;C&quot;. Isn&apos;t that supposed to be a 70? If a C is 50, what would a &quot;D&quot; and an &quot;F&quot; be Metacritic?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423510">Expand</a></span>

Yes this is a DotA clone; it takes what was great about dota and really built on it while discarding some of what made DotA annoying at times. The &apos;professional&apos; reviewers who rated this under 80/100 are insane; they couldn&apos;t possibly be talking about the same game.</span>

So far we&apos;ve found it to be a fantastic multiplayer experienced. The developers have reported that the major issues with the online play are due to the large number of pirated copies floating around. Approximately 18,000 copies of the game were sold in the first few days, but over 120,000 players were pinging the master servers. Pirated copies can&apos;t actually log on to play online, but they can still slow the servers down considerably. If you liked DoTA, or are a fan of RPG/RTS hybrids, I&apos;d recommend ignoring the critics and giving this game a shot, if you have friends to play with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=423574">Expand</a></span>

This offers a place for newcomers to more easily shine and find each other to battle with. It&apos;s deep, it&apos;s fun and it looks gorgeous.</span>

However, since the price has dropped to $20 I feel it&apos;s worth another look at by the gaming community. Lets be honest: you can do a lot with $20 and video games nowadays if you don&apos;t mind decent indie titles and going through the right channels, so does Demigod stand up to the value? Yes, I believe it does. It&apos;s had a long and bumpy road to get to where it&apos;s at now, and as a game it seems to have been forgotten by the gaming community. It is, however, a fun game! While it lacks variety, each character is balanced and unique and fun to play. It&apos;s easy to sink a couple hours a clip into it, and very fun when you can get a good match up vs some humans. So the pros are thus: Fun game play, and most would agree that it&apos;s a decent looking dota type game at a good value ($20). The cons? No variety with character selection, and an appallingly small selection of maps. Simply, there&apos;s a lot of potential for this game to have &quot;more&quot; going for it. That alone would have made it amazing, if it just had more of what it already has started. The game is fun for what it is, a dota style game, but it just needed more variety! Also, while it pains to say this, it&apos;s a dying game with a small community of players. Might be fun solo against some AI, but you&apos;d really want to get this game with a couple of friends to really enjoy it.<br><br>As a side note, the maps are rather cool looking and not at all traditional, and it is a very pretty dota game. There is a good selection of items to upgrade, and the upgrade trees for each character are all very interesting. On that note, there are several different ways to play a character as well, so there&apos;s no one correct path to always go. You might have your favorites, but if a tactic isn&apos;t working for you there&apos;s always another strategy with your guy you can take advantage of.<br><br>Last words: What it lacks in variety, it makes up for in execution. It was a bumpy road in the beginning, but it seems like a working game now that just needs to be adopted by a caring dev team who want to make it a shining title. Until then, it&apos;s a great value for $20 at the very least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606811">Expand</a></span>

<br>However - the single player is very meh. AI never does anything different and putting 2 ai&apos;s together is guaranteed to result in a infinite stalemate.
<br>And that&apos;s really it for this review.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is all but dead - filled with nothing but elitists and impossible for newbies to get a game going. I played this about a year ago, so I can only imagine it is only more dead now.
<br>
<br>I tried very hard to get a game going - went to the official forums and made a newbie thread and asked for anyone to play with me. Though some said yes, I never heard from them again and they didn&apos;t respond when I contacted them.
<br>
<br>So I went into the online play in-game and joined one of the three games they had going - all were elitist games that didn&apos;t want newbies - I tried anyway because I was sick of single player. Told them up-front that I was new. I was kicked and told to go to another game that was in the lobby - so I did. Then they kicked me and told me to go to the one I was just kicked from.
<br>
<br>Finally I met someone willing to play with me. The most horrible thing happened: The game crashed in the last 3 minutes of the game. It was already a done game - he was attacking my primary base. Somehow the game awarded me the win though - told me that the other guy  lost connection.  I guess there is some glitch that people can take advantage of and do this - because as soon as I contacted him he called me a cheater and refused to talk to me and swore he was done trying to help &quot;fake&quot; newbies.
<br>
<br>I love the lore and the gameplay but since single player mode is bad, and multiplayer is practically unplayable I cannot recommend this game at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/demigod/user-reviews?user_review_id=4254155">Expand</a></span>
