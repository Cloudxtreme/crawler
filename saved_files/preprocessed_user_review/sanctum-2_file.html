<br>
<br>Sanctum 2 is very different from the first. It&apos;s almost entirely different. For one, it&apos;s main focus is just co-op, while the first was both single player AND co-op. This is proven by the different character selections. There are 4 different characters this time around, instead of just one. However, each character has one gun that is locked directly for them (The Assault Rifle, Rocket Launcher, Sniper rifle, and Shotgun are tied to one of the 4 characters). This is very different from the original, because in the original you could pick any 3 weapons no matter what type. This time around your first weapon is locked in, and you can only have one secondary weapon instead of two. You also cannot upgrade any weapons.
<br>
<br>It is also pro co-op in that some enemies have weak spots in their backs (like in the original), except this time around they attack you (and thus, face you). There is literally no way of getting around them to hit them in the weak spot. It was designed so one player would distract them while another attacks, which is not a good thing in single player.
<br>
<br>You can only build 10 towers as well. Now, this isn&apos;t 10 towers per player. You can only build 10 towers per map regardless if it&apos;s one of 4 players. You also do not get resources after every wave like the first. They are dropped down at the core, only only one player can pick them up. So that means if you find a bad player, they may be a resource hog and not let anyone else get anything. I find this to be an extremely poor choice in design on a game that&apos;s meant to be co-op based.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also more boring than the first. The maps are a LOT smaller, and the enemies per-wave are puny compared to the first (Which looked like just a long line of enemies because there were so many).
<br>
<br>However, there is still fun to be had here. Just don&apos;t go into this thinking that it&apos;s going to be Sanctum but with new content, because it&apos;s not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3162546">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You can expect beautiful and detailed map design, leveling up your character unlocking new stuff which is very motivating. One has to come up with new strategies now that enemies can attack you, pulling them to a lightening tower can be quite effective for example :)
<br>
<br>The ressource thing was no issue for us as we just did it round robin style, but I can imagine this being a problem in public games.
<br>
<br>Yeah you can only use 10 towers on a map, but the wave numbers have been reduced too, so I believe they thought this whole thing through, we will see at later levels or when adding perks. It comes down to more coordination, which is a great thing if you play with people you know.
<br>
<br>We all like it a lot so far (only 2 hours in) and I can absolutely recommend to buy it, especially at this low base price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3161469">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s also some improvements that could be made in co-op with the way resources are used and the way we select a game. All in all, I prefer this game to the previous one because enemy are more aware of you, the level system make you feel like you are progressing in the game and the sheer number of gun/tower/perk is pretty awesome IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3161279">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1. Limited towers increases strategic placement.
<br>2. Towers can only be upgraded 3 times, but resources can continually be dumped into level 3 towers to increase their attack power.
<br>3. Having resources only going to 1 person, while on the surface seems bad, avoids the situation in Sanctum 1 where someone has nowhere to put their resources because they aren&apos;t using the same towers as someone else, and can&apos;t contribute to upgrade/building towers.
<br>4. Folks complaining about the FPS vs TD elements are just out of their minds. FINALLY in this game, the FPS element is balanced such that you don&apos;t become a useless &quot;moving tower&quot; in the final waves. You are always able to contribute to what&apos;s going on on the battlefield.
<br>
<br>I could go on, but I know I&apos;m part of the &quot;silent majority&quot; that likes this game for what it is, and find it a large improvement in production value and gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3161261">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sanctum 2 is a game I feel gets more slack than it deserves. People weren&apos;t expecting what it turned out to be and were expecting it to be DLC rather than an actual sequel. I think that this game is perfectly fine. It&apos;s a good, hell, a great game! It still gives me the feeling I&apos;m playing Sanctum and has some improvements that I think are for the best. However, I still am able to see some pretty flaws with the game that do somewhat sour the experience. First, the improved stuff. The gameplay has been changed quite a bit. There is a tower limit, weaker towers, and NPCs. I find this perfectly fine as the game now feels more like the game needs me rather than it could use my help on the rare occasion a sweet spot enemy strolls by. The game kinda has a story now, which is nice because it gives me something to think about as I play. There are new classes, allowing for you to choose your way of fighting, and you can actually die, allowing for you to feel more vulnerable. (E) The resources problem has been fixed with allowing everyone to get materials, improving Co-Op immensly. (E)The tower limit has been improved to 15, a much more manageable number however small it seems. The keyboard controls are a little stupid, considering the originals were much better. That&apos;s all I have to say on the matter and on the whole, I really liked Sanctum 2. It might not be so welcome to others, but I love it!
<br>
<br>In all, the new update raised my score and I think the game is just incredible now. The only parts that kick me is the controls and the lack of a server browser. Besides that, it&apos;s spectacular.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160965">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t played this game for long, but I immediacies knew that this game isn&apos;t very good and was so bad that I have no intention of playing further to see if it gets better..
<br>
<br>For starters, resources aren&apos;t given to each player at the start of a build phase, a box full of them are dropped near the core, meaning whoever gets there first gets all the resources and blocks the towers go on. You can&apos;t upgrade your guns, which I loved about the first one. You also have a limited amount of towers, which is a  idea, since they can barely be upgraded and being able to aim down the sight feels pointless.
<br>
<br>It has a perk and leveling system, something I never felt the original needed, while it might be pretty cool with some nifty unlocks, I never felt like it was something I needed to have. A problem with this is when joining other peoples game, they could be a might higher level than you, or they could be lower than you. This sucks because you can&apos;t just hop into a game and everyone be equal and the results are determined by the players skill and strategy, rather what level they are and what things they have unlocked.
<br>
<br>Pretty much everything about this game that differs from the first I feel is a downgrade. Play Sanctum 1 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160486">Expand</a></span>

This game feels nothing like the original, just a FPS with towers added for kicks and giggles. There is a limit of 10 towers per map, limited number of blocks you can build for your maze (you&apos;ll pretty much never get a decent maze set up because of how limited these are), tower upgrades limited to level 3, no upgradable weapons, and timed build phase which takes out any possible planning. Basically, the devs have ripped apart the TD part of Sanctum 1 and built upon the FPS part. On the positive end, the player progression is a step in the right direction. You get new weapons, towers, and &quot;perks&quot; as you gain levels. There are also new enemy types and bosses. But that doesn&apos;t make up for the atrocities Coffee Stain Studios committed when the tore apart what made Sanctum 1 fun. Sanctum 2, at it&apos;s core, is a FPS horde mode with puny towers to a little bit of dps. Sanctum 1 fans should stay away from this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160498">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-No weapon upgrades (Perk system instead)
<br>-Ridiculously slow reload times (they prompt you to &quot;Switch weapons!&quot;)
<br>-You have to run to the core to collect your resources in between rounds, which are limited.
<br>-Only one person in coop can place towers.
<br>
<br>It feels like a bad version of Halo with some perfunctory tower defenses.  Buy Super Sanctum TD instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160709">Expand</a></span>

So meaning there wasn&apos;t much money involved buying this so I cant base my review on its worth of money.
<br>
<br>So lets start with the gameplay. Its different compared to the first. I like the perk system and I also love the campaign. it requires to think different and place certain towers in a different way where they are most useful. I do hope that the tower limit will go up at some point but haven&apos;t seen it yet. 15 towers max is a bit of a disappointment especially in bigger maps. Also BOSS spawns!! This makes it a whole lotta more interesting and harder. What I do miss is that I need to take a good look how to build.. in sanctum 1 it took me quite some time to actually get the best maze. with sanctum 2 it feels kind of being hinted where to place what.
<br>
<br>The Graphics are &quot;good&quot; as what I would expect from coffee stain studios. Nothing special but nothing bad either.
<br>
<br>I do miss a few things from sanctum 1. So that&apos;s the reason why I give it a 7. If I can upgrade my guns, make slow plates on the ground instead of turrets and place more then 15 towers then yea it would get an 8 or a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843773">Expand</a></span>

The original Sanctum was a great change of pace for tower defense games, putting you into the battlefield with upgradable weapons (a tower defense with shooting). Sanctum 2 takes the original&apos;s premise too far in the opposite direction in terms of game balance. Sadly, all the towers are too weak and this has become a first person shooter with towers. With very limited resources and base blocks, you will be building or upgrading on average one tower per wave with mazes only becoming effective near the end of the map. Even when you do finally make a great maze that is somewhat defensible, many of the bosses can smash their way through your base blocks, destroying your towers and creating a free path for enemies. The worst part is the difficulty curve; the early levels are tutorial-esque cakewalks which quickly drop off into frustrating trial-and-error tests of endurance.
<br>
<br>The map design has improved significantly, including 16 levels with improved music and sound providing great atmosphere. While the drawn slideshow cutscenes are entertaining and provide some pretense for the missions, the story and characters are never really fleshed out. Sanctum 2 combines sub-par FPS elements with sub-par RPG elements and sub-par TD elements to create... a surprisingly mediocre game. This could&apos;ve been a fantastic co-op game if they just built on the original&apos;s game design instead of going for the CoD/console audience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255321">Expand</a></span>

I see a lot of people complaining about the differences between Sanctum 1 and Sanctum 2. I&apos;ve played both of them, as well as Super Sanctum TD, and I have enjoyed all of them. I&apos;m not going to argue with people who complain the game isn&apos;t exactly like the first one, as that is a legitimate concern. Imagine playing Halo 1 and 2, but instead you get Halo 3: ODST. I can understand that. But at the same time, if that does happen, take the new game on it&apos;s own freaking merits. I wouldn&apos;t give ODST a 0 because it&apos;s not like 1 and 2. I&apos;d rate it on it&apos;s own. Rating a game on it&apos;s predecessors is okay, but at the same time, to weight the whole score on them is a mistake. Be comparative, but don&apos;t be unfair.
<br>
<br>Sanctum 2 is, even when compared to its previous installment, a great game. It&apos;s a lot of fun, just like Sanctum 1. There are a lot of changes, so I&apos;d suggest a little personal research before making your final decision if you are a veteran of the first one, as they are quite extensive, but not necessarily bad. Some features were taken out and some more were added. But I would still recommend checking it out in any case. It takes a genre I am not that great at (TD) and adds in aspects of something I am good at (FPS), and allows me to supplement the TD aspects with my FPS capabilities, and in the process, produces a nice, but not impossible challenge, and a lot of fun. If possible, I would also suggest getting the DLC as well. One of the few games I would ever recommend getting DLC for.
<br>
<br>Also, a lot of the reviews from people on here seem to contain false information, such as resource amounts, tower caps, multiplayer experiences and so on, as if they played the tutorial level and nothing else. Not saying they are all wrong, but I&apos;ve seen quite a few negative reviews with numbers and info I know to be absolutely wrong from playing constantly with friends recently.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3973221">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think that very cool game: it&apos;s have good graphics, well story, single player and perfect multiplayer. And what else is needed for a good game?

You can play 4 characters (with the 4&#x20AC; DLC 5) and a lot of maps. The only negative thing is the Matchmaking, somtimes you have a very bad Ping.</span>

They were obviously hooked on the original (which was an awesome game)  and expected more of the same. YES, THIS GAME IS DIFFERENT. However, the developers capitalized on many of the unique features that made the first one great. While there is more FPS qualities in this game, the people who dislike that seem to forget that about 70-80% of all kill and damage are still attributed to towers. While the character&apos;s shooting plays a crucial role in surviving each wave, the towers and strategy are equally if not more important. IF YOU WANT A TOWER DEFENSE GAME, THEN GO AND BUY ONE. This game is a tower-defense, first-person shooter HYBRID. To me, it feels even more balanced than the original game. Additionally, the developers have fixed many of the issues that users didn&apos;t like, including expanding the tower cap to 15 and removing the location-based resource drops. This game loses one point because some of the bosses are a little overpowered, and some can even destroy your defenses. However, I loved this game, and it is totally worth buying. (Pro tip: if you turn the gamma way up, the colors become much more vivid and the whole thing looks awesome).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965373">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Seems like a lot of people who think it sucks just wanted an updated Sanctum 1 and didn&apos;t bother to look into the game before buying it. The resources and tower limit were both known about before release. You now have to think more about the placement of your towers and when to upgrade them. I agree the resources only going to one person is something that needs to be changed.
<br>
<br>Would probably give this an 8-9, but giving it a 10 just to offset some of the people that somehow think Sanctum 2 is now a CoD clone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3161826">Expand</a></span>

I know a lot of people might say OMG AAA GAMES BUT THIS IS INDIE!!!! but that&apos;s not the point, the point is the game is bad compared to sanctum 1. I have never played Co-Op (Single Player seems impossible on easy) but i feel co-op player would miss out on certain weapons due to class restrictions (New to Sanctum).  If your fine with Shooing with buddies, this game might be something to look at. If you want TD and a shooter though, look to sanctum 1 because this does not deliver that.

I felt Sanctum 2 was a big let down in this hybrid fps-tower genere.  THE   resources weren&apos;t shared.  This led to just throw a hissy fit, on Facebook,-embarrassingly i know.   I was shouting to the heavens what have you done with my beloved sanctum  foolish developers.   Then the patch came out and fixed a lot of the big issues i had with a problem with granted there are several glaring issues, perhaps to cater to people less new to the Sanctum, which isn&apos;t an excuse people have intelligence, I would suggest to look at what made sanctum a good game .
<br>
<br>Here are the current flaws i have with it, to many guns have bad recoil, tone it down a bit.
<br>Two weapon limit cap, i want more options not less in this kind of game.   I want to be able to play with my options, I find this inexcusable, for the pc version.
<br>Small map designs,  smaller map hud.
<br>My biggest one is of course finding people  i wish either a we can find a lobby listing the amount of people in the game or joining a game with a lot of people   This is for me what make sanctum shine
<br>
<br>The pros
<br>Variety of weapons to chose from
<br>Class and level up system (pro or con depending on where you stand on this )
<br>You actually get to fight enemies, here is the thing me and my good friend from san fran abused the crap out of the towers, the floor tiles- everything.   However, we felt empty inside because we couldn&apos;t fire any bullets  because the towers had killed them for us.  Also at one point our weapons just became useless,  so we had to rely on the towers towards late game anyways.
<br>
<br>15 tower cap limit, which i find adds for more strategic placement vs, random placement
<br>more variety of  aliens to fondle, with your guns :0
<br>You can actually die-yay for ze deaths
<br>
<br>In short if you can look past these flaws then  sanctum may be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169680">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For first, I&apos;m not a big fan of TD, just because I&apos;m pretty bad with strategies. I&apos;ve been not very happy then one my friend decided to gift me first Sanctum to play together. Still, I don&apos;t really regret his decision  after just a few hours of him building and me shooting, I found that Sanctum is actually a pretty lot of fun. I have nice memories about time I spend on that game in company with my friend.
<br>
<br>And then, for all the sudden, while we waited, first news about Sanctum 2 showed up! I&apos;ve got not much wonders about what it can become, but I&apos;ve been sure that I gonna take a loot of good time with my friend again, playing the new game. I was wrong.
<br>
<br>The thing here, I think I&apos;m now even more a fan of Sanctum 2 than my friend. This game became so amazing, I didn&apos;t even expected that. Even if there&apos;s no more slow field or towers that increases the power of every shot that goes through(I mean the ones that increases power of even players shots, they did amazing work in previous game), if I can&apos;t power up weapons anymore, it became the coolest thing I ever saw. New tower system are much easier for me to understand, new leveling system endlessly pushes me forward to get new perks, weapons and towers, while if I play with my friend, we can actually talk about tactics much more now, like  what tower any of us going to take, what positions we must choose to shoot off enemies and how we gonna make the maze to apply maximum possible damage on enemies.
<br>
<br>That thing became so awesome, and if I didn&apos;t finished it already, I still amazed and wonders what awaits me on the next stage. Storyline showed awesomely as well  it&apos;s the best way to show what happens between fight, giving the player pages of greatly made comics. Only thing that it&apos;s can be kinda boring or not too funny to team up with random peoples... but it&apos;s actually doesn&apos;t makes a lot of problems for me as long as I have someone to play with.
<br>
<br>Nicely done, Coffee Stain Studio. Can&apos;t wait for DLCs already.
<br>
<br>Oh, and little notice for peoples complaining about Sanctum 2. Someone already pointed at it  it&apos;s completely different game. It&apos;s not original Sanctum, it&apos;s not even close and it shouldn&apos;t. Because this difference, all the changes in balance are actually the thing that must be here. It&apos;s fine to play both alone and with your friend, even 4 towers is more than enough to make a good defence line, if you know what to do. So please, don&apos;t tell things like &quot;New Sanctum is the bad game&quot;. It&apos;s a great game, there&apos;s just actually no good way to make everyone happy then not everyone happy with some changes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203682">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics are phenomenal.  Beautiful.  Impressive environments.  Lots of secrets that make it satisfying for me.
<br>
<br>Combat is satisfying and the creatures&apos; ability to fight back seems to be a nice change to the game (IMO).
<br>
<br>Nice variety of towers.  Nice effects from them as well.  Maps have a big variety as well.
<br>
<br>Biggest negative is that I don&apos;t know how replayable the game will be after you&apos;ve beaten everything.  So far, however, I&apos;ve loved it for the majority of the time.  Some maps are dreadful  mostly maps that do not allow you to maze; though most maps do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188093">Expand</a></span>

I had no intention of playing the game in that state and it was no fun to me at all hence the low score.
<br>
<br>However since the recent outcry from many of the fans the devs have actually listened (this is unusual these days with most devs and does command a lot of respect) and made changes improving the game and are looking towards making future changes in support of their product. With the new shared resources (this was a major issue before) and increase in towers the game is moving in the right direction and becoming a much better game for it. As such I am submitting this new score based on where I see the game going, I still do not believe it will be the best TD out there and will appeal more for its fps side (hopefully the devs will prove me wrong) but it is certainly not the waste of money it was in its initial form and is becoming much more enjoyable to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160658">Expand</a></span>

They all but told one customer that posted about this to go play Sanctum 1 instead and then they did some quick patches which really doesn&apos;t fix the issue to try to defuse the issue. So if you are looking for a td/fps this is not the game for you because the td elements have been greatly reduced and if your looking for fps/td then this also may not be the game for you because the fps elements are very basic. There is not even a health bar and you cannot do things like upgrade or mod your weapons. Sadly the game doesn&apos;t know what it wants to be and tries to be all things, but ends up not being all that good. Finally, its a bit of a unbalanced mess on some maps they give you an excess of blocks to place, more than you can ever use, but not enough turrets, which makes no sense and on some maps they don&apos;t give you enough blocks to use, not even 25% of what you need, and because the map is so large the fix number of turrets just cant cover the map, so it becomes a nightmare. If  you want a great td/shooter try Sanctum 1 or even games like Dungeon Defenders and Orcs Must Die 2, but not this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160920">Expand</a></span>

Sanctum 2 feels primarily FPS with a torn up tower defense thrown ontop, despite the fact guns are no longer upgradable which was a feature I enjoyed in the first
<br>
<br>Sanctum 1 allowed for an enjoyable Co-op and Single player experience, where as Sanctum 2 feels like it&apos;s forced to be played Co-op as enemies will try to attack you, some with weak spots on their back turning to attack you, making it hard to do damage. It seems it was made for one to distract and the other to shoot the weakspots. Then again Co-op it&apos;s self is rather hindered, since Sanctum 2 offers  rather limit resources so often players in the game may have conflicting maze designs or tower placements, so sometimes you have to allocate who gets what each round. Sanctum 2 is also setup for griefing, you could get a player that just hogs everything then refuse to build etc.
<br>
<br>Also Sanctum 2 has torn up the tower defense side of things, by adding some rounds with timers. I understand that it makes players think fast, but in a game that boasts to be tower defense, allowing time for players to plan their mazes etc is a part of that. By adding limit resources and tower limits most of the time you are unable to get a decent maze going along with the fact there is a 10 tower limit and towers no longer upgrade to level 5, but instead 3.
<br>
<br>Sanctum 2 is not a bad game by all means, I think it just has missed some of the magic the first had. If you&apos;re a huge fan of the first, then you may want to give it a miss or pick it up on steam sale. If you&apos;re a first time Sanctum player, give it a crack you may enjoy it.
<br>
<br>But that is just my opinion, take it as a grain of salt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3163053">Expand</a></span>

I pre ordered Sanctum 2.. and even bought Sanctum 1 to support the devs (and to satisfy my new addiction for 1 more day until Sanctum 2).
<br>
<br>Now I&apos;m greeted by this... Nothing like Sanctum 1.. the game I fell in love with just a few days ago... the amazing game that was used as false advertising to lure me into paying for Sanctum 2.
<br>
<br>Like I said I&apos;ve only got 12 hours logged so I&apos;m sure there are other fans that can go into better detail.. and I haven&apos;t even logged an hour into Sanctum 2 yet because I was so disappointed.. so maybe I missed some things but here&apos;s my thoughts on it:
<br>
<br>* Having to run back to the core to get resources every round is absolutely unnecessary and unfun.
<br>
<br>* Having to RACE the other players in multiplayer to get resources is unfun and creates a terrible social atmosphere.
<br>
<br>* Having a separate pool for nodes and turrets discourages mazing and kills the strategy portion of the game
<br>
<br>* Having a round-start timer makes me feel pressured, and lessens strategy involved.
<br>
<br>* The turret limit is WAYY too low and just kills the tower defence part of this game. Some players like to focus on upgrading a few towers, some players prefer to spam low-medium level towers.. You&apos;re limiting play styles and that&apos;s never good.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more but as I said I haven&apos;t played much.. too discouraged.. This game is a failure in game design... but brilliant in it&apos;s marketing of getting me hooked on the first game and then giving us this sequel.
<br>
<br>I hope the developers fix what&apos;s needed to make this the amazing sequel that it could be but right now I&apos;ll be requesting a refund on the basis that the free weekend was false advertising.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160831">Expand</a></span>

This game holds nothing true to the original sanctum.... they took all that was good and destroyed it. It feels terrible to control and is sloppy in execution. Looks pretty, but the size of the towers, behavior of the enemies, and performance of the weapons, is just terrible. DO NOT BUY IF YOU LIKE SANCTUM 1!!</span>

Yes, the graphics are better and it is nice to have a selection of &quot;classes&quot; to choose from between the characters. I also like how you can see over the walls and you don&apos;t get trapped in the maze you make but can easily vault over the blocks or shoot over them. I also like the idea of the perks (even if a lot of them are useless).  But other than that I do not see much that was better than the first game and many things are actually worse.
<br>
<br>For one, you are limited to 10 towers in all the levels I have played, which is a far cry from the first in which you were limited only by your design.
<br>
<br>You can&apos;t ever swap your primary weapon. Like the look of your toon and like their ability? Too bad, you are stuck with their primary weapon. But you can change the secondary as you unlock them, which is nice. Oh, and no weapon upgrades of any sort either. That was removed as well.
<br>
<br>Only 1 person can pick up the tower blocks or money. Let me tell you how much of a bad idea this is for playing PUG on multiplayer. Hell, it is a pain sometimes when you are with your friends. I can&apos;t fathom the reason for this change as if you aren&apos;t the person who picks up the resources you just sit there and get bored while they plot it out without you. I can&apos;t stress enough of how much this is a terrible idea because it takes 75% of the team out of the building phase to do nothing more than twiddle thumbs.
<br>
<br>The levels are EASY and there are far fewer mobs than in any of the previous game&apos;s levels. There are some waves that are challenging, but then you get two or three waves of 2 soakers (which as the name implies are nothing more than bullet sponges) or a handful of mobs. *yawn*
<br>
<br>You are also limited in the number of blocks you can put down, starting with maybe 4-10 in the first wave and then a handful every wave after. The maps also seem smaller, but that could just be me.
<br>
<br>I see where they were going with this and I get that they wanted to make this more of a shooter, but that is not what made the first Sanctum so special and fun. The FPS gameplay is not fun enough to have the majority of the mechanics lean on it, and taking away the very thing that made it a tower defense game. Now it is more like a second-rate FPS with some turrets you can place. Really disappointing and all it did was make me want to buy and play the first one again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3162773">Expand</a></span>

I still think Sanctum 2 is a step up from Sanctum. At Sanctum 2&apos;s release, they did have many issues. Co-op really sucked, and still does. The towers are limited, taking away much of the TDF aspect of the game. The story is kinda weak and necessary. The characters aren&apos;t necessary, but do add a nice touch to the game. And the FPS part is, and always have been better. I don&apos;t know why I like Sanctum 2 better than Sanctum. I just do. It IS more of an FPS than a TDF now, but that&apos;s still no real reason to hate it. It is fun. Though, I do recommend you play Sanctum before Sanctum 2. Just so you can experience it like most other people did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203209">Expand</a></span>

As a plyer of the first sanctum (to me the greatest tower deffense game ever besides vectoid td), I hate this game. As a game of its own however it is ok.
<br>The reasons why i hate it are the same reasons why i think its ok for a new gamer to the series or to td games. These reasons can be summed up to LIMITATIONS. The first game had very few limitations and a very simple stlye of play and this game has the opposite. Now you die first off which makes trying to stop a horde  hard as  (tourettes guy quote), the limit on towers is facking otrocious, enemies now hit you and you take damage and chase after you which is retarded, you can&apos;t upgrade your guns, you now have to pick up the recources instead of getting them, your limited to how many of the bases you can place a wave, your credits are severly lowered, the maps are small and  the control feels so stiff and akward, and overall its not pleasant to shooty your guns with such a kick back, enemies are even stronger and there weakpoints are severly hard to hit, and the game to me is just a total  up compared to the predecessor.
<br>
<br>Some of the things are coll like the new bases which alo you to do dignal designs which would be awesome if sanctum 2 was like sanctum 1. The guns look nicer, again would be better if sanctum 2 was like the first game, the graphics are nice as hell wich again if 2 was like 1 would be better, and the idea of pers was a great additon which would have worked wonderfully if the game was more like the first sanctum, but sadly it is not.
<br>
<br>For sanctum players i would say get this when it goes on salke dont waste the 15 because if your like me youll just be oissed of because your expectations wont be met, for new players i would say if you got dispensable money and want a mediocre sequal to an amazing game then waste it, but i think far cry 3 blood dragon is a way better deal and HOLY HELL IS IT  AWESOME. Overall it sucks but isnt un playable but santum one lpayers just buy the dlc and say no to this till its on sale for a dollar which wont be long with the way this is going.
<br>
<br>Also i add this as a big  you to pc devs who decide to go to console to make a profit instead of catering to those who built you up. Cofdfestain it isnt cool what you did  You destroyed your baby and made a horrible sequal and tailored it to consoles so that you can make a buck and look what happens the game blows. Your as bad as slender the arrival, or the new sim city. Ok im sorry your game isnt that bad but still thats where your headed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3162089">Expand</a></span>

<br>Check the demo and (or) watch some youtube review/ let&apos;s play... it totally worth the money, ignore any review with a score below 6 because they are bull****.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168810">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t read the critics reviews.  They will never give a negative review  unless everyone else is also.  They are a pack of social hangers on  just like the jocks and cheer leaders in school.  They will laugh at all of the same jokes  and snub anyone that threatens their chances of getting into the &quot;inner circle&quot;.  THEY CAN&apos;T BE TRUSTED.
<br>
<br>Trust the actual players.  The reviews are in.  Solidly mixed with an equal number of &quot;HATE IT&quot; versus &quot;LOVE IT&quot; scores.  Do you see that in the Critic scores?  NO!
<br>
<br>Okay, back to my review.  If you *LOVED* the original  you will *HATE* this bastardized sequel.  Trust me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3306304">Expand</a></span>

Whereas the first game had a limitless time to plan out defenses and limitless combination, this one has a timed (short) building phase, a limit of 10 towers, and the resources, well that&apos;s the real kicker.
<br>
<br>In the first game, resources were awarded to everyone automatically at the end of a round, beginning of a build phase.  So, you just worked your butt off killing of this invasion, now you can immediately take the time to start planning out for the next wave.  That was Sanctum 1.  In part 2, you now have to return to the &quot;Core&quot; (which isn&apos;t exactly close all the time, oh yeah, and there is no more teleportation to make it fast), then collect the resources.  Does everyone get to in co-op mode?  Nope, just 1 person.  So you get 1 gopher and several people that do nothing but play an FPS.  There is no tower defense portion of the game to them at all.
<br>
<br>They sacrificed an amazing game so they could port this one to consoles, it seems.  Gone are almost all of the elements that made the first so unique:  teleportation, limitless planning/building phases, resources for all, and a great balance of just about 50/50 TD/FPS.  Now, it is 10/90, with a very heavy emphasis on FPS.  Even worse, now you can no longer upgrade your weapons, they &quot;reload&quot; at a much more annoying rate, and they are all pretty much new weapons from the ground up.
<br>
<br>Do yourself a favor and play the first Sanctum.  It truly was a unique experience that should be enjoyed by all.  I grabbed it after Steam had it for free for the weekend.  It impressed me so much that I hurriedly preordered Sanctum 2.  I wish I hadn&apos;t done that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3161777">Expand</a></span>

Not only is the TD aspect messed up badly, the game is like a bad port of a console title with the server list gone from the original and now all the multiplayer done via a simplified matchmaking list. It is clear the devs no longer care about the fans that put them where they are today. Do yourself a favor...tell them no by not buying this tripe. This game has no longevity compared to the original. Once you beat it, you&apos;ll never want to play it again.

<br>I feel bad for the console players who will be facing this horror. Coffee Stain...the good days are over, it is time they got bought up by EA and appropriately mothballed forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3161746">Expand</a></span>

<br>The devs saw fit to create a very poor FPS game with watered down tower defence elements. Amongst the problems you have a limit of 10 towers max per map, resources that aren&apos;t shared amongst players and open to ninjas on mp games, towers that do pitiful damage, short matches with small waves and timers on some of the build phases (no pause now).
<br>
<br>The reviewer from IGN who wrote that this improves on sanctum 1 in every way needs to be fired because it could not be further from the truth.
<br>
<br>The only reason I gave this a 3 is because of the few steps they do take in the right direction such as new characters, perks and graphics. The rest of the game is a major downgrade from its predecessor.&quot;

<br>
<br>Sanctum 1 was great. You could specialize in mazeing and tower defenses, in weaponry and build support towers to maximize your damage output, or a combination of the two. Upgradable weapons, towers, support stuff. The maps were big enough for the player to build a huge variety of mazes.
<br>
<br>Sanctum 2 is ultra horrible. You don&apos;t really have a lot of options when it comes to mazeing because the building arenas are very very small. I cannot stress how small the maps are. In fact, they are so small, they have to limit the number of rounds to 6-7 because by then, you could basically fill in the entire building area. The only mazes you can build are linear ones; left to right or up to down, and by no means are they considered complex. Weapons are no longer upgradable. Buildings can only reach level 3. There are no more slowing fields or amplifying fields. The number of buildable towers has dropped to like 3.
<br>
<br>The one thing that&apos;s different is that the monsters will now chase the players; However, you can abuse this and just kite the monsters around offensive towers. In fact, it&apos;s best not to maze at all. I focused on building a trap with a high dps killzone instead of a maze and trying to shoot them.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t waste your money on this game. The developers are just trying to make money off the fans of Sanctum I.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3163069">Expand</a></span>

What was brandished as a TD/FPS hybrid game, is now really just a FPS game with a few drones. There is no passive strategy, just mindless shooting at hordes. If you wanted something like that, you might as well play left 4 dead 2. A TD game *must* incorporate passive strategy at its core or else it&apos;s not. I was not entirely pleased with Sanctum 1 to begin with seeing how much they valued the FPS aspect, Sanctum 2 just confirms my displeasure.
<br>
<br>I orginally stayed away from titles like Orcs Must Die because I really do prefer cleaner and sleeker graphics, but if there&apos;s nothing else out there that resembles a decent TD or TD/FPS, they may as well take my business, too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4129773">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Character choices, cartoons and the fun graphics have clearly had a lot of work which are nice touches.
<br>
<br>However after playing for several hours my friends and I decided we would put this one on the shelf and dust down the original.
<br>
<br>On the plus side the original Sanctum is now cheaper than ever.</span>

What the first Sanctum lacked is made up for in this new sequel. The story can be played solo or in a 4 player co-op mode. However, you will not find yourself getting to far without some friends. Within the game you can choose up to 4 different characters and each character has a unique primary weapon (assault rifle, rocket launcher, sniper rifle and shotgun). Each primary weapon also has a secondary function. Ex. The Rocket Launcher can be fired in single fire or it can lock on 3 times and launch a barrage of missiles on the enemies. The use of these secondary functions can save your ass. Also, each player can have access to one secondary weapon and as you level up you unlock more. Each character also has the ability to hold a certain amount of towers so it is key to choose towers that are most effective together. As you level up you have access to more tower slots. Finally, you have your perks. Each perk does something different for example: If you land on an enemy you do 4000 damage. As you continue to level you unlock more perks and perk slots.
<br>
<br>This is a great improvement from the original sanctum and gives you a lot more variety throughout the game. Enemies are not moronic now and will not ignore you. If you are in their way they will move you so be wary. Some of the levels within the game can be beaten in single player however I strongly recommend you play in a group since you will most likely will not be able to get through every level on your own. Once again, this game focuses a lot on co-op so for those of you who like to do things solo...well sorry.
<br>
<br>Whilst the game is fun there are not many big parties out there to find so it is best you find some people to get on with. I find this frustrating for every time I go to find a match it will just throw me in a random game with 1 person who hasn&apos;t this slightest clue what he is doing. Another downside to this game is that you are only limited to 15 towers on the maps. With the size of some of the maps that is really not a lot. Especially if the enemies are coming from 2 or 3 directions. Also, the amount of funds and walls you get after each wave is not nearly enough to have any affect on the enemy waves. What does make up for this game is the FPS aspect and the load set builds. You will not find yourself just standing around as your towers decimate enemies. You will always be upfront blowing some weird alien into a million pieces. This makes the frustration seem just a little better.
<br>
<br>Overall I think this is a great game to play and experience for both the FPS and the strategy aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3196611">Expand</a></span>

Fans of the original lost some of the detail with map building and customization but I am hoping that future installments will again expand on this aspect of the game.  There is a lot of game here though and you will get deep into it trying to find the optimum floorplan/character loadout to complete challenges.  I have just as much fun playing solo as multiplayer, not sure what people are complaining about here.  As far as I know you can complete all the maps solo if you are good enough and have unlocked the top tier stuff.  I was able to solo all of the original game content so far.  There is plenty of replayability with higher difficulty settings and survival mode.  Sanctum 2 is a lot of fun and if you pass it up you&apos;ll be missing out on some of the best gaming to be had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3896438">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Moving away from immediately having access to most weapons and all towers you now must unlock them, which means you now have limited tactics available at certain stages and the game feels poorer for it. Still if  a fan of the first worth a look.</span>

Instead of passively watching your towers do all the dirty work, you are allowed descend into the action and distribute carnage alongside them. Both games execute this concept almost flawlessly, however Sanctum 2 has far more content than its small-scale predecessor. This is the fully featured, fully realized game this series needed, and offers lots of content to enjoy whether you&#x2019;re a strategy fan first and shooter fan second, or vice versa. With 16 levels, 8 weapons, and 4 different character classes to choose from, there is a lot more to do right out of the box compare to the first title. with additional DLC being announced and there&#x2019;s a Season Pass available that gets you all the future expansion packs at a reduced price.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer has been completely overhauled as well. It is now easier to drop in or out of multiplayer matches, and you can now specify who exactly is allowed to join your ongoing game. It also scales rather nicely, with each additional player adding even more resources to the pool but also increasing the overall challenge. This way, the game&#x2019;s difficulty is well-balanced. There is an easy mode, but it skews the game balance a little too much in your favor and is not entirely recommended.
<br>
<br>Resources have also received a sort of overhaul. The game sort of just drops a set amount of supply for you to utilize, breaking up barricades and towers into separate categories. Credits, however are no longer a shared currency required for building barricades and towers. Instead you just get a certain amount of tower credits, and a certain allotment of barricades at the end of each round. Although  It may not seem like that much, but taking away  the decision of spending money on barricades really does make the game better, as you&#x2019;re free to spend more thought on strategy instead of playing accountant on the battlefield. This is also mainly because on the field, weapon upgrades have been given the boot. In the first Sanctum you had towers, barricades, and weapon upgrades that you had to spend credits on. All of these things operated on the same currency, meaning that you could spend wrong and die. This would happen often. Though the field upgrades are gone,  you can still tweak and improve your weapons through the smart use of loadout perks that can affect the behavior and damage of your guns. These perks however can also affect yourself, or your towers; but with the removal of upgrades, it would be smart to use the perk slots for more offensive purposes.
<br>
<br>Other improvements in the game are minor tweaks and additions that keep things refreshing and new in smart ways. You&#x2019;ve got AI squad buddies that will assist you now. While they can take about as much damage as a dandelion, they still try. Weapon damages are tweaked, enemy damage values and health have been tweaked. Bosses have been added and maps are varied and consistently intelligently challenging. To top it all off, the game looks gorgeous and is really brought to life by its high gloss neon art style. A style that has clearly taken cues from &#x2019;80s futurism, and the Anime from that era.
<br>
<br>Sanctum 2 is a brilliant representation of a game that was developed with an open ear. When Sanctum was released in 2011, it was a great idea that wasn&#x2019;t without flaws in the structure of its design. Here, Coffee Stain Studios have taken the time to improve upon every flaw, and produced an indie gem polished in the fire of scrutiny. While Sanctum 2 is still a challenging game, it&#x2019;s tough in smart substantive ways that add up. Opting for this instead of the punitive approach that Sanctum was built on has made for a far superior product in the form of Sanctum 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3322558">Expand</a></span>

Unlike the original, which had a nice balance of TD and FPS that lent a bit more to the TD side, where you could make great mazes and if done well, not even touch your trigger, I found many of the maps had very small buildable areas and lots of open space that was unusable, making your towers only a small distraction, and mazes too short too be of use. I find that the weakspots are not as obvious and are harder to hit than the original, and some of the enemy&apos;s  (Floater) attacks were overpowered or kept you out of range. I haven&apos;t played much multiplayer, but from what I have played it seems pretty normal, but from what I have read, the resource pickups are a bit annoying, especially if playing with people you don&apos;t know/trolls who can sit at the core, not helping, and taking all of the resources.
<br>Back to the FPS part of the game, unlike the previous in which you could upgrade your weapon range, ammo, damage and abilitys, Sanctum 2 relys on choosing completely different guns that do not progress through the round as the waves get harder. I like to use the rex and tesla, but I cant use my rex against swarms of flying enemys with 6 individual flak missiles, I have to hope that my 3 and the very small amount of towers can destroy them. That also leads me into the fact you can only have 2 weapons on you, and you can only choose the second one, which is only a sidearm (Unless you change class, which is annoying, what if I want a rex and double jumps?) I find that the armored enemys are a bit strong, but have found how to deal with them, but for new players they may be very hard to defeat, and the floater&apos;s shockwave thing makes it very difficult to hit it&apos;s weakspot, and impossible with short range weapons such as the shotgun. Unlike in 1, you can no longer get ingame info about the enemys, such as speed, description and weakspot, which is no good at all. Now when you die you have to wait an obscene amount of time to respawn (A full ten seconds), while many games get respawn times right (Going up as you get better) and even when you do manage to respawn, the lack of televators means you have to run from the spawn to the enemys and lose even more time, and if you were fighting off some enemys on one side of the map and some start getting to the core from somewhere else, you cant teleport to the closet televator, you have to hope that your legs are fast enough and your stamina is high enough to get you there before you lose. The game is more Co-Op centered, despite the rescource problem, as some of the enemys have weakspots on their backs, but they turn around to fight you, thus protecting their back, so that you need another player as a distraction. There is a 15 tower limit, although I have found it is too hard to get more than 4-5 per games because of the lack of money. The limit isn&apos;t 15 towers per person though, it is 15 towers in total. The small amount of different towers a player can use per game (3 or 4 I think) means you can&apos;t really play very well on singleplayer because you need other players to have other towers.
<br>Finally, now that I have gotten through all of the bads, I can get to the goods.
<br>The game is quite aesthetically pleasing and the comics between levels are a nice little extra that can make waiting for it to load a better experience and the music is amazing! The flying enemys are a lot easy to kill as they no longer fly out of range of everything but the rex and towers and the level up system is very nice, although not perfect. I enjoy having perks, and being able to change myself to fit the needs of a difficult level and I love that the enemys now attack the player and do damage. The minimap is nice, but I often get disorientated (Although I don&apos;t really know why.) The fact that the enemys now physically attack the core rather than exploding on it and doing tonnes of damage is also very nice. The possibility to upgrade towers even when you don&apos;t have enough for a full upgrade is also nice, allowing you to dump leftover resources into upgrades, rather than waiting till the next round.
<br>
<br>Overall, I don&apos;t really think the game is worth more than the Original and I think it needs a major update that addresses at least some of these issues to be worth buying. The game as stated in another review is mainly a downgrade from the original, although the newer graphics, music and progression system is nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3614042">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>SUMMARY: Sanctum 2 focuses heavily on team-based play with all the evils that entails (network connections, chatty players, poor players, etc.) so you should know about these in advance and they&#x2019;ll get no further mention here. What this game does well is deliver a shooter that feels futuristic and spacey, as well as delivering some strategy. Not too much strategy, since you ultimately still just have to put bullets into something until it dies, however weapon and tower selection can make or break a level when you are playing solo. This reflects just how important these choices are, in combination with the layout you select to obstruct your enemies-spacing them out is as important as choosing the right guns (which vary from level to level in a very positive twist). I personally failed a mission 10+ times with random jump-ins before I buckled down and beat it solo (&#x201C;canopy&#x201D;, in case you are interested) by choosing a smarter layout than was possible when sharing resources.
<br>Which brings me to my main complaint: the game is not very balanced between single/co-op modes. If you play with good players it is really easy, while if you play with poor players it is impossible (solo is middling difficulty). This is because there are the same number of enemies with the same amount of health, but depending on the number of players you&#x2019;ll have more resources and more &#x201C;moving turrets&#x201D; (though the resources can be wasted and the moving turrets can get in the way). It would have made sense to me that when more players enter a map the creatures have more health to deliver a multiplayer challenge, but I guess that was a design choice. My other main complaint is that some (not all levels) are riddled with traps-holes that are covered with a solid plane but that you can still accidentally jump into. This is a problem because getting out is way harder than getting in. Sometimes the only way out is the &#x201C;suicide&#x201D; menu option so you can respawn outside the hole. I realize that it is hard to find all these spaces before release, but continuing support should be addressing them, and they make the game feel a bit incomplete. Fairly minor gripe though. Main thing that keeps me from playing is dread of annoying drop-ins (note: it is possible to lock your game so no one can join but the lure of potentially good players to make it easier is hard to resist).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4434761">Expand</a></span>

Also, you can play with up to 3 other people, so this game is really worth the money.</span>

<br>
<br>You can&apos;t use all gun types, which sucks, since they are locked to the character you pick. So you can&apos;t assault rifle and snipe anymore.
<br>
<br>mobs with weak spots behind them forever face you, meaning that in solo play, you can never hit their weak spots.
<br>
<br>Small maps and a turret limit only hinder the game.
<br>
<br>It truly is a game that is completely different then the first. But you will have some fun in it. The only main problem is if fans of Sanctum one go to it thinking it&apos;d be the same game type, when it isn&apos;t, is what has hurt this game behind the scenes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sanctum-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5831287">Expand</a></span>
