So far I have sunk 35 hours into it and plan on playing a lot more. The game has a very charming atmosphere, the dialog is great the translation is very good, the graphics are nostalgic and remind me a lot of Harvest Moon. The gameplay is versatile and fun. On the one hand you have the great economy-style in terms of running your shop, haggling prices, keeping an eye on Booms and pricerises/drops. On the other hand you have the random generated dungeons you can clear with unique bosses, loot and best of all: tons of adventurers you meet during the game that you can SELL stuff to that they will actually wear in the dungeons. There is plenty of stuff to see and do, not do you just sell and buy stuff but you constantly discover upgrades for items, the shop and your adventurers. As you progress a nice story unfolds and the difficulty is perfect. If you fail to meet the deadline for paying debt the game does a perfect job for those and let&apos;s them restart with a boost by keeping items/levels and adventurerlevel+gear.
<br>
<br>The crafting system drives you into the dungeons to get even better items than any shop can sell you. After you &quot;finished&quot; the mail story line the game is far from over, new modes are unlocked and you can carry over your old stuff to new challenges (like survival mode).
<br>
<br>The game is simply great, the best game I got to play in 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=2537928">Expand</a></span>

For a 10$ game (it&apos;s on sale on Steam by the time of this review) Recettear is worth your money than many downloadable XBLA or PSN with the same price point. If you like Japanese text adventure games (not the same as western text rpgs) this game is good for you. Sure, the mechanic is simple, you run an item shop, do trading, raid dungeon to find some rare loots while trying to make enough profit to pay back the debt and seeing some interesting story unfold... but that is the purpose of this kind of games anyway (to get involved in the story like reading manga or watching anime... if you want complex game mechanic you should go for WoW or something of that extent). The dialogs are cute and funny and have a lot of references to Japanese pop cultures (it made me laugh so hard when  I saw the game made a homage to one most loved Japanese character) and the voices are nice. The only complain I have with the game is that the dungeon-crawling session of the game could have a little more actions players could perform such as jumping or blocking, now the limitation makes it feels like a really toned down version of Izuna or Shiren&apos;s... but overall this is one nice, cheap and interesting game to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=1456794">Expand</a></span>

Pros:<br>- Great focus on the core aspects of the RPG experience: earning money, collecting loot, levelling up. Extremely well executed and integrated with each other.<br>- Really polished presentation, great translation on the part of the publisher Carpe Fulgar.<br>- Fun story, great characters.<br>- TONS of replayability as the dungeons are randomly generated, tons of different heroes, lots of items to collect. - Managing your item shop is way more fun than I expected.

The dungeons are pretty boring for the most part, and store management is not complex enough to be compelling for more than say 4-5 hours. The graphics and visuals are lively and some (not all) of the character dialogue is amusing. This game is creative in its inception but somewhat uninspired in its execution. I enjoyed playing it for a few hours but no more than that.

I was not disappointed at all. First thing I can say about this game is that is clean and simple with controls and gameplay that is easy to understand and learn quickly. The simple but robust gameplay is not the star, however, it is the straightforward yet addicting story line of a young girl who must open an item shop in order to pay off her father&apos;s debts to a finance agency. In order to to do so you must mix both the buy low sell high strategy with the in town marketing centers and hire adventurer&apos;s and train them/lead them through dungeons and lairs to find loot and treasure to sell in the shop. It is truly an addicting game in the sense that it keeps you wanting to just sell one more item, go dungeon raiding one more time so you can meet the reachable yet challenging goals set forth by the loan agency. Now, as for the graphics, they are very clean and fun with great character designs and, let&apos;s admit it, quite the cute roster of characters and world that they inhabit...not toooooooooooo cute though. The interplay between the main characters and the citizens if the town is great, with the fantastically mundane (chatting about the stars) to getting with fights with...interesting...strangers in town. I definitely recommend this game to whomever wishes for an interesting and unique twist on a rpg that includes a great amount of humor and addicting gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371741">Expand</a></span>

Quite literally I could not put it down, even after I had beaten it. Somehow it manages to get you caught up in the story with great dialogue and well executed gameplay. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the dungeon feature, which seemed out of place in the game and wasn&apos;t up to the standard of everything else around it. However, it is entirely optional and easy to ignore with no consequences for doing so, so it isn&apos;t a problem at all. Fantastic game overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=2134393">Expand</a></span>

<br>How to describe this game, it&apos;s similar to Harvest Moon, except that you harvest treasures in dungeons. And you own a shop. What could be just a strategy game doesn&apos;t really shine through its story, but through its characters. Each of them has a sould, and a role that isn&apos;t necessarily obvious when the game starts. Of course, you&apos;ve got to love cute anime stuff in general, that&apos;s a requirement to play this game. So I&apos;ve been disappointed by a lot of blockbuster games, while this &quot;little&quot; game appeared to be amazing.

After finishing the debt part starts the Endless game part, in which you slowly start discovering the other adventurers and thanks to Arma&apos;s story, you learn the fate of your own father.<br>To be frank I was extremely sceptical at first. I played the demo but it left me neutral. But when the full game started unveiling itself, part after part, I started being more and more addicted to it, to the point that I started doing everything, completing everything to the max (merchant level 99, charme level 99 and bilions of pix). And I have yet to finish the story.<br>Maybe objectively this is not a masterpiece, but it doesn&apos;t matter. It&apos;s so ridiculously addicting and rewarding that It&apos;s a pleasure to play. Something I will probably keep playing for long time, even after finishing the story (which seems ridiculously big).<br>Really an amazing game. Congrats to the developing team and to the translators (even though they distorted the translation a little bit, matching it to the /b/ way of speaking).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371877">Expand</a></span>

You run an item shop, you quest for new items, and sell those items to people. Along the way you make friends and a pile of money. Simple enough to grasp, or so I thought. This game is so needlessly filled with dialog that is takes away from the fun. I&apos;m all for a tutorial or a few helpful hints, but after 40 minutes of playing I hadn&apos;t even opened my shop for the first day yet. All I was doing was reading dialog AND not good dialog. It&apos;s not like there is a story line that will keep you on the edge of you seat. You are a young and very ditzy girl who is partnered up with a loanshark fairy. The fairy tells you everything you need to know to run a shop. She tells you, then you repeat it back to her and make a ditzy joke to go along with it, then she reiterates, and you make another ditzy joke. This goes on for what I am certain forever. Steam has me clocked in at 94 minutes of play time and I don&apos;t think I can take anymore cyclical dialog. I really hoped they would just shut up and let me play this game, but I have a feeling it will never end. Did I mention I can&apos;t find a way to save my game? I had to quit after 40 minutes of play and when I returned it made me start a new game. I had to go through all the dialog again. Yes it lets you skip, but you&apos;re pressing Esc 10 times just to play for 5 minutes. Who are these people that are giving this game all these good reviews?

A girl who always breaks your chain of gaining experience from selling items. Once &quot;unlocked&quot;, she visits your store, selling goods to you at very inflated prices. This is a death knell if you encounter her early enough (-1). FUN FACT: Euria sounds like &apos;urea&apos;, the waste part of urine! Sounds pretty apt!<br>Constantly levelling up in dungeons makes dungeoneering very easy for the first few levels, and very annoying in the later stages, where you are about to fight a boss, but want to level up first (to get full health). (-1).<br>It can be said that the markets fluctuate TOO much, if you buy a somewhat expensive item at low price, and sell it when it&apos;s high price, you make a much higher profit than you should, making the game fairly easy if you&apos;re lucky enough. (-1).<br>**TOTAL**: 18-3=15.  Recettear is one of my all-time favourite games, and is perfect in almost every way, with some VERY minor exceptions. Worth the unusually high price tag, and MORE!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=2191765">Expand</a></span>

The Dungeon was not really great &amp; could be made better. Overall game play was still OK for me. Many variety of items to sell and obtain. Although felt those random encounter where you character will talk to other people was a bit redundant. Good casual game.</span>

Recettear is one of the most fantastic and original RPGs I&apos;ve played in the past few years. Classic graphics and game-play with a different spin of the main character being an new item shop owner trying to pay off a debt, instead of an adventurer. The game is split off into two sections, store management where you sell items at the right times for the price that will get you the most profit. It wonderfully works in the concept of supply and demand as you get actual news on market updates sometimes more than once a day on what item prices are up and what ones are down. Along with the store management is going to the market or merchant&apos;s guild to buy items to sell in your store, or to help with dungeon crawling.
<br>The second part is the dungeon crawling. On the days you need a large boost to your store inventory or ingredients for crafting, you can hire an adventurer from the adventurer&apos;s guild to go to a dungeon with you. This is where you will control the adventurer as your main character follows behind. Using the adventurer you will fight off enemies, picking up items that some drop and opening chests to usually get items/treasures. The good part about dungeon crawling is that you get items that you can sell for 100% profit, minus the fee to hire the adventurer. Lastly on the dungeon stuff, the adventurer you hire will level up through the process of killing enemies, like any RPG, which is a good thing because they will be stronger and you can later move on to bigger and better dungeons, but it is also a slight hindrance as well, because the stronger and more experienced an adventurer becomes, the more it will cost to hire him or her. As the game progresses through the story, you will be able to hire different kinds of adventurers. I&apos;m giving this game a 10 because it is a solid RPG, with a fun and whimsical story, that has familiar game-play while still feeling quite original. I&apos;ve played many RPGs in my day and I can say I&apos;ve never before played a game like Recettear. The people that rate it real low because of a lot of dialogue have clearly never played a classic RPG, or they have been spoiled by playing too many fully voiced RPGs.
<br>
<br>One of the other reviews says says that the store management isn&apos;t complex enough to be compelling for more than 4-5 hours, the problem with saying that is that it shows that they didn&apos;t play very long, because I&apos;ve played 16 hours and I&apos;m still getting new facets and challenges to running the store. The game doesn&apos;t give you all the ways to run your store right off, it treats those like any abilities learned in an RPG. As you get more experienced at running your shop and level up as a merchant, you gain more things that you can do, like decorating your store and new ways to sell things to your customers.
<br>
<br>Finally, I would add that just because it doesn&apos;t have the latest newfangled sparkling graphics and gimmicky  interface, doesn&apos;t mean that it isn&apos;t an original title. The story and store management along side the classic game play is what makes the game original. The art and graphics(classic around PS2 era JRPG type) are solid, fitting the style of the game and the story.
<br>
<br>It isn&apos;t hard for this game to shine with with all the samey RPG drivel that tends to be heralded as special and wonderful(usually only because of the graphics). I highly recommend this game to any gamer that is properly familiar with and loves RPGs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=3067901">Expand</a></span>

The game starts easy, but quickly ramps up the difficulty as you go. Unless you look up a guide or something, you can expect to fail your first playthrough. Fortunately when you fail you keep anything that isn&apos;t story - related so the next playthrough will be much easier. The game is repetitive but also addicting. If you like Japanese style games or anime, etc you will feel much more at home playing this. If your a completionist when you play games, expect to play this for a very long time. If you quit once the story is done, I would suggest a different kind of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=2312002">Expand</a></span>

No single part of the game is really amazing or innovative but put together you have a lot of things to juggle. It reminds me of Persona in how your day is broken up into time slots where you have to manage your store, shop at the market, do quests to recruit mercs, and dungeon crawl for more loot to stock your store. The game&apos;s main objective is making weekly payments to clear your family&apos;s debt. They really ramp up in cost quickly which is where most of the difficulty comes from. However, the last payment is really high and most people don&apos;t manage it on their first playthrough. While there is a NG+ mode, the second time through was way too easy and got boring without the dungeon crawling. Despite some balancing issues, this is a great JRPG and worth picking up. Just try to remember to keep multiple save games. Oh yeah, and the boss fights are pretty cool.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822765">Expand</a></span>

There are subtitles provided for those who don&apos;t speak Japanese, the game mechanics are solid, the ability to run an item shop is pretty fulfilling, and the adventure aspects are enjoyable. That being said, the game definitely caters to a specific type of gamer. If you aren&apos;t into anime genre, the art styles and dialogue will drive you crazy. It&apos;s also pretty unforgiving when it comes to the amount of money that you need to make before it&apos;s game over back to the beginning. The dungeons can get monotonous, but if you aren&apos;t into that style of adventure game (top down RPG hack and slash) you probably wouldn&apos;t play this game anyway. The random events could also make this game really difficult at times when it comes to making money.
<br>
<br>However, overall, the game was really fun, and it is worth a $10-20 cost.
<br>
<br>So, to sum it up...
<br>Pros:
<br>Challenging,
<br>simple plot,
<br>solid game mechanics,
<br>decent economy sim,
<br>various adventurers to play for whatever style suits you best,
<br>Provides a game that is exactly what is shown on the tin
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Random events could make the goal impossible,
<br>Appeals to only a certain audience in art and atmosphere,
<br>Dungeons and routine can get somewhat monotonous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=3405501">Expand</a></span>

Then when I think of the depth of this game and how each NPC has different tastes and preferences how they all act differently and each is unique in their own way it really brings the game to life making it worth that 20 dollars. Anyways moving on this game was pretty well done and very surprising. I enjoyed it a lot.
<br>
<br>Story is fairly unbelievable. A little girls father who has disappeared leaves his daughter with a huge crippling debt. She&apos;s only 10 (I am guessing?) how is she spose to repay his debt? Why the fairy Tear tells her to make a store so she can pay it back. The lil loli Recette gets help and turns her house into a store. While the story was fairly unbelievable and lacking there isn&apos;t much to do but if you do the RPG dungeon part more stories unfold and builds up more character for Recette and Tear and the Adventurers.
<br>
<br>Characters in the game have a huge impact. Everyone is unique and different and the events that happen make them rememberable enough. The more you unlock the more events that will happen interacting with all the characters all together. It gives incentive to do the dungeon part of the game to unlock more of these characters with their corky bits and pieces.
<br>
<br>Visuals and Graphics. It&apos;s 8-Bit and it&apos;s Indie. What more can I expect for a game with this much depth? Not great but monster bit-maps were great. The art for the NPC  Background pictures were great notch. Overall I&apos;d have to say it&apos;s well done but I still knida wished for a 720p version or something.
<br>
<br>The challenge the game presents is up to how smart your are and if you can pull it off. Me? I feel I&apos;m pretty smart although I don&apos;t want to boast about it but I can say that some of my other friends can&apos;t even get past the 2nd week. So it&apos;s defiantly up to your own skills to be able to make this game and easy or an impossible experience.
<br>
<br>There are two different types of gameplay here. Running the Store and the Dungeon Crawling. Running your store was great but a challenge. Everyone has a different budget and you have to learn that by personality and age. The little girl is well in fact a little girl so she doesn&apos;t have much money. Louie is poor but the more adventuring you do with him the more money he gets and if you sell to him cheap he starts to get a bigger and better budget. It&apos;s so crazy and complex that each character in the game has specific things and goals and all this other crap that it&apos;s difficult to explain! Combat was simplistic but each Adventurer has their pros and cons and a different playstyle required. Not much to talk about here but it knida reminded me of Final Fantasy without the turn base thing.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this game? Defiantly. It&apos;s a must buy. If 20 dollars is too much for your wallet though you&apos;ll have to wait for a Steam Sale or something. I don&apos;t see it move from that price much at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=3354225">Expand</a></span>

I figured there was a reasonable chance it would end up on my &quot;wasted money Steam purchases&quot; basket. Only a few days later, when I bothered to check it out, this game became one hell of a pleasant surprise.
<br>
<br>Recettear is a weird mix of simulation, hack &amp; slash and role-playing, with the cute japanese kind of graphics and animations that I really love. You play Recette, the cute and naive item-shop seller girl, who&apos;s teamed up with Tear, the fairy, who at first seems like the tough business...fairy(?) personality, but already a few hours into the game, I&apos;m getting the feeling she has a totally different agenda than the one she&apos;s letting out.
<br>
<br>As Recette, you need to manage your items shop and make money, so you can pay a debt to Tear&apos;s agency (whatever it is), so they wouldn&apos;t take your house. In addition to buying and selling routine, you can also hire adventurers and go to dungeons. In return for your payment to the adventurer, you get to keep the items you find in the dungeon, and sell them with nearly 100% profit.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game is a lot of fun, definitely worth its price, in my humble opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801812">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ sim style run a shop + dungeon crawling + crafting + cut scenes telling the story, it creates a circle of never ending small tasks while the clock is ticking.
<br>Its not a strategy game as each week you need to pay back more money, so getting a good start does not &quot;snowball&quot; its a endurance race to keep alive financially were returns increase each week as well as costs.
<br>Anyhow its a solidly built game were all parts fits together well.
<br>
<br>-dungeon crawling can be a little well time consuming but its still addicting, and you might end up needing to use scummy save-reload to go back in time as the a dungeon run taking 30min+ failed and you needed that money to stay alive.
<br>
<br>+each part of the game is simple and intuitive
<br>
<br>Summation: its a GOOD game but each of its parts are on its own not as good as the best, the dungeon minigame is certainly not a second binding of isaac the store on its own is certainly not ... cant think of a game here but im certain there must be one.
<br>And the story on its own is not the best compare it to something like the dreamfall longest journey which makes many books blush in comparison its not on that level ether.
<br>This all being said there can only be 1best game in each genre and one cant throw rocks on all other 99,9999999% of games, this is a original combination making it a fresh new experience as a whole even though each ingredient are just &quot;ok&quot; it blends well and makes all the ok ingredients into more then the sum of its parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=6934051">Expand</a></span>

<br>You&apos;ll be sitting at home, thinking what the **** am i doing with my life, while sinking hundreds of hours into this. Its addictive, cute, and highly replayable.
<br>When i picked this Game up i didn&apos;t really know what to expect. I like the idea of finally being the one selling the Items, not only collecting them.
<br>You start out with a small Shop, cheap Items and Customers that would rather pay nothing at all then pay 130%.
<br>You slowly work yourself up to be the best Item Shop in the Town, selling extremely Valuable Items in your Shop and amassing riches like nothing else, being a Millionaire is so satisfying.
<br>But the Game doesn&apos;t end there! On Top of the Item Shop you also get to Dungeon Crawl with several Heroes that all handle differently, you can Level them up, sell them better Items so you can progress further and the Dungeons have 100 &apos;s of Floors to get Items that you couldn&apos;t buy or get otherwise.
<br>This Game is a Rare Masterpiece, the Idea behind it is so simple yet effective.
<br>If there ever is something like this as a Multiplayer Game, i know where ill spend my time.
<br>Pick it up and you wont be disappointed if you like
<br>A: Anime
<br>B: Dungeon Crawling/Collecting Items
<br>C: Organizing things</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/recettear-an-item-shops-tale/user-reviews?user_review_id=4880961">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Very enjoyable game. Grabbed it on a sale and am thrilled I did. I have OCD (for real, not just decided I do because I like a clean house) and it is nice to have something where I can completely give in to my tendencies and allow them to take over. Even though I finished my first game in two days, I find myself still playing it every day a week later with no intent to ever stop.</span>
