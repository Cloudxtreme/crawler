<br>
<br>The game promises to be a combination of city-builder, tower-defense, and Diablo-style real-time-roguelike.  It only vaguely manages to get the last of those three down.
<br>
<br>The game works like this: You start off with a deceptively interesting-looking and wide array of character choices to pick from.  This is the only interesting choice you ever get to make.  After that, you get plopped down in a town square and have to start building.
<br>
<br>City-building is THERE, technically, but not particularly worth playing for.  Building the town is a pretty trivial affair  you pretty much have to make a fairly balanced town, and except for the guard towers, it doesn&apos;t much matter where anything is, so there&apos;s little difference between one town and another.
<br>
<br>Then, you have to pay for your town, which essentially means running around killing random things in the wide open field with a few sparse props that they call the world in this game.  Each &quot;dungeon&quot; is nothing but a prop in the field, and there&apos;s nothing to really explore.
<br>
<br>Oh, and remember that thing about character selection?  They&apos;re all basically the same in a fight, give or take some stat bonuses.  There are no special powers.  No spells.  No super moves.  You just click on an enemy and watch both sides subtract HPs from the other until one number becomes less than one.  Rinse and repeat until the &quot;remaining enemy&quot; counter reaches a number less than one.  Then get declared winner.  Yay.
<br>
<br>Then it tells you to play again.
<br>
<br>The recurring problem of games that try to blend many different genres is that they often tend to lack the content to really make a deep, enjoyable game of any one genre because they try to spread themselves so thin.  This game didn&apos;t even have enough content to make it part of one genre, even before they spread it thinner.  It feels like it was some indie developer&apos;s first project, where it was kept shoestring budget and just ran on the desire to create &quot;my first game&quot;, even if the feature list was sparse.  I can only assume Tilted Mill just plain ran out of money before building the game they were TRYING to make, because I cannot believe this game was in any way what was intended to go to market., and what we&apos;re seeing is some stripped-down premature birth game that was only half-formed, and not yet ready for alpha when it was shipped.

<br>It&apos;s a hollow, barren land, these Hinterlands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hinterland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3749494">Expand</a></span>

I was expecting something like Majesty, where your townspeople interact with the world, but in this game they don&apos;t really do much aside from generate income, resources or bonuses (and they don&apos;t leave their buildings unless you bring them along to fight), leaving your character to fight extremely repetitive battles, even if you choose a town administrator sort of career. The graphics are ok, but the inability to zoom out is frustrating - even at 1920x1200 you can&apos;t really see very far from where your character is standing.

This is a fantastic casual game that blends RPG and RTS very well. Think of it along the lines of a small version of The Guild 2 with a little Action RPG thrown in to keep you busy. :) Sad that there&apos;s not a widescreen option, but maybe they&apos;re patch that in later. Worth the $20.</span>

<br>All in all I like this game. It&apos;s fun. It has mindless grinding mixed in with a casual city builder. Yet there is so much missed opportunity here. While playing I&apos;m constantly thinking of ways this game could be better. In fact, I really wish someone would make another game like this. My biggest problem is the $10 price tag. Honestly, it&apos;s not worth it. $5 and I&apos;d recommend it to my friends, but $10 for a buggy, graphical mush of a 5yro casual game is just a little too steep.
<br>---------
<br>So it&apos;s 2013 and I&apos;m just playing this game. There were not many reviews; so I decided to leave my opinions here as well. Just in case some other gamer happens to stumble upon this title. I learned about Hinterland when a blog site said if I liked Minecraft, Terraria, and X3 then I&apos;d like Hinterland as well. I&apos;m not certain how they tied those games into this one...Irregardless, I picked it up for $10 on Steam, which seemed liked a lot for a game that&apos;s 5yrs old.

<br>The first thing I noticed is this game is buggy. It crashed on me when I changed the resolution, which doesn&apos;t go above 1280 x 1024. My 2nd launch and the game froze bc I hit Esc to pass the developer and publisher cut screens. It might have been that I relaunched the game too quickly from the crash bc I haven&apos;t had any other problems with the game since. When you start a game you are asked to choose a character. There are plenty to choose from and each person has strengths and weakness. I like having plenty of options. Once the game finally loads you begin inside you sparse town.
<br>
<br>So the premise of the game is this: You own a town, you hire tradesmen to work in your town, you build and grow your city while killing all the monsters off the outlying areas. Kill all monsters and win the map. So it&apos;s a light city builder and light grind fest. Not a bad combo for someone who likes both and is looking to spend an afternoon or a few hours unwinding.
<br>
<br>On to the meat of the game. Graphics in this game is just passable. The ground is a horrendous camouflage rendered goop and the view feels way too zoomed in. Let&apos;s pick it apart shall we? First the view is too close to the ground. You can not see enemies on your screen, exception being from directly above you, until you have gotten too close and they aggro you. This can become an issue if they are higher level or more than one. There is a mini map that shows the location of enemies, however it can show 1 dot when it&apos;s 3 enemies. Another thing about enemies. The ground camouflages them. Most of the enemies blend into the ground. Even with approaching from below and using the min map sometimes you just don&apos;t see them until it&apos;s too late. On the other hand, I like how different weapons and armor does reflect on my character and the people living in my town. After you play a while the graphics don&apos;t seem quite so bad.
<br>
<br>The city building aspect can become a bit of a frustration. You have two resources to manage: Food  which keeps your citizens staying in your town. Gold  which you use to hire citizens and upgrade building.  Food so far has not been a problem. Just make sure you hire a farmer or trapper first and you should be good. Gold, for me, has been a big issue. You just never have enough; and not like most games where you do 3 or 4 upgrades at a time and think, &quot;I wish I had more.&quot; In this game you have to decide, &quot;Since I barely survived the last few town invasions... Do I wait 5 more minutes to get the herbalist we need for health potions that show up 1 every 5 minutes or do I upgrade my Manor so I can wait 5 more minutes to upgrade my guardhouse?&quot;  It&apos;s questions like that you&apos;ll have to face constantly while playing. There will be times when all you can do is just sit around and wait for money to come in. Unfortunately the game doesn&apos;t spawn new enemies. Except for the ones that attack your town. Those enemies can end a game quickly if you aren&apos;t prepared. Some advice would be to try an keep at least 1 health potion on you for a town invasion.
<br>
<br>The whole money aspect of the game can turn tedium. Killing monsters gives you 1 to 4 gold. each area has 5 or 6 monsters; so if you clean out an area you get 6 to 24 gold. Normally by that time you are low on health and need to return to town to heal. Hiring people costs sometimes 10 times that. Not to mention you can generate income in town, but only after hiring a merchant that needs 2 or 3 town upgrades first each requiring 50 or more gold. You see where I&apos;m going here? However, the constant feeling of below the margin does force you be think more critically about every purchase. On the other hand, when you run out of gold and all the monsters overpower you. You&apos;ll find yourself just sitting around in a boring little town for 20 minutes.
<br>
<br>So yeah, there yah go! I&apos;ve said a lot of hurtful things about Hinterland, yet I took the time to write them down. I have such mixed feelings towards this game. I&apos;m going to start another map and see if I like or hate it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hinterland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207548">Expand</a></span>

Having only just recently heard of this game, I&apos;m not sure if it even wanted to be heard of to begin with.  I recall Tilted Mill being a pretty ambitious little company.  Heck they even made a pretty decent city builder ages ago, but this?  This is terrible.  It barely functions.  Its a little bit of this, its a little bit of that and what do you know- it can&apos;t make up its mind.  Many have used the word &quot;addictive&quot; when it comes to Hinterland, but what they really mean is &quot;addictive until you realize their is no replay value whatsoever.&quot;  This was out in 2008?  My goodness.  I mean I&apos;ve been seeking out obscure **** all my life and I finally happen upon this monstrosity of programming.  It isn&apos;t some hidden &quot;gem&quot; that the thirty or so people on metacritic and beyond describe it as being.  Its generic, its boring beyond recognition, it is full of glitches, displeasing visuals, unacceptable framerates, no resolution support for anything more than 1024x768 and a bland soundtrack to go with it all.  This is the most generic thing I&apos;ve ever actually sat down and played in years.  Literally years.  I still can&apos;t think of a more dull experience than Hinterland.  Let the secret stay buried deep.  This is a travesty, it feels like the end times with once bold developers making what look like browser games for the RPG element addicted retards.  Its somewhere between Diablo clone and a dog turd.  Do not even bother spending the $10 USD on this.  You will not get your money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hinterland/user-reviews?user_review_id=4070969">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I have always enjoyed the merger of town sims  RPGs. I only wish they made more of them!  Pretty terrible graphics and animation mar an otherwise fun and unique game. If it&apos;s on sale for a couple bucks on steam, give it a whirl. You&apos;ll have a good time if you can get past the cruddy graphics.</span>

While i personally love large tech, stat and ability trees, i can understand why they had limit this arena, given the smallness of the game. Given the inherent randomness within the game, it doesn&apos;t seen to affect replayability in a large manner. Still, i would perhaps like to see a few more options in the original creation of characters. Hopefully this will be addressed in future additions to the game. This is an 8, but a high one, with hope for improvement as Tilted Mill continues to tweak that game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hinterland/user-reviews?user_review_id=725995">Expand</a></span>

<br>This plays close to a real time adventure strategy, you start with a hero and town hall, you must hire craftsmen and build there facilities to create a town, you must also feed them so farmers are a mainstay to any successful game, the heart of the game is running around diablo style killing mobs to clear areas, your character levels and can use gear as an rpg allows. The real thing this game does is melds town building and diablo style like rpg.
<br>
<br>The fun in this game comes from the management of your town, you clear areas for the loot to build your town to help your character to attack tougher areas, it works and its fun. I suggest you try it even if you arnt into this type of game, simply because a game can be fun without an ea agenda of over the top cut scenes, triple a marketing and f for gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hinterland/user-reviews?user_review_id=6475046">Expand</a></span>
