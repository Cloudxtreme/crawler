This is a complex strategy based game.  As usual in strategy games, there  is a very long campaign based on a story line and skirmish capability.  The skirmish capability is outstanding, allowing the user to play the role of any of a number of races with different strengths and technological abilities.  With some race customization capability and different star systems, this allows for a huge amount of variation in game play.
<br>
<br>Games can take many hours to play out.  The game allows saving status and resuming.  The biggest weakness for most people is the lack of multiplayer support.  This game is only turn based with one person playing against one or more computer opponents.  Alliances are allowed, either in up front game definition or on the fly, by negotiation between players.  A multiplayer option would be nice, but is difficult to implement because the length of game play is often too long for keeping a group together.
<br>
<br>After downloading, there is no need for an internet connection to play the game and no disk is needed to play.  This is particularly a plus for PCs without (soon to be obsolete) optical drives.  I appreciate a game that cares about convenience for the user over awkward and annoying copy protection schemes.
<br>
<br>Reasonable graphics performance requires a midrange graphics card.  Playability suffers a little with too slow a PC, though not nearly as much as reflex based games.
<br>
<br>The detailed, race based technology trees add complexity and affect strategy choices.  Impressive ship customization options add to thought required and entertainment value.  While a detailed analysis of the science may poke holes (population growth etc), the game is quite sophisticated and presents an interesting hypothetical future.  Unlike many &quot;strategy&quot; games, the simple solution of massing a huge army and only then attacking does not work.  Unlike many games, there is an ongoing maintenance cost for ships that are in operation.  Maintaining a very large standing fleet hurts the economy and future military capability.  To win requires a strong economy, manufacturing capability, technology and, of course, fleet.  Much more realistic than most games.  Also something that many political leaders do not pay enough attention to in the real world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1480009">Expand</a></span>

Most video games are fast-paced, point and shoot affairs. The TBS genre caters to a very specific niche -- those who harbor fond memories of board games like Axis and Allies or Risk. That being said, for those who appreciate these types of games this is a must have! As a fan of similar games (Civilization, MOO, Alpha Centari, etc.) I have to say that this is one of the best I&apos;ve played. As you can see from the reviews above, most professional game critics agree with me. I won&apos;t try and list all the virtues of this game (the list would go on forever); I&apos;ll simply limit myself to some of the most outstanding: - Unique races with unique technology trees (this makes the game more believable and adds to the replay value). - Awesome A.I. (the best I&apos;ve seen in any strategy game, period). -Beautiful starship design and customization (nothing is more fun than watching a ship you designed mop the floor with your enemies). Again, this game is not for everyone. An average PC gamer (let alone TBS fanatic) will probably spend a little time getting through the learning curve and getting his clock cleaned, even with the A.I. turned down to easier levels. Nevertheless, once you figure out what you&apos;re doing a victory in this game really does bring a lot of satisfaction. Perhaps the biggest reason to buy this game is the company that produced it -- Stardock. No other company is as responsive to customer feedback, and Stardock will release patches and improvements for about a year for any game it makes -- even after sales have tapered off. While it is obviously in the business to make money, games like this are clearly a labor of love, and it shows. If you have any interest in serious strategy I can&apos;t recommend this game highly enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=414690">Expand</a></span>

I understand that there is a lot frutsration towards turn based games, however this game is exactly what it sets out to be. And what it sets out to be is the ultimate in resource management, fleet strategy, creative ship design, and compelling and competitive artificial intelligence. Be warned, this isn&apos;t a game that you are going to firing up at a frat party anytime soon, however if you enjoy really poring over the details of your empire and carefully picking your battles then this is without question the ultimate expression of a eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate title. Again though, if you don&apos;t like chess, then you will definately not like this game. There are minor balancing issues with the individual races however Stardock has released several tune ups to the game as well as several new pieces of content to the game post release. Truly an example of an independant labor of love in the gaming industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=419305">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a huge Civ4 fan, and this plays along the same guidelines. It will suck hours out of a day. Only problem is that they do not have a manual for ToA (only the first two installments). ToA makes many changes, to the learning curve is a little high. Hopefully the guide will be out soon.</span>

The new tech trees add so much depth tio the game. You have to adjust your strategy in all aspects to the needs of your race, which really gives an unique feeling to every race in the game - a thing that i really wished to have in this kind of game. Normally changes that big in gameplay stay on your wishlist, but Stardock really did a greaat job with fulfilling the gamers wishes. Besides i have never seen before a game where players are that involved in the design, you can go to the SD-homepage, give your suggestions and get direct contact with the developers. Twilight is as good as it is, because those that play the game also helped in creating and improving it. And it is not over yet, some improvements waiting in upcoming patches. Dread Lords was very good, Dark Avatar great and Twilight just did what the developers intended: To create a game that can be played for the long time we are waiting for GalCiv III without getting bored by it. P.S.: Just some comments to statements others made here. A 4X game may not be the type of game, anyone is enjoying. If as a matter of taste you do not like Football you cant just barely say, Football is a bad sport. In its genre the game is excellent, if you do not like the genre - do not blame the game that you dont. The devs did their best with it and if you like 4X you will like this game. If there ever has been a real sequel to Master of Orion II, this game might be the most likely one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=414021">Expand</a></span>

My only gripes are that StarDock should publish tech trees so we can plan, the espionage system could be better and the economic system is very difficult to figure out until you play a few times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=415863">Expand</a></span>

Should come with warning saying &quot; if you want to have any type of life do not play&quot; highly highly addictive. You will be up to 5 oclock in the morning with this game. Must play for space sim strategy fans.</span>

Improved graphics, new techs, new units, better AI, new campaigns, everything one could ask for from an expansion. While the game itself may not be good enough to be one of the highest rated games in years, even if just because it doesn&apos;t have multiplayer, it is undoubtedly the best expansion pack in years.</span>

Separate tech tree per civ, terror stars, ascension victory, better AI (how is that even possible?), tournaments, insanely large maps, awesome modding tools, incredible new graphics overhaul, nicer UI, and more.

The complexity of the game is staggering, even after watching all of the tutorials. Trying to just earn enough BCs (or billions of credits, I guess?) is difficult and when I had to raise taxes to actually make a buck or two, the people (naturally) get angry. So, you have to cut production down which means that technologies take forever to research and things just don&apos;t get done. It is an interesting concept, however, and the ability to set up a spacial empire sounds like a lot of fun. I&apos;m sure if I actually could get into it more, it would be a really fun game (which is why I gave it a 7 instead of a lower grade, since the game is largely unexplored). I think the slow start-up is really what gets me the most. When you compare it with Civ IV, Civ goes much faster (and perhaps too fast) and you can get into the game much easier. Also, the tutorial never covers the &quot;Wonders&quot; that are being built all around me. All of the sudden I would see this notice of a galactic wonder being built and I had no idea how I could even build one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=417082">Expand</a></span>

Stardock has released their second expansion to the title five years later and it&apos;s a poor job. For starters, the game isn&apos;t even officially released. They have a system where they say that the game is &quot;Generally available&quot; and mask the fact that anyone who examines its development can see that it is still a beta. The races AI isn&apos;t fully finished, the ascension victory is a poor addition in it&apos;s current state, and there&apos;s a gamebreaking issue where the technology costs keep exponentially increasing and renders a fundamental gameplay element unmanageable. This is an idiotic move by Stardock and is a business move because they admit it&apos;s not done yet, but they want the money up front. Next off is the additions to the game in terms of what the AI says, they now have even more insulting responses aimed directly at the player. I imagine the developers thought these lines were funny, but the player has to read these belligerent responses over and over and it just doesn&apos;t add anything. The general feel of stardock&apos;s attitude towards this game at this moment is apathetic. They said they&apos;d only support it after 2.0 (It&apos;s official release), if it&apos;d make them any more money which gives the impression they aren&apos;t passionate about making this game the best they can make it. The AI has gotten better, the new techs are nice, and there are general improvements to the interface and graphics in the game. It&apos;s overall, much more unstable, and I had it crash about five times in a session, with graphic errors on the side. Stardock doesn&apos;t deserve any praise for this game. It&apos;s a shame it&apos;s scoring so highly. Please avoid this game until it&apos;s patched, or better yet, don&apos;t buy it at all. You can spend your days on better things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=412998">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps thats it - the fleet graphics are cool, but its a bit too confusing and just too long and just not that fun - plus it takes forever to play - shelfware.</span>

All in one, the game i think has like a handful of really unique technologies and the rest of the tree is filled with improvement versions. Thats a sign of lazy game design for me. The only real positives i could think of is the good AI (nothing you cant achieve with some advantages to the AI in other games) and stardock&apos;s approach to patching their game (this is really unique and gives much of the 3 points i give to this game). Total: 3/10. Weak game that gets lots of hype because of the nice developers behind them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=415027">Expand</a></span>

So I was sure to make a good purchase. I choose GC2. First, I had problems to install the game. I began my first game in EASY mode. Early in the game, some pirates take one of my planet between two turns. Took me many many turns to got the technology to take it back. It was just returning to normal when another gang of pirates arrived. Some professionals this time. Their vessels were arround 100 times stronger than mines. I took between 300 and 500 turns to got the technologies to built some presentable units to face them. By that time, they had destroyed almost everything I had and moreover, almost everything others had, in the galaxy. Some starships were hidden in the corners of the maps. lol. But I was finally ready, built 4 pairs of  huge destroyers. I was wipe out in a single attack, and they had lost nothing. Just a bit damaged. They were still 20 times stronger than me. Soon after, they finished me. Pirates won the game   -I had no fun at all. Even not interested to try another game. Those pirates stole me 19,99 dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3274976">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately I feel the need to point out that if you&apos;re a fanatic TBS player like myself, it still holds no challenge (unless you let it cheat) once you figure the ins and outs of the game.  The music is average, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is utterly fantastic.
<br>
<br>Galactic Civilizations 2&apos;s ship editor is one of the most impressive I have ever seen.  No need to take my word for it, just use google and look at what other people have made using it.
<br>
<br>The planet micro management portion is quite interesting, with each planet having a chance to have certain tiles that give a % bonus to production/research/etc that makes each and every planet worth colonizing in the long run.  That crappy 4-5 quality planet that you&apos;d normally ignore in search of something better?  It might just have a 800% production tile that makes it outstrip every other planet in the sector when it comes to building your war fleets.
<br>
<br>Speaking of war, that&apos;s the one part of the game that keeps me from giving galactic civilizations 2 a 10 out of 10.  When it comes to combat, it really is a matter of rock/paper/scissors in terms of defense and offense.  You have lasers, missiles, guns and a corresponding defense for each.  All combat boils down to is who has more weapon &apos;points&apos; that isn&apos;t covered by their enemy&apos;s defense points, and how many ships you have.  It doesn&apos;t get more complicated than that, which is a real shame.  One need only look at games like Master of Orion 2 to see how it could have been done better.  A turn based combat system that actually let you control the ships would have opened up entirely new avenues of fun and possibility.
<br>
<br>All in all, a great game with almost no bugs (I have been playing it for well over a year and the only issue I ever encountered was a strange bug where I loaded a save and all ships had 1hp and 1 movement) that could have used minor tweaking in a few areas to truly be the game of the year instead of just great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-twilight-of-the-arnor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4723951">Expand</a></span>
