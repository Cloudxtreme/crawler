I saw a RTS/RPG hybrid game and immediately told myself how much fun I hade with Warhammer Dawn of War 2. So I quickly checked metacritic to see good reviews so I quickly checked score and bought it wihtout playing first two games. And what a disappointment. I will go through it step by step:
<br>
<br>1) Graphics 4: Actual in-game graphics is only mediocre and I think Warcraft 3 looked much better. But I am not that kind of guy who judges the game solely based on how it looks. I was able to play hardcore indie games like Avernum: Escape from the Pit so I can appreciate a good game even with 90ties graphics.
<br>
<br>2) UI and Controls:4  And this is the part when I started to wonder how is it possible that this game is its 3rd instalment. User interface is confusing and tutorial is worthless being pure video based. It took me ages just to find a skill tree for my character.
<br>
<br>Additionally using skills in this game is incredibly confusing, you cannot use character portraits to help with targeting of some spells (like heal), cooldowns are incredibly quick for you to manage even 2 characters with 4+ skills and targeting enemies who are surrounded by multitude of friendly units always dying and moving is a chore. Many times you find yourself losing the control of the fight and getting frustrated  because you failed to land a skill 3rd time in a row with your units dying as a result. So horrible.
<br>
<br>3) Game design: 4. I played the game until I got the Lighthouse quest but I decided to do all sidequests and clearing the map first. Then when I was supposed to start building my base I was stormed always stormed by enemy units (I counted 30+ units in two quick succesive waves against my 10) in first two minutes and lost horribly.
<br>
<br>This was a time when I gave up and looked at some Let&apos;s Plays on youtube only too see that some people had the same issue only with much smaller enemy army. I checked my difficulty settings: Normal.
<br>
<br>I tried to play around - I tried to move my units forward to fight with enemy before they all gather, didnt work. Then I trained myself to speed building and managed to build 3 turrets before the first wave of enemies arrived to no avail. This is the point where I gave up. I probably messed the game by doing sidequest or visiting some part of map first or something. I do not care to lower the difficulty settings to Easy and I sure as hell don&apos;t want to restart the game to check if doing quests in different order makes a difference.
<br>
<br>Final verdict: 4. This is a game with bad graphics, horrible interface and at least for me resulted in a sudden difficulty spike that I was not able to overcome even on Normal. This game was incredibly overpriced for what it has to offer (19 EUR or something like that). Maybe if it costs EUR 2.99 then it may be something for some niche hardcore fan otherwise I advice you to pass on it or go play Warcraft 3 again. The single player campaign has more to offer then this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spellforce-2-demons-of-the-past/user-reviews?user_review_id=3938035">Expand</a></span>

Because you will meed old allies and enemies alike, along with a decent storyline to make them shine. The soundtrack is awsome, the main menu track is simply astonishing, but it gets a bit repetitive after a while, especially in long missions where you hack your way through your enemie&apos;s base. Graphics have been quite enchanted so to speak, but they are based on an old platform. There are some random buggs, but a simple reload of a savegame or a map change will usually make it go away.
<br>This game is at best when you have played all the games so far; it&apos;s worth it. And these being said, let&apos;s hope there will be a Spellforce 3 to be reviwed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spellforce-2-demons-of-the-past/user-reviews?user_review_id=3937048">Expand</a></span>
