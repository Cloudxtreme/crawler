Sadly &amp; despite commercials, the story almost doesn&apos;t exist. The music is all the time the same &amp; simply boring. Another problem is AI - enemies are simply dumb. The only tactic they know is: get in shooting range &amp; shoot till death. That&apos;s pretty bad for a game, where 99% content is shooting enemies. Did I mention there is no possibility to set difficulty level?
<br>
<br>tl;dr: non existent story, repetitiveness, extremely dumb AI (in a tactic game!!). Not even worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halfway/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383844">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- nice music (though not very varied)
<br>- some sense of immersion and atmosphere
<br>- the combat works, more or less
<br>
<br>The mixed:
<br>- a simple combat system overall, it&apos;s much like XCOM Enemy Unknown, with 2 action points per turn, but you can also make an aimed shot (~simplified JA2)
<br>- the graphics of the soldiers and objects are pixelated and would look fine if not the highly-detailed GUI elements which use crisp native-size pixels
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- can&apos;t save in the middle of a mission
<br>- ranged weapons have too low accuracy even at 1 tile range, so in the first missions you may end up using mostly melee attacks which feels strange
<br>- camera attempts to follow the selected character all the time which doesn&apos;t feel right; also giving orders is not allowed until movement has finished - feels clumsy
<br>- missions are linear and small, enemies appear when you pass trigger tiles - and after you&apos;ve killed that first wave, the level is done (or there are more scripted waves); the missions feel even more scripted than they are in XCOM EU
<br>- I never understood what &quot;retaliate&quot; does. They should have just kept &quot;overwatch&quot; like in XCom or a turn interrupt like in JA2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halfway/user-reviews?user_review_id=6008785">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed playing straight through the story line over the course of a couple days and look forward to making some more content myself. I wish it had more music and perhaps a little more variety in content such as weapons and items, but it&apos;s certainly worth its asking price and a no-brain-er if purchased on sale or as part of a bundle.</span>
