Very cheap and sharp player movement, weird player rebounding as well as player details definitely disappoint. The only positive thing can be said about its sound (so what) and slightly about the graphics (which however do not help the gameplay). I was definitely expecting something more in terms of gameplay atributes than technical ones from EA which has gained &quot;unlimited experience&quot; in these kind of areas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nba-live-06/user-reviews?user_review_id=383881">Expand</a></span>
