Clever AI and a cool Sci-Fi storyline make this a must have in my opinion. Graphics could be better and the sound isn&apos;t earth shattering but the gameplay is great fun.</span>

These days to find a really unique FPS isn&apos;t to look for a FPS at all. FOr the genre to change these days. Its going to have to include some major makovers. And, I am positive more than half of you, not even me, could think of an idea to quench that thirst. Might as well be thirsty for what is good. And this game is an average story with amature voice acting. But overall, the action is fun. And it brings tactical gameplay for when you are in less of a mood for mindless mass-kill. The best part is, there arent a lot of Sci-Fi shooters without Demons, monsters, and out of this world aliens. This one feels a little more real. Liek a sci fi TV show. Something liek Stargate or Outer Limits Sci Fi. If you like sci-fi and the price seems certainly worth it, dont pass it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=404778">Expand</a></span>

Had this come out in 1998 or so it would have earned a Metacritic score of around 80, I&apos;d guess, but its design is almost embarrassingly outdated today.  However, I grew up with the evolution of shooters through the 1990s and Alpha Prime is a satisfying throwback for gamers in their 30s, like me.  I give this game a solid 7 because it&apos;s now a $5 direct download from Amazon, except that it was part of their 2010 end-of-year sale and I paid literally pocket change for it:  $1.25.  This game is still worth $5 easily, almost *because* there are plenty of amusingly nostalgic gameplay elements for people who have been around a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=1461668">Expand</a></span>

In this case, there is none. I have never played a worse FPS in my entire life. I&apos;m able to play through [most] FPS games on the highest difficulty setting with very little trouble, due to the fact that the games have decent mechanics that allow for the player to use the environment to their advantage in order to stay alive.
<br>
<br>Not so in this game. Yes, you can take cover behind things such as boxes, but if you do, you are pinned down completely. Most rooms have at least five enemies in them, which are horrible AIs that have been equipped with instant-detection capabilities, inhuman reaction time and accuracy, and apparently endless magazines of bullets. In the four hours I played this game, I never once saw an enemy reload. All they did was aim directly at the player and spam bullets until you either died or somehow managed to kill them. Then, once they&apos;re dead, they [most of the time] drop their weapon, only for the player to pick it up and realize that the magazine size is only good for [at most] five seconds of continuous fire.
<br>
<br>As for the health system, I have never before encountered such a heavily-skewed health scale in my life. Enemies can take twenty bullets to the face before going down, but you can barely take two to the chest. This wouldn&apos;t be so bad if there were more resources available to the player, but medkits are few, far between, and extremely ineffective.
<br>
<br>The weapon selection in this game is extremely limited, and so is ammunition. Never before have I played a game for over an hour and still only have two guns. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not expecting Borderlands 2-esque gun variety, but even games that only allow you to carry 1-3 weapons at a time generally have a few more unique weapons that you encounter. Additionally, while you will pick up ammunition from fallen enemies, you generally only get a handful of bullets, even though the enemies are capable of laying down a continuous stream of bullets for an indefinite amount of time. (I tested this out. I crouched behind a box for ten minutes in a room with one other enemy. There was literally no interruption in the stream of bullets, and he never moved from his original position.)
<br>
<br>Game mechanics are completely messed up. The control scheme is decent, but nothing is as responsive as it is in almost every other game I&apos;ve ever played. For some reason, you have to crank the mouse sensitivity up incredibly high in order to have any sort of decent cornering/aiming speed, even if you have a mouse with on-the-fly DPI switching and you turn the mouse all the way up. The &quot;peek&quot; function is worthless, because apparently even though you&apos;re only extending your head out from behind cover, the hitbox extends all the way to the floor, as if you were crouching next to the box, rather than peeking out from behind it.
<br>
<br>Graphics are so-so. Artistically, it&apos;s very well executed, and I have no complaints about model quality, texture quality, ambiance, etc. The problem I have with the graphical style is the fact that everything looks like it&apos;s been wrapped in plastic or sprayed with a glossifier of some sort. I have this same complaint about DOOM 3. It really breaks realism of a game when literally every surface is shiny. Even games developed on the Source engine are more believable than this, despite the age of the engine and its limitations.
<br>
<br>The music is decent, but extremely repetitive. If you&apos;re a fan of things like Deadmau5, you&apos;ll probably really, really enjoy the style of music used in this game. However, if you expect any sort of variety in a song, you will be sorely disappointed.
<br>
<br>The characters are very human and believable, so this is the one aspect of this game that I cannot fault for any reason.
<br>
<br>Overall, I would consider this game to be terrible. I have gotten frustrated at games in the past when they&apos;re incredibly difficult, but I have never in my life actually gotten angry enough to immediately uninstall the game after closing out of it; until now, that is. Had I not gotten this in the Bohemia Interactive Humble Weekly Sale along with ten other games for $6, I would feel shafted by it and would likely try to get a refund. Do NOT buy this game unless you enjoy horrible mechanics, crappy gameplay, underdeveloped AI, and/or general lack of creativity. Even Carrier Command: Gaea Mission is better than this trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988079">Expand</a></span>

I bought it for $2.70 off steam and it is truly worth at least 10. The physics, graphics and hud are great. AI can be dumb sometimes. Voice acting is par, cut scenes should be shorter. The gameplay is standard but it is still fun to play.</span>

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get the good stuff out of the way. I really like the fresh IP growing here. The story is solid, if a little cliche, and the world-building is very well done for such a short game. The game paces itself well, and I really love the soundtrack. The game requires a modicum of strategy, and it&apos;s next to impossible to run-and-gun. The level design is interesting, if a little linear. The ReCon hacking mechanic is a neat little quirk that&apos;s far too underused.
<br>
<br>Finally, the graphics are great. No, they&apos;re downright gorgeous. The human faces are unique and recognizable, and even on the highest graphical settings I was playing quite smoothly. The clear surfaces ripple and reflect light in a realistic manner, and the shadows are very well-done.
<br>
<br>Now, onto the reason for my low score.
<br>
<br>The weapon choices are mediocre at best (the melee attack becomes useless within two maps and I rarely found myself using the shotgun or flamethrower due to their ineffectiveness at long range), and the explosives (rockets and grenades) are about as effective as a bunny&apos;s fart if not aimed perfectly at your target. I found myself relying very heavily on the sniper rifle early on, since the primary automatic weapon was not yet effective against the enemies in the game. Somehow it feels like the enemies get weaker later on... I have no possible explanation for that except the game becomes more balanced the longer your play it.
<br>
<br>The same physics applied to objects is applied to the player, when normally the player is much stronger. Even a slight incline on a &quot;smooth&quot; surface (such as the lid of a container) was enough to send me sliding slowly backwards. The vehicle physics are &quot;meh&quot; at best. Once heights high enough to induce fall damage arrive, there&apos;s next to no feedback when fall damage takes place, and the height at which your character takes fall damage is very, very low.
<br>
<br>The writing is perhaps the weakest aspect of Alpha Prime. The dialogue is very forced, and the characters tend to be stereotypical. The woman who shouts in your earpiece is sexually promiscuous, the black character uses &quot;punk-ass&quot; as many times as is legal, and the main antagonist is a cruel military commander, taking pleasure in torturing prisoners. The hero is a disgruntled prospector, one of the few people not affected by exposure to the game&apos;s MacGuffin, Hubbardium. The intro cutscene features two throw-away characters and the protagonist, Arnold, drinking in a bar. This scene becomes an exposition dump as the female love interest strides in, wearing shiny latex and a plunging neckline, taking a seductive pose on a table while she speaks very seriously about a rescue mission she wants to recruit Arnold for. It lasts for almost five minutes, explaning events that happened before the game and still somehow not cutting down the cutscene content later on in the game.
<br>
<br>The voice acting ranges from good (the antagonist&apos;s dialogue is strong) to laughably parodic (Paolo Bellini delivers his lines with a disinterested monotone and hilarious Italian accent), and the overall quality of the game suffers for it. I feel that the poorer VA jobs suffer mostly from the poor writing: many crutch phrases pop up during the dialogue, and the tone and vocabulary of the long-running characters tends to change over time. Additionally, the dialogue pacing is very sporadic. The lines tend to flow with each line of the (hilariously typo-ridden) subtitles, so longer sentences get broken up with awkward pauses in the middle of clauses.
<br>
<br>Most of the other negative reviewers already complained about the difficulty, so I&apos;ll just clarify things a bit: The game is not hard due to engine mechanics. The problem arises from poor design: Enemy weapons are extremely powerful over long ranges and the enemy AI has near-perfect aim. These combine to make traversing a single hallway inordinately difficult.
<br>
<br>The final problem is the lack of an autosave feature. I know it&apos;s petty, but this isn&apos;t 1998 here. Upon death, the only options are to load from the start of the level, load from the last Quicksave, and return to the main menu.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game has lots of very good ideas. New IP, a solid story, amazing graphics with a low performance threshold, a design document that&apos;s essentially Valve&apos;s &quot;Raising the Bar&quot; copy-pasted, and a strong gameplay hampered by poor AI, weak player weapons, hilarious voice talent, and a silly script. If this game hadn&apos;t been $2 on Steam when I purchased it, I would have felt as disappointed as I felt when I paid full price for Mirror&apos;s Edge. As it stands, I can only say it&apos;s worth about what I paid. Buy it when it&apos;s on sale and give it a shot, but be prepared to throw your keyboard against the wall in frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=2470659">Expand</a></span>

However i can comfortably say that the game poses difficulty.... in an unfair manor as the enemies shoot right through walls. the story isn&apos;t terrible but it was fairly standard. The graphics for its time are fairly decent so i cant give this an overly bad rating a below average of 4 is exactly how this game preformed. it is below average and i honestly wouldn&apos;t recommend playing this game it is okay BUT its a very rough ride all the way through. All the AI are just pathetic But what i think saves this game from a worse rating is its excellent use of bullet-time which is well done to say the least. now the level design its well done for it&apos;s time but nothing to be amazed about there are places where you will get stuck or be clueless in the exact direction you should go. But it isn&apos;t worth buying all in all perhaps if it was cheaper but even then it isn&apos;t worthy as a game that deserves the praise it received.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=3880171">Expand</a></span>

They are obviously cut and pasting the doom 3 engine, yet they somehow even managed to make the visuals more bland. Every aspect of this game fails. From the AI interaction, to the gameplay, the plot, the weapons, the sound. It feels like it was released in 2002 which is the only way it could have been taken seriously. I&apos;m glad I got the demo. This is a game that would make you regret spending a dollar on. They should consider releasing it for free and just using product placement since it was obviously made to try and make a quick buck as opposed to having any relevance in today&apos;s fps market. I guess they can&apos;t all be half-life 2. A game like Alpha Prime makes you appreciate the good ones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=411720">Expand</a></span>

The acting is not bad at all, the characters are interesting and the story is pretty good. I am not an FPS noob, having played virtually every major one since the original Wolfenstein and Doom. I really like the fact that combat isn&apos;t &quot;run and gun&quot; like so many shooters. It takes thought and planning. I had to save often, and many times had to re-do a room or fight sequence that I just got killed in. The graphics and sound are very nice. The weapons are typical shooter fare, but I like the addition of the flame thrower... very cool. The game also takes a nice piece from F.E.A.R. with bullet time, but you need to reload it with Hubbardium (like finding med kits), so you get used to using it more strategically. I also really liked the hacking feature. Overall it is a great game, especially for the $20 value! Nothing earth shattering, but what it tries to do it does very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=416207">Expand</a></span>

It does have some decent graphics, and manages to have levels that DON&apos;T seem like a straight path, but I found the controls to be jerky, and the voice acting sad. If it had been reworked a little I&apos;m sure it could have made a great game.</span>

(btw you can download the soundtrack from the official website) As far as the story goes it won&apos;t win any awards but its alright for a fps i guess.. Oh and this game is hard even on normal settings.. Prepare to get killed a lot hehe If it weren&apos;t for some minor little bugs i&apos;d probably would have given it an 8 out of 10. Anyway im looking forward to Black Element&apos;s future projects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=415616">Expand</a></span>

The levels are all fairly decent, with a nice mix of industrial settings and a fair bit of detail. The AI is pretty bad, but that&apos;s more or less standard fare for this caliber of shooter. Overall, not a bad game, not a great game - but definitely worth a look!</span>

Sure, Alpha Prime is nothing extraordinary, but it&apos;s not crap by any means either.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a standard corridor FPS with a story. If you like FPS games, there is nothing to complain about here, aside from perhaps the difficulty being a bit too high. I&apos;ve played on Easy and even then some sections were unusually hard and caused me to die many times.
<br>
<br>The story isn&apos;t bad either. Again, it&apos;s nothing groundbreaking, but for an FPS game it&apos;s pretty decent. Most FPS games don&apos;t make anywhere near the effort in the story department as Alpha Prime does. The cutscenes and the radio dialogue sections between the characters were a nice addition to keep the game interesting. Most characters were developed reasonably well in terms of personality.
<br>
<br>The graphics are very nice. Considering the game came out in 2007, those are pretty decent visuals, even by today&apos;s standards. The music is also not bad. There are only about 1 or 2 jarring heavy rock tracks, but the rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and gives a nice epic feel to the battles.
<br>
<br>The enemy variety could&apos;ve certainly used some work. You spend a good 80% of the game just fighting spec ops, which gets repetitive eventually. There are some other gameplay sections added too, like hacking, and using a loader to move boxes out of the way, which is a nice change of pace, even if some sections were quite annoying. The loader in particular was difficult to control, and having to move a dozen of boxes out of the way just felt like a waste of time.
<br>
<br>In general the game is not as bad as the reviews claim it to be. It&apos;s just a standard, above average FPS that will keep you entertained for a few hours. If you are into the genre, give it a try, otherwise pass it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=6092147">Expand</a></span>

<br>-environments don&apos;t have much variety even the last cavern styled place but you really can&apos;t expect much else from a low oxygen environment on some rock.
<br>-Hopping onto the tram feels awkward considering the jump causes you to bounce off stuff as soon as you so much as nudge the ceiling or edge of something, they really should have turned off that bounce affect to give it smooth movement like half-life
<br>-falling damage is ridiculous, you can&apos;t fall more than 1 meter without taking damage, made me scared to do anything</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123298">Expand</a></span>

For this review I am not going to spoil anything in this review, even though the story isn&apos;t very exciting i will just give a brief summary of the starting story as an exception. It revolves around protaganist who is recruited to rescue a friend from an evil space corporation, while fighting enemies.
<br>
<br>Visually, this game&apos;s graphics aren&apos;t the best around, but they do look OK and do a tolerable job. The art style fits the game&apos;s setting and overall story well in my opinion. The particle effects are nice however, like when I shoot a wall it sprays dust everywhere, but there&apos;s not much more to it. Graphics are overall OK.
<br>
<br>The shooting mechanics are a bit awkward at times, as the enemies take up a lot of bullets before they fall dead and it is hard to tell if you hit your target, as the cross-hair is very thick and wide and blood doesn&apos;t fly out of your enemies very far,so long distance shooting is a bit of a chore. But the difficulty almost killed the whole experience for me. I played the game on normal difficulty (Out of Easy, Normal or Hard) and found the game becoming a grind after playing for about 45 minutes. If an enemy catches you before you can react, you can be killed by even the lowest level enemies, taking off lots of health with few bullets. Now, imagine that but times 15 and having to defend someone on however much ammo and health you have. That explains a tedious, grind-worthy defense level, which took multiple attempts for me. My problem with the difficulty is that it&apos;s misleading how difficult it actually is, and the unbalanced level design prior to enemy placement. I don&apos;t even want to play on hard, after i got my arse kicked on normal difficulty.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack for the game isn&apos;t too special itself, but fits well and reminds me of the Quake 2 soundtrack a lot, which is a good thing.
<br>
<br>After playing for about 4 hours, I haven&apos;t come across any really bad bugs, aside from the gaming crashing every time I try to leave.
<br>
<br>So to conclude, Alpha Prime is an OK FPS that falls short in gun-play and story, but does a nice job graphically, soundtrack wise and is actually a very stable game. 6 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alpha-prime/user-reviews?user_review_id=4406385">Expand</a></span>
