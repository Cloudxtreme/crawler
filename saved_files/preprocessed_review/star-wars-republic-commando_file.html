Anyone saying, especially in 2005, that the graphics sucked is either completely full of it or was running it on the lowest settings. Gameplay is fantastic if you can get past the linear progression of the game, however I found it pleasing to not have to do much backtracking to unlock doors or find keys, etc. Also if the game weren&apos;t linear, there would not have been such large levels. The levels are spread out very well with different terrains being introduced regularly. Could have introduced more diversity with bad guys. Mostly stay the same throughout, however each level introduces more super battle droids and destroyer droids, adding to the difficulty as the game progresses. Too short, but that is very common with shooter in general, especially linear ones.<br><br>Don&apos;t know anything about multiplayer, only played the single player campaign. One of the best Star Wars games of all time, and probably the best Star Wars game since Tie Fighter.<br><br>The story was fantastic. Don&apos;t want to give away spoilers, but it is very engaging for being a linear shooter. Read the companion book series by Karen Traviss if you like the story of this game, her books in the commando series are very deep and I love her writing style which features very diverse personalities considering they&apos;re all clones. Overall, it is a solid 8/10 in 2012, was a 9.5/10 in 2005. As such I am giving it a 10 because it is a seven year old game and I couldn&apos;t give a 9.5, so I&apos;m rounding up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2132814">Expand</a></span>

I very much enjoyed this game and still delight in playing a round or two of capture the flag almost everyday. This game has proved to be challenging at some points but not crossing the line over to frustration ever. On od my favorite games. A must have for any FPS fan and even some stategy fans.</span>

If anyone tells you otherwise, they&apos;re crazy.  The story is actually interesting which - for me, anyway - is a rare thing in starwars games.  The real beauty of it is the squad gameplay, though.  Players can&apos;t storm through this game with their generic blaster-rifle-thing and expect to get far.  Instead, they have to take advantage of different parts of the environment.  Fights have to be taken on tactfully, which is far more than one can say for most mainstream games. *cough* Call of Duty *cough*  Republic Commando has been and will continue to be one of my favorite all time games.  It&apos;s a shame there aren&apos;t more games like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=1755805">Expand</a></span>

Better storytelling than games like Halo(and if you ask me better game all around). And in some places Republic Commando delivers a better simulation of real war than Call of Duty or Medal of Honor. The campaign lasted me 10-12 hours with replayability. Excellent story and characters. Everyone will find a favorite character who will stick with them forever! The characters are: Scorch- Demolitions expert and funny guy. Sev- Sniper and is distubingly funny. Fixer- Tech expert. Funny at times also, but keeps it straight. Boss- Perhaps the most boring character, but is still fun. You play through the game as him. Multiplayer: I had an absolute blast with multiplayer back in the day. It was the only game I played and was quite involved with a clan. The game allows custom content and I made some maps from time to time. I can easily see anyone enjoying multiplayer. Republic Commando 2(Imperial Commando) was announced...but cancelled. I was saddened to hear this as there&apos;s a total cliffhanger at the end, and I&apos;m pretty mad that I won&apos;t find out what happens. Only bad thing about this game is Boss&apos;s dialog. It&apos;s far too generic for my taste, but that&apos;s just me. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes tactical gameplay, Star Wars, or being a total badass who can take down anyone. Give it a try for $10 on Steam!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=739588">Expand</a></span>

Even though it was released at probably the wrong time of the 2005 (competing against games like Gran Turismo 4 and Devil May Cry 3), Republic Commando still holds it&apos;s ground as being one of the smartest shooters of the sixth generation&apos;s twilight year, and I often look upon it today as the second best Star Wars game I&apos;ve played to date (behind Battlefront II, of course!), and sort of a cult hit among others.
<br>
<br>Republic Commando begins during the Battle of Geonosis in Episode II, and ends with the Battle of Kashyyyk in Episode III. The player is thrown into the shoes of RC-1138 (also known as Boss&quot;), the squad leader of the Republic commando squad Delta. Alongside your character, of course, we have three other commandos that form up your team: The wise-cracking demolitions expert Scorch, the headstrong sniper Sev, and the by-the-book tech expert Fixer. All four characters are instantly likable the second you meet them in the game, and could easily be some of the best written characters I&apos;ve met (I love the jokes that Scorch makes and the banter that he has with Sev!).
<br>
<br>Gameplay is kinda similar to games such as Rainbow Six and SWAT; point and order your squadmate to do a certain action (eg, set an explosive charge, focus fire on one target, heal up at a bacta dispensing station, or  set up a sniping position.). It&apos;s simple, but it works really well. Now and then your squadmates go down, and it&apos;s up to you or another squad member to revive them, but if you go down, then it&apos;s not game over, since one of your still standing squad members can still revive you. Normally, they will have to clear all enemies before reviving you, but in tense situations, you can take a risk and order them to revive you (eg. Sev is incapacitated. You go over to revive him, but you go down as well. Fixer and Scorch are still up fighting, and won&apos;t revive you until all enemies are dead, but if you&apos;re desperate to get up, you can order one of them to come and revive you. Once all enemies are dead, then you can revive Sev and continue the mission.) It&apos;s only game over if everyone goes down.
<br>
<br>Sound is also a good spot in the game. All the music is suitable at the right parts of the game, and all the voice acting is done really well!
<br>
<br>There&apos;s one downside to the single-player though: It&apos;s short, like, VERY short. The average time to beat the game is around 3-4 hours. I won&apos;t spoil anything, but the game&apos;s ending didn&apos;t help either, leaving the door open for a sequel (which STILL hasn&apos;t happened yet!)
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also multiplayer, but is alright to my standards, but not great. It&apos;s still worth playing from time to time, though.
<br>
<br>The single-player may be short, and the multiplayer is considered mediocre (to me!), but nothing stops Republic Commando from being one of the best first-person shooters I&apos;ve played, and one of the best Star Wars games that I&apos;ve played. Hopefully EA listens to fans and make that sequel. I&apos;m just itching to see Delta Squad again......</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=3457480">Expand</a></span>

I have had a lot of fun with this game.  I really like how it depicts a more violent side of Star Wars.  There is loads of blood and gore, intense violence, and even a bit of language to make this game feel different than most Star Wars experiences.  There is even a bit of humor from your squad-mates to go along the way.  The AI of this game is absolutely fantastic.  If you order your troops to do anything, then they will do it without question.  You can hear the enemies giving orders as well.  The Unreal engine is used very well.  It made the game look and feel great.  The physics of the game are as realistic as the feel of the soldiers.  However, this game is not without its flaws.  My only real complaint about this game is that it is way too short.  The campaign is something you could speed through in just 10 hours.  Unless, of course, you&apos;re the kind of gamer who makes many mistakes.  The multiplayer experience overall, is just average.  The multiplayer here is no different from the kind that people have come to see from games such as Team Fortress 2, or Halo.  Other than those two flaws, the game is very good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2162322">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Story:
<br>You take control of clone RC-01/138 (aka Delta-38 and &quot;Boss&quot;) and you&apos;re the leader of an elite squad of a total of 4 clones, 40 (aka &quot;Fixer&quot;) the brains, computer specialist and smartypants of the team, 62 (aka &quot;Scorch&quot;) the demolitions expert and goofball and 07 (aka Sev) the fierce hunter and cold-blooded killer. You start your first mission on planet Geonosis, where the Clones would make their debut in Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones.
<br>
<br>As the game goes along, I grew an emotional bond with the other members of my squad, caring for them and all that. The Single-player campaign is brilliant because of this. There are a Lot of memorable moments of the squad&apos;s conversations with each other (much like Battlefield: Bad Company), whether it&apos;s deep and emotional or humouristic. In summary, the character development is absolutely stunning.
<br>
<br>The gameplay:
<br>As stated earlier, the game is a squad-based first-person shooter, and it utilizes this mechanic extremely well.
<br>There are 4 different kinds of Republic weapons for your squad including grenades of different features (thermal detonators, stun grenades and EMP grenades for example), and throughout the game there are certain points where you can assign your squad-mates to a certain position with a certain weapon, which puts in a lot of strategy into it, all depending on what kind of adversary the squad is up against.
<br>
<br>The graphics:
<br>The game runs on Unreal Engine 2, and the game is Gorgeous to say the least. However, there is a famous issue about this game called &quot;Bump mapping&quot;, which adds a lot more realistic and dynamic lighting and shadows to every corner of the game, which was specialized on Nvidia graphics cards and not so much on other brands like ATI, so many people could have issues with this feature as the game would certainly look better with Bump Mapping enabled.
<br>This is kind of a nitpick though, because the game is beautiful with or without it.
<br>
<br>You might think that the Steam version would have fixed this issue, but unfortunately the problem is still present there.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>Republic Commando is one of the most underrated Star Wars games out there, and it BEGS for a sequel, but even today, 8 years later, we have yet to see any new announcements on a new Republic Commando game.
<br>
<br>This is one of those games that was executed almost perfectly as I would only encounter one or two AI glitches throughout a single-player campaign of 7-8 hours.
<br>But it doesn&apos;t end there, there is also a multiplayer mode where you can play against each other in standard game modes like Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag and such.
<br>
<br>I guess you could call this game an &quot;Underrated Gem&quot;, and I urge you to play it!
<br>The only negative I have to say about this game is the bump mapping issue, which is a huge nitpick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465634">Expand</a></span>

There are three main levels which wouldn&apos;t be terrible if the first one didn&apos;t feel like an extra long tutorial.

Was this resolved in a book that I haven&apos;t read?

It feels a lot like Halo, but with some squad-based elements tacked on.  And it&apos;s really not as short as other reviews would have you think--8 hours is pretty standard for an FPS.  The action is good, if a bit too scripted and linear.  Its major problem seems to be the lack of variety: levels go on forever; there are only three locales; only about three types of enemies; you can only have one pickup weapon at a time; endless door breaches.  Regardless, the action is pretty much constant and the squad commands work well once you remember the keys and icon meanings.  The graphics are still decent even by today&apos;s standards, even though the bump maps are a bit low-res.  Sound and music were okay--nothing special.  Voiceovers were good and occasionally humorous.  Controls were fine.   And finally, stability was great.  Overall, a good take on Star Wars combat, and I&apos;m glad I played it even if I could only take about an hour of the nonstop / tedious action at a time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2448728">Expand</a></span>

Even is in the 2000&apos; era of gaming, this FPS is much better than FPS from actual year. I&apos;m still playing it. Too bad the sequel has been cancelled.</span>

I can&apos;t emphasize the linear gameplay enough, it literally consists of single passageways that you follow throughout the entire campaign. There are only a handful of weapons, and the enemies barely change throughout the campaign.<br><br>Second, the input lag is horrendous, even if you have a high-end PC. The mouse sensitivity settings are either far too high or far too low. This is the kind of basic optimization that should be expected for a franchise game like this.<br><br>Lastly, the atmosphere fails to give the gamer the Star Wars feel. I can&apos;t explain why, but it lacks the evil, or even badass, &apos;stormtrooper&apos; feel.<br><br>If this wasn&apos;t a Star Wars game, I would never have bought it. I gave a 4 instead of a 3 because the game is old, and the graphics reflect that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2080197">Expand</a></span>

The story is driven, action packed, nice music for the cinematic experience. My only and 100% only gripe about the game is that the Multiplayer SUCKS. Besides that Id give the single player alone a 9. Bad Multi a 7.</span>

                                        <span>&quot;Star Wars Halo&quot; sums up this game pretty well. It seems to try hard to copy the mold of many other FPS games without actually innovating and making a better product. But if you like those type of games you will enjoy Republic Commando. Bear in mind the game is quite short and the multiplayer is lackluster. If this wasn&apos;t a Star Wars game it would be a 6/10.</span>

Even though you&apos;re a cookie cutter clone trooper squad they continue to throw new weapons at you throughout the game from dead enemies to break up the monotony. It also tends to poke fun at itself, with squadmates remarking about the repetitiveness of certain mission objectives.

<br>
<br>It makes squad control simple, responsive and rewarding, and although it is a linear game, it never gets constrictive, with the ability in some levels to blow up fuel tanks to make a sniping position etc. as well as choice of where to put your commandos, whether to breach doors or stealth slice through them, and the occasional side route or air vent to sneak through.
<br>
<br>Must buy for anyone into Star Wars and their games, as well as any casual OR hardcore shooter fan, due to  difficulty settings drastically changing the tactics and approach to fights, to the point you have tactics for each unit type, and group of mixed unit types (eg. EMP grenades for large droid groups). Even if you find the game too repetitive, it is unique and you will certainly enjoy something out of your experience, the only bad thing being nVidia&apos;s bumpmapping being broken on modern cards.

Released in 2005, after eight years it still looks fantastic and, above all, the gameplay is still breathtaking. It reminds me a lot of Rainbow Six: Vegas, but this is even better I believe, since the fantastic elements of the Star Wars series add a more varied and interesting gameplay.  The plot is very linear and well structured: although the story is not that striking or moving (it is a first-person shooter after all) the levels get  more and more intense as you play the game. Maybe one flaw of the game is a not so intelligent AI, or  the fact that tactical positions are pretty obvious, predetermined; anyhow, this avoids a lot of possible bugs. Plus, it is a 2005 game, so we can&apos;t have the same expectations we&apos;d have with a game released in 2013.  All in all, although I haven&apos;t played many Star Wars games, I think this is one of the best of the series. It is definitely worth its current price, and it&apos;s definitely still worth playing. I&apos;m giving it a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439594">Expand</a></span>

The nightvision mode looks plain amazing, and the guns look and feel real.</span>

Squad mechanics is one of the best I&apos;ve seen in a first person shooter though the AI could use a bit more polishing, its still better than some of the NPC teammates from other more contemporary shooters. The linear progression is fine as it portrays the story in a good pace. Not everything needs to go sandbox people. Squad mechanics are well placed with a very responsive Squad AI. Enemies are brutal and will really make you appreciate the different variety of droids in the Separatist Army. Graphics are a bit dated and could have used some works even when it was originally released.
<br>
<br>In sum, this is possibly one of the best Star Wars game I&apos;ve played next to Battlefront 2 and KOTOR and its definitely worth the buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=3402774">Expand</a></span>

The AI does what you tell it to do, so make sure to use the commands for the best experience. The voice acting is also very good, with the squaddies engaging in active conversations. It (the voices) can get a little repetitive at times, but not as much as Call Of Duty or even Battlefield. The strategy aspects of this game make it extremely versatile, and is playable even if you are a poor first-person shooter player.
<br>All in all, this is a fantastic game and a great buy for $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=2843075">Expand</a></span>

And don&apos;t even get me started on glitches. When I load up a game I start at the first of the level? I don&apos;t even know how that happens. Not only that I can freaking kill myself, where I was when I saved I can just kill the white clone (Apparently me) standing there.  And sometimes I just fall through the floor when I&apos;m walking across on the ghost thing ship level. And stop with the mutiplayer hacking. Other than that stuff and glitches it is one of the most epic games I ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=3155782">Expand</a></span>

If you have been thinking of trying this game, think no longer, just do it and do it now! I promise you, you will not regret it! Best Star Wars game ever!</span>

<br>There are many factors that make this game so fantastic from creative environmental, weapon and character designs to the innovative gameplay mechanics that this game introduces.
<br>
<br>I love the protagonist and his three squad mates each one adding more flavour to the overall gameplay experience, each of the squad mates usually  had an opinion on how to attack an area strategically in a certain fashion, they also had skills unique to each soldier,  for instance one was a demolitions expert another an expert with a sniper rifle and the last a master with hacking computer consoles, these three factors are always useful in combat situations.
<br>
<br>I am disappointed that they did not  end up marketing a sequel, I hope that a republic commando sequel may show up in the not so distant future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=3939415">Expand</a></span>

Bummer, if it is great, then I would give it a 10/10, but thats not the reason I didn&apos;t give it a 10/10, I give it a 9/10 because its not that long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=6036674">Expand</a></span>

However, the game suffers from a lot of problems. Organic enemies are incredibly easy to bring down, while robotic enemies will chew through most of your ammunition in slow, drawn out, frustratingly difficult and unsatisfying fights. At one point, a glitch left one of my squad members stuck behind, which made the following mini-boss battle intensely difficult. Graphics haven&apos;t held up well at all, with an over faded atmosphere extending into long, protracted, homogeneous levels. When your squad gets into position and a real fire fight starts, the game suddenly becomes very fun again, with you directing AI squad mates in the heat of the battle, but these moments are too few and far between.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327523">Expand</a></span>

First of all it is buggy: screen resolution didn&apos;t work and you had to set the bump mapping on low to prevent crashing. Graphically it wasn&apos;t top either, which may be related to previous point. The team element is sometimes very annoying since they sometimes do not react very well. The biggest complain I have is about the weaponry: the laser guns are not precise and do not have a big impact on some enemies. On top of that some are way too strong. On the other hand I prefer this over boring light saber duels. The music is pretty good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247686">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Republic Commando&apos;s sustained by its sense of coordination and teamwork. You grow to rely on your team, and genuinely feel exposed and weakened when not backed by your AI partners. Voice work is great and, as I said above, brings this game from decent to great.
<br>
<br>That said, there are some weaknesses. Shooting&apos;s not dreadful, but does lack punch. AI can interact with targets and the environment, but there&apos;s no way to arrange door breaches or tactical movement outside of the (thankfully common) interaction points. Last but not least, I encountered a handful of bugs that forced me to reload to earlier checkpoints more than once.
<br>
<br>Still a great game, still definitely worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=5841374">Expand</a></span>

The game has very enjoyable characters and the voice acting is pretty good. It runs on Epic Game&apos;s Unreal engine 2. My only minor nit picks is that some of the weaker enemies were very bullet spongey(that means they took a lot to kill). And the single player was really short. Little do most people know there was going to be a sequel called Imperial commando. But the idea was scrapped. With this game is either you love or hate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-republic-commando/user-reviews?user_review_id=5981250">Expand</a></span>
