The game is very much like Elite if you are old enough to remember that, it&apos;s a space trading, fighting game that is best enjoyed with a very slow deliberate and relaxed pace in mind. Other than frantic fighting that takes real skill, and preparations (change to correct missiles and guns, the battle is over in seconds... wrong guns, wrong missiles... minutes or hours.) There is so much to discover and learn that if you enjoy this kind of open ended exploration/mining/trading/&quot;x-wing&quot; style combat then you will like this game. The main storyline is pretty average, with absolutely AWFUL acting. Most lines are delivered similar to a really bad high school... no, better make that elementary school play. What is fun for me is just nosing around, experimenting and finding new stuff, plus the visuals are fantastic. (on a dual core, with 4gb of memory and dual sli nvidia 512mb cards- your milage may vary.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-force-rogue-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=401419">Expand</a></span>

Combined with the music it creates the best space-sim feeling in a game I have played. Third reason, the fights. Tough adrenaline pumping action. Forth reason is the exploration. Many systems to explore, many species, many secrets. The game has a few downsides, like the steep learning curve, short story and repetetive missions. However, it&apos;s better to have an advanced game than a simple one and the non story-mode gameplay is almost as fun as the story-mode. So the biggest downside is repetetive missions, but that doesn,t matter much when you want to fix medals and explore the galaxy. SpaceForce: Rouge Universe is simply one of the best sci-fi games if you like the feeling of really explore space in a beautiful and fantastic way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-force-rogue-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=2141792">Expand</a></span>

It took them approx a year to get out the latest patch and it didnt even fix the most fundemental bugs to be fixed. As for factions well irrespective if you go pirates well you will still do the campaign for the emd, freemode is a joke , just plain boring, the quest system is this complete botched randomised cheap as hell feeling quest system that after you have played 30 mins you have seen ever quest type in the game. On the forum all that are left are the diehard fans or just plain deluded or people that want you to buy this dire game so you are in the ssame boat as themselves(This is my view - most I have seen on the forums is 4, they start polls and post positive so it looks like everyone likes the game, the fact is most people have played and moved on because it is such a dissapointment) I have played and got into all space genre games of recent years some of which include Freelancer X X3 Darkstar One and trust me SF RU bring nothing new to the table, I know of a total indie developer who made a game evochron renegades, the game is only 30MB approx in size and while it isnt perfect by a long shot it is still a better game than SF RU, also with evochron renegades the SOLO developer beings out better quality updates and 100* faster than this so called non indie developer - provox aka jowood You want my view as a person who is an avid rpg/strat/MMO fan, dont buy this game - Its graphics is what people must be reviewing on, this sickens me as to me a game should be about gameplay so in my view its getting far higher reviews than it deserves. I play old 8 bit and freeware games 10* more fun than SF RU yet reviewers put good reviews out because it looks nice :( Please stop reviewing games on glitz its just making it harder for those of us who want content and diversity to not get ripped off by bad reviewing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-force-rogue-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=413081">Expand</a></span>

There isnt any multiplayer yet but there &quot;might&quot; be down the road,The Advertisement on Steam stateing that there is multiplay is a mistake by Steam not the developer or the publisher. Overall the game is Great,i say buy it if ya like space games.</span>

Not only that, but the game has an &quot;unfinished&quot; feel to it. Like they got about half way done and said &quot;eh, this will do.&quot;</span>

What&apos;s really amazing is how much effort went into the game on the basic stuff -- engine, art, etc. -- and how little effort went into directing this to a great gaming experience. In the grand scheme of things, it takes relatively little money to hire a good writer/designer, compared to the rest of the investment. If only they had done that, this game would absolutely sing. As it is, it sinks like a stone. They hired an incompetent 19-year-old student with zero experience to do the entire mission design and writing. He did even worse than you&apos;d imagine. Do not even consider buying this game until you have tried the demo! You&apos;ll easily see from the demo how bad it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-force-rogue-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=398715">Expand</a></span>

However, this is &quot;the&quot; single most expansive sci-fi flight sim I have ever played. Not only does it offer in-game benchmarks for Dx10, it offers a galaxy of star systems and planets, factions and multiple game-play options. Beautiful game with lots of flight controls.</span>

<br>
<br>I suggest you never buy this, not only because it&apos;s a dreamcatcher crap, but because it&apos;s nothing new or creative, we&apos;ve seen hundreds of games like this one already. They bring nothing new to the genre... Play the old X-universe series (not the Rebirth one, it sucks big time) and not only it will be the same but will cost you waaaayyy less money... graphics will be quite similar too since Spaceforce is rather dated when it come to graphics , like we had those 10 years ago.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-force-rogue-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386622">Expand</a></span>
