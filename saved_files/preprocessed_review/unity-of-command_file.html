I am very pleased with this game. Design, artificial intelligence and user interface are the best I&apos;ve seen among turn based wargames. Research and gameplay are really good also, and I wonder how such small independent studio (two guys basically!!) made such solid, stable and interesting game that is suitable for newcomers and veterans of wargaming. But yeah, nobody is perfect, so better multiplayer system and ability to undo last move would make Unity of Command even better. The good thing is that actually developers actively support their game so we can expect more ecxiting news in future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2159568">Expand</a></span>

Has a lot of scenarios to play, and seems to be a big community. For a wargame it is beautiful, normally we are use to 20 year old sprites but this one has a perfect UI and graphics, challenging, elegent game, Superb!</span>

I&apos;ve only played a little bit of it, but so far I&apos;m enjoying it a lot. It&apos;s a fairly simple game, but getting into it might take you a little while. The visuals in the game work very well, and the interface is nice and &apos;clean&apos;. You control a number of different divisions during the invasion of Russia. When advancing towards your objectives, you need to consider the consequences of what you&apos;re doing - if your supply line is broken, you&apos;re going to have a tough time, because without supplies your units can&apos;t attack. The game allows a lot of different tactical options, which is very good. You&apos;ll have to get a bit smart in order to defeat your enemy, because the game is fairly challenging. The game seems like it lacks a little polish - a few changes would&apos;ve made the game more convenient.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of turnbased strategy, or strategy in general, this is a must buy for this price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2701615">Expand</a></span>

It gets lots of high review scores from &apos;professional reviewers&apos;, who all seem to agree that this game depicts Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR in 1941. Too bad for them this game is based on Fall Blau, later renamed Operation Braunsweig, the 1942 summer offensive towards the Southern Soviet oil fields. The critics also get the score of this game as muddled as their history. Unity of Command is a TERRIBLE game with an incredibly limited, linear and boring scenario. The player has almost zero control of units, formations or anything else. The combat is simplicistic to the point of being asanine. It looks and feels like a game of checkers. Units move with ridiculous fluidity to instant-resolve &apos;fights&apos; that appear to be simply mathmatically randomised results. The maps are PATHETIC, lacking detail or even visual appeal. Unit cards are even worse. The UI is cluttered and confusing and the manual for the game is not existing. Frankly at $7 you would be better off getting an expensive coffeee than wasting your time that was obviously built as your standard Steam scam, a game that offers a cutesy little video offering to get your interest. Comes with an inflated user score created by the scam artists themsellves with false metacritic accounts, then sold to the unsuspecting Steam buyer on the back of your standard &apos;see no evil&apos; speak no evil&apos; &quot;pro&quot; reviews. You can believe me because I don&apos;t lie to you. This is worse than mediocre. It might be worth $2 for a masochist. You will have much more fun playing Hearts of Iron 3, if you want to play a Wargame.Or try Panzer General 3, which is at least passably fun. The Paradox development team are trying to make a serious and historic and viable war game. This is a pathetic amateursville shadow of a war game.

<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.

Its a good remake of the 90&apos;s classic panzer general, so casual gamers can get into this as well as a grognard, but grognards need to remember its not a full blown war sim. They have incorporated a pretty neat supply system, making sure all your units stay in supply is very important, but its very annoying the CPU will sacrifice 2-3 CORPS just to interfere with your supply for 1 turn, which does have a pretty heavy cause and effect, but its like the CPUs main mission in life. Since it plays like panzer general combat is not considered simultaneous so I can attack the same enemy unit with every unit I have until its defeated, not realistic but it is what it is, all you have to do is keep rotating out units that attacked and rotating in units that are fresh, each hex is considered to be 20KM so this bugs me, and this is how the CPU will always find a way through your lines to interdict your supply lines, very very annoying, Except for this I find the game fun to play and capable of stealing many hours of my life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2823897">Expand</a></span>

<br>9. Plenty potential for further improvement and development
<br>
<br>Cons: 1. Game frustratingly asks for gamekey more than once
<br>2. Game lacks depth in strategic level i.e. decisions that will affect the long term progress of the campaign. Currently, strategic decisions are limited to banking prestige and requesting elite units from Stavka or OKW reserve.
<br>3. The game is very short you can finish the whole game in 10 hours. It really feels like an extended demo/
<br>4. Campaign feels more like patching together different scenarios without any real connection between them
<br>5. The finale is disappointing. In fact, it is utterly absent.
<br>6. Inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and minimize own casualties is irrelevant for gaining or losing prestige. There is a certain scenario, that the own way to achieve BV is by sacrificing your whole army...
<br>7. Air combat is not existent. There is no concept as air superiority. The influence of air strikes is practically minimal.

Unity of command seems more like a gamelet than a game. It does get you thinking though. Supply chain and tactics are fun. Graphics are definitely a plus. But way too short and the stale map really never changes much.  They should have taken notes from Panzer Corps (and Panzer/Slitherine should have taken note of Unity&apos;s good graphics). If anything Unity makes me want to play Panzer Corps--the updated version and put Unity away (most likely for good). But I still say buy it on sale and have fun because it is fun and engaging--just too short, a little stale, and somewhat pricey for what you get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731582">Expand</a></span>

This game portrays the hard fought eastern front of ww2 as a fairy tail, with generics and odd terminology. The AI is nearly non-existent and the graphics are below normal compared to other strategy games of its kind. The number of campaigns are lacking and the tutorial is bugged completely.

The mechanics are simple yet complex (see what I did there?) enough to add a deep strategic level to each scenario. I hope more titles like this start to appear out there.</span>

A.I is strong, you don&apos;t feel the A.I is cheating to beat you.Keep it going guys. Easy to learn but hard to master. Boombastic raises the only issue and the save game/progression style needs to be tweaked a little.</span>

I note that the user that said that you have to entirely repeat the campaigns if you lose is wrong in his statement. I admit it&apos;s a little confusing to figure out, but you merely need to restart the mission and meet the victory conditions. The game is inexpensive, and I&apos;ve played and enjoyed it far more than any other game I&apos;ve purchased in years. It&apos;s mainly single player, but has multi-player via capability via internet for all the scenarios (you need to arrange the multiplayer match thru means other than the game for you to find the other party). I think the game has some minor flaws, and there is room for tons of other features if they could be thought of and implemented, but I really have to say that if you like tactical games you should not skip this one because it is challenging and unique. It is NOT a Hearts of Iron type game or the like, it is far less complex and mainly focuses on theatre tactics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3011482">Expand</a></span>

Also it&apos;s aw full to notice that there is no need to try save your troops only thing that matters is to take control of objectives in time. Makes game play somewhat funny, sometimes AI don&apos;t try to defend objectives and just attacks your non-important weak units. Weather effect seems to be designed to only interfere player what is very annoying. If you wish to full fill whole campaign you have to restart missions numerous times to get te needed weather or correct result from key attacks. Good looking game but terrible campaign and AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3584720">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was also amazed that this is produced by a four person company somewhere in Croatia, the hotbed of computer game design!

<br>Buy it on sale direct from them or on Steam and you won&apos;t be disappointed! Looking forward to further DLC and applications of the system.

                                        <span>I like turn-based games and world war II theme, so I was obvious looking for this game. Tactical options, lovely graphics and mechanics are really great but I were not still fully satisfied. Maybe, it is by lack of variety in the campaign missions or monotony which really ruined the game. Anyway, looking forward to DLC.</span>

<br>In general it is nice frame to work with, but lacks meat. There&apos;s just a single campaign, others are released as DLCs. There isn&apos;t much user created scenarios, so after 5-6 hours you&apos;re done with the game, unless you want to repeat campaign for perfect score, which is really painful, as random bad weather will make it impossible to reach objectives in time.
<br>In general the game reminds me old Panzer General, but PG is still better game. Amazingly no game got close in over 15 years.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worth to buy on sale only, due to lack of content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3934996">Expand</a></span>

You can carry over experienced units if they happen to show up in later scenarios but it can be very difficult to level up a large number of units. In addition, the game penalizes you for attempting to attempt a sound military victory and instead forces you to simply get units to objectives as fast as possible without regards to casualties or the state of your battle line, something no commander would ever ignore. Overall I give it a 6/10, it could have been much more than it is. The PG series did all of these things with a good level of balance that this game does not provide. I have not played the DLCs. One good aspect of the game is the supply function, that while frustrating, provides additional tactical considerations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3970325">Expand</a></span>

It does a great a job of balancing the need for a strong offensive while planning your supply lines turn in advance.  The AI is brutal and unforgiving if you are careless it will rip you in half.  There will also be times when bad luck with weather or when combat goes against your plans that your will be forced to replay the scenario but thats life and war.  However this game has the magic formula that will keep you coming back.  Its easy to start, very hard to master and when you do win you are actually proud of yourself.  Also this game runs like a dream on a MacBook Air or any ultrabook without killing the battery.  I actually look foward to long flight because of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=3972553">Expand</a></span>

Every so often a game comes along and I just go crazy for it, as I did with UoC.  I am admittedly late to the party, having just found the game and its DLC three months ago; but doggedly making up for lost time every day.
<br>
<br>My wargame tastes run to the turn-based.  I might be considered an old-timer in the video game world by today&apos;s kids.  But I consider myself a pioneer, an original gamer, an OG, or just a G as they say in some neighborhoods. I&apos;m of the generation labeled with the ever so flattering label of X, as if we needed any more reason to feel disillusioned.  There is a big, giant X over all of us, voiding us out.  Great, thanks World.
<br>
<br>Regardless, having played my fair share of real-time and turn-based wargames on all manner of devices, I feel edified enough to firmly plant myself in the turn-based camp.  My all-time favorites are the Civilization series, Korsun Pocket, Warlords, the Total War series.  Those are my type of games -  games you can sit with and strategize for as long as you want, go do something else for a few minutes, and come back to.  Playing turn-based wargames is a more relaxing pursuit.  Real-time can be fun no doubt, and I did love Rise of Nations and the Age of Empires games, but I&apos;ve always preferred to play at the turn-based pace.
<br>
<br>In UoC you play as either the Soviets or Germans on the Eastern Front of World War II.  The base game and its two add-on DLCs, Black Turn and Red Turn, cover the action at the division level from the opening salvos of Operation Barbarossa in 1941 through to the ultimate defeat of the Germans and the capture of Berlin.  Set piece battles include Kiev, Stalingrad, the great bulge battles around Kharkov, and crossing the major rivers, Dnieper and Dniester.
<br>
<br>Historically, UoC is accurate enough.  It may even be accurate down to the actual weather on the battlefields.  Divisions are named and situated where I am confident they were during the real life battles.  One gets a sense that the battles are designed to play out more or less as they did with Zhukov and Paulus at the helms.  Movement and attack are on a hex grid and the mechanics of battle are straightforward and accessible.  The game is very easy to pick up and play; the interface is intuitive and the screen space not overly cluttered.  Information about your divisions, terrain, weather, enemy units, and supply, are all right at your finger tips.  The battlefield graphics are good enough, not a distraction but not special either.  They&apos;re good enough that they don&apos;t detract from the battlefield.  The guts of the game are the almost two dozen scenarios provided, and the campaign that consists of these scenarios.  This makes it easy to practice a  scenario and get a feel for it before risking it during your campaign progress.
<br>
<br>What sets this game apart and makes it so addictive is its easy-to-play-but difficult to master nature.  At the start of each battle you are given geographic objectives to reach within a set number of turns.  You are rewarded with prestige points for achieving these objectives on a sliding scale; 100 points if achieved on turn 3, less 25 points rewarded if done on turn 4, and so on.  When playing the full campaign, prestige points can be spent on reinforcements, the proper use of which can be the difference between victory and defeat.  I cannot stress enough how fiendishly difficult it is to achieve these objectives on time. There is always a way, but it is never obvious.  Solutions will be revealed and brilliant victories achieved by practicing, learning the intricacies of the gameplay and getting experience with the scenarios.  UoC encourages creative strategic thinking, &#x201C;How the hell am I going to get my tanks to Rostov by turn 4?!&#x201D;  It challenges you to find the weak points in the enemy line, the soft underbelly, and attack it.  Flanking moves and surrounding maneuvers are crucial to victory and used widely and to great effect by victorious armchair generals.
<br>
<br>Speaking of supply, the algorithm that controls the supply mechanics is brilliant. I haven&apos;t played a game that incorporated the strategic use of supply (and the utterly desperate dependence troops have on it) as well as UoC does.  The supply system radiating out from depots and slithering along the railroads is vital to your advances.  It acts as a bungee cord, a leash, pulling you back, restraining your daring dashes into the enemy&apos;s rear.  But don&apos;t ever forget, supply is just as important to the enemy, and if you are playing the AI and you cut their lines, it will respond; it has to.
<br>
<br>Unity of Command has officially taken place along-side my wargame all-time greats.  It&apos;s a five star game, 100/100 on that scale.  Put simply, it is fantastic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unity-of-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=6182802">Expand</a></span>
