<br>Have you heard about a piece of hardware called GAMEPAD ???
<br> Well, if you get a GAMEPAD the controls are near perfect. I play with XBOX gamepad on my PC and the control is perfect and so is this wonderful game.
<br>
<br>Best adventure game since Broken Sword series. Game of the year IMHO.
<br>
<br>PS For all FPS-slash-everything/everyoune-into pieces-fans STAY AWAY from this game.</span>

<br>This is a Jewel for the price that GOG offers it, taking into account that is 100% compatible with last gen operating systems. Also take into account with a small hack (check youtube) you can even run it at FullHD 1920x1080 resolution.

<br>I have not finished it yet, but I do not care anymore about the ending, as the playing has been soooo damn good. I want to even start to play guitar again :P

I&apos;ve often seen games/movies that i LOVE being trashed by people and vice versa, and I&apos;m never able to understand the other&apos;s point of view, no matter how hard I try. This is one of the latter. I think it&apos;s AWFUL. I played the PC version of this and a few comments point out the terrible control method. Apparantly this is better with a dual analogue control pad which, if you use one, might make this game enjoyable. From my experience though, of using mouse and keyboard, it&apos;s unplayable. The game starts off very well with an intriguing premise and a very absorbing logical puzzle to solve that immersed me immediately and i thought i was in for an excellent game, but after this first scene the game goes VERY rapidly downhill. It&apos;s seems to think it&apos;s so bloody clever and there&apos;s an air of this pomposity throughout. This really grates as the game is in fact very poor. It has very limited interaction of the worst kind (controlling a character from one point in a maze of paths to another in order to trigger another cut-scene, with no reward or danger along the way is not in my book &apos;interaction&apos;, but rather a waste of time and poor game design.) and subgames ranging from boring, pointless and illogical if you&apos;re lucky (the simon says games), to absolutely infuriatingly badly designed ones (the army base section) which is made &apos;challenging&apos; by a stupid control method, unclear rules and having to repeat the ENTIRE annoying thing from the start when you mess up. Again in my opinion this is poor game design that i thought ended some 10-15 years ago. This sums up the game for me. A collection of extremely poor games that would have been considered below average 15 years ago, being used to forward an intriguing, but poorly told plot, all held together with nice 3d graphics and cinematic effects pretentiously stolen from tv shows of the time. For a good story driven game there are many others much better than this: Omikron the nomad soul by the same company as this is flawed but much better. Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, Max Payne all tell better stories in a better way and with an actual game driving it along as well. This game i imagine would appeal to people who like games like Myst and Riven. This isn&apos;t meant as a put down of any of these games but just as a guide to who would enjoy this game. Asta la vista I gave this 2 for the excellent first scene as zero seems a bit harsh but it also definately doesn&apos;t deserve a 10! 10? A perfect game?

The point of an adventure game is generally story, with most actual game play being dominated either by puzzles, or in this case, rapid decision making in stressful situations -- where the results can largely affect the story. Action sequences involving the colored circles I felt made the player feel the intensity of the situation -- and to keep you focused and engaged to intense cut-scenes without distracting you from them. This is a rather revolutionary adventure game in that it is dominated by decision making that actually has real affect on the plot. I found this game to be more gripping and exciting than many action games, because making the wrong decision in this game can have negative and irreversible consequences for my character that are not just &apos;you&apos;re dead, respawn and try again.&apos;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=742641">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately this game did not come anywhere near those hopes. The main problem I have with this game is the Simon says circles. It fealt akin to playing DDR without the music. Or worse, playing DDR where the music is out of sync with the button pressing. The background action scenes were epic in their own rights and would have made good cut scenes but the Simon says gameplay distracts the player from enjoying them. The mash left and right gameplay mechanic seemed pretty inane too. As for the plot, I fealt it had way too many moments of deus ex machina for me to handle. I was okay with the first half of the story but not the second half. The Oracle randomly chose the only person in the world who posseses the chroma? There is a purple clan? The purple clan is artificial intelligences? Artificial intelligence can reanimate people? I would have been okay if it had only been a crime drama but the super natural killed it for me. Shifting between the detective and the suspect prevented me from rooting for any side of the struggle. I was merely playing a role, doing what was expected. This game feels like it wants to be a movie, but I don&apos;t think the plot would allow it to succeed as one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=421034">Expand</a></span>

All in all: wibbly wobbly controls and dito story make Fahrenheit a game that dissapoints in the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=742247">Expand</a></span>

YOU make the story; YOU are the player and YOU are the director. Every move of yours affect the game....I mean movie. Overall a must play epic game that, like &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, counts your every move.</span>

Don&apos;t buy it. It relies on the (theoretically) interesting concept of making you perform every mundane in-game action either by doing a combination of button-presses, or by playing a game of &quot;simon.&quot; This unfortunately gets sour very quickly, becoming at best monotonous, and at worst downright punishing as you&apos;ll be forced to replay the same segments of the game over and over again, without any way to skip through the (occasionally lengthy) in-game cutscenes. As other reviewers have mentioned, using a gamepad is absolutely necessary to properly control this game, however even with the correct control device, it&apos;s still an awful game. Additionally, the story takes a dump during the last 1/3 of the game and finishes in such an anticlimactic and absurd way that it effectively makes the previous 2/3 of the game a complete waste. Avoid if you enjoy having fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1461000">Expand</a></span>

With Fahrenheit, Quantic Dream proudly stride back into the spotlight, returning from something of a sabbatical after Omikron. The narrative is always gripping and makes sure to involve the player at every opportunity. The plot draws you in and manages to elicit a myriad of emotional responses to the tale you unfold. The characters are intriguing and likeable. The musical score one of the best arrangements I&apos;ve heard, each song perfectly conducive to the scene it plays over. You know you&apos;ve just played a truly great game when the elation of completing it is coupled with a sense of sadness that it&apos;s over. The game loses a point in my opinion as the last quarter or so sees a rather speedy move to conclude the story. In the closing stages the exposition could&apos;ve done with more detail and opportunity to understand the facets, perhaps with an extra chapter or two. Alternatively, more hints scattered around the game&apos;s earlier acts. Nevertheless, taking into account the quality of the game overall, such annoyances can be forgiven. After all, sometimes it&apos;s not the destination that&apos;s important, it&apos;s the journey. All in all an utterly compelling adventure full of suspense, intrigue and excitement. All of which are carried out with artistic and technical flair. Game of the year for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=382608">Expand</a></span>

Remember the old Dragons Lair games where the action sequences consisted of you pressing buttons at the right time to proceed. This is exactly the same. I suspect most people who have rated it highly havent finished the game because i thought it was an ok game up until about 3/4 of the way through. Then the plot turns to putty and events happen for no logical reason whatsoever. I completed the game twice choosing a different ending for each. Surprisingly enough i was greeted with pratically the SAME ending for each (exact same character modelling and scene) All in all extremely sloppy and gratuitous ending (totally unnecessary and ridiculous sex scene at end) It seemed like the developers just rushed the game to completion because of some deadline. for 39.99 you get to *play a game-movie hybrid* for 5 hours.

The simon says button mashing is horrible. Even after hitting all the right keys in the correct manner you still FAIL - it sucks so bad you have no idea. The story in this game is incredible I was totally engrossed in the characters and the plot but the mini games just take the cake as ruining what could have been an incredible gaming experience for me. Sorry but maybe a bit more play testing and market research could have helped the development team realise that when you have such an amazing story ruining it with crazy button mashing interludes is the worst design decision ever. Fantastic story. Nice experiment.

The &apos;simon&apos; system is so well done that once you get better at it there&apos;s still more to master. Don&apos;t be fooled though, definately a slow paced title for those who like constant action.</span>

The action sequences are thrilling because they are very challenging and demand the kind of perfection you&apos;re asked for in the real world. It does help to have some DDR/StepMania practice (remember that sometimes the buttons light up twice in a row, and also you have to press doubles simulatneously). Enjoy- the soundtrack is amazing, and I can&apos;t believe people complain about the graphics. It&apos;s also probably the best &quot;movie&quot; you&apos;re gonna see- and also be the protagonist of- this summer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=387857">Expand</a></span>

However I did enjoy being able to switch characters, all of whom I thought they did a nice job of developing. I don&apos;t see this as a &quot;ground breaking&quot; game format that adventure companies should start modeling their games after, as there is actually very little interaction with the environment, no puzzles of any sort, and no inventory to tinker with. Had this game behaved more like Dreamfall where you mostly guide your character with subtle interaction with the environment as a means to unfolding more of the story, I would have given it a higher rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=419400">Expand</a></span>

The story was morbid, unique, engaging, and hit just enough high notes early on and mid-game to compensate for the trainwreck that it would become near the every end. The characters were well written and believable, and the world that was built by Quantic felt very real and life-like for the most part. At the time it was released, the game was truly innovative and both the director, David Cage, and his studio were hailed as &quot;visionaries&quot; and propelled to celebrity status in the gaming industry. Their &quot;visionary&quot; status would continue to be held in high regard with the release of 2009&apos;s Heavy Rain for the PS3, which resembled IP/Fahrenheit in terms of plot, but also differed from it by revolving the story around a murder mystery (rather than having the perpetrator identified from the very beginning as the main protagonist as in IP/Fahrenheit). Both games were well-earned commercial and critical successes for the studio, and both are well worth a playthrough for any serious gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3644943">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t. In fact, we have another contender for Game of the Year (one of the very few titles up for it in this lackluster &apos;05 season). This game shines in nearly every single aspect. Especially the writing. I&apos;ve never seen this quality of a screenplay in a videogame before, but I expect to see it duplicated in the future - it&apos;s that damned good. No games, currently, can match the depth of the characters in &quot;Indigo&quot;, nor it&apos;s tight plot. This is to be expected, of course, as this game is billed as a cinematic experience. The amazing voice acting only serves to reinforce that this game is a &quot;movie&quot;. What isn&apos;t expected is for all that to come together so well with player interaction. For me, the way &quot;Indigo&quot; is controlled couldn&apos;t be much better. The control system is basically a grim version of &apos;Dance Dance Revolution.&apos; Lame? Not when your governing an explosive fight scene or car chase, I assure you. Many critics are complaining about the &quot;need of a gamepad&quot; to enjoy these sequences as it&apos;s to hard to use a keyboard. That&apos;s not true, there&apos;s a little something called key mapping - it&apos;s in the options menu, find it and use it. Speaking of what can be found in the options menu, graphics only get average marks in &quot;Indigo&quot;. It was designed for consoles, that&apos;s obvious. Even when you crank up the resolution and enable every single special little flair on our mighty PCs, the graphics still wind up being bland. Also, a grain effect has been filtered over your view - much like that of a sercurity camera. Does this add to the &apos;realism&apos;? No. It seems like a mask, to prevent us from seeing the dull textures and jaggies that mar the landscape. It almost detracts from the experience. Well, not really. The score, however, is undeniably perfect - nothing more needs to be said about it. Well then, why not a 10 out of 10 you ask? The end chapter. Yes, this game does stumble. Big time. Everything seems rushed, like they had written themselves into a corner and need to blow their way out with a stick of explosive laziness. It&apos;s sad to see such a great story come to such a lackluster, generic, tension free ending... but, the path to your destination is the most important. That&apos;s what you&apos;ll see and that&apos;s what every other developer will see as they try to duplicate this stunningly original game. If anyone needs proof that games can be art, they need look no further than &quot;The Indigo Prophecy&quot;. This game will stick with you for months to come... unless you replay it first. ***Final Review:: Story- 9.1/10 ; Graphics- 6.9/10 ; Sound- 10/10 ; Control 8.9/10 ; Gameplay- 9.1/10 ; Value- 8.1/10 ; Fun Factor- 9.1/10 ***</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=382917">Expand</a></span>

A lot of thought and innovation has been put into the game, mixing in a fantastic Hollywood plot - something you dont see often. The voice acting is completely spot on, and the horror and action scenes are respectively chilling and intense. The game is designed to be a true interactive movie, and they certainly fulfill their aim. However, the control system is one of the most annoying i have come across, almost ruining the game Grim Fandango-style. Actions are made with mouse gestures, that is, dragging the mouse around the right way. Making more complicated gestures to precision can get very frustrating. Conversations are also controlled using gestures. You are given about a 3 second time limit to choose the correct conversation path and make the gesture. This is made even more difficult with the paths only being described in one word rather than the whole sentence being shown. At points, the screen is split, showing different angles or characters, much like &apos;24&apos;. Cinematic approaches like this really draw you in to to the atmosphere of the story. However, when you&apos;re walking around somewhere with several immovable cameras pointing at your feet, it can get slightly tricky. With all its downfalls, it still gets a solid 9/10. Fahrenheit is a breath of fresh air for gaming, and i truly do hope that more games like this are developed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=383000">Expand</a></span>

Firstly ,it has been a (positive) very pleasant adventure-action game with a great graphics-camera engine which (negative) unfortunately was quite short for its money. It started of with a (positive) very nice scenario which however bacame quite (negative) complex with too much fantasy and clan bits at the end. It has an (positive) excellent decision making engine during the game in addition to a (negative) poor and a little boring action engine (its too easy I&apos;d say). As one can see the game has several positve aspects that are followed by negative. However in general, the game offers a new style and mixture to its genre that leaves a pleasant feeling to its buyer-player. In the end, one will definitely feel that much effort has been put in this game and that is why i &apos;ll give it an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=383125">Expand</a></span>

On the negative side, the plot basically takes a couple &quot; WTF&quot; turns toward the end, and although it manages to barely fit together, it was dissapointing to see rehashes of ideas from the matrix and sci fi when the tone from the outset was that of a dark, mature, crime thriller.

Yes, I got frustrated towards the end of the game when I couldn&apos;t stop my characters from doing certain things and when the story went a little too fantasy for my liking. But overall it stands out from so many games now because it&apos;s easy to jump in and play (unlike many RPGs) and it&apos;s not about killing as many people as possible. If you take it as an interactive movie rather than something where you can actually change to plot in significant ways, then it&apos;s great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=389500">Expand</a></span>

This is a beautiful game with many interesting twists that keeps you interested throughout the darkness and enjoyably light times of the game. A must have or at least try for gamers.</span>

When I play an adventure game like this, I&apos;d like to be able to just sit back and explore without all of the do overs. They would have been better if they were better executed, but I fount the controls to be terribly off when I had to run to a spot, or sometimes the presses wouldn&apos;t respond in time for the events. All in all though, the game gets an 8 for its originality and clever story telling that really made me feel like I was changing the events of people&apos;s lives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=738490">Expand</a></span>

The story starts off as an intriguing murder mystery which places you in control of an innocent murderer and the cops after him. The first 2/3 of this game are enveloping and immersible, if you&apos;re into games like Heavy Rain. Most of the mechanics work, and the button prompt segments are top notch, even if dragged out a little. One of the more creative parts have you controlling a character with claustrophobia in first person, having you control their breathing while trying to solve a puzzle. The problem is that the story falls apart toward the end. What started off as a Dean Koontz novel turns into an episode of Dragon Ball Z. The ending scenes were laughably out of place, not to mention the use of plot devices such as deus ex machina. The experience was a step into the right direction, and despite it falling apart at the end, still makes for a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1553316">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>An epic game, the graphics are not very good but the story is EPIC! The game style is very similar to Heavy Rain and I love that game. Everything is very excited in the game and if you failed a mission, is the end of the story!  Only one thing in the game that i dont like its the Chrome thingy. That thing always made me fail missions :P</span>

It starts out great, the graphics are outdated but I stopped noticing after a few minutes of playing it. However, as the story proceeds it&apos;s getting worse and worse. Mainly Taylor&apos;s part of the story was a dissapontment for me, felt very lackluster especially in the end. In the end it goes wild and B-movie style with a...not terrible, but not in one bit satisfying ending ever. In fact thinking about the last 30 minutes of the game convinces you that it made no sense at all. Also *minor spoiler* matrix style combat!? Bullet dodging? I couldn&apos;t stop myself from laughing at this point. What games does right is the emotional dialogues. The voice acting is great 90 percent of the times and the conversations seem natural and satisfying. You can really feel immersed into the game at some points, actually caring about Lucas and (to a much lesser extent) about other characters. Also I have to say the music surprised me, really fitting the mood of each scene and helped me get through lenghty boring QTE sequences. Overusing them made me feel distracted from actually watching the action, as I was busy pressing buttons through an entire scene and failing it often as I tried to multi-task doing QTE and watching what is happening. This really irritated me as these qtes rarely fit what your character is doing right now (there are only 3 types of them)  and failing them often forces you to go trough lenghty cut scenes that you&apos;ve just watched.
<br>Overall even with the outdated graphics, story level degrading dramatically towards the end, some stupid qte mechanics and sometimes outright boring scenes, this is actually a GOOD TITLE and I recommend it to anyone liking the genre, as you won&apos;t find many better titles in it. Therefore a solid 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3225351">Expand</a></span>

In this case, it turned out so-so. The story is engaging, and you&apos;ll often feel the characters stress during the different scenarios they will find themselves in. You&apos;ll get hints about some supernatural elements at the beginning, but I personally find the regular detective story and psychological thriller aspects going on far more interesting. This makes the second half of the game a bit wishy-washy, as they cram in a lot of unbelievable events. Ranging from characters suddenly developing in unbelievable ways, to environments and scenarios seeming too far-fetched, or just generally too strange without any believable build up. The gameplay itself is typical for the adventure genre; interacting with objects and surroundings, hearing the protagonists thoughts and such. There are interesting dialog options and choices to be made, but they seem to impact the story very little; but they do help the immersion a lot. The problem is that the controller is one of the two greatest challenges in the game, as it first seems illogical and after some getting used to just comes of as bulky and often causes great annoyance during timed events. The other challenge is the &quot;Simon Says&quot; events, which happens extremely fast and will confuse you even more as you will have to rethink on how to use the controller. The Simon events will also distract you from the on-going cutscenes, as you will have to focus entirely on the button mashing mini game, rather than on the actual interesting stuff that&apos;s happening on the screen. But other than my problems with the controller, I find the game to be a good choice for anyone who likes the  adventure genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3759584">Expand</a></span>

While it will probably not be fully appreciated by everyone, it is an extremely well done title that grabs you until you finish the game. There are plenty of moments where you&apos;ll have a decision to make and the decision may even slightly change the whole story. The characters in this game feel completely realistic so it is really easy to become immersed in the whole storyline and actually root for somebody. If you are interested in crime investigations or mystery in general, this game will offer you something of both, packed with a great gripping story to boot and a ton of thrilling moments. I didn&apos;t give this title a 10, because the final third of the game turned into something different than what I had wanted. Nevertheless, if you haven&apos;t played this game yet and are looking for an adventure game taking place in realistic settings, you cannot go wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5094253">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>lets star with the gameplay, i really think that this game dont have a bad control but, the quick time events are by far one of the worst things of the game, they are boring, too long and dosent add anything to the game more than make it worst, the dialogue sistem isint really bad but the time to answer is too short and the way to answer is kind of imprecise, click and move the mouse to a specific place is new but it its a little uncomfortanble
<br>
<br>now the story . look the story of the game isint really bad but in the end is like a teenager write it. when  i was in the end i was screaming what the **** i am playing. the story becomes of murder and the things behind it and ends in a non sents pice of garbage SPOILER really david a relacionship between lucas and karla they just meet 1 day ago. the game leave a loot of holes in the history and in the end is really bad
<br>
<br>the characters. lucas is ok just ok not too many change in the character but at least is there. karla is tho daam cliche that typical girl that is super badass and samart and ends in a realcioship with the main charcter. tyler is more cliche ands it. the other characters are just filling the game i feal is not bad that they are there, but if the desappear i will not miss them
<br>
<br>and now the worst part
<br>if you play the game yo will notice that this is not in the gameplay part
<br>i leave it for the end
<br>THE
<br>STEALTH
<br>SECTIONS
<br>the worst stealth i ever play by faaaaaarrr
<br>bad controls, bad place with to less cover zones, out of place and many many more
<br>
<br>now in the end is not a bad game BUT  IS NOT IS NOT A 10
<br>look when i play the game i dont now who was david kage but now i see the game with worst eyes beacouse this guy make the not tho bad heavy rain and the horrible beyond tho souls
<br>he should not make videogames coss he is triying to make movies and the are not good
<br>so this was my opinion of the game thanks for read</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/indigo-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6898837">Expand</a></span>
