There is two ways about it. I love TBS. I love tactical combat in TBS&apos;s. I love fantasy setting and I love unique and varied races and units. Age of Wonders 3 hit all these perfectly for me. This is the game I have been waiting for and wanting.
<br>
<br>Let me underline that I have been participating in the beta for 2 months and have over that time clocked 180 something hours (all within the limitation of real life) in both online and offline modes (yes, you can play offline). Over that time I have gotten a good impression of what the game is about, what it delivers, but more importantly, what it can deliver. The game has such a solid mechanic, that any additional content will just improve more and more on the game.
<br>
<br>I am not a reviewer and I don&apos;t know how to write reviews, but what I can do is give you my thoughts on the game. It is complex, it is deep and it really covers the 4X expectations. You get to explore a beautiful map, you get to exploit treasure sites by entering them, fighting the guardians and taking their loot (everything from weapons/equipment to mounts, secret spells, resources, prisoners who will join you and more). You get to expand by building new cities or by having other cities join you through diplomacy, bribes, quests or just conquest! And  you get to exterminate all who stand against you in a glorious tactical combat.
<br>
<br>You have heroes who level up and can pick traits, skills and spells as they increase in power, decking them out in magical equipment and riding fantastic mounts from spiders to hell hounds and beyond. You have units who rank up and become stronger and learn new abilities, increasing their tactical value. You have access to great spells that can shape the land, makes cities riot, devestate armies on the strategic map and summon creatures from other places. Spells that can turn the tide on the battlefield and give your opponent a surprise he or she never saw coming.
<br>
<br>There is this and so much more! I am quite horrified to see three votes giving 1 score even before the game is released knowing everyone who has participated in the game so far has been nothing but happy with it. For me, this is just the game I have been waiting for and it combines the best of master of magic, heroes of might and magic, civilization and fallen enchantress. Seeing the game as it is and knowing it is just so incredible fun and that with each addition to it, it can only get better, this is my highest rated TBS game of my so far life time, including all the oldies and classic.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t wait to see other people get to try the game and leave their thoughts on it. I look forward to reading other peoples opinion on the game and I feel confident that any TBS fan will find this game to hit the mark for them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4097021">Expand</a></span>

I have a feeling that in 15 years or so I will still be playing Age of Wonders 3. I make this prediction because once in a while I still play the original AoW and it came out in 1999. So unless they come out with an AoW4 or standalone expansion that is even better in every aspect I think this game will stay on my computer and my next computer and the VR headset after... a long time.
<br>
<br>My favorite part of AoW3 is its focus on tactical combat while still including all the 4 Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) plus RPG elements. There are cities to form into an empire, heroes to level up, spells to research, dungeons to loot, resources to manage, etc... On top of it all players are engaged in battles early and often. The battles are killer fun tactical experiences that take place on their own maps separate from the primary strategy map. When a hex is attacked on the strategy map the armies/stacks in that hex and all neighboring hexes get pulled into the tactical battle. This means there could be 42 units (7 hexes x 6 units/hex) in the same battle and they could even belong to several different players! The combat mechanics like attacks of opportunity, flanking, guarding, and 3 action points to use for movement, multiple attacks, or multiple reactions are very well done. When playing single player I almost always choose to fight each battle manually because they are so much fun, but there is an option to automatically resolve them if you wish.
<br>
<br>One thing that is disappointing about AoW3 at first glance is the number of races. Past AoW games had at least 12 races but AoW3 is releasing with 6. However, this is made up by the new class system which did not exist in previous AoW games. The developers have done an amazing job making both race and class matter. An elven archdruid feels different than a draconian archdruid or an elven warlord. Thus, instead of having simply 12 races to choose from you have 36 race/class combos (6 races x 6 classes). There are also specializations/spheres that further customize your leader and playing experience, similar to previous AoW games. I expect more races to be added in DLC or an expansion and am fine with that.
<br>
<br>The only bad thing I can say about AoW3 is that it feels like the morale systems need to be flushed out a little more. My wish for morale is that your starting/ruling race should have more influence on the morale of your cities and units and diplomatic relations with independent cities. It was important in past AoW games. These things will probably get improved with some patches, and should not stop anyone from buying the game.
<br>
<br>There was a period of years where I played a lot of Civ4 and some Civ5. Eventually I found myself thinking - I wish there was more action in these games and battles were more realistic like... Age of Wonders. Before AoW3 was announced, I searched for recent games with gameplay similar to AoW but nothing seemed to be on the same level. Warlock was too simple and too Civ-y... Total War just didn&apos;t draw me in... Others didn&apos;t even look worth buying. Age of Wonders seems to fill a special niche that no others do.
<br>
<br>Bottomline: AoW3 takes many of the best parts of its predecessors plus some new goodness to create a masterpiece of the TBS/4X genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4097207">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has good graphics, solid/great AI, clear information, a tome of wonders to look things up. endless amounts of content, a great map generator, editor, good community, great strategical depth. The game is not rushed but ready to play from day one. I could go on and on and some people have done that out here.
<br>
<br>Normally i would rate this game around 8.6/9.2. I dont usually give that high grades. But what would you ever want more out of a game that is cheap and could be one of the greatest games of its kind. Ill give it a 10 because of people who give this game a 1/0 for minor issues like fair prices on gog or minor launch problems on day 1 (i dont have any) .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4098462">Expand</a></span>

<br>i loved age of wonders - shadow magic (AoW 2.5) and had clocked many hours into the game. this new entry is loaded with depth, known from older titles with all its beloved core features. it also adds some nice new mechanics like classes, some improvements to tactical combat (flanking, opportunity attacks, etc.) and wonderful 3D visuals!
<br>the AI right now is very good, which for me is one big factor if a strategy, more importantly a 4x game is worth the buy. lets be honest, multiplayer is nice but most 4x lovers play singleplayer because they like epic campaigns and that is exactly what you get here. the random map generator gives out maps which just look awesome and could very well be made by hand which shows the degree of effort they put into these feature to present organic and believable playgrounds.
<br>the customization in this game is wonderful, starting with the many options of customization for the maps to advanced gameplay rules and not even ending at the superb character designer where you can create your leader after your liking.
<br>
<br>i really can&apos;t understand who would give this game a negative score. has it a deep diplomacy system like the grand strategy titles (europa universalis, etc.)? no, the game is more focused on exploration, tactical combat (one if not THE main meat of the game) and RPG elements loke leader / heroe classesk, itemization and leveling. has it 100 buildings which each give +x generic production or +generic modifiers? no, it doesn&apos;t try to be an town building / management game like civilization. what the game offers is great depth in parts of 4x fantasy which every fanboy was craving for over the last decade (since AoW:SM came out).
<br>
<br>only reasin i imagine people giving this game a 0 / 1 is if
<br>
<br>a) they believed it to being an egoshooter
<br>
<br>b) an CGI filled adventure / RPG game
<br>
<br>or c) if they are warlock 1 / 2 fanboys which feel threatened by this game somehow, even though its focus is more towards the 4x (hardcore) lovers. before someone cries &quot;fanboy yourself&quot; then yes, i love the AoW-series. warlock 1 was nice and warlock2 seems to become a decent game which is more focused on casual gamers and cheeky humour. people should stay calm and just enjoy these games instead of feeling butthurt over their own misperception.
<br>
<br>or of course there is d) its the internet and people are just trolling.
<br>
<br>i say it again, everyone who loves fantasy 4x or TBS games should consider this game a must buy! there already several lets play series on youtube duo to the developer handing out preview builds to many lets players cause they stand behind their product.
<br>
<br>peace :).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4099139">Expand</a></span>

With that being said I find this game to be excellent. It is easy to pick up and play but has depth at the same time. I love the inclusion of a story based campaign mode. Downloading and installation was painless and after I set up an account, verified the email (which came to me in like a minute), put the settings to ultra, and away I went. All in all I highly recommend this game to any tbs fans or anyone interested in trying the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4099108">Expand</a></span>

This is a must buy for every TBS gamer. It&apos;s fun, it&apos;s deep and it&apos;s challenging. The tactical combat is imho the best to ever grace a TBS game. It&apos;s not overly complicated but has so many things to tinker with and most of all is satisfyingly fun!</span>

I had played the old ones and have been actively looking for something that gives the same experience. The tactical battle there is no other game like it, its like table top battles, it takes that idea and brings it to life, using squads of a variety of things like archers, and cavalry and play on siege base scenarios or swamps and bridges. Or if your into games like XCOM where cover and flanking can change the game and look after your units and heros as they gain metals.
<br>
<br>It also has a great character customization, diplomacy,  I like games where I can form alliances with other races to defeat enemies, and the best thing good old hotseat! so I can play with my GF and bro.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4098653">Expand</a></span>

I hate to have to say it, but this third game is a disappointment. It forces the player&apos;s strategy too much, limiting you to one option. You are put in positions where you need to rush and that&apos;s all you can do if you hope to win vs the poorly programmed cheating supplemented AI.
<br>
<br>You have to send out small fast units to grab undefended AI cities which feels more like an exploit than normal game mechanics.
<br>
<br>In combat I was fighting to siege an enemy fort and our armies were evenly matched, so obviously I wanted to use some strategy and position my forces for the best approach. Not in AoW3. In this game you&apos;re penalized for using strategy. A message popped up after only a few turns saying that no unit had been damaged fast enough and the battle was ended. The only option I have is to rush at the gates so my forces can get cut down by their defenses.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have time for games like this. It&apos;s unbalanced. The AI gets bonus money to spam OP units on normal or higher. Any difficulty easier than that is too easy and no challenge.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s some advice for the devs, actually try to program AI routines. Not just a few basic ones, stop think about why the AI is losing strategically and make routines for dealing with those scenarios. It&apos;s obvious you didn&apos;t even try. You should probably try to hire me to fix your terrible AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4116392">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>* After killing 11 out of 12 soldiers in a squad it still does the same damage as if nothing changed,
<br>* Not enough ruins and such to explore, you barely get 2 items per game.
<br>* Strategic battle starting positions are insane.
<br>* Heroes customization has too many useless traits, and even level 10 heroes aren&apos;t that powerful.
<br>* You can only cast 1 spell per combat round, but what if you have 2 casters? or 3?
<br>* Casting global enchantments is pointless, whatever you cast is immediately dispelled the following round.
<br>* Heroes only give their bonuses if they are leaders, so you can&apos;t stack two heroes in an army. why?!
<br>* All races have the same buildings.
<br>* There is almost no different between the units of each race (priest shots fire, priest shots poison etc...)
<br>* It takes ages to clear a map, and it&apos;s mostly waiting on your cities to produce enough units to take down the 3 army stacks the computer has holed up in his castle. really really boring.
<br>
<br>I can go on for ages, this is a bad game, they did not think this through, this is a big disappointment!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4099424">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What you get is an ugly thing that looks like it should be on an Asian website as F2P and be for your tablet or facebook profile. Granted it is a bit big for that. It has lots of stuff to it, nice new features like researching unit tech suppose to just needing to hit X city size and have y production to make the building needed to train. I love all the the stuff on paper, but visually it looks like a knockoff of the franchise, and like it as little work and thought as possible was put into the UI.
<br>
<br>Every thing is designed so you can look at the pretty most the time still back ground like you paid 39.99 to preorder a back drop that moves from time to time. No detailed info at easy access, no feel that the old ones had that every decision mean something. It went from a game of chess, to a kids travel edition checkers, easy to use, and folds away out of sight when not in use. Went from detailed chess pieces stored off to the side of the bored when not in play to generic magnets with pieces of plastic glued to them that just get stuck to the board, then easily vanishes under the the table that doubles as a box as far as unit and city details went</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4104739">Expand</a></span>

However, AOW3 does not in any way live up to either AOW2 or the HOMM series.
<br>Maps are extremely boring, with few resources, points of interest or other goodies. The &quot;dungeons&quot; you can explore are quite fun however. The graphics in general are lackluster, and it&apos;s very hard to see on the world map where resources, POI&apos;s etc are located.
<br>Hero building is pretty good and diverse, and the fact that your hero is a unit is something HOMM could learn from. The larger scale combat maps and siege type combats work well too.
<br>However there&apos;re just too many cities to conquer, be they from another faction or from independent parties, and large and huge maps are just not very enjoyable. It&apos;s the same stuff - fight 3-4 mobs manually (because the auto combat function is **** 5 times or so every turn and then build a few things.
<br>The only break in monotony is boss battles where you fight e.g. 18 vs 18; those are fun and requires just a minimum of strategic planning - all other battles don&apos;t as the AI is horrible.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, I&apos;d say that I&apos;m fairly disappointed by this game and that it doesn&apos;t reach HOMM 4-6&apos;s level at all. Your money would be much better spent getting any of those games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4259741">Expand</a></span>

<br>The UI has some shortcomings like missing &quot;effective&quot; range indicators and the &quot;all-knowing&quot; Tome of Wonders does not contain any info on some searches that I did.
<br>While the graphics esepcially in the overview map are very aesthetic and the soundtrack is well composed, the proclaimed tactical combat lacks eye- and earcandy... the animations and spell effects are lackluster, the sound doesn&apos;t feel very impactful... things that imho were better even in older HoMM titles.
<br>My biggest contra is the empire management where the best procedure seems to be to stomp out as many cities and units as possible while not bothering all that much about your resources. Meaningful decisions about which buildings to get in your cities? Hardly. There are also few incentives to recruit weaker units as you can quickly progress to the highest tiers... if you know what to research. And while I normally love random elements in such games, it doesn&apos;t feel right in the research section of AoW3.
<br>Some of these things (like gettings many cities asap) might be changable in the random map games, but first I&apos;d like to finish the singleplayer campaigns to get a feel for the game. And while the story with it&apos;s good english speakers can induce some atmosphere, the levels just cannot motivate me to play through them.
<br>On the plus side: The AI of the game seems to be well programmed, both in the strategic and tactical section.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4133554">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a fan of the Age of Wonders series since Age of Wonders 2: The Wizard&apos;s Throne, and like a lot of fans I looked forward with eager anticipation to the release of a new game in this series. Age of Wonders 3 does not disappoint. Combat is much tighter and faster paced than before, and there are more interesting things to do on the world map. Graphics are perfect, by which I mean that they spent just the right amount of time and resources on them - enough to look good, but not so much as to detract from gameplay or slow down your system.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t perfect - there are still a few bugs to work out (myself and the other beta testers tried our best, but sometimes you just can&apos;t fix all of these things by release), and there isn&apos;t quite as much content (in terms of races, classes, and the like) as there was in previous installments - for example, we&apos;re down to only 6 starting races as opposed to Shadow Magic&apos;s 15 races. The developers have, however, promised to keep updating the game, fixing bugs, tightening the gameplay even further, and introducing new content. So far we&apos;ve been told we&apos;ll see the return of the Halfling race, as well as the introduction of a Necromancer class and a hinted-at Merchant class.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game to anyone. If you&apos;re a fan of the series, definitely check it out. If you&apos;re not a fan, go ahead and check it out anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4103754">Expand</a></span>

I want to be able to automate most stuff so I won&apos;t feel as if I am working instead of playing. Personally for me this the biggest con, and this is why I&apos;ve stopped playing this game after ~10 hours in total. I don&apos;t want to micromanage woeful stuff that mu computer should do for me.
<br>2. AI on strategic map is really stupid.
<br>3. Looks like they&apos;ve spent most of their development time on graphics. Personnaly I would still buy AoW3 with old graphics, but better gameplay, and would enjoy it.
<br>4. No possibility to run an autocombat and then go manual combat like in HoMM. Come on, was it so difficult to implement?
<br>5. Most spells are useless.
<br>6. Cities have more structures, and most of them become useless because you&apos;ll produce 1 unit at 1 time.
<br>7. Ever run out of mana?
<br>the Pros:
<br>1. You can have much more casting points.
<br>2. Attacks and damaging spells don&apos;t miss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4171384">Expand</a></span>

<br>The UI is very clunky compared to the older versions. It now takes too many clicks to get a lot of basic tasks done.
<br>
<br>One big pet peeve of mine is that you can&apos;t cycle between cities (or i couldn&apos;t find how to). You have to manually click a city and then find the next city to click too. Which would be fine, if the map was not so cluttered.
<br>
<br>Another problem is that the building description is a tooltip rather than a fixed menu on the right.. like the old games. So, more often it is too much of a pain to figure out what exactly does the building do.
<br>
<br>The unit screen is a total mess, with again no unit description menu.. So, i have to hover my mouse over the unit name and wait a few seconds to see what the unit&apos;s powers actually are. Plus there is no differentiation in the UI over tier1 -tier2 - tier3 units.. so I have to right click a unit and check its wiki before I know what tier the unit is off. In the old game, the units were organized so that the cheapest 3 were always tier1, and so on.
<br>
<br>There is no mini-map in the battle... Yes, let that sink in for a while.. no mini map in the battle screen. So, battling in any zoom level but the lowest is too slow and annoying.
<br>
<br>They have removed the strategic aspect of attacking the city from 4 sides. Now you only attack from one side.. the front.
<br>
<br>The hero upgrade screen is just chock full of upgrades, most of them are useless.. and there is no upgrade tree.. So, you have no idea how to unlock the better upgrades.
<br>
<br>I though do like the new buildings as they do offer a lot of different strategies in what buildings to build first.. but the UI is just so horrible, all the joy of city management goes out of the window.
<br>
<br>Too many things in the game are a mix and match between right and left clicks. Your attacks in battle would only hit if you right click.. even though you select the unit using left click. Heroes can be equipped using right click, even though you left clicked on the inventory.
<br>
<br>It gets tedious to constantly have the wrong click.
<br>
<br>It is a playable game, but not unlike AoW2 where tasks were fun and not a chore. I have played AoW2 nonstop for 10 years.. but AoW3.. i am just going to play because i paid for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4123904">Expand</a></span>

Even though there is a wide variation in spells, races and classes and the seemingly &apos;infinite&apos; amount of combinations and games this should offer, every game essentially plays the same.
<br>
<br>Age of Wonders has a few major flaws that make the game boring very fast:
<br>- Class balance is off. Certain classes are capable of destroying most others, while other classes, in particular those that rely heavily on spellcasting, are virtually powerless against a gold-based class with a good army such as the Rogue or Warlord. With a smart mix of racial and class-specific units, these two become even more overpowered. The simple fact is, players can only cast a single spell each turn of combat, while they can move and attack with every separate unit on the field - this makes physical combat by definition far more influential than spells could ever be.
<br>
<br>- Lack of depth in development. While building your empire, with a few lucky early resources, you can rush straight to &apos;endgame&apos;. If you&apos;d really want to, &apos;endgame&apos; units are easily achieved and there is a glaring lack of depth to the tech trees and units that become available. There are four tiers of everything, which means that a research-oriented player can whip out maximum tier units within 30 minutes of play, or possibly even faster depending on your luck with resources. After those first 30 minutes, there is no longer any kind of stronger unit available. Not a single 4X game presents such a flat tech tree, because of the simple fact that are those 30 minutes are over, the game stops being interesting and surprising.
<br>
<br>These two key points will, eventually, and for me already after about 4 games, destroy the entire experience and lead to a dull, boring game that revolves around simple rush tactics to win. Sure you could make your life difficult, but then you notice that the AI utilizes said rush tactics as well - end of story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4353695">Expand</a></span>

It is difficult to get into, particularly if you played AoW and AoW2 a lo, because it is fairly different and the differences are not too well explained. I love the game, though. The battle animations are great, the races feel very different, and it keeps me thinking about it way too late at night.</span>

<br>
<br>Rated a 9 because I feel there&apos;s some small features missing mostly in terms of usability that i&apos;ve seen in other 4x games but would definitely recommend.

<br>
<br>Easy empire management combined with a deep and complex tactical combat system makes this game a must have for fans of Heroes of Might and Magic and Fallen Enchantress or Warlock. It stands out in portraying a highly detailed and breathing fantasy world, it&apos;s lethal and thrilling combat and enchanting music score. The sheer number of units, abilities, spells and maps (thanks to a random map generator) makes this a game that will be played for years, decades. I still play the original Age of Wonders, which came out in 1999.
<br>
<br>Humour has always been kind of a trademark of Triumph Studios, as is displayed in things like an outhouse or picnic table on combat maps, the witty unit descriptions and the animations of idle units like the Beholder (Watcher) or goblins.

<br>
<br>This game is a steal! I bought my steam digital download version for 75PLN (about $25) and if you look online you can by it this cheap pretty much anywhere in the world. For this price you get a brand new game with 2 campaigns, each with 6 missions + 1 for alternative choices made. I would say this is easily 40 hours of gameplay, at least. Then you also have scenarios and endless possibilities with random map generator.
<br>
<br>The game is complex, but easier to get into than the likes of Europa Universalis, Total War, or even Civilization series. At the same time it offers plenty to more seasoned TBS and 4X players. It&apos;s different than almost anything else on the market. People compare this game to HoM&amp;M, Civ, and Total War, but while it includes elements of all these games, it&apos;s still something totally different.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy 4X games, you should definitely try it. If you like TBSs in general you might want to give it a go. If all HoM&amp;M titles after HoM&amp;M 3 (and maybe 4) disappointed you, buy this game!
<br>
<br>For anyone who likes Civ, Gal Civ, HoM&amp;M series this should be a definitve buy. People who like Paradox games should also consider it.
<br>
<br>The random map generator in this game is like nothing I have ever seen before. The number of options is mind blowing. You can customize the number of cities, their size, number of treasures, resource, visit structures, starting army sizes, and much more.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s plenty of strategy involved and enough variety to keep you playing for many hours. 6 classes, 6 races, and 14 specializations to choose from means you get to try out new things almost every game.
<br>
<br>And finally, the multiplayer. I don&apos;t know how 4X games could have existed without simultaneous turns. I used to play some with classic turns and it was a thrill, but it also dragged on way too long and I would never play with strangers for this very reason. Here you can start a small map 1 vs 1 game with smallest starting cities and medium armies and finish it in about half an hour, it that&apos;s your cup of tee. You can still play epic large map games with mutiple opponents and save your sessions, in this case too, the simultaneous turns option will vastly speed up the game. I was worried about using this over the classic turns, but it works like a charm, I use it even against the AI, there&apos;s hardly any reason not to.
<br>
<br>Buy this game! Even if you have never played 4X games before. This is a good game for beginners too and at this price it is worth giving it a go. The support for the game is amazing, the forums are very helpful and best of all there is more content to come in the form of dlcs and expansions, which are likely to feature new playable races, new scenarios, and maybe new campaigns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4150595">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are amazing, the optimization is flawless, the game play is truly fluid, enjoyable and engaging, the sound and music is cool and fitting. Easily 10/10, well done!</span>

This provide me with a whole new experience, very much unlike &quot;regular&quot; AoW experience with city spams etc.
<br>
<br>One thing that I feel lacking is: diversity among racial units. Tier 1 and Tier 2 units are lacking uniqueness in my opinion. On the contrary, support units are quite different one from the other (High Elves&apos; Storm Sisters are totally different than Goblin Blight Doctors), so do Tier 3 units or class units. I do hope that Triumph will release a patch that address this issue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4101516">Expand</a></span>

<br>I werent fan of Age of Wonders 1 and 2 (preferred Heroes and discipless 2), but this instalment is really good. It feels like mix of heroes of might and magic and civilization. I dont think that this game should be compared direct-li to HOMMAM, both are very good games and both are very different. The game play of Age of Wonders 3 is very good and graphics and music are ok too. What is really good about this game is wast number of skills and abilities your hero and units have.
<br>
<br>Aside from some minor problems in game play, the only major problem can be very bad tutorial. If you are fan of 4x strategy games you will know what to do in short time, but if this game is your first 4x game than you can have problem with it.
<br>
<br>Still have to recommend this game. I really like the classic turn based game play and this game is very addicting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4121535">Expand</a></span>

Thoroughly enjoyable and stable as it stands now.  The only mild complaint I have is I want more - more races, more classes, more customization options for the leaders (particularly leader heads and outfits), more units, more victory conditions... just more.  Don&apos;t get me wrong - there&apos;s a veritable dragon&apos;s hoard of content already -but the game already has me craving more.
<br>
<br>Happily, the developer has strongly hinted at continuing to develop content for the game.  It&apos;s an absolutely superb fantasy TBS as it stands and the prospect of more content to come make it all the better.  Here&apos;s to hoping the developers continue to develop more content, races, classes, units and monsters, because I could just pack my bags and go live in the Age of Wonders.  Definitely highly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in fantasy turn-based strategy games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4104240">Expand</a></span>

The only thing that I can think of that is slightly disappointing is the fewer number of races in the game. The new class system does however make them much more varied than the previous 2 titles&apos; races. Well worth the purchase.</span>

If you segment in the game into its Tactical Combat, RPG, and Strategic components my ratings for these components vary substantially.
<br>
<br>The Tactical Combat is some of the best when compared with similar games that provide this type of instanced tactical combat.  The tactical combat is similar to Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes and the Dominion series.  IMO it outshines this games by allowing larger armies, facing, flanking, zones of control, cover, and line of sight.  The game is very solid in this regard.
<br>
<br>The RPG components are not bad as well, with a variety of choices for how you improve and manage your hero characters.
<br>
<br>Where the game really falls down IMO is the strategic layer.  Despite a number of different races, the units you build end up feeling much the same.  That said, the units are not the biggest issue here and TBH there is some synergy to be gained by constructing certain units and armies that work well together.
<br>
<br>The cities themselves are pretty much postage stamp representations of each other despite being from different races.  There are very few decisions to make here since your building all build in a couple turns and there is little reason to specialize.  City management on large maps become a tedious and somewhat boring chore.  Until changes to the strategic layer are made I feel smaller maps which tend to focus more on the tactical battles provides the best play.
<br>
<br>As I said, the game has potential and it will be interesting to see where it ends up after a few patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4126263">Expand</a></span>

The empire building is pretty bad... each different faction has the same buildings, with only one difference, and there are very few buildings. Your cities will build everything very quickly, and then you have no choice but to expand. On harder difficulties, expanding is the ONLY real choice. You can&apos;t build tall, because cities have such few buildings and reach their maximum population level very quickly. There&apos;s also very little downside to settler spam, and the benefits far outweigh the negatives.
<br>
<br>The empire building also moves at a very, very fast pace. On normal mode, for example, you typically complete a building in 2-3 turns, and most military units in 1 turn. However, the maps are very big. This creates a problem... by the time you&apos;re done exploring the map (especially on larger map settings), endgame will be here. And endgame is very, very stale. It usually consists of spamming your hero class&apos;s tier 4 units, and supplementing them with stun units. Virtually every race and hero class does this, because there&apos;s no downside to having t4 units other than upkeep, and they&apos;re very easy to get. You can get t3 units by the 20th turn, if not earlier, and if you take the time to try and expand you&apos;re going to get swarmed on harder difficulties or in multiplayer.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, the game boils down to battle after battle. When it&apos;s late in the game, if you&apos;re fighting a player that&apos;s equally as strong as you are, it often comes down to a deadlock. Both of you might have 5-6 cities pumping out strong units every 1-2 turns. Sometimes these fights can take hours, especially if they involve multiple armies. You can autobattle, but it&apos;s not recommended, as your units seem to behave like morons.
<br>
<br>Thus, the game has a flow problem; the empire building and research happen very quickly, but because military units are produced so quickly, you just end up with hours of t4 units fighting other t4 units.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619273">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- A beautiful strategic map
<br>- Combat is fast, brutal and entertaining
<br>- It is fun to level your Heroes and Leader; it adds RPG to the game. Also quests that can be gained from independent cities or dwellings add to RPG-feel.
<br>- Concept of Race &amp; Class for your Leader provide much variety in play. For example, you can play as a Orc Sorcerer, Dwarven Warlord, Elven Rogue, Goblin Dreadnought etc.
<br>- Classes are really different from each other; this applies to gameplay, spells and units. .
<br>- Nice campaigns with different outcomes
<br>- A pretty good Random Map generator with tons of options
<br>- Users make custom scenarios and challenges with Map Editor
<br>- Great music
<br>- The developer (Triumph Studios) listens really well to the community; as of patch 1.4 it has fixed (almost) all bugs/issues and in the next patch there will also be much new functionality.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- In general races could be more varied. The good news is that the Devs are working on this and is expected to improve in the next free patch.
<br>- Although the idea behind alignment is nice (good/neutral/evil is based on your actions and not on your race choice), it remains a bit shallow imo. But also this will be addressed in next patch, making alignment having more impact.
<br>- MOD-tools are not released at this moment (feb 2015). They most probably will in the future though.
<br>
<br>Other comments:
<br>- For new-comers to the game it can be difficult to learn and to master. It is recommended to watch some videos on YouTube if you are new to the Age of Wonder-series. For example: How to play Age of Wonders 3-videos by iHunterKiller.
<br>- I cannot comment on Multiplayer as I don&apos;t have much experience on it.
<br>
<br>Overall I recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in Turn Based Strategy games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4954740">Expand</a></span>

Sadly for several years they did not have anything, but now they brought it back and is better than ever. The story of Athla has been expanded and the game play has been increased to give us a greater experience. Smarter AIs and tougher opponents. The Dev team is even great listening to the players and giving us new stuff to expand the game.</span>

Regardless, this game had one of the best launches I&apos;ve seen in a long time. The AI is rather competent and capable of making your life miserable, and it doesn&apos;t appear to cheat. The auto resolve battles seem to actually play an auto-match instead of just calculating victory on unit stacks, so sometimes when it predicts defeat you&apos;ll win and vice versa.
<br>.
<br>The Campaign is surprisingly good, it&apos;s got it&apos;s problems and it&apos;s extremely difficult but the art between scenes and the story are really well done, and some of the minor heroes are genuinely interesting. The campaign also features a decision at some point that effects the rest of the campaign and the outcome and ending too.
<br>.
<br>The real meat of the game is in the custom scenarios and random maps. The largest map size is so massive that it can take days to finish a single game, while small maps are best for multiplayer and rush battles can be surprisingly fun (I expected them not to be).
<br>.
<br>The game allows you to customize your sandbox wizard rather extensively, choosing from a variety of race/class combinations, selecting abilities influencing research trees, spells, and empire passives, and it allows you a great deal of control over how your wizard looks.  Unfortunately the schools of magic are somewhat lacking from previous games, with earth and water magic being entirely underwhelming at least as of the vanilla game.
<br>.
<br>The game has a variety of classes and each race has a variety of units, including irregulars and tier 3 units that are different for every race. Archers and priests are also fairly interesting as they tend to differ a lot between races, unfortunately melee and base mounted units tend to be generic.
<br>.
<br>If the game had more victory conditions it would probably be a lot more fun, especially if there were better victory screens or scenes at the end of a random map. Some will find it more combat focused than they might prefer, but the same was true of past Age of Wonders games, and the 4x city building/expanding elements are still quite addictive, with terraforming options and a variety of spells.
<br>.
<br>Devs have announced many changes and features they plan for the future and it appears that they&apos;re working on bring back old races and possibly new classes. The future looks bright for this game, and it&apos;s well worth the lower than average price they&apos;re asking for it. Players who actually like 4x games and stick with it enough to learn what it has to offer will get their money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4145905">Expand</a></span>

The artwork and battle grounds are fantastic and evoke feelings of treading through a world steeped in deep lore.
<br>
<br>I started with the campaign, but it wasnt until I tried the random map generator that I really got hooked (I&apos;ll have to get back to the campaigns at some points.. just .. cant.. seem to find the time!).  The random maps are beautifully done and are unique adventures everytime.  Early game is about exploration and leveling and questing, mid game is about skirmishing and getting a good position to face the AIs and then finally taking out the AI&apos;s.  This is as I see it anyway, and makes for a very satisfying experience!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4162556">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve been rocking AOW3 for the last couple of weekends with a couple of friends in hot-seat mode. And when I say rocking, I mean full on day in - day out marathons with tiny brakes for sleep. We must be at the 30 hour mark by now, which seems a good place to voice opinion.
<br>
<br>First the basics. The AOW series were strongly inspired by the HOMM series and &quot;Masters Of Magic&quot;, so it comes to no surprise that they sport game play that is a mix and match from both. You build and develop cities (MOM/CIV), to produce armies (MOM/CIV/HOMM). These armies are led by great heroes (HOMM) into tactical combat with the enemy and independent mobs (HOMM). There is a research tree based on your leader&apos;s class and specializations (MOM) and of course powerful strategic spells (MOM/HOMM).
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t go over graphics, sound and interface since I find those irrelevant if they are capable of getting the job done without distraction and they seem to be in this case (sans the bloom in some combat locations, it&apos;s just mehhh...). The sole fact that me and me palls have been afflicted by the &quot;just one more turn&quot; syndrome is reason enough for me to rate this game as high as I did. But let me go over what I actually find so appealing in AOW3. Even with it&apos;s multitude of combat units the game somehow manages to find balance in chaos. All games we&apos;ve played thus far have been &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; close. Each player is constantly grasping for the win until the bitter end when the true winner is revealed through greater cunning, strategy or tactics. An example for it&apos;s good balance is that when two similar strength armies engage, often only just a few units survive. Note that similar strength doesn&apos;t mean the same army composition, four well developed heroes versus a plethora of regular units are also evenly matched armies. I also very much enjoy the choices the game provides, should I make my heroes into leaders or combatants? Should I focus my cities into military development and get my racial units or build up research and mana so I can get my class units? Should I summon an additional guy for the next fight or preserve casting points for combat magic? The game is full with interesting choices like these and what makes them interesting is that both paths are viable. The random map generator is excellent, it creates gorgeous maps with a lot of interesting locations and good starting positions. This for me translates into infinite number of maps available for play.
<br>
<br>Enough praise, lets go over the bad parts. First of all the AI is atrocious. I&apos;m playing on the hardest possible difficulty setting and all it does is spam cities. When war pokes it&apos;s ugly head, it either sends lone units/heroes or in the rare occasions when it actually has a sizable force it divides it into small armies that are ripe for the picking. Mob encounters start to get very similar very quickly. The game has tons of different units and I don&apos;t see why mobs should be so limited in their choice. And that goes double for scoundrels, every game I&apos;ve played thus far has had me slaughter uncountable amounts of scoundrels - scoundrel villages, scoundrel patrols, scoundrel guards, etc. It&apos;s a minor issue with me that the game deploys one of a full army&apos;s units behind the battle line and there seems to be no way of picking which unit that is or to move it&apos;s starting point. Most of the time you would have time to get into position before the actual battle begins, but it&apos;s a silly thing to have left in what is otherwise a very polished game.
<br>
<br>Finally, to end on a good note. Triumph (the developer of this game) seem devoted to their player base and have already released a patch that addresses a bunch of issues pointed out by players. This is a good sign and perhaps the game will only get better with time. I strongly recommend this game and my suggestion, as of now, is to stick to multi-player on small/medium maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4138312">Expand</a></span>

It seems really underrated to me but that could be because of differences between this one and the older games, which I&apos;ve never played.
<br>
<br>The campaigns are really fun; I usually hate campaigns in strategy games but this game actually has really enjoyable campaigns with great voice acting, fun little storylines and beautiful artwork. It&apos;s also quite atmospheric and the music is mostly really nice (a couple of obnoxious songs but many great ones, too).
<br>
<br>AoW 3 is quite charming. I enjoy exploring the map, finding items, and working on building up my hero/leader. The customization for leaders is superb and there are so many different spells, abilities, items, etc. Tactical, turn based combat is amazingly fun. The option to automate it when you don&apos;t feel like doing it is also nice. The exploration sites are especially fun because they are usually in unique battlefield locations (castles, dungeons, etc.) and involve 6v6 balanced battles that end up being very well balanced and challenging.
<br>
<br>The game is not without some minor flaws (e.g., tech tree implemented poorly and you can&apos;t see the progression, etc.) and city building is so-so, but there aren&apos;t any major issues that break the game and overall it&apos;s a blast to play. I have so much fun just playing around with all the different classes, spells, etc., finding items, exploring the map, and enjoying the tactical battles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5245382">Expand</a></span>

Continuing along the lines of the previous iterations, there is a lot of character customization and a wide variety of maps. Definitely worth picking up on a Steam sale if you enjoy games like Heroes of Might and Magic.</span>

<br>
<br>But the base game is a fantastic game. It stays true to the series&apos; roots in a way that usually doesn&apos;t happen with sequels anymore. It is fun, it is innovative, it is challenging, it is rewarding. For anyone who is a fan of 4X or TBS games, try Age of Wonders 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5208156">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Age of Wonders is originally a series with its own unique characteristics and UI, but the transition to a streamlined modern title (AOW3) makes it lose all its charms, becoming a game excels at nothing but with some basic elements in modern 4x title.
<br>
<br>The empire management (happiness), diplomacy (leader scene) and resource controlled by cities gives me a recall of Civilization 5. Unfortunately, the depth of empire management is non-existent. Happiness is mainly determined by how often you win wars, so you have no other main ways to control it. City management is just a simple decision choice to build something (a selection of text from an interface) which unlock units or generate new resource per turn. After you have made the decision, nothing needs to be worried about, and you can just click end turn while controlling units to explore in mean time until it is done for your next decision choice. Diplomacy is just a joke, you only need to care about 3 resources in game, and so there is no need for trading or whatsoever. Even you negotiate something with other factions; they may soon break it without any consequence. Because the main goal of this game is only to crush all factions other than you in the map, so AI won&#x2019;t even bother with this.
<br>
<br>On the RPG perspective and combat side, it is sub-par compared to HOMM3 or King&#x2019;s Bounty series. Spell is limited and can only be cast once per battle. Equipment choice is a joke, as you may only come over with 1 or 2 equipment before the game ends, as you need to rush and finish off your opponents quickly, before the game ends up as a deadlock and repetitive resource depletion fight. King&#x2019;s Bounty does a much better job in the aspect of hero growth and equipment variety. Combat lack the awesomeness and varied ability of units in King&#x2019;s Bounty series, a high quantity of ranged units and powerful spell is all that matters. In terms of the exploration and turn progression, HOMM3 does a better job in this area.
<br>
<br>The only thing unique in this game is the leader choice and race combination, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter too much. The core basics of race remain the same and unit variety is still similar as ranged, melee, and calvary, although the leader gives some benefits for each race which doesn&#x2019;t matter in long term.
<br>
<br>In the end, it is just a slow-pacing RTS executed in a turn-based perspective where you control hero or scout to explore a tiny map and gather 3 types of resource, while the cities serve as a resource generator with automatic resource generation per turn and a barrack for military unit production, so that you can produce units to rush all your enemies ASAP before the enemies have too much resource to recover its loss, which is the only vital strategy for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5053827">Expand</a></span>

Ever since I got into these games, I&apos;ve been looking for a very specific type of game. I wanted something set in a fantasy world with a great combat system (preferably not RTS, which isn&apos;t my thing), memorable factions, and diplomatic options for victory. That&apos;s a pretty tall order for a genre that already doesn&apos;t have a whole lot of options. When I heard about AoW III, I jumped at the chance to play it.
<br>
<br>After spending a dozen hours over the last couple of days with it, I have to say that this is very close to being exactly what I was looking for. AoW is set in a fantasy world with beautiful 3D graphics. While graphics aren&apos;t the most important thing in a strategy game, the lush, colorful world of AoW really draws you in right off the bat. Things get even better when you go into combat. One of the best things about fantasy is the flashy spells, and this game definitely doesn&apos;t disappoint. Spells can cast an eerie, otherworldly glow over the whole battlefield, or cloak your entire army in lightning. You definitely won&apos;t be disappointed in terms of aesthetics.
<br>
<br>The combat system is turn-based and thorughly enjoyable. Units are lead by heroes for whom you can acquire gear and learn new skills upon leveling up. Unlike in some games where winning is just a matter of having more units in the area (ahem...Civ 5), here every battle plays out like a chess game. Both positioning and the battlefield itself play huge roles. Are you outmuscled by a particularly powerful unit? Set a trap and have one unit flank him from behind (there are bonuses for flanking and penalties for various postional disadvantages), then, when he turns around, have the other unit flank him. Combat never gets dull here. Even though you can sim battles, you&apos;ll find yourself wanting to fight out every one of them.
<br>
<br>The game has several paces you can choose from that focus on different aspects of gameplay. Are you all about war? You can set up the game for that. Do you wanna take your time and build an empire of scratch? You can set up for that, too. I play on empire building pace. While this is fun and certainly very streamlined to limit micromanagement, the options for city building are a little lacking. There&apos;s really no focus on culture or religion or anything like that. Instead, every building is there to either unlock units or generate gold or mana. For me, this is kind of a bummer, and here&apos;s hoping they can turn out an expansion pack that adds to the non-combat side of empire building. Same thing goes for diplomacy. You have your basic peace treaty, alliance, open borders options, but this aspect of the game is definitely lacking.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is an awesome game that&apos;s well worth the money. It really shines in terms of exploration (owing to the beautifully rendered world) and combat, but lacks in the economic and diplomatic side of things. Things are streamlined so that it will be accessible even to beginners, but it might be a little lacking for hardcore micromanagers. Even without super-detailed management options, however, this game is still a winner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4113550">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>ok so maybe its a little bit boring to clean all the map of those bandits. and i dont want to play every single battle becouse its a waste of time. so i use the autoresolve button and voila, i lost 2 or 3 units to kill 3 bandits. so you have to fight every single battle or you are going to lose units or maybe a hero.
<br>
<br>graphics are no good or bad. sound its no good or bad too. magic is a little bit useless, like 85% of the spells you are going to use em like 1 or 2 times at most.
<br>
<br>my veredict: only play it if you are a fan or a bored gamer. excuse me if my english is bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4440610">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The general stuff: Visuals and sound are high quality as you expect it from the series, and the gameplay is the same, as well. Compared to AoW2:SM, there are fewer units (but Shadow Magic was essentially an expansion) and the game is currently more streamlined, which also makes it more accessible. Race differences and alignments don&apos;t yet matter as much as in the previous game, but developer responses on the official forum imply that this is coming. The focus is less on empire building and more on global strategy and tactical battle (no other fantasy TBS does tactical combat better). Games are relatively quick for TBS standards, especially if you opt to start with cities and an army.
<br>
<br>Content: The game has several lengthy campaigns (that you can play on either side), scenarios, a map editor (that lets you create entire campaigns), a competent random map generator (huge plus), single-player and multi-player (local, internet, and asynchronous pbem is in the making. There&apos;s a ton to do, and it&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;ll run out of things to do. There is a large number of options that allow you to customize scenarios and maps: teams, victory conditions, custom heroes, classic or simultaneous turns, terrain, map type, map size, pre-learned spells or none, and so forth.
<br>
<br>The AI: If you don&apos;t want to play against people, the AI&apos;s quality matters. Right now (two weeks after release), the AI is pretty standard for a fantasy TBS. It&apos;s not GalCiv2&apos;s excellent AI, but it&apos;s also not Civ5&apos;s excuse of an AI. It seems more competent than it was in AoW2:SM, but it&apos;s a little passive still and can be cheesed in tactical combat. The devs mentioned that the next patch will include substantial AI improvements including code that recognizes cheesing attempts and will respond to it, so by the time you read this review, things may already have changed. A nice improvement over AoW2:SM is that if you start with a settler and no town, the AI actually handles it well and does manage to be a competitive opponent. So if you go for the &quot;empire building&quot; mode, the AI will keep up with you.
<br>
<br>In short: I dig the game and don&apos;t regret that I picked it up at the full price. It&apos;s a worthy successor of AoW2:SM and didn&apos;t disappoint. The devs are active in the community and listen to suggestions. The excellent random map generator and map/scenario editor guarantee variety, and the game actually has multiplayer!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4137951">Expand</a></span>

<br>Prepare to be sucked in with Age of Wonders 3.  An amazing turn based strategy game that will continue to hold your attention and WOW you with attention to detail, depth and rich battles.
<br>The game features a series of campaigns with different routes, fun hand crafted scenarios and a random map generator with different modes to play.
<br>You pick a race/class/specializations which are all interesting, fun and create different synergies.
<br>Orc warlord? Human Dreadnaught? Elven sorcerer?,
<br>Goblin Archdruid Specializing in water magic to create a swampy empire?
<br>You name it! the combinations are plenty!
<br>Each race starts off with a variety of units that for the most part fill common roles,
<br>Infantry, Archer, Pikeman, Cavalry, flyers, and support.  All these units per race ARE UNIQUE and different, it just might not appear that way on the surface. Orcs are great at melee, elves great with archers etc.
<br>Classes affect your spells in and out of combat, and units that you get.
<br>Terrain/weather affect.
<br>Your leader and Heroes units level up and can customized.
<br>Units can level up.
<br>Different sub factions that can be conquered and used to your advantage. Like dragons and giants.
<br>I can go on and on but the combinations and situations to be in are plenty and it never gets dull.

Narratively, the single player campaign is at the same level with its predecessor - the story is boring, uninspired, and the gameplay and story do little to interact. However, if you liked AoW2, you&apos;ll like this one as well - it&apos;s the same title with some make-up and a fancy new clothes.</span>

<br>They somehow managed to keep the mystique of the series alive (the remixed, driving epic music gives the game of thrones theme a run for its money!) while piling on strategic and tactical depth with more unit types and abilities and some game-changing spells (Chaos rift left my jaw agape - made me feel like a god opening the heavens!).
<br>
<br>Definitely worth picking up for any serious strategy gamer - and while not an entry level title, it&apos;s approachable enough that novices should be able to pick up and play as well.

The game is so deep, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a game like it. This game sets a standard on its own, other things aren&apos;t even in the same ballgame. It&apos;s quite a lot to take in when you&apos;re just starting out but it really grows on you, I&apos;m even waiting for the upcoming DLC more than I am waiting for other games to come out.

<br>Great fantasy aspect, excellent strategy aspect (especially in Multi Player), huge number of variables that influence gameplay making each game feel totally different. There are 6 classes right now and I&apos;ve been playing the same class over and over again for the last couple of weeks and keep finding out new things or ways to improve my game.

When you get  game mechanic you will discover its full potential. This game makes you think and improvise to achieve victory instead of building big army to win by force. Graphic is great and back story of any creature in game make me smile :)</span>

However, it should at least note that there is considerable game play to be had.
<br>
<br>I have tried some of the other 4X games and found their combat to be lacking. To me, this is the largest pro about AoW III. It isn&apos;t simply &quot;build the cap unit&quot; and have the computer auto resolve dice rolls. When two opposing units fight, the game switches to a battle board. From there, both sides take turns moving their pieces. All the units have strengths and weaknesses to other types of units in the game. Additionally, mixing units together to form an army stack allows for certain synergies to take place during combat.
<br>
<br>Mind you, yes, this can be both a pro and a con. If you enjoy in depth tactical battles, akin to the early versions of Battle Isle, this game will likely hook you in for hours and hours of game play.
<br>
<br>When creating a leader, you have a choice in class and race. Furthermore, you are able to pick three times from a list of specializations. Each of these brings additional variables to the table. Therefore, there are a considerable number of variations before you even start on a map. The same number of variables apply to your opponents as well. Thus, each game has its own hurdles to over come. Add in a random map generator, and voila - No two games will be identical.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a TBS with intricate combat, AoW III is definitely the game to pick up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5001510">Expand</a></span>

Reminds me of Warlock Master of the Arcane. Overall, this is a good game, and I&apos;m sure once they fix all the bugs and improve the AI it may even be a 9.
<br>
<br>Right now, looking at the elven campaign on hard, it seems that the enemy AI is really bad. Most of the time it does not do anything, no new settlements, no major offensives (saw it only once). The enemy seems to be able to instantly spawn 3-4 stacks of 6 units in their capital when you get within the borders, but it does nothing with those units. They just sit around the capital, about 18 units. I can park my army of 6 within the borders, and the enemy would do nothing. A normal course of action would be to kill off my guys.
<br>
<br>The campaign has good story, and one of my biggest complaints is the poor character resurrection system - the faction leader can die and will be resurrected in X turns, but secondary heroes that &quot;must survive&quot; cannot be resurrected. This creates a lot of situations where a random succubus or a bunch of flank attacks cause me to lose a scenario. This is really annoying when after spending 30 minutes in a capital battle, some succubus flies over the wall, charms my hero and causes me to have to replay the battle.
<br>
<br>In terms of civilization upgrades, all races have exactly the same buildings, and there isn&apos;t much depth to the buildings, maybe 20 different buildings, all leading to the grand palace. Each of 6 classes has a class specific building to produce 4-5 class based units. I think there&apos;s only 4 tiers of units. There is not that much difference between the races, they all have an archer, infantry, pikeman, cavalry, etc.
<br>
<br>Overall, a good game once the bugs get polished out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4112432">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve now played for 40 hours on two maps and am sick of this game.  It feels like I&apos;m playing AOW2 with poorer maps.  Despite the graphics, the maps in AOW3 are POORLY decorated, as if they were decorated by an AI--they look completely generic and more or less the same except for their shape.    I&apos;ve seen all the AOW3 maps, which are much smaller than AOW1&amp;2 (even the XL size), and they look like they were decorated with a palette of maybe 15 tiles.  Good maps in AOW2 are decorated with thousands of beautiful tiles and exquisite detail.  The maps in AOW3 are plain, boring, and pedestrianly conceived.    The tiles are limited, plain, generic, and boring whereas the tilesets in AOW2 were hundreds of times more vast, and indeed, many of them were wondrous.  There used to be all kinds of beautiful, cool swirling magically wondrous things in the AOW2 tilesets, but they are nowhere to be seen in AOW3.
<br>
<br>I think the problem is that instead of attempting to break some new ground in the genre, all they did was take the easy way out and bring AOW2 into the 21st century (circa ~2007, mind you) by giving it a makeover.  That&apos;s it, AOW3 (should be AOW2.5) is nothing but a makeover.  And they thought they could actually make money doing it.  I mean, they must be trying to target the undiscerning consumer who loves playing games in 2014 that were good enough to be out in 2007.
<br>
<br>To wrap this up, finally, so I can put the bad taste behind me...  I would have been 100 times more satisfied if, instead of taking the time and effort and cost to &quot;develop&quot; AOW3, they simply put out a new pack of beautiful, wondrous maps for AOW2, which was a game that I can only describe as perfection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4102098">Expand</a></span>
