However, there are a couple of things that irk me. First the game has a very distinct lack of video options, for the pc version. On top of this, they reuse two levels, several times. One for night time missions and one for day time missions, both tropical and both use the same prefab structures.
<br>
<br>For 20 dollars, its worth the price, but I wish there was a little bit more variety in the mission locales. Then again, what do you expect for 20 dollars?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=5108806">Expand</a></span>

<br>Only downside so far - it takes a while to figure out all the controls, you can cut those cutscenes, but it isn&apos;t too easy to work out how.  Only real problem is that unlike sniper elite you can&apos;t just save as and when, you need to keep going back to the last checkpoint.
<br>I got it in a sale, if it goes to full price again you can prob pick it up on kinguin at the sale price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4851416">Expand</a></span>

Not only is the quality of the game of a very high standard but the technical execution is top-notch that puts other AAA developers to shame in this market. I am a massive Metal Gear Solid fan and I hold the utmost respect for Hideo Kojima and his Konami team who have delivered once again; a breathtaking title with huge care and attention. Their loyalty to fans is admirable in what has been a very difficult year for gamers and gaming as a whole.
<br>
<br>The ambition Konami have and their passion for games make this prologue a great purchase and a welcome warm-up for The Phantom Pain. Some may argue that this is a glorified demo but there is enough content here to guarantee hours of play and substantial replay value. The main portion of the game is a single mission with a simple objective; rescue two hostages from a military base. Other missions within the same base called &apos;Side Ops&apos; can be unlocked which add plentiful more hours to the game. Completing the main mission and additional operations can unlock extra missions, equipment and collectables. Also you&apos;ll be eager to improve your completion times and mission grade based on performance. Although the military base is central to the whole game; it is massive and offers many ways to complete the tasks on offer. The objectives are varied and even the night/day missions add a whole new dimension which keeps the game fresh.
<br>
<br>This title is a fantastic introduction to the forthcoming MGS V and gives gamers a snippet of what can be expected. The cinematic quality is of a remarkable standard as expected and the gameplay is a welcome taster of things to come. The Phantom Pain will be &apos;200 times the size&apos; according to Kojima and I believe him as his honesty and professionalism throughout his career has been spot on and it&apos;s wonderful to see him embracing the PC market once again. Whatever you think of this &apos;game&apos;; Konami deserve so much credit and respect and their product deserves to be purchased at such a generous price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4847908">Expand</a></span>

<br>the graphics in this game is totally fantastic,the shadows and model looks gorgeous,
<br>and the enemy&apos;s AI is also very good,enemy will do different action due to different situation,
<br>the stealth system and the classic MGS shooting style are improved from the last game.
<br>Also I am so glad they made this on PC,so more people can experience the fun of MGS</span>

Even at maximum settings and high resolutions beyond 1080p a single Graphics Card will run the game just fine at or near 60 FPS. This can&apos;t be said about the most other games that came out in 2014, perhaps with Alien Isolation being the only other well optimized game.
<br>
<br>Why i&apos;m still only giving it a 8/10? Navigating through the game feeled a bit clunky to me (both Gamepad and Mouse/Keyboard) and there are a few design flaws that shouldn&apos;t really be there. For example dead bodies just disappear if you move a bit away from them and return to the spot. Ruins a part of the realism the game is otherwise delivering well.
<br>
<br>The main mission is set at nighttime and the graphics are phenomenal with all the lighting effects during this mission. In the side missions that play during daytime however you can see that this is not really what I would call next-gen graphics, if compared to other recent titles, but still pretty good.
<br>
<br>I liked the song that was playing in the cutscene and i&apos;m looking forward to play MGSV: The Phantom Pain in 2015.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4837506">Expand</a></span>

<br>But I was against this game at the time of the console release, because i didnt wanted to support a one and a half hours &quot;long&quot; game. Well,I was wrong.
<br>
<br>Maybe the main story mission is short (around 90 minutes at first try), but there are 6 more missions takes another 50-90 minutes to complete each. At this time I have 14+ hours in this game and haven&apos;t completed all of the content, so i will go back again and continue this great game.
<br>
<br>The open world setting and the very polished gameplay mechanics makes the thing so great. You can go from any direction, with any weapon, using any tactics from killing all, to sleep/stun the guys or just avoid them.
<br>
<br>The various missions taking place different times of a day, and the camp&apos;s layout offers many possibilities to take on or fool those guards, who are present in different numbers and walking on different patrol routes in each mission.
<br>
<br>An the top of that there is a real big replay value in this game. I am really not the guy, who likes to repeat the same thing all over again, but the rating system at the mission&apos;s end, and the unlockable weapons, skins, or easter eggs made me having great fun with this game.
<br>
<br>Playing this game is the more fun from actual gameplay aspect than any other previous MGS title.
<br>
<br>9/10 where the 9 means that this game is one of the best games in the genre if not.
<br>
<br>+ Exemplary optimalization and port quality. Best of 2014
<br>+ Very nice graphics and performance
<br>+ Hell lots of ways to complete any mission
<br>+ Perfect dark tone story, great execution
<br>+ Tons of easter eggs for the fans
<br>+ Lots of unlockable bonuses
<br>+ Save game carries over to the Phantom Pain
<br>
<br>- If it would be 40 hours long, i would say it is short</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4869294">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has full Keyboard+Mouse support or the 360 gamepad.
<br>The sound quality is amazing, same with the voice acting. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job voice acting Snake. It was a little shocking at first because i&apos;m so used to the voice of David Hayter, but i got along just fine and i believe Sutherland will live to everyone&apos;s expectation in this game and The Phantom Pain.
<br>
<br>The game might be a little bit short but the story is pretty good (If you played Peace Walker, you will understand). Besides, the pricing is perfect and the game offers some replay value. This is just a little slice of what we are going to get in The Phantom Pain and i cannot wait for it.
<br>I&apos;m thankful for finally being able to play this on PC the way it was meant to be played. 9 months ago, i bought a PS4 for this game and i was about to order the game for the console, i&apos;m so glad i&apos;ve waited for the PC version.
<br>
<br>Hats off to one of the greatest developers of all time, Hideo Kojima. Thank you so much for this, thank you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4837754">Expand</a></span>

<br>Firstly the good: The game runs really great, has nice graphics and is on discount right now.
<br>
<br>But...
<br>
<br>Starting the game with my Razer Sabertooth connected makes the camera constantly pitch upwards and all the gamepad buttons are messed up - triggers turn the character, select/start act as triggers for readying weapon/firing et c. Plugging it in after starting the game allows it to work fine. Still have to actually move the mouse pointer into a corner since it&apos;s there and does nothing.
<br>
<br>The controls in general are very finger-twisting, especially the tap/hold options. To interrogate someone you have to sneak up on them, hold RT (praying that you don&apos;t actually knock them out LOUDLY) then also hold LB AND choose the option with the right thumbstick, holding all that for the entire duration. Any slip-up causes the interrogation to go to hell in a handbasket...
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s fluidity is damaged by Snake&apos;s mobility being by far very limited. If you&apos;ve played Splinter Cell Blacklist, for example, you&apos;ll certainly miss options like climbing up the scaffolding and taking an enemy out silently. While MGS has its own traditions lack of logical options really damages the game.
<br>
<br>...And exfiltrating a coastal military base in a helicopter as opposed to a boat is a stupid thing to do, regardless of circumstances.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4845954">Expand</a></span>

However, I found it to much more than that; My most recent MGS game being 4 at it&apos;s release in 2008, I felt quite rusty going into this. Ground Zeroes is a good warm-up for MGS5, consisting of six missions that take place in the same ficticious Cuban military base, Camp Omega. The &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot; mission is the meat of the story, involving the rescue of two minors on opposite sides of the base that were apparently major characters from Peace Walker. Interspersed cutscenes and collectible cassette tapes flesh out the character&apos;s back stories and their experiences on the base. The extra missions provide vastly different approaches and playstyles to infiltrating (or assaulting) the base, ranging from a helicopter ride providing covering fire to an assassination mission that fails easily if you are even spotted. After you finish each mission there&apos;s still plenty of unlocks and time trials for purists, along with the last two missions for waxing nostalgia.
<br>
<br>Ground Zeroes helps to connect the events of Peace Walker with MGS5 and acts as a catalyst for the time jump been the two games. Overall, this probably won&apos;t win over any new fans but is a thoroughly fleshed out &quot;VR Mission&quot;-style side game that provides a solid intro to The Phantom Pain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4867962">Expand</a></span>

I played Sons Of Liberty on PS2.
<br>
<br>When I played the game, it was a whole new gameplay experience for me on third-person shooter titles. Controls of MGSII:SoL was not that free as other third-person games and it took time for me to get used to its controls.
<br>
<br>One thing I noticed in all MGS games from the first one to Snake Eater (I only played main titles of the game at the moment.) was you can&#x2019;t walk while crouching as it automatically goes to prone movement than crouch movement, which for me was awkward. But this changed on Metal Gear Solid IV: Guns of the Patriots, which I have not played yet so you guys know.
<br>
<br>With the next-generation consoles rising and PC gaming is also catching up with the console exclusives, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes was released on PC platform last December 18, 2014, after 9 months of its original release on consoles last March 18, 2014. The fifth installment of the game is the second title to be released on PC.
<br>
<br>The story takes place after the events of Peace Walker which is set on year 1975. Snake, protagonist of the espionage tale, was sent to the U.S prison facility based in Cuba to retrieve two of his pawns: Chico and Paz&#x2026; the story continues when The Phantom Pain releases.
<br>
<br>Intriguing and hanging as it was always been set by Hideo Kojima, the mind and director of the game. You are left with that feeling of wanting to have the continuation in your grasps.
<br>
<br>As what we know of next-generation titles, we expect them to be graphically improved and with technology gives the developers the ability to make their game as realistic as possible with lighting effects and face rendering.
<br>
<br>This time, from first Metal Gear Solid to Metal Gear Solid IV, MSGV has completely dazzled me in a way that it deserves to have the &#x201C;Next-Gen Graphics&#x201D; title on top of Kojima&#x2019;s masterpiece. And he still keeps the &#x201C;in-game&#x201D; cutscenes which pretty much, for me, the key of the game than rendering CGI Animations as their cutscenes. MGS still stayed true to in-games graphics which we hardly see in most games nowadays.
<br>
<br>Even if the game has well-detailed visuals, without its core music and score the game is nothing. With Harry-Gregson Williams reprising his position to be the composer of the MGS title, all I can say is the game plus its score can blow you from the edge of your seat.
<br>
<br>MGS5 still gives us the similar gameplay which we know and love. Since I can&#x2019;t compare the difference between MGS4 and MGS5 (as I stated above, I didn&#x2019;t play MGS4 yet), I can only tell the difference between MGS3 and MGS5. A lot of improvements on the game, I know they already applied crouch-movement in MGS4, what I can say is the game combined with the old stealth-based MGS with a SOCOM U.S Navy Seals shooting-perspective gameplay, you can now choose to be either aggressive and kill everyone in your path to complete your mission OR you can be stealthy and knock off some of those bad boys cold and finish the mission without getting caught or killing anyone OR be both.
<br>
<br>Decision making of the game is crucial now than the older titles of MGS as this time it&#x2019;s not just a walk in park.

<br>For the most, the game can be finished within a 20 minute period. The game is considered as a prologue in books. I finished the game in 1 hour and 6 minutes 26 seconds, it took me time because I died twice in game and took me a while to look for an entrance which led me listen to the recording in-game for like 6 times.
<br>
<br>MSGV:Ground Zeroes will still pull you back in game just to know what other secrets Hideo Kojima added in-game. Hideo himself is also in game which I have not yet encountered but I will do another re-run of the game to unlock those secrets.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is fantastic even if it&#x2019;s only a 20minute-ish game and it makes you want more to finish and to know what happened in the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4902683">Expand</a></span>

Which is way better for me on replay than 1 long campaign. The only possible reasons to call it a demo are because there is only 1 area or you paid over $20.You could call the story a demo caz theres not much. Call it a prologue if anything.Everything is excellent high quality stuff, besides Sutherland dialing it in like hes getting paid $20.Will try to acquire phantom pain as close to launch as possible, i will however make sure it is up to standard like i have to do with everthing else these days,even though i have no doubts. People and there 1 campaign throwaway games come on now this is mgs were talking about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4934342">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So the game is a single sandbox area wherein the game guides you through a primary mission padded along with some excellent albeit brief cut-scenes. The initial mission is quite brief, but once you have beaten it several more missions open up to take place in the same area. The missions design is excellent, especially for this type of game and offer some really serious replay value with lots of different options and strategies to explore each time.
<br>
<br>I would estimate several hours of content here, which is more than acceptable for the price and the quality level of what is here is outstanding.
<br>
<br>Tons of visual options, optimized really well and KB+Mouse controls I found surprisingly better than the controller. This is a top to bottom polished PC version of a really top notch Metal Gear experience. We will be waiting for some time for the Phantom Pain to be released on PC, but Ground Zeroes demonstrates with almost certainty that the wait will be worthwhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4855507">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On my MSI GT70 Ground Zeroes runs miles and miles better than Watchdogs and Far Cry 4 and looks much more beautiful.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend you pick this up, especially at a 33% discount on day 1.</span>

<br>But this is a warning to those that are left-handed to stay way. I wouldn&apos;t mind if we could sell our games.
<br>The keys that are impossible to bind on the keyboard are:
<br>
<br>Enter, Backspace, Insert, Delete, End, Home, my 2 side mouse buttons, my mouse wheel scrolls, the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the decimal point on my numberpad.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s 21 bindings that have been removed from me. That never happens to those that can play with WASD, so it shouldn&apos;t be done for those that are left-handed. I have contacted Konami, hoping they will rectify this and I can play the game properly and give it a better review. But for now, I can&apos;t even play it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve found even the weapon selection is atrocious. You hold a button and press a direction on your keyboard. For that, we usually get the direction of our mouse movement, the mouse wheel or keys on the keyboard. This is just them replacing the d-pad selection from a controller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=5318472">Expand</a></span>

<br>A paid demo, kickstarter or however people want to call it, this is something that a die hard MGS fan craving for a MGS game might be able to forgive.
<br>
<br>The price point may not be unreasonable compared to the console release (especially to those who got it on sale like myself), still I would rather Konami made the fans wait a little bit longer and released everything in single game, rather than throw us a small chunk of it then leave us craving for more and end up paying for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849305">Expand</a></span>

Do not buy this, wait for The Phantom Pain. Its not worth 15 quid, its not worth 10, its not worth 5 or even anything, its a demo, it should be free, I can not believe that some people are defending this because its a good port, so this is what the world comes to, make it a good port and you win the PC fans over, don&apos;t even worry about content. Game play itself was fun enough, about 8/10 minus 8 because Konami have charged people money for a demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4864117">Expand</a></span>

What it does do is show me a solid game I&apos;d likely enjoy more if I could sink my teeth into it beyond just what&apos;s at the surface. It doesn&apos;t deserve to be overglorified or slammed for what it is. The price might be worth taking a point off since it&apos;s perhaps worth $10 or less, because regardless of how long you can play this demo, it&apos;s still just a demo that only really lets you sample what the big game will be like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4853305">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anyways here is my review on Graphics, Gameplay and audio:
<br>
<br>---
<br>Gameplay: the inventory system is completely ruined and doesn&apos;t feel like MGS anymore. The old MGS games had a good and simple easy to use interface and map but here it just feels like a thing from a first person shooter!
<br>
<br>Graphics: The game looks great on ultra-settings but performance suffers at some points. If you don&apos;t have a high end PC then you can play on medium setting but it doesn&apos;t look as good as the ultra. I&apos;m sure they can do a better optimization than this.
<br>
<br>Audio: David Hayter is not Snake anymore, this alone makes it a complete failure. The soundtrack is overall not as memorable as MGS1 and MGS2
<br>---
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t believe those who gave this game a high score... they&apos;re either lying to themselves or new to the MGS series because this is in no way what fans of the series wanted. If you loved the first 3 games you&apos;ll be very disappointed with this one. I hope Phantom pain will be better because this was as bad as MGS4</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4848396">Expand</a></span>

I have a very high end PC (970 SLI, i7-5030k) running on a 4K monitor so I was a disappointed to see how average the graphics look, very plasticy. I have to say even the latest COD looks better. The game ran fine, but I think we have become too nostalgic in our admiration for MGS, the gameplay is awful compared to many AAA modern titles on the PC. Enemy AI is appalling, shoot one, the rest will obligingly wander over like chickens in some very basic AI routines. All the alert sounds are like the old MSG but sadly it seems the enemy AI routines are also old skool. The gun sight is  also not precise, showing it console roots and makes firefights point and click spray affairs rather than tactical sharp ranged combat. I may be a bit harsh as I play a lot of Armed Assault so I expect more realistic gun play and ballistics but its truly dated  and out of place in a big 2014 release. Im sorry to say based on this Id say MGS solids glory days are firmly locked into the past on consoles. I hope the final release proves me wrong as this is just disappointing. It should have stayed on consoles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862390">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve never played MGS before, but it&apos;s similar to Splinter Cell, which is a good thing. Graphics are great and it runs smoothly on my aging system. I&apos;ll definitely be getting the full version of The Phantom Pain when it&apos;s released.</span>

I thought my 2011 laptop wouldn&apos;t run this game but I was wrong, It can. This is with any doubts a AAA game and a really great port. If the port of The Phantom Pain will be like this one, I won&apos;t buy a desktop and more people will enjoy this masterpiece at it&apos;s fullness. Thank you for this port Kojima Productions, you won&apos;t regret porting it or any Metal Gear game for that matter.
<br>
<br>Game: 8/10 - Main reason: Short canon 1 main story mission only in 1 small open world area, some minor buggs.
<br>PC Port: 8.5/10 - My laptop from early 2011 can run this on high and some med set.
<br>
<br>Congrats to Kojima Produtions and Kojima himself once again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4859644">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is so clearly a console-first and PC-as-an-afterthought game that you cannot even use the mouse on the main menu. You don&apos;t even see your cursor on the menu (???? pretty wtf moment for me). You can&apos;t even bind extra mouse buttons or the scroll wheel.

<br>Don&apos;t support games where developers are too lazy to allow you do something so simple as to bind keys to what you want.

<br>After spending nigh on 15 hours with the PS3 version, there was no doubt left in my mind that Ground Zeroes was worthy of being a Metal Gear Solid game. Say what you will about the length of the main mission, but this game clearly makes a case for the term &quot;content&quot; being much more nuanced than how most people refer to it.
<br>
<br>Camp Omega is the real star of the show in Ground Zeroes - it feels like an amalgamation of the best levels from Thief, Hitman, and the Splinter Cell series in their heyday - and reinforces how the stealth genre is more about the levels than anything else. Everything about Camp Omega feels like it was crafted by experts: The believable vantage points, the sparing-yet-dense use of both high and low grounds, the use of light and shadow, it&apos;s all there.
<br>
<br>The PC version (both surprisingly and unsurprisingly) is the definitive way to play this game. The FOX Engine truly shines when left to flex its muscles on superior hardware. My eyes almost popped out when I saw rain water drip down the face of one of the many nameless soldiers I would chokehold into submission later on!
<br>
<br>I feel like the bar has been raised impossibly high by Ground Zeroes as a prologue to the upcoming The Phantom Pain. If the levels in the full game can capture even a fraction of the craft seen on display in this game, it will be more than something special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4874174">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only reason I didn&apos;t give it a perfect score is that I expect Phantom Pain to be a lot better and bigger. It seems like Kojima is bringing it all out in main MGSV, I&apos;m so glad then that the engine it runs on is, by all means, one of the best engines on PC. It looks amazing and runs smoothly, I didn&apos;t even dare to expect something like that was possible nowadays. Especially for a series that were good in avoiding PC for so many years. The irony continues, as does my love for it.
<br>
<br>But what is the best thing in the game is that it does not guide the player by gently holding his hand through all. It encourages to explore the possibilities and to simply have fun with all the tools it gives you. Yet another cute irony is that even though Camp Omega is not a friendly place, after spending few dedicated hours in it, it started to feel like home.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, this is not a game that one plays for the story, but a game that one plays for fun. If you think you can get over one location and one quick main mission and focus on getting 100% or at least some incredible sandbox fun, go and buy it. Once you pass the 5 hours mark in this game, you will start to catch the irony of most people reacting to it :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=5357970">Expand</a></span>

First the game has a very distinct lack of video options, for the pc version. On top of this, they reuse two levels, several times. One for night time missions and one for day time missions, both tropical and both use the same prefab</span>

You&apos;ll just be setting yourself up for disappointment if you go into this game, not playing any others before it. But, I do recommend this game to anyone who has played and liked any other MGS in the series, before hand.

<br>
<br>If so, know that this is by far the best PC port of a console game I played recently.
<br>The Normal settings are challenging but absolutely affordable while the Hard difficulty is really challenging, requires patience and skill, it is rewarding to say the least.
<br>The main mission is fun and the story, which is basically absent, is fine. It&apos;s fun to collect intel, videos and all the easter eggs from every mission.
<br>BIG PRO FOR THE PC VERSION: you get both special missions, namely: Deja Vu and Jamais Vu which are terrific, you&apos;ll laugh so hard at both if you&apos;ve been a fan of the franchise.
<br>
<br>The only bad aspects are that at Hard difficulty some missions are seemingly impossible to get the S ranking, probably because they didn&apos;t think anyone would bother. Not having a dedicated button for taking cover but having Snake do it automatically is sometimes a bit clunky and can get you spotted.
<br>The amount of ways you can play every mission is just amazing.
<br>
<br>Didn&apos;t talk about the shooting and the stealth, nails both, pretty rewarding doing headshots at almost 300 ft with a tranquillizer gun.
<br>
<br>&quot;I&apos;m good to drive&quot; Lol 10/10
<br>
<br>Actually it&apos;s more like 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366607">Expand</a></span>

<br>In short the game is a third person stealth action combat kind of a game. You play as a Snake or as he is referred later on Big Boss - the whole Metal Gear Solid time line is quite confusing but that&apos;s something for die hard to keep a track of.
<br>
<br>The game consists of a single story mission and a number of side mission&apos;s called side ops. The side ops can be treated as a full flagged missions but with just a different objectives and a lot less story following them. They all take place on a single fairly big map. While the atmospheric conditions change and vary a lot - whether it&apos;s a day or night with rain and without it you must understand that the map does not change. Though having a sandbox kind of aspect for all missions lets you learn and appreciate it&apos;s design a lot more if after a single mission you&apos;d leave to another area. I&apos;m still on the fence if that&apos;s good or not. On one hand I really did enjoy playing the same map but discovering new areas and ways of approach - on the other hand the engine seems just too powerful to have a single map.
<br>
<br>The &quot;main game&quot; is short. It took me around 70 minutes on the first try to finish the main mission - and that&apos;s including time spent learning what I&apos;m allowed to do and what I&apos;m not. You can probably finish it in half of that and that&apos;s not rushing. The additional side ops extended the time spent in game to around 8 hours which is fairly decent for such a short game - and I did not replay any of the mission on hard mode - so that&apos;s that. Though in order to unlock two bonus missions had to raplay the main one.
<br>
<br>The story is interesting though if you&apos;re not paying attention it sometimes does not make a lot of sense. The big thing to note is that Ground Zeros is mostly free of the Metal Gear Solid strangeness. This feels like a more traditional war game rather than metal gear title which comes with quite a bit of supernatural and a few metal gears.
<br>
<br>The game engine is a beast. It runs smooth, looks amazing and offers a lot of choices of approach and interactions. You can be stealthy, you can go gun blazing, drive a armoured vehicle - it&apos;s up to you. The number of things you can do is really high.
<br>
<br>There are sometimes games that have extremely memorable moments. Those can be scripted but this one (and this goes for the MGS5: Phantom Pain as well) is a unscripted moment maker. During a rainy mission I climbed on top a small building and started sniping people down - no suppressor - and due to rain/storm they just couldn&apos;t work out where the shots were coming. That was so amazing seeing them just run and talk that there&apos;s a shooter somewhere but can&apos;t make out where.
<br>
<br>The little touches like suppressors lasting only for a certain number of shots, luring enemies with clips, even the sentries calling other guards to investigate something make this game a real joy to play.
<br>
<br>The controls are a bit finicky - I struggled between mouse/keyboard and controller. For sneaking and moving around the controller is a much more natural fit. For shooting it&apos;s pretty bad. Ended up switching between the two when things got hot. Would have liked if the keyboard controls were a bit more thought through.
<br>
<br>Finally the price - this feels more as a DLC rather than a full title. Or even more like a demo. In my personal case that would have worked. If this was free and I&apos;d played that - no doubt I would pre-order the Phantom Pain - full price, no questions asked. As it stands I&apos;ve stayed away from both until I saw them on at least 50% sale - and the only reason I&apos;ve picked up Ground Zeros is that they&apos;ve been bundled. At anything more than 3$ this is definitely not worth picking up. Instead you should just buy the Phantom Pain. There is enough content for this game to not matter entirely.
<br>
<br>So in summary. Worth a buy for cheap. Fun game but does nothing that would suggest buying this over Phantom Pain which is definitely a money well spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=7039899">Expand</a></span>

I got it on the cheap, which is what you should also do if you&apos;re looking to get it still. There&apos;s two ways to look at GZ, at least from where I&apos;m standing, and it looks like both: A paid tech demo for the FOX engine, and the gut-wrenching prologue to TPP. Really, when TPP came out this game should have been folded into it and anyone who owned it should have gotten a discount towards it, but this is Konami we&apos;re talking about.
<br>
<br>Ground Zeroes plot follows directly on from Peace Walker, and if you haven&apos;t played that game or indeed any Metal Gear, you&apos;re not going to have any idea what&apos;s going on, but here&apos;s the basics: You are Big Boss, legendary former special forces operative turned mercenary leader. You are on an infiltration mission to a US military blacksite in Cuba, in search of a double agent who betrayed you, and a captured comrade who went looking for that same agent.
<br>
<br>Things kind of go downhill from there. GZ introduces the player to the mechanics they will be seeing in Phantom Pain, though it is noticeably rougher around the edges. Going from TPP to this game as I did was not pleasant in this regard, especially losing the Fulton system, and it is annoying to see that issues i have to deal with in the later title, such as the complete inability to use the mouse for the buttons in the iDroid, were present here and not addressed prior to the release of TPP. It is also considerably more ponderous to switch between weapons of the same category here. While both of these games represent an unprecedented step forward in the messy history of console games ported to PC, in terms of optimization, controls, and PC-specific settings, there is a long way to go yet. Still, the smooth camera control, aiming, and player movement are all here, as is the godsent &quot;reflex mode&quot; that allows you to enter bullet time when spotted and neutralize the spotter before they can raise an alarm, as well as a fairly forgiving checkpoint system and the removal of series-mainstay infinite enemy respawns. Gone are the days of MGS4, where I would &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; up stealth just once and be forced to shoot my way through the rest of each level, hideously maiming my score and ranking. The checkpoints are actually more forgiving here then in Phantom Pain, even.
<br>
<br>After completing the relatively short, simple and, notably ONLY, story mission in the game, you unlock access to a series of four &quot;Side Ops&quot; missions, including a glorious rail-shooter level where you give a certain bespectacled game designer-slash-intelligence operative fire support from a helicopter. If you collected nine hidden &quot;XOF&quot; patches in the story mission, you also unlock access to two &quot;Extra Ops&quot; levels, one an amusing nod to the original Metal Gear Solid on PS1, the other a bizarre mix of elements from several other games, including Kojima&apos;s &quot;Snatcher&quot; visual novel, which was only available here in the US on the much-maligned SEGA CD. Beyond that, the anal-retentive among you may take interest in the various &quot;trials&quot;, hard mode levels, and other increasingly minute and inane extras, though this is all to otherwise pad out the content of what is, at best, a two to three hour game. There are plot-relevant audio tapes scattered among the Side Ops that at least make them worthwhile. I would say about half of my playtime was spent listening to these tapes, and a good chunk of the rest was spent with my face in the mud, trying desperately to be good at stealth games. As this is not MGS4, I was at least partly successful.
<br>
<br>Nonetheless, I have heard it stated that Ground Zeroes is completely superfluous to one&apos;s enjoyment of Phantom Pain, and this is largely true. It is however, a small but key piece of the overall plot and on that basis alone, I recommend it to longtime Metal Gear fans. If for whatever reason you ignore the story in these games, then by all means skip this installment and proceed directly to Phantom Pain, which is a far greater value for the price- and now includes multiplayer, no less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507643">Expand</a></span>

The entirety of MGSV could be thought of as Hideo Kojima&apos;s way of saying thanks to the series&apos; fans, who have kept the Metal Gear brand relevant in the gaming industry for over 30 years - a collective passion and dedication, which forms the basis of the series&apos; finale: we, the players, carry on the title of Big Boss. Heartfelt? Sure. Corny? Well, it wouldn&apos;t be a Hideo Kojima Game if it wasn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes takes place in Camp Omega: a U.S. naval prison facility - reported black site - located at the southernmost tip of Cuba. Big Boss received word that Paz Ortega survived the ZEKE explosion, and is now being held prisoner along with Chico at the facility. Due to Paz being the only lead that MSF has on Cipher, and the fact that Chico somehow sent out a distress call while bound in chains, Big Boss is forced to take matters into his own hands, and infiltrate the camp to rescue them both.
<br>
<br>Back when MGSV was first announced, Kojima promised a mature Metal Gear story, which would explore real-life issues that he normally doesn&apos;t tackle. Ground Zeroes somehow fulfilled that promise by highlighting the prisoners and their torment at the camp, rather than focusing on Big Boss himself. Right off the bat, the player is greeted by hooded prisoners on their knees, surrounded by growling guard dogs and heavily-armed soldiers; the camera focuses on a minor with a small hole on his chest, and bolts on his ankles, seemingly traumatized and out of touch with everything around him; cassette tapes bring light about the brutal and disgusting torture methods used by the officials at the camp. What&apos;s outstanding about Ground Zeroes is that it set up the intended mature tone so well, exploring the human nature and relishing the silent moments, but eventually dialed everything back for The Phantom Pain, where Kojima takes another shot at the Metal Gear tropes that he established.
<br>
<br>Skull Face was supposed to be the next big Metal Gear villain, with the potential to top some of the best characters in the series. He is only shown for a brief moment during Ground Zeroes&apos; campaign, wearing an outfit similar to the Lone Ranger, and an eventual glimpse of his heavily-scarred face; even so, his power and influence can be seen throughout the camp, and his backstory - as told through cassette tapes - imply a vengeful man, who had everything taken from him, and forced to serve different masters wherever he went. Enter The Phantom Pain, where his role has been relegated to that of the typical evil mastermind, who will stop at nothing to make sure that everyone who knows the English language dies.
<br>
<br>The events leading up to that grand finale of The Phantom Pain had been very lackluster, and Ground Zeroes could only offer a small glimpse of how the entirety of Metal Gear Solid V could have really felt like, if more time was given for developing it.
<br>
