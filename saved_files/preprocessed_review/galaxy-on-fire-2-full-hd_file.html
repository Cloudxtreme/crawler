<br>The biggest glaring flaw that you will run into is the fact that you will target lock allies over enemies, meaning that using guided weapons of any kind is worthless..
<br>
<br>I&apos;d also like to emphasize that, because the addons aren&apos;t available on PC, and never will be, the game is incredibly short, with half it&apos;s content, and ships, missing as a result.
<br>The developers previously used the excuse &quot;Sales weren&apos;t good enough on PC&quot;. Of course, with a $20 pricetag ($15 more than the mobile phone counterpart), its a wonder why, on top of the fact that most negative reviews about this game stem from the fact that none of the DLC has been, or ever will be ported to PC.
<br>
<br>I hope this helps anyone looking into this game. There are better space games out there. This is essentially a non-multiplayer version of Star Conflict with worse controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galaxy-on-fire-2-full-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=4264618">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are beautiful on my 27&quot; iMac. The Mac version allows me to use my old USB Joystick, which makes combat a lot of fun. The storyline is silly in a fun/entertaining sort of way. Unfortunately, the storyline is kind of linear, though you can leave it and come back to it, as you see fit.
<br>It is annoying that the opponents&apos; ships don&apos;t have the same upgrades that are available to you. I would have expected a pirate flying a Veteran to have a turret on his ship and the same array of weapons and missiles that the user could pick up.
<br>One thing that baffles the mind is why they wouldn&apos;t give us the ability to form a small fleet of ships under our control, through either capturing other ships or purchasing additional ships. Since the game already allows for wingmen, to whom you can issue orders, it makes little sense. I guess I have a dream of having a game that has all the features of the Escape Velocity series of games, but has the 3D flying and wonderful graphics like GOF2 Full HD has.
<br>I have put a lot of time into playing GOF2 and have finished the expansion packs. Now, I am left with nothing but a handful of repeating missions and a very limited number of solar systems to visit. Once you finish the storyline, it would be really nice to be able to dominate systems with the armada that you wish you could build from captured or purchased ships and take over the galaxy, once system at a time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galaxy-on-fire-2-full-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=2859000">Expand</a></span>

The design is really astonishing, it gives the game this realistic look. The story might seem short, but people who are still doubting should buy it and wait for the expansion packs (Valkyrie and Supernova) to arrive as they pack a lot of action, new star systems and more storyline! The action might seem lame when you just started the game, but when you rise through the levels the difficulty increases a lot. Those who still seek a challenge should try hardcore. Anyway I REALLY recommend buying this game as it just blows you away!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galaxy-on-fire-2-full-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=2823806">Expand</a></span>

The autopilot will fequently drive you straight into asteroids (more annoying than a problem), the economy difference between systems doesnt vary enough, the voice acting is decidedly hammy, certain &quot;freelance&quot; missions will make you an enemy with one faction or another and it&apos;s never clear which or why, mining is great fun but will quickly be abandoned when you realise you can make money far faster just by looting from everything you kill, and it doesn&apos;t really offer anything new compared to other space trader games available. Despite all these faults it has the customary addiction factor of this kind of game, the graphics are passable if not amazing, and the storyline will gently pull you along without thrusting you into situations with impossible odds as long as you&apos;ve done a little side questing along the way. The ship classes are interesting and varied with each faction having an easilly recognisable style as are the varies customisation possiblities regarding shields weaponry and other gadgetry. All in all an entertaining piece of software as long as you don&apos;t take it too seriously. Unfortunately, there are better games in the same mold already available at less than half the price (such as DarkStar 1 and Freelancer). If you&apos;ve already played these (and the great X2:) and want a fresh delve into something very similar then this is for you. In my opinion it&apos;s certainly better than the original X and the botched X3 which was ruined by a terrible &quot;new&quot; control mechanism straight from the console scrapheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galaxy-on-fire-2-full-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=2575431">Expand</a></span>

If you imagined a cut down X3 or a reborn Privateer, you&apos;d be fairly close. Generic missions, ship modules, an increasingly expensive choice of ship, a half-baked storyline, it does nothing enormously original. However it has a pleasant casual appeal of simple flight and easy combat, which means that if you&apos;re turned off by complicated space sims this may be for you.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t without flaws - each faction&apos;s NPC ships are identical and practically never change which means combat gets repetitive fast; you the player may have access to shields, missiles, and various other special modules, but you&apos;ll never see them used on you; turrets are absymally implemented; the PC options are terrible and controls awfully limited; porting clearly was a last minute effort as basic input handling doesn&apos;t even handle more than one button at once and targeting just doesn&apos;t work properly; perhaps worst of all, the developers opted to not bother porting the more interesting add-ons that would have breathed more life into the game. Some very strange decisions.
<br>
<br>Yet, if you can fly with the mouse and get used to its quirks, it&apos;s refreshingly fun &amp; simple to play. It&apos;s the quintessential tablet game; nothing complicated, yet fun enough. I managed to drop 15-20 hours into it updating my ship, finding new starcharts, building from blueprints, and of course completing the simple yet amusing storyline.
<br>
<br>I would say it&apos;s worth picking up in a sale, as I did, as it&apos;s just not worth the full asking price due to the flaws. If they patched in a proper PC porting job, and made the NPCs less generic (neither of which frankly seems like that much extra effort) it&apos;d go a long way to making it a well rounded space sim that does what it does simply &amp; effectively.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galaxy-on-fire-2-full-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=2804139">Expand</a></span>
