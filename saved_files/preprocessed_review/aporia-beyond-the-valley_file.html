<br>Graphics: The game looks amazing, runs terribly. Some of the best fog and godrays ive seen, but the game is brought to 30 fps on a 980gtx.
<br>Gameplay: Myst inspired puzzler but ultimately a poor clone, Puzzles are singular and nothing you haven&apos;t done before. There&apos;s not reason to look into the constructed environment beyond finding resource or glass shards, It&apos;s all pretty generic.
<br>Story: interesting enough to have kept me going until the bugs and autosave system became to much. Told in uniquely cool 2D projected scenes, Probs the coolest idea in the game.
<br>
<br>Summary: I feel like this game needed another 6 months to fix up the glitches, optimize the engine and maybe make the puzzles a bit more complex, even then it wouldn;t have the world building myst had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aporia-beyond-the-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=7464377">Expand</a></span>

<br>Visuals of the game creates the feeling of a magical world and they are well polished. I liked the visual effects. The same location has a total different feeling when it becomes night. Many times I just stopped and looked at the assets around the world, so detailed and beautiful. The sound and the visuals supports this mystical, enthusiastic feeling and the story even more. I will have the soundtrack to listen when I go for a walk. I definetely recommend to play this game with nice headphones. I felt l like I m living in that world.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are well balanced on hardness. They were not so hard or too easy. The atmosphere you experience while solving the puzzles are stunning. I felt rewarded and statisfied after solving puzzles. I havent seen any bugs or any disturbance on the flow fo the game. The world is too big and from the map I could see that I didnt visit all the puzzles. Cant wait to explore more.
<br>
<br>good job</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aporia-beyond-the-valley/user-reviews?user_review_id=7433318">Expand</a></span>
