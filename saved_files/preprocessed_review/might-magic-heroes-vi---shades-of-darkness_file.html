Many of the Best reviews are from regular reviewers. That says something about who is trying to manipulate the score here.  As to the game, if you liked M&amp;M 6, this is pretty much more of the same. I did like it, so my review is somewhat positive. However, I would appreciate if after 2 years there were some new things too. Furthermore, Ubisoft does have some customer service issues(namely it doesn&apos;t exist) with regards to uplay.
<br>
<br>In fact, I would be inclined to give this game a 9 or 10 and recommend it to all my friends if Uplay didn&apos;t exist. I understand it is needed to help curb illegal distribution and all, but in their effort to keep the game out of the hands of illegal downloaders and freeloaders, they made the game less fun for their legit customers.
<br>
<br>Please Ubisoft, clean up Uplay and make it  customer friendly. I will not buy anymore PC titles of yours until I see this happening. Do you realize I have had an open ticket in your tech forums for over 2 years now? Seriously...
<br>
<br>So while I can recommend the game, its fun enough, its score will suffer as it should for a company that is pushing product out the door then forgetting about their customers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3148853">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I prefer HoMM 6 to HoMM 5 due to sheer amount maps and gameplay available, and the only nuisance would be AI that it doesn&apos;t look like they ever changed since HoMM 3.</span>

I have only played the first 3 maps of the dark elf campaign and I thoroughly enjoyed them. The graphics are crisper than the original. Very nice graphics. Reading the forums people are experiencing many bugs but I am sure they will fix them as time goes by. The game froze 3 times with me, all when starting battles. Not a big problem though I just loaded the autosave from the previous turn. It is a very complex and well polished game. I look forward to trying multi-player after I finish the campaigns. I would definitely recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3146937">Expand</a></span>

However due to the incredibly poor release of this game, i am unable to play my game. The release was so bad, it has effected me and i don&apos;t even own this. Ubisofts poor DRM and server/game issues are SOO bad, this games release has denied me access to the original game, as their server claims i don&apos;t have the game. Not just me, but a huge amount of people have this problem. Literally unbelievable, ubisoft should be ashamed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3148150">Expand</a></span>

<br>Got home to my freshly installed H6+SoD on Steam(I had uninstalled the game yearsterday due to some sudden slowdown, worked it out today  it was the Antivirus) just ran the game, unlocked Shades of Darkness and everything just worked. Cant fault anything at all. I LOVE the expansion. Totally. So far in the middle of a second map of the Elven campaign, and its very immersive and fun. I find the story and dialogues much much better now. And funnier  Dungeon is becoming my favorite faction, well may be together with my all time H6 favorite Haven
<br>
<br>I think Virtious has done a tremendous job, content-wise. Just have a look at reputation abilities and new dynasty weapons! They have brought back many familiar spells/techniques and added some new.
<br>
<br>Ok, after playing extensively(still in the middle of elven map 2) I have to say that devs did a right choice introducing Dungeon instead of Sylvan/Academy. It establishes presence of the elves as we know them, arrogant and proud. Lots and lots of tactical abilities, have to think really hard on how to approach battles on different heroes.
<br>
<br>1. Storyline
<br>
<br>IS awesome. They have learned a lot, it is mature, developed and quests are actually forcing ypu to say split your army, or rush as fast as possible, or explore everything. They mixed all these perfectly. I love the interactions between Raelag and minotaurs, and between brothers
<br>
<br>2. Lineup
<br>
<br>Awesome, love it. My favourite are chakram dancers, and manticores(they seem to have more animations by the way)
<br>Assasins are powerful but easily killed, its worth it sometimes to attack with them and then use racial on them atraight away and move away. on general creatures are powerful but expensive. Only exception, black dragons are a bit weak on defence.
<br>Love the trickster class as well, and this mageblade dynasty weapon is fun. New abilities are hard to use but effective.
<br>
<br>My Favorite races always were haven and academy, but now I am not sure:)
<br>
<br>All these trolls giving a zero, that just isnt funny. Only negative about the game its crazily addicting!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3147038">Expand</a></span>

There is a lot of challenging content here, with huge, detailed maps and campaigns. The story and dialogues are also enjoyable, and finally we have the awesome town screens that we&apos;ve always wanted. The expansion patch solved a ton of issues that were still there after so long, but it also introduced several new ones, worst of which is the occasional black screen  freeze when entering a battle. They haven&apos;t clarified what&apos;s causing it and said they are working on a fix, so you can&apos;t really know if your PC will be affected by this, so until they fix it, it&apos;s hard to recommend taking a leap of faith on whether the game will work or not. Also, if you choose to play offline, every single unlock and account progression is unavailable. There is absolutely no reason for this requirement, you should be able to purchase your Altar unlocks and gain account XP even while offline, and only performing a synch to the cloud when and if you choose to. It just feels terrible going through unnecessary DRM and logging in services that offer nothing. There is no multiplayer element to the campaigns, so they shouldn&apos;t be making you jumping through hoops to play them with all their features on. The only thing it offers is &quot;conflux bubbles&quot; in every map, which you can click and see posts by other players, most of which complain about how terrible the DRM is. How ironic. Overall, solid expansion, has some bugs that may make it unplayable until they are fixed, shame about the unnecessary DRM. I suggest you are patient and buy it later during a sale if you&apos;re not in too much of a hurry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3155391">Expand</a></span>

Black dragons are awesome. After rushed start  HOMAM 6 is finally getting on par with older Heroes games.</span>

<br>Strictly speaking it deserves 8.5 for the game development and concept and -12 for the U-play system implementation.
<br>I am located in Shanghai, China. The game needs at least 20-30min to synchronize with Ubisoft servers, and most often fails much earlier prompting a U-play error. This is utterly ridiculous and defies any description.
<br>So, let&apos;s sum up: -12+8.5=-3.5. Since, I am not allowed to score -3.5, it get&apos;s a 0.

Some people who have not played Heroes of Might and Magic V may probably not understand some parts of the story line, but that isn&apos;t critical to the game. I did have some occasional glitches in the battle maps (map items like rocks, braziers etc appearing very large, absence of gridlines), but nothing really that significant that a reload couldn&apos;t solve. The only glitch that I couldnt not find a solution for, was the mana required to cast some of Sorshan&apos;s spells. Mass regeneration takes up like 40 mana, but Mass Drain Life 217 mana, especially frm a Magic Hero? Seems like a bug? But that said, it wasn&apos;t a biggie since the main hero i.e Raelag, wasn&apos;t affected by the bug.
<br>
<br>I hope those who had problems with the game will give the game a chance...assuming you guys can get into the game i.e Sure, Ubisoft sucked in the DRM and Conflux, but once you get over that, and play the game proper, it is pretty good.
<br>
<br>(PS :when conflux was down today for server maintenance, I replayed the 1st HoMM campaign again offline, just to check if there my game had any problems that some people complained about. I played Duke Slava&apos;s 1st mission without any problems as well. I had also forgotten how funny Kraal and the orcs can be! (from my first play thru when HoMM 6 was first released).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3144045">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Always-on DRM for single-player games is always cracked. Go to whatever tracker, and you can find this game running perfectly by people carefully bypassing the DRM. It functions better than the &quot;real&quot; game, and has shown Ubi&apos;s always-on DRM as both ineffective and extremely detrimental for players. Diablo 3 is cracked, Far Cry 3 is cracked, SC2 is cracked and multiplayer-capable through LAN (probably publicly online  I don&apos;t keep up with piracy *that* much), even MMORPGs like WoW have private servers facilitating piracy (as well as legitimate modded and/or free-online play). WINDOWS is cracked  iOS is cracked, everything is cracked, so devs need to quit thinking they can reinforce a dam when the water just flows over, anyway. Always-on DRM does NOT deter piracy. Once it&apos;s cracked, it&apos;s cracked, and no pirate cares what fancy ways the devs came up with to try curbing it, it&apos;s still easier to install and play pirated than legitimate. If the devs/pubs really cared, keep the DRM active and bugging people off until a cracked version is widely distributed in public, then de-activate the DRM, because it&apos;s no longer doing its job any better than CD keys. I wonder, sometimes, if devs purposefully go with publishers on outrageous DRM schemes just to show the publishers what a ridiculously pointless and horrible idea it is, and which will be criticized to no end by the people who PAID for (not pirated) the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-heroes-vi---shades-of-darkness/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201389">Expand</a></span>

<br>The launch was as botched as botched gets. It took me two days after buying to be able to play (due to registration errors) and the game frequently crashes.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s only a 5 because it follows the might and magic formula, which is enjoyable on a new shiny update and the hero&apos;s are interesting.
<br>
<br>I would wait until fixes occur before bothering to purchase.</span>
