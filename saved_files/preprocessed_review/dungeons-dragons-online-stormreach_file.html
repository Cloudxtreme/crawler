Of all the MMOs I&apos;ve played (WoW, TSM, RoM, etc), including ones released years after this, DDO is the only one that managed to hold my attention. It has the best gameplay of any MMO I&apos;ve seen. It lacks PvP, but it does have a mature and helpful playerbase. There&apos;s plenty of crafting and levels are very meaningful. Character builds vary widely and you can do things that I&apos;ve not seen to be possible in any other MMO, such as making a melee character that takes literally no damage from attacks, or a spell caster who can instakill whole rooms full of enemies with one spell.
<br>Quests are varied. No &quot;Kill 10 rats&quot; type quests. There are only two things that stop me rating DDO a 9/10. One is that it can be a money sink, if you&apos;re not smart about what you pay for in the game. The other is that like any MMO, it can become repetitive once you&apos;ve done every quest 3 times, and you&apos;re just re-running things to farm them for loot. Still, you can get at least a year of fun play out of it before it gets to that point. I&apos;d encourage any D&amp;D or MMO fan to try it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=2959408">Expand</a></span>

I got lucky and have a few friends who joined up around the same time, and got invited into a guild fairly quickly, so I&apos;ve had no problem finding people to do quests with.
<br>
<br>The combat is very fun and the leveling system is very faithful to D&amp;D while making the necessary tweaks to make it more fun on a PC. The community has been very helpful so far. Most of the negative reviews seem to be early in the game&apos;s F2P days, and from what I&apos;ve read and discerned from talking to other players, the game has evolved a great deal since the early days.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a graphics fiend, but I found the graphics to be acceptable, and the game runs great (30ish FPS outdoors, 50+ indoors) on my relatively low-end rig with a bit of tweaking, without looking like crap.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m really enjoying this so far, about a week after signing up. I recommend doing some research into classes before signing up, or if you don&apos;t want to got that route, don&apos;t dual class with your first character.
<br>
<br>Overall a fun experience so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967644">Expand</a></span>

I have never had a problem finding a group, whether it was going off with one other adventurer, or a whole party of 6. This is an action roleplaying game with very well designed quests, terrifying monsters, and deadly traps. The action is fast, and you will have to be resourceful if you want to survive. From the originators of the genre, they know how to make a game, and it hits the mark. This is not to be confused with other games claiming to be roleplaying games, i.e. you won&apos;t be &quot;going out the front gate to kill small animals to lvl up&quot;. From the onset you will swept up in amazing storylines from the originators of the genre. highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=389991">Expand</a></span>

This leads to one of the greatest things about the game: it isn&apos;t balanced.  You could build your character to be a badass, or you could build your character to suck.  Its not going to stop you from doing either one.  Using the system you can design your character to be quite unique and specialized.  You could make a rogue is really strong, or really dexterous, or one that is really smart and has a mountain of high level skills to be able to handle any task. Its really up to you.  The downside of this is for some people is that to really be good at this game you need to learn the rules of Dungeons and Dragons.  Also, you really should have a good idea what you&apos;re going to do with your character before you create it, and that could be frustrating for some people who are new to the game.

<br>Like most of the Free-to-play MMOs out there, you can play this game completely for free, but it is a million times better if you&apos;re a subscriber.  The free-to-play setup they use disables selling items on the auction house, the shared bank, and the majority of playable content over level 4 (there are 28 levels) and limited character slots.  It also disallows free-to-play players from playing through content on a higher difficulty the first time through and there is a cap on the amount of money you can hold.
<br>
<br>With an active subscription you can sell items on the auction house and use your shared bank, collect mountains of gold and access all of the content.  While this may sound like a lot of restrictions on free-to-play players, one should keep in mind that there are ways that it isn&apos;t as restrictive as certain other games where they don&apos;t let free-to-play players even whisper or hand an item to another player.  This means that if you log in for free then you can give the game a good try before you decide to spend any money.
<br>
<br>As another reviewer mentioned, you could spend $1500+ on this game and still have things left over to buy.  On the other hand, for $15/month you get the majority of that unlocked for you, which is a much better deal.
<br>
<br>I got to level 9 with a few characters, so I can&apos;t say much about the end game.  I can say that this game is a lot better when you have a friend or guild to play with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=4152482">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately the bad points, are so bad it weighs the game down to an almost unplayable level.<br><br>Good:  The combat is very fun once you get used to it. It is almost a prototype for this new era of &quot;action mmo&apos;s&quot; we are seeing today. The jumping and swimming mechanics are some of the best in any game, especially for its time.   It&apos;s D&amp;D, plain and simple, if you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons, you should like this game. Building your character, is a large part of the game, rather than just something you do for 5 minutes before you begin.  Also DDO&apos;s f2p/p2p system is a real gem, and should be an example to the rest of the mmo world.<br><br>As for endgame, the true reincarnation feature is wonderful. the ability to start your character back at level 1, with an xp penalty, but higher stats is pretty unique.<br><br>Bad:<br>The entire game is instanced. This is my biggest complaint. It really makes the game feel less like an MMO and more like a large scale co-op plat-former. You are never doing anything game play wise with more than 10-12 people. There are no large outside wilderness areas, where you just see a random player running by you. The only area in the game where you will ever see other players on a large scale is Stormreach. And even that is instanced.<br><br>The endgame is extremely weak, rudimentary raid designs and poor tanking and healing mechanics make for just a pretty basic raiding experience. When an entire game is instanced, you would want the instances to be well designed.<br><br>Finally the &quot;crafting&quot; is likely the worst I have seen in any mmo. Even worse that WoW&apos;s crafting, and that is pretty bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730340">Expand</a></span>

<br>Feels like paying to play normal D&amp;D with a **** DM and a lot of made-up rules that mostly benefits only the DM himself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857441">Expand</a></span>

<br>I figured the game could use an updated criticism so that&apos;s why such a late review, let me preface this
<br>by iterating that this game originally is based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 edition rules and is developed and maintained by Turbine, it has gone through many rule changes from its release.
<br>
<br>The rub, this is not D&amp;D, it departed from the core rules at its inception, as a result, design has spiraled into patchwork of in game systems that  fail to resemble any version of D&amp;D; Turbine has repeatedly made the worst changes they could make at every major update, I consider this company little more than a front for milking the D&amp;D license.
<br>
<br>Lets talk about the game in a short description, you make a character at level 1 and you choose stats ala dungeons and dragon style; you find yourself in the main city,(only city), do your first quest; here it gets dumb fast, enemies get inflated stats, save, hit points, skills, spells, you name it, they do it better.Whole thing is instanced, every area, segment,quest;level locked items, when in D&amp;D has that .....I can spiel that off to the rage. I
<br>
<br>The game as it is now, much closer to current mmorpgs out there, expect the online store, in game currency, ios come to mind; I doubt I am able to adequately finish this  paragraph without the degeneration into an angry accounting of all I hate about the game, this is due to the respect I have for the original rule set.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=6339492">Expand</a></span>

A thinking-person&apos;s MMO despite what the critics say about twitch gaming (imagine spacial and tactical rather than FPS-style twitch). Playing and leveling are fun and does not seem tedious. My only complaint is the community does not seem as friendly or helpful as some other MMOs I&apos;ve played (alternatively it is not littered with juveniles mucking up general chat with spam though). Also, as with any MMO, I truly believe they should be free of charge after initial purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=386275">Expand</a></span>

I would not go so far as to call it a twitch game, but you definitely have to be awake to play it.  I give it a 10 becase they are just about as close to pen-and-paper DnD as you can be.

If you like people. If your nickname is Rambo and you like playing solo then you&apos;ll have about 5 missions you can try before you&apos;re stuck depending on what type of character you have. Graphics are solid but not spectacular (mine are on high, but about as good as Morrowind yet smoother), sound is good at creating a spooky atmosphere and the occasional dungeon master&apos;s voice helps create an even more moody feel. Character creation is A+ and you can create 5 different types. If you have friends playing, make sure you all create your character in the same world at the start so someone joining later doesn&apos;t have to create a level 1 character while everyone else is level 4. The REAL TIME combat is pretty good, but the camera will screw you if you get backed into a wall, making it hard to see who you are fighting. The adventures themselves are outstanding...not perfect, but entertaining. They are all instanced so you will not see any other players except your group on the quest. The real key to this game is who you play this with. Just like the pen and paper version: People too serious and people too silly aren&apos;t much fun but I haven&apos;t found a whole lot of them. Jerks are far and few probably because the game limits their impact. The game is all about teamwork and if you get some light hearted and fun people to play with who are doing their best to win the mission, then you&apos;ll really like this game. A suggestion is those looking for a good group should post on the forum at DD online. The nice thing is this game can be played once in a while and not be a time consuming grind. I&apos;d say this game is for someone a little more mature, since a 12 year old kid playing WOW all the time now playing DDO with 30 year old people will probably not understand the need for teamwork, but who knows everyone is different. A group of 12 year olds are going to love this game if they play together. The game&apos;s negatives are that it is not a free roaming world to explore. It&apos;s about hanging out with everyone in the separate parts of the city and then going into the dungeons with your group below the city...believe me it&apos;s still fun. The way to form groups could of been a little better organized. it would of been nice to have a cheat sheet that when you examined someone it said: your experince playing DD, your level of seriousness, your time commitment, type of players you are looking for, and a rating from other groups on how much fun you were to play with (this would help keep some people in line and avoid wasting time with jerks). If you are a solo player then do not buy this game...go pick up Oblivian. If you like playing games with people then this will be fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=386057">Expand</a></span>

The final flops that were Might and Magic IX come to mind, and those didn&apos;t charge a monthly fee! Very linear, only good for kids to cut their teeth on. Shallow, repetitive gameplay.</span>

In Stormreach, combat is way to simple (hack-hack-hack) and way too fast (average 10 seconds per fight). With no crafting element either, this game just doesn&apos;t stand up to the competition. The world is far too small for a MMORPG. It&apos;s ridiculous to see nearly the entire world in the 1st week of play. This game is not for the hard-core gamer - we&apos;ll hit the exp cap in no time at all. Nice storyline, fun nostalgia for ex-PnP players, but just not enough there to keep paying the monthly fee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach/user-reviews?user_review_id=387115">Expand</a></span>

All of that feels like running in a hamster wheel. Dungeons = meat of an MMO.  Choice in character creation is the other piece.  You will never have more choice or variation in character creation than in this game.  3.5 wins on that mark.

<br>In game voice on auto that works. Not the crappy stuff of WoW or other games, a bonefide quality ingame voice system. Makes group work easy and available. Social, same. Creates an oddly supportive community.  Hop in a group and you can all communicate immediately.  This does create a &quot;must have ears&quot; culture in game.
<br>
<br>This game is nothing but dungeons...with a couple slayer areas that you traverse to get to dungeons...which makes it far outshine most MMOs.
<br>
<br>The game, sadly, is dying for two reasons: raid bypass timers and out of control duping.  Raid bypass timers are sold by Turbine in their cash shop.  They allow you to bypass the timeout period between raids and thus run, say, 12 of the new raid in a row to get that item you want.  They also remove all motive to continue playing because you can get what you want in a day...if you spend the cash.  That cash became moot with duping.  Buy 1 raid bypass timer and copy it into the thousands.  Rinse/repeat with the rare raid crafting items for the best gear.  Again, removes all motive to keep playing because the reward system for playing no longer exists.  Turbine&apos;s punishment (a buddy duped and this was his): a 5-day ban, and you keep all your duped stuff.
