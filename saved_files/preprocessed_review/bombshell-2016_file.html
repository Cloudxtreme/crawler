Because of lame story or writing? Here&apos;s the thing: Not every games have to be at a Planescape Torment or The Witcher level of writing quality. There&apos;s some game that heavily rely on atmosphere, storytelling and good writing to set up the mood. For some game, the story or characters can actually make or break the game, but here, come on! It&apos;s a action-packed, adrenaline driven, silly twin stick shooter? It doesn&apos;t pretend to be a cRPG with great narrative or anything, it&apos;s just a top down shooter, and at that, it&apos;s pretty good.
<br>
<br>So sure, jokes are hit and miss. Sometime it will grab you a smile, sometime it will feel a bit cringy. Sure, the whole scenario could pretty much be written on a post-it note and sure, Shelly sometime feel like a clich&#xE9; character, a bit like Duke, but without the clever satire. But who care? It let you turn alien to bloody gibs with satisfying weapons in various environment with fast-paced action. It got some rpg gimmick, some extra-story arena challenge, it&apos;s chock-full of references, ranging from Duke Nukem to Iron Maiden and the smooth gameplay seal the deal. What&apos;s not to like about it?
<br>
<br>In short:
<br>
<br>The plus or okay:
<br>- Gameplay is smooth and satisfying
<br>- Graphics are ok. Nothing great or jawdropping but by all mean, it isn&apos;t ugly either. Some place are actually pretty nice thanks to the sometime creative design.
<br>
<br>The minus or less good:
<br>- Camera is sometime not really good. On some levels, it feels too close from Shelly and prevent you to see mobs. On these levels, you&apos;ll rely more on minimap to shoot at things because they are out of your field of view.
<br>- Yah, writing isn&apos;t good. I don&apos;t see it very relevant in that kind of game, but still, it&apos;s true.
<br>
<br>TL;DR : It&apos;s ok. It&apos;s a solid 7 for general player. If you like the genre, turn that into a 8, because it&apos;s a perfectly decent top-down, frantic shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bombshell-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6062099">Expand</a></span>

If you know you&apos;ve made a game that&apos;s not very good--don&apos;t name it something that can be used against you in reviews. &quot;Bombshell really bombs&quot; doesn&apos;t make a very good review blurb. If you&apos;re going to go that route though, you might as well have titled this thing Crapburger. This game stinks.</span>

The gamespot review was so snotty and hateful I immediately bought the game and found myself enjoying it. It surely is not earth shattering but it&apos;s that mindless fun that you can pick up after a long day and just play. The controls are a little wonky at first but once you get the flow it&apos;s fun. The story is a little corny and the main character a little much but is solid. You can&apos;t go wrong at 30 bucks for this title if this is your type of game. I actually enjoyed it more than DIablo because of the ability to use a controller. The story is fun but goofy but personally I feel it&apos;s better than diablos.
<br>
<br>Overall if watching one of the videos remotely entices you, pick it up, it&apos;s a fun game by a small developer that will keep you entertained inbetween big budget titles that big gaming publications like gamespot get paid to review high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bombshell-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6066968">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game controls feel extremely fluent - especially using the Xbox Controller on PC feels great. The graphics are beautifully crafted and through the game you get to visit a number of alien worlds with a lot of diversity in enemies and scenery. Bombshell&apos;s robotic arm one of the strong elements of this game, and it gives you a bunch of options and choices and you quickly learn that some weapons are strong against certain enemies while being puny against others.
<br>
<br>The quests in the game can get repetitive, but I found myself coming back to play more and progress through the story. Also, the story itself is perhaps not the strongest, but it definitely works with the 90s sort of feeling you get from the game.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game to people who enjoy a good action game with a bad-as protagonist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bombshell-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6051506">Expand</a></span>

It has a lot of bugs and not so impressive boss fights. Game looked promising but it was not delivered correctly, it looks like it was rushed out of development. Good idea but bad execution of it. I sadly do not recommend this game because it has a bad acting, repetitive, i barely noticed the RPG aspect of the game. There will be patches for the bugs but i it is getting closer to the latest Batman game situation. It is definitely not worth your money</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bombshell-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6054567">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a well-presented top-down, mouse-aim shooter with a a diverse range of weapons and abilities, classic action shooter sensibility and a smattering of elements from FPSs, RPGs and platformers that more or less work well together, but it&apos;s also a rather messily executed pile of bugs, occassionally of the game-breaking variety. It reminds me of nothing if not EYE: Divine Cybermancy in this regard. Enemies disappearing, Shelly getting stuck in places, weird jump physics, mission critical items not being able to be picked up, preventing progress... most egregiously, completing the quest to get the final weapon in the game bugged, and I had no weapon to show for it. I have played a dozen games like Bombshell that weren&apos;t half as broken.
<br>
<br>It also drags a bit, padding out it&apos;s approximately nine hours of campaign play with oddly spaced checkpoints and forced backtracking to complete sidequests. The combat balance is also odd, with Shelly&apos;s power sword ability outperforming most of her firearms. It has an interesting &quot;splitting&quot; mechanic with Shelly&apos;s AI-controlled arm, Amiga, being able to detach itself and move independantly of her, but this mechanic is only occasionally used for puzzle solving, and this game has the barest minimum of puzzle difficulty akin to the Duke Nukem games, barring one painful riddle for which the solution can be found here on Steam in the game&apos;s only current guide.
<br>
<br>That being said, it has lovely visuals and it is obvious that this game had a lot of heart put into it, and it has been patched since launch- which makes me wonder how badly it ran when it first released. One would hope the forthcoming 1.3 patch will address more of these issues. I got it on sale for about $12, which is a reasonble price. As it is, the base price of thirty is far too steep for what you get.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s quite obvious that it was meant to be a Duke Nukem game, but it&apos;s honestly better as is. Shelly Harrison is a more interesting character with actual development and internal conflict, rather just Duke with breasts, as her canceled appearance in Duke Nukem Forever might have portrayed her. The music is excellent, and while the NPC voice actors were really phoning it in, Shelly&apos;s own VA is pretty good.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m honestly on the fence about Bombshell. If you love top-down shooters as much as I do you will probably find something to like in this game, but if you&apos;re a stickler for bug-free gaming you&apos;ll want to look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bombshell-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6689849">Expand</a></span>
