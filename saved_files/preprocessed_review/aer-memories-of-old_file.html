<br>Peaceful, but not much here
<br>AER is a little over 4 hour long game all about exploration
<br>Here you play as a shape shifter that can turn into a bird out to obtain 3 shard pieces to unlock an ancient temple and defeat the void before it takes what&#x2019;s left of the shattered world you find yourself in&#x2026;
<br>The gameplay here is very simple and the music is very beautiful...
<br>There is no combat... no hard or frustrating puzzles&#x2026;
<br>you simply fly uncovering islands, secrets and knowledge and explore these islands and hidden caves and temples on foot
<br>flying feels intuitive and smooth, though I did get stuck in a rock while landing, forcing me to back out to the main menu and lose the island uncovering progress made since my last save.. But this only happened once&#x2026; the game is otherwise pretty bug free... though im convinced one of the trophies are bugged  for discovering an ancient battlefield.. unless I discovered the wrong thing
<br>There are multiple caves hidden on these islands containing spirit animals and tablets to give you more back story&#x2026;
<br>but where there&#x2019;s some traditional gameplay is within this games 3 temples&#x2026;
<br>Each are fairly short to complete, the longest taking me about 20 minutes.. And will have you going through powering switches with your torch and aligning different items to progress, nothing too difficult or frustrating&#x2026; and you can enter any temple at any time when you feel you need a break from exploring... the pacing of this game is up to you. Again really making this a relaxing enjoyable experience to get lost in&#x2026;
<br>I wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily call AER special or a must play game&#x2026;
<br>But I appreciate the break from life playing this game gave me
<br>I give AER: Memories of Old
<br>a 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aer-memories-of-old/user-reviews?user_review_id=7638439">Expand</a></span>
