Brainless, heartless, but not gutless - it&apos;s pretty much a straight SciFi-FPS with a DX story, fun to play if you skip all the boring, badly acted conversations (if it weren&apos;t for those looong level loading times!). The new augmentations are a real improvement, but I&apos;m missing a really difficult setting - the enemies are as brainless as in the original DX. And nobody has come up with a &quot;hardcore&quot; mod for it. We have yet to see whether DX3 continues the trend, but it&apos;s funny how the Tomb Raider series has become obsessed with &quot;character&quot;, while Deus Ex is heading the opposite way. To explain the &quot;brainless&quot; part in DX2: You don&apos;t get different story threads or conversations based on choices you make, the secondary NPCs have only 1-liners, there are no computers to hack or secrets to uncover, and the whole DX moral framework is missing - so what you end up is a dumbed down version of the almost living world DX1 created. DX2 isn&apos;t remotely in the same league as its predecessor, but it is better than the Matrix sequels 2-3 compared to The Matrix. It has a strong storyline that adds an interesting twist to the plot - to kill JC - and a new brand of enemies that DX3 will use too, the biotech-haters aka &quot;Templars&quot; (I think it would have done both DX1 and 2 a lot of good to rely less on ancient mythology, it just sounds so ridiculous). DX fans have to accept to the fact that great things rarely come in series, the classic Star Wars and Alien X-logies excluded. I don&apos;t doubt that installment 3 will disappoint in some ways, too. Hopefully it will take the series into new territory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=78879">Expand</a></span>

Its Havok v2.0 physics engine mitigates the low score, since it&apos;s one of the first games to utilize ragdoll physics - the engine on which Valve&apos;s Source engine was based. But as far as gameplay is concerned, the maps are small, the missions are unexciting, and the controls are somewhat confusing. The universal ammo system is a terrible idea - if you run out of ammo for one gun, you run out for all of them. Some of the characters from the first Deus Ex game return, but there&apos;s no feeling of intimacy with any other characters in the game. You still have the option to choose different paths and endings in the game, but it does little to enhance gameplay experience. The first Deus Ex game is superb, the third one is also quite good, but don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re missing much if you wish to pass this one up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2558945">Expand</a></span>

They don&apos;t matter much.  Play styles don&apos;t matter much either; every (tiny!) level is more or less the same formula, kill the bad guys and get the Macguffin.  Did I mention the levels are tiny?   Overall it was a big disappointment compared to the masterpiece of Deus Ex.    Also, this game does NOT run well at all on modern PCs; the way the engine works is very...odd...and there is a constant switching of open windows for every area transition that is undergone in this game; of which there are very many, because as I said the levels are TINY.   If you are a fan of the series, or want to see where things have gone after the events of DE1, then this game is worth checking out.  But on it&apos;s own merits, there are really better choices out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3028097">Expand</a></span>

I could deal with these things, like the poor AI and graphics of the original. However, simultaneous to consolisation technically, the characters are all one-dimensional and unconvincing and the narrative is alltogether forgettable. I didn&apos;t just come to trust the original Tracer Tong&apos;s judgments, I made it so that he trusted me. I understood The Smuggler&apos;s motivations and situation. I returned to warn him in to leaving New York. Alex and Jaime had their reasons for leaving UNATCO, Carter had his own opinion, opposing and just as legit, about staying - Ideological reasons. I actually REMEMBER the story behind completely peripheral and ancillary characters like Sandra Renton when I ran into her again in LA. Jock made me respect his closed nature, but I sure had fun digging around in his HK apartment reading his Emails to figure him out (indeed, a location I only found after numerous run-throughs). The info was there, it was a detailed and subtle world inhabited by complex characters. I felt sorry for Nicolette when she reminisced at the old Chateau about her past. Even minor characters like Lucius Debeers presented an unclear, heavy moral dilemma above coffee wars. I can remember the deep philosophical insights of the prototype AI in its side-room. It&apos;s ideas made me feel for where our own world is headed. It wasn&apos;t just believable, it in fact, resonated with reality. I can&apos;t even recall the names of Invisible War&apos;s secondary characters, let alone their motivations and background stories, if they had any. I do remember that you could basically double-cross all the factions and nobody really cared, though. I remember that Klara was pretty much just a vapid, ambitious nonentity. But I only remember that &apos;coz she was hot. The game is half the length of the original and that half is not even half as detailed. While the consolitis is inexcusable, I think it&apos;s a microcosm for larger, sustained and crippling problems with the game&apos;s narrative design and setting establishment. I felt like I was controlling the narrative more than that the world was happening around me. I&apos;m going to give this a three. It would be nonsensical to rate this against other FPS on the market before comparing to it&apos;s predecessor. It is, after all, a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=66813">Expand</a></span>

Thsi game, sequal to one of the best, most open and free-form games ever made is a pure travesty. More over this dispicable nonesense is entirely the fault of Microsoft. Yes, you heard riight. After that big, fat cheque was cashed by the dev team to ensure that the XBOX version got priority, the PC version was destroyed. Because they had to make a powerful, potentially very capable game scale down to the pathetic likes of that hobbled console, we ended up with the worlds ugliest textures, hysterical physics, TINY levels (you cab run across some in 3 seconds!!! Literally!) and totally linear design. This last part alone is inexcusable - Deus Ex was one of the first games to offer real choice and real consequences - In this game, nothing you do matters. It is just a corrider FPS with conversations. There is a reason that Warren Spector (Lead DEV of this game) no longer works in the industry, and this game is it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=62831">Expand</a></span>

He should be flipping burgers instead, which he&apos;s far more suited to (although I wouldn&apos;t count on him being able to stick to the complex recipe required of most basic burgers). Hope DX3 is enough to erase this garbage from our collective memories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=740954">Expand</a></span>

<br>After playing this alongside other similar titles from the same era in a marathon today, I can finally put into words WHY its&apos;s bad.
<br>
<br>Atmospherics-
<br>There are none. Literally. I&apos;m not talking about the graphics being outdated. There just simply wasn&apos;t any thought put into the areas whatsoever. The outside city area feels claustrophobic and sterile. The inside areas feel bare and unused. The entire game feels like it&apos;s made out of plastic or that one episode of the Twilight Zone where everything was a child&apos;s diorama. It&apos;s as if a business executive poked his head into the design team&apos;s studio, glared at his watch as the team were painstakingly planning corridors then just screamed &quot;PUT A NEON SIGN ON IT. THERE ITS A CITY. You&apos;re costing me money&quot; before storming out.
<br>
<br>Characters-
<br>Every NPC in the game is a paper cut-out of a human being. Their motivation seemingly written by a child. I AM A MANAGER I LIKE MONEY. BUSINESS IS BAD. NEED TO MAKE BUSINESS GOOD. I am a worker, beep bop boop. Work is hard. I hate working. I am lazy beep bop boop.
<br>It&apos;s hard to feel any remorse when you throw their corpses around as they were never really alive to begin with. I know that in this era, AI was still rather rudimentary, however, after rubbing a dead guard against a non-hostile live guard&apos;s face, I was expecting some kind of reaction. A simple &quot;put that down&quot; or attack action would&apos;ve been fine. Instead I got nothing, and that&apos;s where the problem in Deus Ex lies. It isn&apos;t wholeheartedly filled with terrible ideas. It isn&apos;t filled with anything. The game is just bare and unabashedly gleeful as can be about it. Story characters aren&apos;t given any sort of backstory beyond a vague summary probably written on a dirty napkin in a design meeting. Within the first hour or two you&apos;re already confronted with your &quot;factions&quot; argument, a trope that has seen better days.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>The story resembles a &quot;my first betrayal&quot; pop up book and is highly characteristic of these sorts of games. This alone isn&apos;t a failing merit but nothing new has been done with it at all. There are vague elements of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, a more well polished, sucessful game that came out only a year or two prior, only they&apos;re executed without any finesse. Whereas BG&amp;E gave you a reason to want to uncover the truth and convince others to see it Invisible War doesn&apos;t really care what you do either way. It&apos;s just irritated that you&apos;re taking so long, so there are no hints or subtleties, just cereal box headlines rammed down your throat. Bad map design, terrible hollow combat, almost useless stealth features and a character customization system that has no customization. I&apos;ve played everything and this is just terrible with no redeeming features.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570193">Expand</a></span>

I noticed most of the people below didn&apos;t even buy the game, which explains why they talk about dynamic lighting (looks nice, but has zero effect on gameplay), havok physics (horribly implemented, and has no affect on gameplay, and odd design decisions (one ammo, minimal RPG elements, cramped levels?). If you liked the original, and consider yourself intelligent do not get this game. If you never even knew there was an original, and consider Halo to be the best thing since sliced bread then give this a shot.

As mentioned, the characters were flat and uninteresting, the systems (like ammo and combat in general) too simplified and the levels far too small. DX2 is a perfect example of what happens when a perfectly good computer game is redesigned into something it shouldn&apos;t be... i.e. a console game. The worst part about the game is that even with a powerful system and a good graphics card, the movement still seems clunky and unnatural. I admit, I consider the original DX one of the greatest games ever made and praise it along with the likes of System Shock 2 and Escape from Butcher Bay. DX2 is only a shadow of the original, and even if I give it the benefit of complete separation from it&apos;s predecessor, and treat it as it&apos;s own stand-alone game, It&apos;s barely worthy of a gamer&apos;s time. I ended up playing through it twice within about a 3-day period before retiring it to the dusbin of my CD case. While I load up and maybe play through the original about every year or so, DX2 hasn&apos;t seen the light of day since.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=73532">Expand</a></span>

Actually, looking at most of these reviews makes me laugh as it&apos;s clear people haven&apos;t even played the demo let alone the full game. 10s? Have you seen the AI, the laughable physics, the shoddy graphics, and horrid interface? Wow, you folks really must have bad taste in games if that gets a 10 from you. Or maybe... maybe, you thought this was a 1-100 rating scale? If so, then yes... 10 sounds about reasonable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=53545">Expand</a></span>

They took out all of what was good, made bad AI even worse, and then locked the framerate at under 20 on high end systems. I&apos;m not sure to laugh or cry... but this is one very mean joke on the parts of Ion Storm. Where&apos;s Deus Ex 2? This is garbage.</span>

I won&apos;t bother to list the myriad of things wrong with it from console dumbing-down to unified ammo to pathetic AI, because they&apos;ve all been said a million times now. And they&apos;re true. That is to say, one of the worst FPS games I&apos;ve ever played. I tweaked the graphical settings and it&apos;s still a dog. I tweaked the control settings and it still plays so poorly that in the end I gave up and turned on auto-aim just to slog through the story to see if at least that part of the game was good enough to warrant playing the game. I haven&apos;t finished the game, but yes, the story is quite good so far. That&apos;s the only reason I gave it a 4, but at the same time it also makes it that much more of a disappointment when you realize how great a game it should have been (and would&apos;ve been had it not been a straight xbox port with zero additional effort--they couldn&apos;t even be bothered setting up the ini files properly for a PC).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=53719">Expand</a></span>

Throw in the Matrix sequels and it just hasn&apos;t been a good year. What&apos;s to say that hasn&apos;t been said ad nauseum a thousand times already? The game is a sick joke, primarily (though not only) because frankly, it&apos;s a second-rate console port. The game design decisions (unified ammo stands out as a good example) are so unfathomable, detrimental, and brainless that it really is a marvel. Suffice it to say DXIW is an awful, incredibly disappointing gaming experience for any fan of the original. Console kiddies may have better mileage, but nonetheless, its blasphemed lineage aside, this game is second-rate at best. May Harvey Smith, and the &quot;team&quot; responsible for this travesty, rot in whatever hell might be reserved for programmers who can so stupidly and wittingly betray the wonderful legacy they were given to build on. Resquiat in pace, Deus Ex.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=53804">Expand</a></span>

DX2 Invisible War is one of the worst sequels ever in PC gaming. Eidos absolutely butchered this release. The game crashes to black screen causing me to reboot about 10 percent of the time. The game looks like a console. The game handles like a console. Invisible War has been dumbed down to console level. I could go on and on with the gripes about this game but I won&apos;t. I now very scared about how they&apos;ll butcher another of my favorite games, Thief. Thief 3 I pray will have some redeeming value.

When a sequel came out, I was delighted to hear it, and bought it as soon as I could. Invisible War is a perfectly adequate game; it certainly is fun for a good while, and its freedom of choice gives it (at least to me) great play value. However, it has several elements which take away from its gameplay value considerably. First of all, and most noticeably, the engine is a load of baloney. It worked quite well for Thief 3, but it just makes everything in IW look terrible. Quite honestly, I think that they were looking a little bit ahead of their time; I don&apos;t think that the world was quite ready for full real-time dynamic shadowing. On today&apos;s hardware, it is perfectly playable, but on the hardware at the time, you had to have a pretty good graphics card to get any kind of decent performance. The second huge issue was the universal ammo system. I truly believe that whoever came up with this system should lose their job; it was a terrible idea, in that it drastically changed the ideas most players have about &quot;ammo conservation&quot;. You couldn&apos;t save up good ammo to use on a boss or tough situation, because the ammo was all the same; you might use up all your ammo with the pistol before you actually need to bring out the big guns. And, it led to a homogenization of the weaponry which was really bothersome; all the weapons look exactly the same! There&apos;s no variety! Though difficult to explain in detail, I think most players will understand what I mean when I say that the universal ammo system really bites. Lastly, the greatest issue in the gameplay: the user interface. To put it bluntly, IW has possibly the worst UI of any video game that I have ever played. It looks bad, it takes up half the screen real estate, it makes things like, oh I don&apos;t know, different types of ammunition, completely impossible. The bad UI also made impossible certain elements which made the original DX so great, like keypad entry, or the original hacking system. Though the other elements are possibly forgivable, the terrible UI makes IW simply a pain in the butt to play. There are many other little things, as well; seasoned DX players certainly will miss the distinction between lockpicks and multitools. There are no more skills or skill points, which takes away an entire RPG dimension from the game. The storyline is pretty terrible. The bottom line is this: IW could have been really, Really good. With more modern technology, DX could have been taken into a whole new direction that would have made the game even better than it already was (which is really saying something!). But, instead, a series of bad design choices systematically destroyed everything good about the game, and turned it into a sub-par, even-less-than-mediocre sequel which left a bad taste in everyone&apos;s mouth. Invisible War is quite a disappointment to the seasoned DX player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=83246">Expand</a></span>

<br>Was it due to the horrible not-quite-anime styling they seemed to have adopted? Or was it to make the arms stand out for the low-resolution of the console? Or was it because they rushed it out and didn&apos;t bother to rig the models properly?

The plot and all the new story elements introduced are poorly written and embarassing when placed next to its predecessor. It&apos;s a real shame that this black mark is on the series considering how amazing the original and Human Revolution are. I can&apos;t think of a single positive thing about it so I give it a &quot;1&quot; because it is playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2828430">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s definately pretty for it&apos;s time, but everywhere is signposted in neon lights that don&apos;t actually give off any light. Pictures float where they haven&apos;t been aligned to the walls properly. There are holes in the scenery. Doors open in the wrong direction. Everywhere feels cramped and any sense of exploration is absent. Apartment blocks with only four rooms. &apos;Outdoor&apos; areas that are actually enclosed in 40 foot-high walls. The first moment of disbelief was searching in Make Ballistics for a high-security lab that holds a prototype weapon - it was actually just around the corner from the reception desk. If not bad enough, the short corridor leading up to it ends abruptly before you ascent a short ladder to a balcony, where the lab is located. That&apos;s right, no stairs or elevator, a ladder inside a corporate building! This kind of junk should have never got past the planning stage. That said, there is glimmers of the opposite - the Cairo Arcology being notable and use of dynamic lighting. Encounters can be equally awkward. It seems that everyone wants to pour out every ounce of sensitive information they hold when bumping into them for the first time. Even worse, these are often in massive, monotonic paragraphs making these easily forgettable. These issues wouldn&apos;t be so bad if the core game mechanics were in place, but the game is shackled in shoddy AI, useless currency, and an almost unlimited supply of multi-tools and health kits to be found in every corner. Below average - another Daikatana. Exactly the sort of game that if purchased after release full price would leave people bummed and swayed toward piracy - and that sucks for all concerned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=84369">Expand</a></span>

I DO NOT like shooters overall and consider myself a wargamer and rpg&apos;er and almost didn&apos;t get it after reading some of these reviews. My only conclusion is the negative ones were written by people who had to have a perfect remake to be satisfied. Trust me, Ion Storm did not sell out to the console crowd. Did they lighten the game for it? Yes. But it is still a satisfying game experience (although short - finished in about 15 hours of play with lots of reloads and exploration). In a market of many, many less developed games - I rate this one highly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=53833">Expand</a></span>

Like many others, I wanted the original Deus Ex with updated graphics, and better AI. Instead, I felt the game had been watered-down considerably, and many of the features that made the original so great (like ATM machines with real pins, a log you can add to etc..) were replaced with simple point &amp; click operations. The graphics engine was also incredibly demanding at the time, and even those with the fastest PC&apos;s struggled to keep a consistantly decent framerate. The music wasn&apos;t as memorable as the original, and Alex Denton didn&apos;t seem to have the dark, gritty qualities that made JC so cool. However, I recently played through the game again. I found myself enjoying it much more when I tossed aside my sentiments of the original, and take DX:IW for what it really is - a reinterpration of the DX universe, which still has a great plot, interesting characters, and the same style of interactivity which made the original so special. If you want to get the most from this game, then play it with the mindframe that it isn&apos;t the sequel to the game we all love. You will enjoy it a lot more, and worry less about the faults, and more about the special things that this game has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=57409">Expand</a></span>

Of course it is perfectly natural for people to compare this game to its predecessor, but people should realize that a sequel doesn&apos;t have to an upgraded version of the old one with prettier graphics and better sound effects. This is the thing at issue here, Invisible War is structured differently from its predecessor and a lot of people are extremely frustrated by that. People should try to overcome that failed expectation and evaluate this game for its own merits. This is a solid FPS/RPG hybrid with a memorable story. You want to be rocket slinging death machine? Then go ahead and be so. Or maybe you want to be super stealthy and avoid killing anyone, you can do that too. You can be brutish and destructive, or you can be subtle and diplomatic. The gameplay has loads of options to chose from, and Invisible War does a better job of portraying that than its predecessor. The story is original, it moves beyond the clich&#xE9; </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=65934">Expand</a></span>

Personally, I fall into a middle camp. I love this game. I love it just as much as I did its predecessor. But, they are not the same game. The mistake many reviewers make (or made) lies in sticking to the purist belief that Invisible War should be measured against the first game, but where do you begin? Depending on your belief, the skills, biomods and inventory system has either been &quot;lobotomized&quot; or &quot;Streamlined&quot;. The reviewer&apos;s point of view dictates whether the plot is perceived as &quot;dumbed down&quot; or &quot;Punchy&quot;. Invisible War should not be measured against the yardstick set by Deus Ex. Their plot is shared, but otherwise they are sufficiently different to warrant being kept apart. Reviewed on its own merits however, Invisible War is a gold standard game, an excellent addition to anyone&apos;s library, and classic example of how to tell a good story and tell it well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=71315">Expand</a></span>

Even going around the Tarsus Academy picking off Order Seekers with my weedy pistol was better than trying to hit those NSF terrorists on Liberty Island. The augmentation system has been revamped, with the new name Biomod. In my opinion both it and the weapon mod system are both far easier to use than in the original. But what&apos;s bad? Well the subtitles are gone, so while the random conversations between NPCs still occur, sometimes you can&apos;t make out what they&apos;re saying. Also, too much choice? Perhaps. But still, it and the original are the two best PC games ever to make it into my disc drive - may they continue to do so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=55304">Expand</a></span>

The cons: about 40% long as the original, too easy(i beat it on normal dying about 5 times the whole game), TINY LEVELS(the first one had HUUUGE levels! Lower Seattle is about 200 sq. ft!), and yes there are some console aspects to it. However I agree with Chris B. on one thing that this game IS a PC game, the only real console-ish aspect is the level size. An amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=55896">Expand</a></span>

I would liken it to introducting someone to football (soccer) by making them watch Sky&apos;s player cam;  you get an idea of what playing the game is like while having no idea what football is or represents.  This short demo has unfinished graphics (I hope), almost no AI and a single level of a game that is meant to be one long immersive story and hence feels reather contrived.  Many people will download it wondering what the big deal is to be confronted by an average FPS shooter - if you have no idea of the depth of the DX games, most of the subleties in the demo will remain hidden to you.

And now for my REview (ahem). Okay, so there will be two types of people who are going to read this, 1. the people who (like me) played and adored the original, and 2. the people who never heard of the original and are wondering where the hype came from. If you are in the 2. column, feel free to skip to the last paragraph. For the rest of us, let&apos;s hold off on the knives until we have examined the game a little more closely... Firstly, no this is not the prequel; DX1 inherited much from the likes of Thief and System Shock 2 (game dynamics and menu system), presonally I enjoyed sorting out my inventory, remembering passwords and keycodes, managing coutless types of ammo and counting my skill points until I could remove my sniper-shake. Almost all of this complexity has gone from IW and the blame has fallen squarely on the Xbox. The graphics on the original were let&apos;s be honest, a bit poor, I expected great things from this (something just behind HL2 and Doom3) but again, the Xbox limitations are blamed for poor visuals. I happen to think this is unfair, sure it is a bit of a system hog, but it runs well on my 2G AMD with 9800pro at 1024. The most important thing to realise with the visuals are, 1. Remove the damn &apos;bloom&apos; feature - it&apos;s awful (and still doesn&apos;t do what it&apos;s supposed to do - wait till HL2&apos;s HDR...) 2. READ THE ION STORM FORUMS. Can&apos;t emphasise that last one enough. But what of the game - assuming it runs smoothly enough and we geeks can get over the fact that we have so few slots and only one type of ammo... Well I &apos;m beginning to think that perhaps it is not completely the Xbox&apos;s fault. Think back now, WHY did you love the original so much? Was it the inventory? Graphics maybe? Possibly the AI? Or maybe it was that you felt so much a part of an unfolding storyline that you couldn&apos;t care less what the game played or looked like? As a point of interest, when I first got DX1, I installed it, played it for 10 minutes and left it alone for five months before giving it another try. So what of DXIW? Okay, the graphics are not next-gen; no astronomic polygon count and badly in need of tweaking and patching; but the dynamic lighting (best since Blade of Darkness) Havok (such fun throwing things around), ragdoll-physics (such fun throwing people around) are superbly implemented. The weapons are only really tools that help you accomplish your goal, rather than the glossy graphic,ever-present at the bottom of the screen that you yearn to replace with a bigger one. The levels - well, they are environments, not paths with strategically placed guards, they are laboratories, hotels, clubs - places with backdoors, air conditioning (lots of that), stairs, locks, basements, roofs... The more you play this game the more you realise that the makers stripped away the geeky anorak of DX1 in an attempt to reveal the beauty that unerpinned the original to an audience that the orignal could never reach - they try to give unscripted, non-linear, player-centric gaming to the masses - not the elite (or &apos;Illuminati&apos; as I like to be called). Yes there are bugs - I hate the breaks for loading (yes, blame the Xbox), the actual functionality of the ingame menus is very annoying (Xbox, thanks), the game engine needs polishing for performance (but then again, we would still be waiting for it otherwise) and a few other gripes besides those. But is it any good? Would I recommend it as I did in my preview? Yes and no. It could have been better, and I personally would have been just fine had they forgotten about the Xbox all together. But this is Deus Ex - there are no other games like it... I will give it a mark (probably not 10) but in truth the mark is all but irrelevant; THERE ARE NO OTHER GAMES LIKE THIS - developers simply don&apos;t care enough to duplicate the formula and really, it deserves to be in it&apos;s own category - something like ,&quot;Immersive Interactivity&quot; or &quot;Other World Experience&quot; or &quot;Patient Computerised Living&quot;. No, this game is not perfect - break it down and criticise it if you will - but I think I will stand by my conviction that one day, all games will follow the road first trodden by Deus Ex. DXIW, given some faults is still the second step on that road.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=53922">Expand</a></span>

And now for my REview (ahem). Okay, so there will be two types of people who are going to read this, 1. the people who (like me) played and adored the original, and 2. the people who never heard of the original and are wondering where the hype came from. If you are in the 2. column, feel free to skip to the last paragraph. For the rest of us, let&apos;s hold off on the knives until we have examined the game a little more closely... Firstly, no this is not the prequel; DX1 inherited much from the likes of Thief and System Shock 2 (game dynamics and menu system), presonally I enjoyed sorting out my inventory, remembering passwords and keycodes, managing coutless types of ammo and counting my skill points until I could remove my sniper-shake. Almost all of this complexity has gone from IW and the blame has fallen squarely on the Xbox. The graphics on the original were let&apos;s be honest, a bit poor, I expected great things from this (something just behind HL2 and Doom3) but again, the Xbox limitations are blamed for poor visuals. I happen to think this is unfair, sure it is a bit of a system hog, but it runs well on my 2G AMD with 9800pro at 1024. The most important thing to realise with the visuals are, 1. Remove the damn &apos;bloom&apos; feature - it&apos;s awful (and still doesn&apos;t do what it&apos;s supposed to do - wait till HL2&apos;s HDR...) 2. READ THE ION STORM FORUMS.

It is not the &quot;glorious breakthrough&quot; of its progenitor, but in that regard only about 10% of any games produced in this day and age have anything to do with storyline or a real decision-making process on the player&apos;s part. Compare DX2 to other games currently on the market, and tell me it warrants any rating below a 7. This game holds a magnificent story, allows the player to actually think instead of pull the trigger and jump excessively (which is probably why a lot of imbeciles out there are griping), and said story is actually rather daring considering the recent state of world politics.

Invisible War&apos;s pros: has one of the most engaging dynamic stories in gaming to date that will keep you addicted until the game&apos;s end; the graphics technology that powers the game is amazing (seeing every object in the game be affected by dynamic lights is nice!); the sound is extremely impressive (the game is fully voice-overed and it isn&apos;t bad at all, and every object has a differant sound for colliding into things); bio-modding is simple and fun. Invisible War&apos;s cons: levels feel very claustrophobic and are very small; too frequently will you have to load; load times are long; framerate is choppy (even on high end computers); At best, the A.I is about as smart as a small dog; Combat is never that thrilling, which encourages you to avoid confrontations. While there are definitely more cons than pros, the game still keeps you entertained. If you are an avid fan of Deus Ex 1 like myself you&apos;ll probably get quite abit out of this game, but it&apos;s definitely not the same experience you got out of the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=57361">Expand</a></span>

Personally, I never liked the original game much - i thought it was clunky (especially when it came to combat). Invisible War was fighting an uphill battle. It needed to fix some things about the original that many people didn&apos;t like, such as the combat, interface, and obviously the graphics. Unfortunately, many Deus Ex fans expected the exact same game but with updated graphics. To me, they mostly succeeded. Invisible War has incredible graphics - it needs a fast processor and video card to run well and look good. The interface is much easier and quicker to use than the original (thankfully), and the combat is much more in line with a FPS game. The story is deep, long and involving and the level design is magnificent. I enjoyed this game from beginning to end, and i&apos;m a gamer who DESPISES dumb console games - folks, Invisible War is a PC game with PC controls, graphics and depth. It&apos;s one of the best FPS games ever. Is it as good as the original? Yes, but it&apos;s different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=55386">Expand</a></span>

You can play this game over and over, and the outcome can be different every time. Graphics are good, physics are awesome. Storyline can be confusing, but still interesting.</span>

With the use of Havok2 physics and realtime lighting with the latest 3D cards, expect the graphics to be outodone only when HL2 and Doom3 eventually come out. But don&apos;t hold out for HL-redefining gameplay in it&apos;s sequel, don&apos;t hold out for a gripping ride in Doom3 either. Make no mistake; the makers of DXIW for all their efforts to make the game visually amazing, have concentrated on true, open ended gameplay which will help mark a watershed in gaming (being x-platform will also help). I predict that this game will help guide the future of computer gaming; the ability of the player to enter a world that they have full control over, where their decisions actually have impact on both environment and plot. Tell all your friends, get them to tell all theirs; even if you have to beg, steal or kill, get this game; witness the future of gaming first hand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=53363">Expand</a></span>

Where the original game was an exhibit of outstandingly balanced gameplay, ingenious mechanics, and exemplary writing, DX:IW nearly completely lost sight of all of it. Writing was thin and with a minimally-engaging plot and stilted dialog, made worse by generally mediocre voice acting. Graphics, despite mechanically improved over the original, are poor; while the original DX suffered from old technology and limited polygon counts, it nevertheless created a visually arresting gameworld through creative use of what it did have to work with. DX:IW had access to better technology and while textures looked better and objects smoother, the overall effect seemed weaker than the original. The blame from this can be laid at the feet of parallel development -- the simultaneous design requiring the system be technologically dumbed-down to survive on a console killed it. Worlds are small, load screens are frequent, and scene-setting -- the placement of elements in the world that one would expect to see and, thus, improve the realism and feel of the game world -- nearly nonexistent. The console development impetus also resulted in an inexcusable compromise of the game&apos;s core design: choice. The option to go stealth, combat, or anywhere in between was largely eliminated, turning DX:IW into a more ineffective run-and-gun requiring (and allowing) little finesse. Players of the original Deus Ex frequently complained bitterly that the game had been dumbed down and rightly so; compared to the original, DX:IW is a weak, watered-down, unfulfilling game that seems to exist only to keep the name flag flying. But, taken on its own, DX:IW isn&apos;t an awful game. On its own merits, DX:IW does allow for some creativity in planning and flexibility in strategy -- not as much as its predecessor and definitely not as much as is successor -- but enough to distinguish it from a basic run-and-gun. In short, worth a pick-up from the bargain bin (where it can still occasionally be seen) or from eBay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2318936">Expand</a></span>

The story is still interesting and the graphics get a nice update, but in every other way it&apos;s a notch below its older brother.  The game mechanics, exploration and atmosphere all seem diminished somehow. On its own, it&apos;s still a worthy title and anyone into cyberpunk style games will like it.</span>

The content is fine enough. Visuals are beautiful, music that I&apos;ve heard so far is nice, and the non-linear Deus Ex approach to tasks is definitely there.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just the way the software is put together is bad. The levels are broken into lots of smaller sections, with constant loading screens in between. Sometimes to get from one area of town to another, you&apos;d have to go through 3 loading screens. That&apos;s not fun at all and horribly breaks the immersion. To add to the wound, the game crashes at times for no obvious reason at all. I am now unable to make progress because of that.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a pity really, because the game seems promising and decent enough. Not quite up to the same standard as the original and Human Revolution, but reasonably good enough aside from the crashes and loading screens. Unfortunately in its current state, I can&apos;t give it a higher score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=5128388">Expand</a></span>

But while I was furious about all that &quot;consolization&quot; be it UI or visuals, or overall simplification of the game mechanics, I was just disgusted by that, but once I got used to it, I enjoyed my experience with Deus Ex 2 quite a lot. It&apos;s really not that bad, it still got some of that Deus Ex vibe, even though it&apos;s much lighter and softer version, but the atmosphere and the story is still there and it&apos;s definitely worth playing and can be a pretty strong experience. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4401362">Expand</a></span>

Noted. However, before you completely discount this review, haters, understand the fact that I come back to this series every year to play all the games through again, including the original(yet I don&apos;t consider The Fall to be canon). However I do have another fact to admit, and this is the fact that this was my first experience with Deus Ex. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t possess a good enough computer to run the first Deus Ex when it came out, the knowledge of the game completely passed me by. It&apos;s strange how after Deus Ex met with such critical acclaim in its&apos; time, only a couple years after (when I started to get into PC gaming) I had never heard mention of it till its&apos; sequel was released on the Xbox platform. So, yeah, I have a little bit of a childhood blinders on but still this game deserves a better look, even from hardcore fans of the original.
<br>
<br>There is a reason why I go back to play every Deus Ex game every year, it&apos;s because these games get me hooked by their brilliant stories and Franken-Genre take on the FPS blockbuster. In no other game can I find an RPG FPS with minor Platforming elements with a deep and detailed storlyine. It just doesn&apos;t exist, and each part of this series has a different flavor entirely.
<br>
<br>As for Invisible War, this game has a very unique feel to it and it stands out from 1 and Human Revolution quite a bit, and it is as other people put it, kind of cold and apathetic. But for some reason, that doesn&apos;t exactly make me hate this game. The character you play as is pretty out of touch with reality, almost robotic, yet this sort of makes sense because he was... well... if you played the game you know his back story so I won&apos;t go and spoil it for any poor soul who hasn&apos;t played this yet.
<br>
<br>On top of that, this bland character gives you the ability to sorta impose your own conscience over your decisions. In the end, Alex Denton feels more like a conscientious objector, a spectator; this fact gives the player the ability to let their own feelings and morals take control of the character&apos;s actions and in this way the player becomes the character. No other part of the Deus Ex franchise provides the means to interact with your character in this way.
<br>
<br>The graphics, while they weren&apos;t exactly the best thing in their time, are still quite enjoyable to me today, and this is because it still delivers this cold and detached atmosphere that is not present in the other Deus Ex games.  Combined with the (enjoyable) coldness of Alex Denton, it achieves in pulling off that not-so-bright future feel that some books like Farenheit 451 have. While the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution seem a little bit over-the-top, Invisible War seems quite subtle in comparison to the other two.
<br>
<br>So, while I understand that there are a couple of things to hate on (really easy, too loose with the ammo and upgrades, well, that&apos;s pretty much my main gripe with Human Revolution too, except for the bugs), I give this game a 10 because I can&apos;t find it anywhere else. This game feels like playing a Hardcore Sci-Fi novel, and that is pretty much the coolest thing ever</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=5365438">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, it&apos;s not as good as the original Deus Ex. It&apos;s simpler, easier, more straightforward; it&apos;s like a &quot;kiddish&quot; version of DX. But it&apos;s still fun, and it offers more choice and complexity than most games. I loved planning my strategy and executing it with style (even repeating a level to try different approaches). It&apos;s a game where thinking is more important than shooting.
<br>In short, if you don&apos;t expect it to be &quot;DX2&quot;, you&apos;ll be likely to enjoy it.
<br>My main complaint is that it&apos;s too easy: even on the hardest difficulty, short after the beginning you have most weapons and enough biomods to not worry about enemies: you just have to be careful and plan your strategy, and you&apos;ll suffer minimal damage (unless something takes you by surprise - and it happens).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-invisible-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=6705894">Expand</a></span>
