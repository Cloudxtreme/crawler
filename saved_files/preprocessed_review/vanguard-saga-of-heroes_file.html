Graphics are awesome, BUT you have to have a machine capable of delivering the highest settings. I run it on my PC at High/High and my laptop at low/low and am still satisfied both ways. Again, if you want the HIGH END graphics you need a HIGH END machine, this game could run on a DirectX 10 format and was originally dessigned to, which is where all the initial &quot;bugs&quot; that everyone is speaking of came from, Sony had to fix it all when they took over. The Adventuring content is off the chart for Soloing as well as grouping, the Crafting set up is hands down the best out there(not just a bunch of mindless clicking), and the Diplomacy is intersting by it&apos;s own rights. You basically get 3 games for the price of one, as each part has it&apos;s level cap at 50. Soon to be 55 (WIth AA&quot;S!!) YAY! I did take a year off and try other MMO&apos;s but am happily back on Vanguard for good now. The only reason my rating is not a 10 is because the Server populations aren&apos;t what they should be for a game of this caliber. So all of you that left because of the &quot;bugs&quot; I encourage you to give it another try, I&apos;m positive you will be impressed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=421791">Expand</a></span>

I had recently bought a new system with a 7950 overclocked geforce and was still getting low fps choppy movement in the cities and have several friends who have reported the same who also have new or newer systems with good cards. The graphics may be nice but the game feels like another persons concept of EQ2. It just lacks a real feel of originality and the crashes and bugs really ruin any senese of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395786">Expand</a></span>

The reason why many WoW players wont like this is because of the fact that the original people who made EverQuest made this game. If you play WoW you WILL NOT LIKE THIS. However, oldschool MMO and MUD players will love it.</span>

                                        <span> I have played the game in beta, and i personally love the setup of the game, it seems to be a greatly compiled conjunction of games such as EQ2, Eq1, WoW, Ultima Online, and SWG. The Free open world is personnaly what i love most about the game, theres no loading screen to go to new zones. This game was a bit over hyped but is still worth buying the collectors edition.</span>

Hard for me to see any thing more than incremental upgrade from EQ1 &amp; 2. I&apos;d call it EQ2.5. However, character classes are interesting and this may pull people sick of the conformity and lack of selection in WoW character classes. Landscapes are beautiful when it&apos;s not raining but it takes quite a travel time to see any significant variation in landscapes. Towns are well customized to race/location (eg., little round hobbity houses, sweepig curving elven tree house city. The game seems to be designed for the Asian market - with Asian buildings and Confucian titles all over the place - they&apos;re fun but a little all-too-pervasive for me. I&apos;m going to try the game again soon when next patch release happens because, as you&apos;d expect in a beta, a few matters are still being worked on. I think EQ users will love this game. WoW users will be less...wowed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=394884">Expand</a></span>

If you have any character in Wow above level 40...  this game will blow your mind.

<br>At level 20, I have already visited over 6 dungeons and explored 25sqkm of the world... This is the Mmo for anyone who just isn&apos;t satisfied [or is no longer satisfied] by simple gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=62371">Expand</a></span>

No lag that I saw, just ugly and freaky. They remind me of a blend of SecondLife and EQ1 Classic.</span>

                                        <span> This game is an object lesson in wasted potential. It could have been The MMO, but was released unfinished. IMO, even after a ton of fixes, it still is lacking, and there are too few players due to its early failure. Still, it is fun, and a real old-school MMO bristling with good ideas and interesting design decisions. Worth giving a seccond shot if you still haven&apos;t sold your copy on E-bay.</span>

I spent 600$ on a new video card and ram just to play it! And yet, it was worth it. My friend and I bought the game and have been playing together up to lvl 12 as Rogues. Every corner I turn in this game amazes me. The bugs are forgiveable. The worst thing we&apos;re dealing with right now is PvP deaths. We&apos;re on the PvP FFA server, and it&apos;s fun, but getting killed for no reason takes the breath out of certain goals like questing and such, but i will admit that it adds a whole new level of gameplay. The fact that you can ride your horse at lvl 10 is awesome. I look forward to a Griffin to fly around in, or a ship to sail the open seas. I&apos;ve never played a game that felt so incredible wide open. The fighting system works for me. Not just turn based but a little more interactive. The mobs are awesome and plentiful. I love thefact that you can get XP on a quest and more for finishing a quest. Sharing quests is great too. Anyway, the only reason i haven&apos;t given this game a 10 is that I have yet to see enough of the game to have any idea of it&apos;s scale. I do agree with some of the people here that you really need a good PC to run this game. It looks decent on the PC i have, but i&apos;m spending the money to see this game the way it&apos;s supposed to be played. Talk about being sucked in. Anyway, if you get on the Tharidon (I believe) server, look for Pakesso. I may be a rogue, but I&apos;m no murderer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395750">Expand</a></span>

It is a huge world that is largely empty. It has some amazing ideas, not quite fufilled. It has some amazing system concepts, that never quite make it to &quot;fun&quot;. It borrows a lot from recent MMOs, and of course it&apos;s spiritual successor, Everquest. Graphically, when it was started, it was well ahead of the curve. But after numerous years in development, the graphics really don&apos;t reach the photorealism that was attempted, nor come close to the charm of the lower res, but highly stylized graphics of games like WoW. Given a year or two on the market, Vanguard could reach a 7 or 8 for MMOs, but.. it has a lot of competition, including WoW, and suprisingly, EQ2, which has become a very strong contender, at least in the US market. I&apos;ve been working on and playing MMOs for almost 10 years, and I still have hopes for Vanguard, but it&apos;s not there yet.

This game does not disappoint in that department. It is very involving, and alot of fun. The community is great, as well, and there seems to be a fair amount of players everywhere. I especially like the MASSIVE continents.</span>

Getting to lvl 20 is a huge grind. Unless you have 4 friends that will group with you every time don&apos;t even bother. The diplomacy and tradeskill parts are so BORING it defies me, this is a terrible game.</span>

I&apos;m trying it out on a everex xt5300 laptop (AMD TL50, nvidia 8600M G, 2 gigs CAS4 667 RAM, 5400 rpm sata1) so as with every recent game I know I have to cut corners and apply numerous tweaks. But after tweaking, defragging and a number of other googled suggestions, I still get like 30-40 fps tops on the lowest settings - the lowest settings. Not medium-low, not balanced - the lowest. And if you didn&apos;t know the lowest settings look like the worst ass you imagine. So for kicks I cranked the video settings up all the way just to see what it would look like (not feasible to play at about 5 fps) and it was still wholly underwhelming. I can only imagine what kind of janky coding they have to make such plain-jane graphics use so much power. The animations are horrendous also. You pretty much have to play in 1st-person to not be constantly annoyed by the D-grade animations. For reference, they remind me of the animation in Morrowind&apos;s third-person view. To the person who said this game looks better than Oblivion - I want what you&apos;re smoking. Even if I had the power to crank this all the way up and still have smooth fps I wouldn&apos;t bother because it would still look trite and mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=415494">Expand</a></span>

To rate this game a 0 just because of your issues regarding graphics is a joke. Overall the graphics are average the game itself in quite in depth, i found the crafting most satisfying compared to the many shite crafting systems out there in MMO&apos;s. The game originally started with a bucket load of problems which lead to allot of people leaving. I have returned to Vanguard after 2 years since then ive played WOW, AOC, WAR. But i after playing these other games extensively ive decided IMO that Vanguard beats them hands down. (Apart from WAR&apos;s PvP ive yet to find something to beat that). The reason i give an 8 instead of a 10 is due to the many problems Vangard had to start with and still need to fix, which leads me to my next negative. Which is there isnt to many players on at the moment, good thing is populations seem to be on the rise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=421340">Expand</a></span>

The epic scale of Telon is unmatched in any game in terms of graphics, size or general freedom. There are flying mounts in the game allowing you go travel anywhere you can see. All of this sounds great, but the game has been plagued with bugs and glitches since day 1, and while they are much better than when the game launched, progress seems to come at a snails pace. The development team is so small that every plan for new content they add is pushed back or delayed (indefinitely) due to lack of resources. It&apos;s this reason that I give the game a 3 for lack of support and new content. Very little has been added respectfully since the game was launched over 2 years ago and this is just unacceptable in any MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=741069">Expand</a></span>

Take for example, the changes a while back to rangers. Sony decided it would be cute to make it so that rangers use the Vanguard equivalent of mana whenever they shoot their bow, but tried to excuse it by saying that they upped the ranger dps. What did this achieve? Lower overall dps because the ranger has to constantly eat now to regain energy and power. This game is ludicrous and an exercise in futility. Pass on this one, the only saving grace about it are the graphics, which are on-par with current games. Other than that, the random lag spikes people have mentioned are actually the game freezing to load up a new region that you enter. That&apos;s right, the coding is so bad that when you go to a new section of the map, the game freezes for 1-10 seconds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=422283">Expand</a></span>

Sigil goes down in history as the most dedicated team ever for a MMO. the amount of patches, daily, this game is going to succeed. This game may not be your definition as a next gen mmo, but it definitally is a 3rd gen mmo. The gameplay is rounding out. The ability to have a house, or build a ship, or even fly on a mount, give you a sense of freedom. This is a game to just log into and live in the world. Don&apos;t feel like doing quests? Then just watch the sunset or travel the sea looking for treasure. If you don&apos;t like how VG ended with beta, give it a few month before they stomp all the bugs, this game will be polished. I highly recommend that you check this game out.

Much of the game is like any other mmorpg, mostly fetch and &apos;kill this many baddies&apos; quests, and the fighting is absolutely uninspiring and average. The graphics range from very good to poor, but you have to have a decent to high end computer to play it at all without tons of framerate issues. Some towns are worse than others. The character models look terrible and ugly, but once you start putting armor on them, they don&apos;t look as bad, except for the animal races, which look like mascots. The world is huge and open, and is in my opinion the best part of the game. It really feels enormous. Unfortunately, a lot of it is very empty and boring right now. The grouping system is difficult to use and needs an overhaul, as they claim the game is mostly for grouping and not soloing. The crafting and diplomacy spheres are something to do, but they aren&apos;t on the same tier of completeness as the adventuring sphere at all, and I can say with confidence that many people will avoid them for the most part. Game needs a lot more work, it has potential. But right now, its not worth buying and paying fifteen bucks a month for. It will probably be much better at a later date, I would recommend waiting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395381">Expand</a></span>

Some great concepts, but I&apos;m still wearing a tunic on my legs, an earring on my neck, lost multiple tombstones and items, UI bugs are intolerable, &quot;Chunking&quot; blows chunks, Levels of experience lost because I logged out, items not appearing in inventory after looting them.. I could go on, but why.. This game was released entirely too early. As most everything else associated with SoE is. People are currently paying for the game to beta test it. See you in April/May. Ill check back and see if its a usable product by then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395724">Expand</a></span>

The only strong points are the graphics customization of the characters but who cares how pretty you are if you move like a robot through an ugly world doing pointless repetetive things? EQ2 looked better (though was just as boring) and WoW is animated better despite having 1/8th the graphical detail. I have heard that it was kicked out the door too early to get some money (and I did see bugs aplenty) but I doubt another year of development would have made it any less stuck in boring generic-mmorpgism.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395979">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are much different than the cartoonish WoW and the ability to actually create a character that doesn&apos;t look like everyone else is welcome. Some people will be unwilling to spend the time it takes to actually accomplish goals in this game and that&apos;s okay; there are other games on the market for them. But for the people looking for the expansive, in-depth MMO where you don&apos;t have to turn off the general channels for the immature fighting, then this may be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395585">Expand</a></span>

The game holds many similarities to EQ1 because many the same people were involved in the design. The developers made the claim that the game was pushed out because of the deadline they had set and also their budget. They claimed if they &quot;only had 3 more months to develop it, and a slightly larger budget&quot; they would work out most of the flaws. Well, it&apos;s been 3 months, and they haven&apos;t even finished putting all the core features in, and they&apos;re adding content to keep the high level players in. They are adding raid content to keep the top 3 guilds happy but they still haven&apos;t added headgear. This is why EQ1 eventually lost a majority of it&apos;s player base, because the development team refuses to fix things. They just keep throwing content at you hoping you&apos;ll ignore the underlying problems. It held my interest a little bit in EQ1, but with this game it got old fast. Unless you came from another game with your guild or a group of friends you will probably never see the changes they have made since release. This could have been a great game if they kept it to one continent and perfected it. The only two reasons to get this game are if you&apos;re a fan of Keith Parkinson&apos;s artwork or if you are looking for EQ1 nostalgia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=397350">Expand</a></span>

The interface is terrible, the production value is ludicrous and the gameplay is so stale I wanted to cry. Worse, I could find no immersion. If you like this game, great.

It&apos;s stable and runs very well now, and it holds more content than most mmos, even without an expansion and after all this time. Very deep, three spheres of gameplay (deep, involved, and complex crafting, diplomacy, and of course adventuring), massive and seamless world with three landmasses, player-owned ships and fully-controllable flying mounts, lots of dungeons and exploring, beautiful vistas, quests galore, mentoring...this game is still one of the definitive PvE mmo experiences to this day. If your only reason for not playing the game is population concerns, note that there is still an active community. Population is increasing, and it is possible to have a social experience in the game. That said, population will never quickly improve if people, who otherwise love the game but are concerned with population, don&apos;t stick with it. Be a part of the solution, not the problem. Game&apos;s free to try now; you can dl the 2-week trial (which introduces players to the Isle of Dawn) and see if you might like it. The area&apos;s only 1 chunk in size, but it gives a pretty good taste of what to expect on the mainlands. If you decide you like it, you just pay the subscription cost ($15); don&apos;t have to buy the game. I&apos;ve been having a blast with it; I wish this game would get more coverage, though. It&apos;s a very unique game, even today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=85708">Expand</a></span>

Diplomacy is basically a card game grind that is pointless unless you get it to level 50. It can be tough to find a group for something you want to do at times but when you do it&apos;s amazing. The community is the best out of any MMO out there.</span>

I&apos;ve played the game from start and the folks at SOE have done a great job in moving this game forward and adding content all the time.The world and the Graphics are alive with detail and not like blocks like some I can think of. The spell effects are fantastic and make the mage type look awe inspiring! I must have built numbers of characters some l&apos;ve levelled all the way to 50 and some I&apos;ve level to 20+ just to see how good they are. There are also some very interesting types of characters that you don&apos;t see else where, like the Disciple Healer. Very smart class and very different for a healer. It&apos;s not quick to level but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing. It makes you work for your levels and helps you learn the lore of the world you live in. One of the best MMO&apos;s out there even if it&apos;s a little hardcore and new some serious hardware to run on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=421485">Expand</a></span>

Since then the game as improved IMMENSELY, one of the most addictive and fun mmorpg games I&apos;ve played recently. I would definitely recommend you give this a shot.. you can also trial it for 14 days.</span>

Still buggy, still boring, still not many playing and with HORRIBLE character animations and unbalanced classes. For elitist MMO snobs only.</span>

The amount of detail Sigil put in battles and Crafting is immense. They have also given players a third way to interact with the world called diplomacy, which allows players to learn the history and lore of the world.</span>

Waiting to see some of the kinks. I have enjoyed it thus far. It seems to be a good solid mix of EQ and WoW, and if they can continue to mix it well enough, it will definitely be the next favorite MMO.</span>

<br>The game is pretty good.  It was released in a rather unpolished state, but the problems it still has are the sort that will not be too hard to clean up.  There are a lot of class balance issues, so if you&apos;re a big baby about that sort of thing, you might want to wait.
<br>
<br>Graphics are quite good, except for spell effects, which are kind of disappointing.  Quests are numerous enough to keep you interested.  The three spheres of advancement (adventure, craft, diplomacy) are nicely integrated -- I hope they continue to flesh these out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=62008">Expand</a></span>

This game is made for the hardcore MMO player in mind, and even though it has had a rocky start you should have been there for BETA... One thing to remember about this game is that Sigil was pretty much forced to release sooner than they probably would have liked as their funds were running out and Microsoft was no longer their team player. From what I can tell they are a VERY VERY dedicated team of developers though as we receive decent size patches every few days fixing many problems and evening out the playing field for the players. I myself even play what is considered at this moment a &apos;broken&apos; class(the rogue), but love the game because of it&apos;s beauty, options, and size. Anyone complaining about having problems with graphics is not playing the game as it should be... you can&apos;t play on your little PIII with your 128MB video card anymore, get over it. If you want a simpler game go play WoW, because Vanguard is here to please those of us that are hardcore about our MMOs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395806">Expand</a></span>

I recently upgraded to an Athlon 64x2dual core 4200+ , Nvidia 7900gs, 2gig ram and Creative SB x-Fi soundcard PC, and the performance on Vanaguard sucks. Even in a zone with 3 people in I was gettiing all manner of lag problems, fps ranging from 60 down to as low as 1 fps for no apparent reason, adn this is with graphics turned down below the default setting and with a lower screen res. Can&apos;t believe this is because my PC isnt up to it. So I&apos;m hoping the problem is bug related. Reminds me too much of EQ1 on a bad day with lag and blinking graphic objects. I know there were reasons for releasing this game too early, but honestly its not acceptable to rip people off this way. if you bought a new car that performed this way you&apos;d take it back, maybe laws should be changed for games to allow the same. Then we could buy it in a years time when its working properly. Other than this rant, the game seems interesting and immersive, but I can&apos;t believe in a world when its so unrealistic due to poor performance. I&apos;ll be back to check it in a few months, meanwhile, back to the kiddies and their wow, or maybe even restart EQ lol.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395938">Expand</a></span>

The performance on my system isn&apos;t great, but it really isn&apos;t as bad as everyone says. The FPS is fairly consistent, and the drops (I&apos;ve never really had below 10 fps, it&apos;s usually around 40) are worth it. If you just stop and look at the scenery it&apos;s really quite breathtaking. Trees sway realistically in the wind, high definition clouds roll across starlit skies, the moon reflects off the ocean... The graphics really pull you into the game. I made it to level 10 in about 10 hours playtime, but I can tell it&apos;s going to be slow going after this. But, I can buy a mount, and with the great crafting system I can make enough money to buy a horse in about 2 hours. Not bad really, and certainly better than killing 3 different types of boars over and over. Give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=395991">Expand</a></span>

<br>If your looking for a new MMO, I believe the trial island will be available (soon?) when the GU5 comes out. Other wise, you have to pay for the full game and a free month of play time. Still worthy though if your desperate for a new change of scenery. hope you enjoy the massive world of Telon!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vanguard-saga-of-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=70931">Expand</a></span>
