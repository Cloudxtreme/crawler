<br>
<br>I really enjoyed the high school problems, even being a cliche its made in a different way than the usual thanks to the possibilities of change the course of action and I hope the next episodes will bring the impact of the choices in the first chapter.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is amazing and I&apos;m not ashamed to say that I bought the game thanks to the trailer and the soundtrack in it. The graphics are beautiful and not too heavy, there is no try to make a perfect graphic, instead there is an art concept and is gorgeous.
<br>
<br>I know its only the first chapter, but I&apos;m too anxious to the next to come, please March come fast!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=4937988">Expand</a></span>

As usual with my reviews, I&apos;m going to start off with the aesthetics of the game, then talk about the writing and dialogue, then conclude with mechanics, then summarize. Let&apos;s get started.
<br>
<br>First up, Life is Strange&apos;s design choices look like something that was put together by someone who has only experienced American youth culture secondhand. It takes extreme examples of some icons, then copy/pastes them together in some &quot;hella&quot; strange mixture of stereotypes that sort of belong in a satirical movie, ( which, in my opinion, this &quot;game&quot; desperately wants to be, but we&apos;ll get to that later.)
<br>You have the hipster teacher, complete with the stereotypical thick glasses, the well intentioned white knight Warren, Chloe, then of course, Max Caulfield. All of which would be great in a movie like say, Junebug. I find it rather flat and uninspiring. But hey, looks aren&apos;t everything right? Let&apos;s move on. The animation and graphics are quite dated looking, and the interface felt clunky.
<br>
<br>So let&apos;s talk about the writing. It bills itself as inspired by Twin Peaks, Donnie Darko, Groundhog Day, etc, yet captures nothing of the charm of any of those movies. The dialogue once again, felt like a satirized version of something someone heard that one time, from that really obnoxious teenager in that one movie. The dialogue is pretty cringey, and the portrayal of a lot of the characters in the game left me feeling no sense of attachment to any of them. I wonder how badly you have to miss the mark, if you have to bill yourself more to fans of movies, rather than gamers? I digress.
<br>
<br>Mechanically, again, the game feels clunky, it&apos;s a mess of casual pandering QTEs, and falls into some ridiculous adventure game tropes, which is odd, considering how much the marketing is billing itself as more of an interactive movie than as an actual game.
<br>
<br>So to summarize, I feel like this game is simply attempting to pander to the Telltale market, but ultimately fails to find anything in common with that demographic. If you&apos;re a fan of walking simulators like Gone Home, you&apos;d probably find a lot to like here, but for a core gamer looking for something to actually play, I couldn&apos;t recommend spending money on it. There are better games out there with time rewinding mechanics, if that&apos;s your hook. I give it a solid 4 to a 5 at best. For fans of the genre only.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=4952058">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m man but cried almost all game long, it&apos;s goes deep in heart, the story, characters, friendship. I can&apos;t say anything bad on this game, I have fully enjoyed how story is told and how you can change your mind, rewind time. More games like that!!! Supergirl just fly ...

Life is Strange over the course of the 5 episodes had me laughing, crying, and, at times, panicking, all over fictional characters who I had only known for a few hours. To say that is incredible is an understatement. It&apos;s very rare to find myself so invested in a story that I begin to respond, out loud, to different events taking place. For those looking for a game with ridiculous fight scenes or different ways to level up, this is not for you. However, if you want to sit down and listen to a great story and have your heart broken and put back together over and over again, this is the perfect game for you. I hope this game will be remembered as one of the greats.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6651966">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion, the game is only partially successful in those two endeavors. Sure, we come to like and dislike certain characters, and there&apos;s a lot of juicy drama and character building going on, but oftentimes the storytelling came across as something written by an amateur. The script is very accessible and emotive, but also comes off as melodramatic (especially so in episode 5) and falling prey to cliche stereotypes (episode 1 and 2).
<br>
<br>When it comes to the visuals, the game sports a kind of cartoon like art style, which I can&apos;t help but feel is Dontnod&apos;s attempt to offset or cover up the otherwise poor texture quality and non-existent lip syncing. It looks adequate at best, but its nothing special to gawk at for sure. Sound design is pretty good, with solid voice acting and suitable soundtracks playing for specific scenes.
<br>
<br>Episode 1 and 2 mainly serve as an introduction to the world of Arcadia Bay and its inhabitants. Every now and then, we also get to play around with time travel in order to explore different outcomes and solve little puzzles. It&apos;s a neat little mechanic that nicely accompanies all the walking and talking. The pace of these first two episodes does a feel a bit slow though. The plot only really starts to pick up during episode 3 and 4, which I consider to be the strongest episodes of the game. Beneath the peaceful veneer, lies the darker side of Arcadia Bay and its the job of you and your BFF to piece together what&apos;s going on.
<br>
<br>Lots of tension and anticipation is built, which to my disappointment feels rather wasted in episode 5 when the &apos;big&apos; reveal is made. It throws out a whole lot of contrived revelations without proper explanation or any convincing reason. In its rush to conclude all the plot points, the game lazily confers a big chunk of its storytelling responsibility to this abstract and supposedly deep concept of &quot;chaos theory&quot; and &quot;it&apos;s destiny&quot;. After a contrived dream sequence, the game ends with a binary choice that as implied by the episode title should&apos;ve left me polarized. Well Dontnod, I&apos;m afraid to say that I was not polarized at all and the choice was a very easy one to make.
<br>
<br>Overall, get Life is Strange if you like character progression, drama and Telltale-like gameplay, but don&apos;t expect to be impressed by the underlying narrative and poorly dealt with themes.

All of the characters&apos; psychologies are well-reflected. Once you hate a character, then you can cry for him. This game is story-based, so for some players it may be bored, but if you search for a STORY RICH game then you definitely buy it. You will be addicted to it.</span>

On the one hand it has some issues with its narrative, especially how Max has these visions of a hurricane tearing apart Arcadia Bay yet that never really seems to be a concern for her. Also I feel the story of Rachel Amber could have been handled better. The lip syncing was also not perfect, although it was improved upon it still is a little disjointed at times. Also the ending is probably the biggest issue given that all your choices are ultimately pointless as you are given two choices at the end that does not change regardless of your decisions up to that point. For a game that appears to be giving this much weight to your choices and how they impact other characters, it was quite disappointing.
<br>But that being said, the game is really, overall a beautiful game. The art for the game is amazing and I absolutely love the feel that it gives. Also the interaction between characters is really what drives the game. It feels real, and even though I am not a female teenager, I was able to relate to the character of Max. The time travelling aspect, although unexplained did add an extra element to the game that was refreshing and helped make the game feel more like a game rather than a story.
<br>The game focuses heavily on the friendship between Chloe and Max and it helps you build a connection to both these characters unlike any I have previously experienced within a game. The fourth and fifth episodes were  the most emotionally challenging experiences that I have ever encountered in a game. I have never cried in a game, movie or television show before yet for this game i genuinely wept. The characters of Chloe and Max were crafted beautifully and you can understand what the writers were trying to achieve throughout the last two episodes which makes the emotional impact very saddening, but it not gratuitous. Although Chloe and Max was certainly the focal point of the narrative, the interactions between other characters made the game more emotionally intense and more relatable.I could keep going on about how beautiful this game is, but I feel like it really does need to be experienced.
<br>I had a difficult decision deciding what to rate this game, because I believe it is truly fantastic and one of my favourite games ever because of the character interaction and the time travel mechanics.  This game has an intense emotional impact that really resonated with me, however it does have some glaring. Overall, I recommend this game but with caution because I was feeling the effects of this game months after I had finished it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=7224433">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. The story was overall pretty solid and will catch you off guard and at a couple points completely captivate its audience. The problem is, for every good moment in the story, the game has two pedantic and unfun sections (for example collecting empty bottles in a junkyard or mindlessly wandering around an art gallery). I also don&apos;t like the direction the game went but I won&apos;t focus on that. I do take issue with the two choice ending though. One of the two endings comes off as a fake choice. Choosing it means that you will miss the point of the game and the cutscene that will play is largely unfullfilling.
<br>
<br>2. I could not identify with any of the characters. They all came off unbelivable and unlikeable, including the main character Max. Dialogue is filled with cilches and is unnatural while none of tthe characters are explored in depth. For people who gave this game a bad review it seems like this is their number one problem with it. The reason it didn&apos;t ruin the game for me was that the genre is magical realism so it is supposed to be a little unrealistic and that I can imagine the dialogue being more appealing to high schoolers than those in their early 20s. (If you are late 20s+ I would not recommend buying this game.)
<br>
<br>3. The mechanic of time rewinding was interesting but left me with the feeling that none of my choices mattered. It was a creative way of  getting to see all the different choices that could be made, but the way it was used in puzzle solving was largely uncreative in my opinion. Furthermore, this mechanic makes the game almost wothless when it comes to replayability, something that I value in other story games. No  matter what you choose you will be lead through the same sequence of events to the same final decision. I don&apos;t want to spoil the ending, but it was very unfullfilling knowing that the main character could travel between the two realities if she really wanted to. This is not a game you should think hard about because there are definitely some major plot holes.
<br>
<br>If you like story games, are young and don&apos;t want to think too much then I highly recommend this game. It&apos;s a fun ride if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s coming. If that&apos;s not you, I&apos;d sit this one out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5639315">Expand</a></span>

At the one hand the game has many aspects which are very appealing. The artwork is simply great. A very consistent artistic vision which mixes realistic with styled elements, some of them impressionistic, some of them like entering one of Hopper&apos;s pictures. The music and the dialogue writing is not on the same level but work quite well most of the time. The music plays an important role in setting the mood, especially in longer non-dialogue section where the combination of images and music work &#x2013; in the best moments &#x2013; like a very good music video. At some points the musical indication how you should feel now is just to blunt and heavy-handed.
<br>
<br>I liked the dialogues. They may not be realistic &#x2013; I wouldn&apos;t know as I am not a US-American &#x2013; but are similar enough to many High School movies to seem at least to be so and the character types are, well, types, but with enough twists to make them enjoyable. And the rather good voice acting allowed me to ignore some of the weaker parts of the dialogues. The psychology of the characters has certainly not a lot to do with how real people feel and behave and experience trauma and handle it, but conforms rather to a simplified version of mainstream Hollywood psychology. This sounds more negative than I mean it. This game is popular entertainment and its main task is to make you feel; and this it does very well.
<br>
<br>Another point this game shares with other forms of modern popular entertainment like contemporary TV series is its interest in female empowerment. The two main characters in episode one to four are Maxine, called Max, and her friend Chloe and everyone else is destined to stay on the periphery. Sometimes, if not most of the time this creates very convincingly the small world only inhabited by these two best friends for ever sometimes tinged with some homoerotic feelings and filled with an atmosphere of mutual teenage adoration. Sometimes it is less convincing, for example when the two are leaving for some dangerous location and refuse help. So this game is, all in all, a very female-centered fantasy &#x2013; as, for example, the old Bond movies have been very male-centered fantasies &#x2013; and this shouldn&apos;t bother you if you want to enjoy this game.
<br>
<br>The story just wants too much. The plot is quite convoluted and mixes some High School/College drama with a crime story &#x2013; this combination works rather well &#x2013; and a mystic, supernatural-powers- are-awakening-and-the-end-of-the-world-is-nigh kind of plot, which doesn&apos;t work for me. Probably the writers wanted to explain the main game play device, the rewinding of time, by making it a part of this mystical world change. I have to admit that after some &apos;discussion&apos; of chaos theory and the end of the world is coming because nature is so polluted scenarios my hopes are not too high in respect to this part of the plot, while the crime story could work out, even if up to now it follows the classic schema very closely including an episode where the detective falls into the hands of the villain.
<br>
<br>The game play left me &#x2013; again &#x2013; with  mixed feelings. Max, the only playable character of the game, can rewind the time for about 1-2 mins. That allows for some interesting puzzles, but even those are not very complicated, and some of the others are bland and quite uninspired. Seen purely as an adventure game and comparing it with the reference games of this tradition, like Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, Day of the Tentacle, Myst or Harvey&apos;s new eyes the game play is rather boring. But this trait it shares with the Tell Tales games like The Wolf among us or The Walking Dead and many enjoy them. Life is Strange follows this role model also in putting a lot of emphasis on the decisions the player can make, and in a very similar way to the Tell Tale games the relation between the decision of a player and the outcome seems to be quite often very arbitrarily. Nevertheless the possibility to explore the beautifully painted world is really satisfying and together with the well-paced rhythm of the game, its change between emotionally intense passages and quieter ones, the game play has kept me immersed and interested most of the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5429328">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_5268300"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I really wanted to like this game. It does look and feel pretty cool for a video game. It&apos;s like one of those thought-provoking teenage dramas about life, death, and all the happiness and unhappiness in between. Unfortunately, I just feel that it missed its mark.
<br>
<br>First of all, the music kinda bothers me. It&apos;s relaxing at times, especially during the scenes where Max gets to sit down somewhere and a BGM starts to play as you relax with her and just chill. At other times, I feel that it came off as rather pretentious, like one of those movies that plays Coldplay&apos;s &quot;Fix You&quot; just so to be &apos;deep&apos;. The opening scene with the music on-loop in the first episode was so annoying. It&apos;s blasting so loud that I could barely hear Max talking over the song as I explore the hallway.
<br>
<br>Then there are the characters. I don&apos;t know why people kept on calling this game and its characters realistic, when most of the character traits here were ripped out from your typical high school drama movie. You have your rapist jocks (right, because seemingly nice guys like Warren would NEVER rape people), your sonority snobs (whom, as opposed to Hollywood&apos;s lies, are the exceptions among real life teenagers, not common stereotype), your shy sensitive love interest, Warren (whose real life counterparts actually rape people), because every teenage romance movie has to have one of those, your hardass military veteran, your homey housewives who married to an a**h*** (because they always do in movies for the sake of drama), and of course, your &apos;nice girl&apos; protagonist going into a &apos;good girl gone bad&apos; phase - again, a trademark of many teenage drama. To be fair, you do get to decide whether if the nice girl stays as a prude or unleash her inner-punk, so it&apos;s not all bad.
<br>
<br>Half of the cliches I described above don&apos;t exist in real life high schools. Jocks aren&apos;t always the ones who are self-entitled a**h***s, sonority girls aren&apos;t always snobbish and selfish (Max even used the phrase &quot;Victoria&apos;s Secret&quot; in the game to inform the players, &quot;Yes, this is a cliche sonority b**** who&apos;s shallow and insecure like all real life models...&quot; except that real life models aren&apos;t like that). They even have your textbook versions of two &apos;slaves&apos; that follow Victoria everywhere like in Mean Girls. One of them has to be the &apos;smart one&apos; and the other is a soft-hearted ditz. FYI, life isn&apos;t a teenage movie.
<br>
<br>The worst part is that befriending Victoria doesn&apos;t change anything in the long run, as she still acts like a shallow snob in episode 2, despite my expectation of the writers showing her to be more than skin-deep. Moreover, not ratting Nathan out doesn&apos;t change anything either, as he still gives you trouble and beats up Warren anyway. The only significant decision is Kate&apos;s suicide, which you can&apos;t prevent if you screwed up too badly.
<br>
<br>The problem with decision-based games like this is their focus on the main plot. They are forced to tell the main story, so their choices can&apos;t affect that too drastically, like giving you a choice not to save Chloe&apos;s father and not screw up her life, handicapping her, while you join the clique of those stereotype sonority ditz. It&apos;s no different from Telltale Games in that aspect. You want a game with choice? Try Fallout: New Vegas or School Days. Both of those games have myriad amount of endings significantly affected by your decisions. As far as I&apos;m concerned, Life Is Strange is as linear as a movie. It&apos;s an interactive movie where you get to participate in SOME decisions where you want the story to go, but you&apos;ll never truly change the fate of the protagonist herself, because the main plot is unchangeable.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not all bad though in hipsterville. The game deserves to be hailed as an improved version of Telltale Games. The controls are more interactive, the cutscenes are of higher quality, the dialogues are more fun and quirky, and some of the character moments aren&apos;t actually as bad as I might have implied above. Despite the cliches, Kate the bible-thumper is not as innocent (or horny) as movies portray bible-thumpers, Victoria redeems herself a little bit when you choose to comfort her (though I still wish they would drop the ridiculous snob act altogether), Chloe is damaged goods and a pretty selfish bestfriend (something I could actually relate with in real life), and I have to admit, there were enough subtle differences among the cliches for the game not to be totally terrible. It&apos;s no Call of Duty bad, but the character writing is merely on-par with Telltale&apos;s The Walking Dead.
<br>
<br>There are some cool things the game did with the choice system, such as the rewind mechanic and dialogue opportunities you get to try out using the rewind if you fail to have a proper conversation. One thing I&apos;m annoyed is that you can&apos;t answer correctly if you are replaying the game a second time (note that collectibles  must also be recollected with replays).
<br>
<br>Overall, the game has potential to be great, but its flaws greatly hold it ba</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5268300">Expand</a></span>

It was a real escape from all the unexplained gore and violence in today&apos;s games.  A masterpiece which will remain as an example as how a story-driven game should be constructed in order to wreak havoc into the mind of the player.</span>

<br>
<br>Life is Strange is an enjoyable cinematic experience that&apos;s admittedly a little rough around the edges. 10% of the voice acting is hit/miss but the VO for the main characters absolutely nail it. One or two of the &quot;revelations&quot; come a little too late as you&apos;ve already cottoned on far beyond when the protagonist should have realised. These are only minor gripes made all the more visible because the rest of the game is so beautiful, emersive, and engaging that when you encounter them you have no choice but to acknowledge them. Don&apos;t let them distract you from how impressive this game is.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve got very high hopes for the next batch of episodes of Life is Strange and a genuine interest in how the story unfolds. Buy it. Buy it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944966">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like Telltale games because of their story and the power to pull you in and care for the characters. But this game, I like it even more than TWD from Telltale. Obviously the theme is completely different but the main focus is on the characters just like in TWD.
<br>There are a lot of decisions you have to make. Different decisions lead you to different consequences. More interactivity in this game than in any TT game. You can control the MC pretty much from start to finish (without too many cinematics get in the way) so it gives you a feeling of greater involvement in anything that happens.
<br>Graphics is pretty nice.
<br>Not one dull moment I can remember. It grabbed my attention from the first moment and succeeded in keeping it until the closing credits. The game has a very immersive atmosphere.
<br>Controls are smooth as well.
<br>Overall everything works as it supposed to be. If the creators can keep this up with the upcoming episodes this is gonna be my favorite game of all time. Enough said.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938880">Expand</a></span>

Going off of telltale I have not experienced any immersion breaking graphical glitches (unlike telltale games where you will have body parts/ weapons fading through clothing etc) and the game tries to keep it so that the information you need to remember is provided within each episode (with one exception), which is handy since the business model has the episodes coming out every 2 or so months. The time travel mechanics are also very fresh (and thus unclear) and makes me wonder at the possibilities for time travel in future games.
<br>
<br>The bad: Some have pointed out issues with lip syncing but I have not noticed, also there is one exception to what I previously stated in that you do need to remember how the time travel mechanics work (which isn&apos;t very clear in the first place) from previous episodes, for example there were two puzzles in episode 3 which had me stumped for a good 10-15 minutes each, the first puzzle relies on using time travel mechanics in an unconventional way that you may or may not figure out as the game doesn&apos;t tell you (or if it does I don&apos;t remember it telling me which is a fault in clarity and guiding the player as several others have experienced this problem). The second puzzle I can&apos;t really get into without spoiling, but it was a failure in terms of game design, but not one that relies on the time travel mechanics.
<br>
<br>The ugly: Now for the business model, I abhor this business model (the episodic business model) and is one of the oldest tricks in the book in terms of television, it makes you want the next episode encourages you constantly thinking about it throughout the weekly, month;y or yearly, release schedule. This is a common marketing ploy used to keep you thinking about a product and is very effective in making you want more. However I am still willing to give this game a 10, which I suppose speaks to its effectiveness.
<br>
<br>TL:DNR Great game, while not a &quot;game changer&quot;, like games such as Telltales the Walking Dead, it is still one of the finest examples of the genre and of storytelling in video games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5287754">Expand</a></span>

When told how to interact with the environment a player wants to simply pull thair hair. You need to click a mouse key and drag the mouse into a specific direction, however, this does not work. When aiming at the characters diary, the character does not speak or interact with it. After several attempts with several objects the character seemed to pick and choose what they wanted to speak about. This game has an interesting premise but because of the plethora of major issues this game just down right sucks. It isn&apos;t worth any amount of money or the time to even download illegally. Just watch a let&apos;s play if you can find a competent one.   I paid money for this on Steam and it was so broken I had to refund it. I then tried to purchase it from Square Enix and again, because it was so broken, I had to refund it, again... This game is garbage. It&apos;s a piece of **** as far as technical performance is concerned. It may have a great story but any gamer worth their salt should not bother with the performance issues or troublesome glitches that happen to this game in general.
<br>
<br>In 2015 games like this should excel because they don&apos;t require a lot of input or technical expertise. But this game fails to grasp this concept. Stick to Telltale games. At least they can make something that runs well. Square Enix proves, yet again, that they don&apos;t know what a computer is or how one runs. They may be able to design console games but they need to leave PC to the professionals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5943739">Expand</a></span>

I HATE stories like this typically, however the writing, art design, and atmosphere is done so well  it will win you over. It tells a very human story while exploring the supernatural. The characters you interact with are entertaining and the story has a lot of heart to it. You are given the opportunity to make several decisions that will impact future episodes, which gives you significant input over the direction of the story. The time travel mechanic is used so well in this game as you try to solve puzzles, rewinding time to manipulate people and objects to your advantage. It is a great buy for $5, i am happily surprised and i am waiting for the next episode!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=4952365">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am really lost for words, and i really dont know how should i boast about this game more without spoilers.
<br>JUST BUY IT! best of all you can buy all the episodes one after another instead of the whole package!

<br>
<br>So I bought this game and I&apos;m so overwhelmed by greatness, I do love nearly everything about this game, the plot, the characters, the atmosphere, hell gosh the soundtrack!
<br>Even though the Lyp-Sync is way off and there are some visual bugs like floating items (Can be fixed with future patches and is not game breaking), it deserves better reviews and ratings and it is my best pick of 2015 so far. In fact the only reason why sites like IGN gave this game a &quot;6.5/10&quot; is because this game has a very specific target audience, as for me, I&apos;m totally one of the audience as someone who turned 18 this year and almost finished with school.
<br>I am so hyped for episode 3 which will be released in may and I am talking non-stop about the previous 2 episodes so far, I spend so many hours on talking with my friends about this awesome game.
<br>We (My friends and I) tried to analyse the game and understand what makes this a great game but it is nearly impossible to say specific things. Dontnod Entertainment really did a great job and for that price it&apos;s completely worth it,
<br>
<br>TL:DR Worth it! Buy it! Play it! Discuss hours and hours with your friends</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5165360">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really still do love this game, the setting and the way it handles character reaction and interaction make it one of the most organic games I&apos;ve seen to date. Unfortunetly this means you&apos;ll end up with some of the cheesiest lines ever written, case and point &quot; are you cereal &quot; even the ingame character think they&apos;re about to barf upon hearing that.
<br>The music score is also very good and they nailed the theme and tone of the story. The main theme in particular is very memorable. Which is saying something from someone who doesn&apos;t pay too much attention to soundtracks.
<br>animation is not the best. While the asthetic is beautiful to behold the actual animation can get a bit choppy, while this is more of a problem near the start of the game it&apos;s extremely easy to notice during lipsync.
<br>Story is good but it feels like it&apos;s building up and building up into something amazing up until episode 5 and then it unfortunetly falls flat on its face. (I&apos;m not giving any spoilers)
<br>So in the end after much regret I&apos;m forced to give this game a 7 objectively and a 8 subjectively.
<br>I compared this game to telltales in my earlier review saying that this would suceed where the others failed. Sadly I was dissapointed and this game still features the illusion of choice, making me give it an objective 7. Subjectively though my previous statements regarding the struggles of the company make me still give this an 8 because I do think that it is justly deserved.
<br>Final  rating 8</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5111602">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game begins with Max witnessing a cataclysmic event destroying her town, only to be thrust back into the present, where she witnesses her best friend being shot by the town&#x2019;s protected and evil rich boy. She discovers her powers and the game takes off from there.
<br>If I have one major gripe with the game, it&#x2019;s that you are just thrown into this characters life, with nothing more than a 8-page &#x201C;journal&#x201D; which chronicles the past five years of her life, and briefly touches on friends and foes. The game would have really benefited from a 5-minute intro that explains this girls life and gives a better clue who she is. On the bright-side, wonderful music, voice acting and toon expressions really do draw you in, and after some trial and error, you pretty much get it.
<br>I&#x2019;d recommend this game to any interested in the &#x201C;Walking Dead&#x201D; series, as it does have that consequential outcome for the choices you make. Episode 1 (out of 5) is available now, with Episode 2 slated for March. $4.00 an episode on Steam, or $20 for all 5.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Interesting plot and concept
<br>Story is fun and &#x201C;time-travel&#x201D; is a hysterical tool to turn the table on your opponents with &#x201C;future&#x201D; knowledge and manipulation.
<br>Very effective emotional communication between characters
<br>Wonderful music and voice acting
<br>Great lighting and effects on PC
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Just throws you into a characters life with zero background.  Slows emotional connection between player and in-game characters
<br>Graphics are a little stiff (Unreal engine) and it can&#x2019;t tell if it wants to be a toon, or live-action movie at times.
<br>Interface is slightly wonky at first
<br>While the &#x201C;time-travel&#x201D; aspect is highly enjoyable, it leaves those gaping plot-holes which leave the viewer to ask &#x201C;why didn&#x2019;t she just &#x2026;?&#x201D; Be prepared to pile disbelief upon disbelief and enjoy the ride</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=4936946">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll be honest, it sounds a little like something that David Cage would make if he joined Telltale Games, but it&apos;s actually a lot better than that and something I heartily recommend, though with a massive pulsating asterisk on it.  If you have little patience for high-school antics and slang, then you will find this game incredibly trying.
<br>
<br>First, characters.  Honestly speaking, the characters here are very believable and you can generally tell the kind of people they&apos;re supposed to be, but with one exception they act like people, not just caricatures.  The main character, Max, is a quiet art student type girl, and seems to have a lot of self-doubt, if her inner-monologue is anything to go by, but she&apos;s pretty relatable, especially for introverts.  Most of the supporting cast you can see working out well with interesting potential, though I admit that I&apos;m /very/ concerned about how certain people wind up getting portrayed mostly due to what they might be used to represent.  The (so-far) primary antagonist is... interesting to say the least; think of a spoiled rich brat with roid rage... I don&apos;t know what to make of him yet.  But so far, the characters get a 10/10 for me.
<br>
<br>Second, plot.  So, nothing wrong with the plot, Max moved back to her hometown to go to the local university as a photography student, and has discovered she rather spontaneously has the ability to rewind time, quite extensively I might add.  The situations going on around her (with one spoiler I&apos;m not saying) are quite varied and quite serious with the potential to go wrong, but so far are being treated maturely so I&apos;m not too worried, but just know that they will be at least talking about murder, drugs, rape, and other such things, and not jokingly.  My big complaint stems from the fact that I can so far identify what every character&apos;s role will be immediately and the aforementioned potentia ex machina.  There&apos;s also a lot of variation of choice and little things you can change.  One thing that bugs me though is that... this is clearly a high school story, and not just the characters but everything about the setting is clearly a high school.  Yet for some reason they keep saying it&apos;s a college, and I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out why.  If I had to guess, it was originally a high school story, but something they have planned for later episodes is going to be really graphic and they didn&apos;t want to show it happening to a minor.  8/10
<br>
<br>Third, writing and acting.  Let&apos;s address the elephant in the room: yes, the main character is a girl named Max, and I wouldn&apos;t be lying by saying it&apos;s REALLY distracting.  Beyond this though, I personally have a VERY low tolerance for terms like &apos;selfie,&apos; so I weary of the slang used in this, but it&apos;s not poorly or inaccurately used for the most part.  The characters speak like real people and the voice actors give wonderful performances--though I should note that some of the people are a little... different, not unbelievable just odd.  My only gripe is directed solely at the word &apos;hipster,&apos; because it does NOT mean what they think it means.  Max keeps getting called one, but besides using a polaroid camera, she doesn&apos;t talk, act, dress, or in other way indicate this; she&apos;s just an art nerd.  And then there&apos;s one girl that is so punk that I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if she wound up wearing a mohawk at one point, but for whatever reason she keeps getting called a hipster.  It&apos;s annoying really, but I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s an intentional mistake to show ignorance of the characters or just the writers using a hot word.  9/10
<br>
<br>Graphics, gameplay, and glitches.  No glitches to speak of.  Graphically... it&apos;s quite good for using Unreal Engine, especially the effects and atmosphere, but note that that involves words &apos;Unreal Engine.&apos;  There&apos;s something odd about the modeling I can&apos;t place, it&apos;s not ugly but it needs a little touching up.  That said though, the effects and lighting are AMAZING.  The point-and-click interface is wonky to get used to, but functional in the end, and the way they handle the time travel is actually quite nice (think longer-ranged Prince of Persia). 9/10
<br>
<br>Overall:  So long as you can overlook the pseudo-high-school setting and some abuse of modern language, then this is a wonderful Telltale-style adventure game with a somewhat predictable but solid and engaging story.  The characters are interesting, and I DO hope to affect what happens to them... even if I&apos;m thinking of ways I can drop one or two of them off cliffs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5004103">Expand</a></span>

<br>Considering that this is an episodic game, obviously it still has everything to prove. But we&apos;re off to a good start, definitely. The only con is the length, just a couple of hours for a single run.

Shaky start. Fantastic middle. Awful ending. That would summarize my feelings about the game pretty well. I could almost leave it at that... But I won&apos;t.
<br>
<br>When I played the first episode of the game, I didn&apos;t have high hopes for it. The beginning is very shaky. The characters feel way too generic, clich&#xE9;d even. The only bright light is the main character and the story that&apos;s being set up (the missing girls, mind you, not the time traveling). Everything else is.. Mediocre at best. But this is to be expected. You can&apos;t expect a game or a TV show to establish its characters in the first few hours. Some manage it but most don&apos;t.

<br>The writers start writing a bit more depth into the supporting cast after the first episode. And I applaud the writers for it. Because of those efforts, I didn&apos;t leave this game thinking it was bad (contrary to what people on the Internet say, 6/10 is a decent rating, not bad by any stretch). However, it&apos;s the &quot;main&quot; supporting character that I never warmed up to. Chloe seems to be the &quot;do it for her&quot; character like Ellie of the Last of Us, Clementine from TWD, Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite. It&apos;s just that it&apos;s so damn hard to like the character. Aggressive, impulsive, shifts blame onto the main character, throws a hissyfit when I answer a phone and she has to talk to her mother. Really?
<br>
<br>The story involves time traveling, making the genre savvy able to predict the overall tone of the ending. Some people on Reddit actually just kind of guessed it to a tee. Given the imaginary rules of time travel, there&apos;s really only new takes on old ideas with time traveling stories. Nevertheless, the other main story, the missing girls. Interesting stuff. Riveting. Truly the best part of the game. And the main focus. Thank god.
<br>
<br>After the shaky start, Life is Strange had three great episodes. Each delving deeper into the mystery, each giving some background on side characters and yeah... Really spectacular. Showed a lot of promise. But quite like Mass Effect 3 years ago, the ending is just awful. It effectively gives you a binary decision. Choose a ship or choose to undo every action you made in the entire game. It really feels like the writers just threw it in there in a hurry to publish.
<br>
<br>Admirable ambition with some great character arcs and an interesting main mystery. Some of the characters got past their clich&#xE9;s after the writers gave some background exposition... Some other characters weren&apos;t as lucky. The writers struggle to end the story in any fulfilling fashion. Two endings, the other is just anticlimactic and the other has been seen previously in countless of time travel stories.
<br>
<br>Should you buy it? Well.. I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s not that expensive so I&apos;d say yes. But only if you really have the money for it. There&apos;s a lot of better games out there at the moment and most of them have the same price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5837106">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m too tired to write a long review again so here&apos;s the short story:
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t like this game because of how emotionally dragged I got into it (keep in mind I liked it, but hated the ending), and it probably got something to do with accidentally not saving Kate which I carefully picked dialogue in my second playthrough, but also the fact that I was expecting a happy game.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t come into a game where you play as an 18 year old girl who really likes photography expecting a sad game. But neither did Max, and so i&apos;m raising this games rating, as it shows you simply can&apos;t save everybody.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6181153">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you ever encounter comments saying that this game is bad and providing elaborated reasoning to back it up, don&apos;t listen to them. As I see it, people might not like LiS for two reasons:
<br>1) It is very slow paced due to its mundane setting, and some might find it boring.
<br>2) It focuses heavily on the main characters, so if you don&apos;t like them, you probably won&apos;t like the game.

<br>
<br>And so on and so forth.
<br>
<br>So, given all that, why do I rate it 8? That&apos;s pretty damn good, right?
<br>
<br>Because, I actually LIKED the game! It spoke to me emotionally on several occasions. And I thought the lead heroine was cute and likable. All characters are cliche as F, but it works somehow anyway.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s just me, some people will of course disagree violently on all points mentioned.
<br>
<br>Sure, it makes no sense logically, and it&apos;s a bit awkward when they feel the need to show how &quot;progressive&quot; they are by scoring some cheap LGBT brownie points in the end (totally out of the blue, and contrary to the character development so far, which is the gripe here, not the LGBT inclusion as such).
<br>
<br>But even that ending on a sour note couldn&apos;t take away the fact it was an enjoyable experience FOR ME and I&apos;m glad I played it!
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to see more games like this in the future!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6485714">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In the first chapter of the game, your character pulls a Butterfly (literately) effect, and discovers she can travel backwards in time. If this sounds familiar, it&apos;s because the mechanism is identical to that of &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; film. Complete with side-effects...
<br>
<br>For the first three chapters, the game really does make you want to care about some characters (some more than others) and choices made right from the first scene in the game have far ranging consequences. The game tells you &quot;This choice will have consequences&quot; when something affects a relationship with another character, while the game will give you a &quot;major choice&quot; that will have far-reaching consequences.
<br>
<br>Pros: If you like time-travel, or like &quot;The Butterfly effect&quot; (or even Final Destination) this will feel familiar. The voice acting and character designs are fairly good, feeling like you are interacting with a film more than playing &quot;hunt for the hotspot and a witty retort&quot; that some adventure games do. Most of the flavor text comes in the form of &quot;SMS&quot; messages and a note in a Journal that you can optionally ignore.
<br>
<br>Negatives: If you hate time travel, hated &quot;The Butterfly effect&quot; , or don&apos;t like adventure games in general, this game will feel very annoying. The user interface is not very good when played on the PC, and tends to confuse players with how to use the verbs presented. Lip-sync tends to just disappear at times.
<br>
<br>If you are playing on a PC, you have to point the camera at the object and then use the mouse to click/drag the verb. This feels confusing compared to other adventure games which have you click/tap the object and then the verb.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661464">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6024906"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This review is marked spoiler because the plot is primarily what&apos;s wrong with the game (and it&apos;s impossible to discuss otherwise). By now you&apos;ve probably read other negative reviews and figured out the problem - Episodes 1-4 build up a plot which Episode 5 literally makes zero sense of, leaving gaping plot holes in its wake and rendering the primary &quot;gimmick&quot; of the game pointless. You basically save the life of a friend in Episode 1 by rewinding time, then use that power from then on to help your friends. By series 5, you are &quot;told&quot; that use of that power has caused a storm that&apos;ll destroy the town. Your &quot;choices&quot;:-
<br>
<br>Ending 1 - You &quot;rewind your rewinds&quot; back to the beginning to undo everything saving the town but causing your best friend to die. Great except it makes zero sense for two reasons as laid out in Ep1 : 1. You already saw the storm coming BEFORE you used your power for the first time (the storm is the opening scene in Ep1), so it wasn&apos;t using your power that caused it. 2: The &quot;rewind time&quot; is actually creating &quot;alternative reality loops&quot;, in which each time you rewind, you spin another loop. So even if &quot;rewinding&quot; did &apos;cause&apos; the storm, doing a &quot;big rewind&quot; won&apos;t undo anything, it&apos;ll just create another parallel loop that&apos;ll make the storm even worse... The storm itself makes zero sense and trying to &quot;rewind the rewinds&quot; is openly contradicted by some comments in Episode 1. This ending actually eliminates every reason to play (and replay) the game in the first place!
<br>
<br>Ending 2 - You don&apos;t &quot;rewind time&quot; and the town is destroyed but your best friend lives. After spending early episodes talking about dating boys, you then ride off into the sunset shacked up with her after magically turning lesbian... Given the developer is the same one who created &quot;Gone Home&quot;, this &quot;twist&quot; really isn&apos;t a surprise. But ignoring that, &quot;the storm&quot; itself still makes zero sense as a &quot;consequence&quot; of your power given it was already brewing before you initially used your power (which is never explained HOW or WHY you got it)...
<br>
<br>There are a lot of other &quot;issues&quot; as well : Adults writing as &quot;with-it teenagers&quot; is never easy, but every 18-21 year old in the game seems to still act like the worst Hollywood stereotypes of the 12-16 age group. Writing was cringe-worthy in many lines and the whole &quot;high school drama queen&quot; theme felt more annoying than immersive. Likewise, hardly any of the characters were actually likeable. Two or three of your &quot;friends&quot; (including the girl you &apos;save&apos; Chloe) were unfriendly, petty and annoying enough to want to not save. What on the surface of some interactions appears as an initial &quot;air of intellectualism&quot;, later gets shown to be cheap attempts at emotional manipulation followed by screwing up the plot after a bloated script collapses under its own weight. By that I don&apos;t mean it&apos;s &quot;difficult to understand&quot; but rather they introduced so much &quot;stuff&quot; regarding other characters on top of the main plot, by the time the end came they either forgot or lacked time / money to wrap everything up they introduced.
<br>
<br>In short &quot;Life Is Strange&quot; is another of those &quot;your choices really really matter this time&quot; point and click adventure games where not only do most of your choices not matter in the slightest, the only important choice you do make 5 mins before the end of Episode 5 wipes out all of your choices anyway yet still makes no sense either way...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6024906">Expand</a></span>

It had quite a strong emotional effect on me whilst I was playing it, it makes you think about your own life and what you wish you could &quot;rewind&quot; and do over again.
<br>
<br>I would rank the episodes as follows: 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 1</span>

From the first episode, players are put into the camera lenses of Max Caulfield, an 18 year old high school student with a love for photography and possesses the ability to rewind time. Pinch me if I haven&apos;t heard skeptics call this Tumbler: The Game. I had the same  thoughts too going in, but as soon as the credits rolled, my mouth was taped shut and my wallet dumped into the next four episodes. Life is Strange absolutely nails the atmosphere and setting the mood of the story and the characters that populate it. The game on the opposite end of the table sitting  away from TellTale, boasts a striking paintbrush look to its world and characters, with soft textures adorning plenty of the environment. But what this first episode alone gets perfect is the soundtrack. Being set in the small town of Aracdia Bay in the state of Oregon as seen through the eyes in a coming of age teenage girl, the indie folk and mellow guitar strums really pull you in, inviting players to a world akin to Juno and Donnie Darko. Life isn&apos;t perfect in this game world and the characterization of all the characters, including Max, are based off some high school archetype of the 21st Century. It&apos;s more exaggerated than overblown, just enough so it becomes clear of each character&apos;s place into this small town and how they add to the mood of it. Skeptics on the other end are already sneering on the prospect that this game is one giant cutscene, but Life is Strange prods itself to be more akin to a point and click adventure, since there are no QTE events or fear of death as in other episodic games, such as The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Instead, players are encouraged to take their time examining the world through Max&apos;s eyes and while some quips and phrases makes people roll their eyes and scream cringeworthy, it lends a charming, immature nature to the game. Max is no superhero and the way she goes about her day even with time traveling abilities is much the same, through her thoughts are centered around her new profound ability to reverse time. In this game&apos;s mechanics, reversing time is used to retrieve and use new information to persuade, solve mundane tasks and issues, and even changing certain decisions if the player is not content with their aforementioned choice.  While it is not mind boggling complex, the simple nature of it invites even the most clueless of gamers and it works well around the game&apos;s plot. One extreme flaw I do have to mention is the lip syncing: its below average. Sometimes it seems that the game was originally in French then translated to English till I found out that the animators just screwed the pooch. Other than that, LIS nails the mood, tone, setting, characters, and pacing in a single episode which can be completed in a slow afternoon. Life Is Strange on its first episode alone has given TellTale a run for their money on top of the episodic gaming scene, and The Walking Dead has two seasons already.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5326103">Expand</a></span>

Life is Strange is a brilliant, emotional, thought-provoking game that raises the bar and will reach out and grab anyone that enjoys a great story, great characters and a world that is rich in nuanced detail that helps bring everything to life. If you had any reservations about putting yourself into the shoes of a teenage girl, don&apos;t, because this game is nothing like it might seem and truly a masterful creation. If you love Telltale-style games, you will feel right at home as it borrows unabashedly from the leading works im the genre, with its own twists woven into the game&apos;s mechanics.
<br>
<br>The only thing that holds back Life is Strange is that it is a port of a game that was animated in another language (Ithink French), which means the English voiceovers don&apos;t accurately fit the mouth movements of the characters when speaking. It is a pretty major detail, although one you will quickly get used to as you immersive yourself in the story. A remastered edition would be worth it if it is ever released.
<br>
<br>Stellar, memorable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5525324">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can nitpick all you want over any game you desire but if you stop coming from a biased angle (reference intended) and come at this game objectively you&apos;ll find it to be a masterpiece. Yes, cell shaded like graphics isn&apos;t for everyone and yes, it isn&apos;t your typical run of the mill game (*cough cough COD players cough cough*), but rating this game based off of those criteria is like rating a painting by tasting it, it just doesn&apos;t make sense. The story is amazing no matter how you look at it. It&apos;s meticulously designed and lets the inner completionist indulge in every little convo that is available for Maximus to have. All the game mechanics have been done before (Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, Walking Dead, etc..).  Its NOT original just for those out there that praise its ingenuity, its just the way the game mechanics work with one another that makes it feel original. That being said, it does in no way take away from the game. It&apos;s like how everyone hates on quick time events. It only sucks if it ISN&apos;T DONE RIGHT. Just look at Dragon&apos;s Lair for an proper example of quick time events done right. The characters were so developed it felt like you were participating in a movie which in some cases made this game a turn off for some gamers. I understand that everyone has their own idea of what makes a good game and what genre&apos;s each individual likes will be different. THAT DOESN&quot;T MEAN THE GAME IS BAD! It just means you are not partial to the game style, so please don&apos;t come into a popular rating website and spam 0&apos;s across the board because you didnt like the style. Once again that&apos;s like rating art by tasting it....... it doesn&apos;t make sense. Enjoy this game for what it is: an expression of art, and I&apos;ll bet some of you hardcore COD players will begrudgingly admit that the game&apos;s developers really hit the mark on this one. Once again, be objective, not biased wehn playing games. Especially if you are going to rate them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5989770">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics, overall art design, and music are excellent, the story is very interesting and &quot;strange&quot; as the title suggests, and the characters are real and compelling enough. Especially the main character, Max. She&apos;s great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6078071">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is such an unique experience that makes this game deserve a 10. Sometimes it gets really messy and confusing. Max adventure is very well written and it is a huge rollercoaster. But if you like GREAT stories, and if you want to get one of the most unique games on the last years do yourself a favor and play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6081503">Expand</a></span>

I had no idea it existed or that it had even existed up until the month before it was released. After stumbling upon a video showing the game, I became immediately hooked.
<br>
<br>Developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Square Enix, the game is presented like Telltale&apos;s series The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, etc, as it is episodic. While all episodes are now released, the wait for each episode was a long one. Each break between the episodes made me feel as if I was waiting for the sequel to my favorite movie to come out, or as if I was waiting for the second half of a favorite TV show of mine. To be able to capture that in a game is remarkable. Many gamers today want all of the content up front and right away. I believe this game utilized the episodic template very well.
<br>
<br>The basic plot of the game is of a teenager, Max Caulfield, who watches a traumatic event unfold. She discovers she can rewind time and prevents the event from happening. This power that she has that the center of the game. Max&apos;s interactions with everyone is affected by her new power, and it creates for a very interesting story. The story is full of twists and turns, emotional events, strong character development, and great visuals.
<br>
<br>As for the game play, it feels very much like a point and click adventure with puzzles here and there. But, instead there are many dialogue options that will change the outcome of the story. Actions that you take or miss will also have an effect on the story&apos;s ending. Trying to play the game to your morals and trying to make all of the right decisions to get the best ending is what drove me to anxiously await the next episode.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game was easily one of my favorite games of 2015. I did not expect a game from Square Enix that would be so choice driven or to be modeled after other episodic series. This game has me wanting more, and so I shall wait for any news that suggests a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6188821">Expand</a></span>

<br>A very story-driven game, your decisions DO affect gameplay. The game can be a bit of a **** but that&apos;s not in a bad way, I actually found it accurate, since time travel IS full of a bit of **** But anyways, it does a great job at developing the characters, and you actually care about/hate them. A really memorable game, very relaxing to play as well, and it honestly has its moments.
<br>
<br>Give it a try.
<br>But trust me, you have to play it all to really grasp the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5956829">Expand</a></span>

The dialogue can be corny, though the acting is top notch, and things can hit you in the gut if you&apos;re invested.  But then it&apos;ll turn around and get you happy all over again.
<br>
<br>At first I had many gripes with the game, but as I went further, episode by episode, suddenly I grew attached to them.  The sometimes unnatural slang grew to be my favorite parts of some of the characters.  The narcissistic qualities of others were purely understandable and, in a way, something you could relate to one way or another.
<br>
<br>The music was easily one of my least favorite parts of the game, mostly because I was prejudicial  and wrote it off as &apos;hipster trash,&apos; but then it too grew to be one of the best parts of the game&apos;s atmosphere.  It felt genuine, it felt real.  In some crazy way, I felt less of an outsider looking in and more inserted into the world.
<br>
<br>As I explored the game, episode by episode, I quickly grew attached to the world involved.  Soon I cared less and less about getting the right reaction, and instead I focused more on building a relationship (as pathetic as that may sound,) with everyone, no matter how superfluous it may ultimately end up.
<br>
<br>Maybe it was the lack of sleep I had the previous night, but something really clicked for me.  If it wasn&apos;t for the fact I wasn&apos;t alone in the house when I finished up episode 5, I more than likely would&apos;ve cried my eyes out. This would fall under the category of &quot;Things I would never do, under any circumstance&quot; clause of my personality, but somehow Life is Strange broke down that wall and I&apos;m still feeling the effects of the game&apos;s ending over 24 hours later.
<br>
<br>I doubt I would ever, ever play this game again.  But not because I thought it was boring, or lackluster.  Instead, it&apos;s because of the emotional anguish it brought to me.  A bittersweet type of agony, I never want to experience again, but am glad I did.  Now excuse me, I have more self loathing to catch up on, because.. reasons.
<br>
<br>TL;DR This game emotionally destroyed me, I entirely do not regret playing the game, regardless of my soul being crushed through the myriad ways delivered throughout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=6047392">Expand</a></span>

Great artistic choices all over. The story is very well written, the characters have a certain depth and realism you don&apos;t see very often, in places the voice acting goes from good to incredible, the soundtrack and graphical style really help create a cohesive aesthetic, and the camera angles, panning shots and overall &apos;cinematography&apos; are amazing. Some of the scenes are just shining artistic mastery. As a writer, photographer and film student this game speaks to me on many levels.
<br>
<br>When the game ended, I left feeling forlorn because I&apos;m so invested in the characters I don&apos;t want to say goodbye. I know that feeling can be confused by unsophisticated people (to be quite frank, if pretentious) as an indication of incompleteness or poor writing. There are many people who disagree with the ending, but those people are failing to realize that for all the same reasons they criticize the ending to this game, they may as well criticize the ending to their own real lives. The choices you make don&apos;t always lead to the ends you want. Life may not always happen to your satisfaction, nor even the way you expect it to. Life is strange.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange/user-reviews?user_review_id=5959748">Expand</a></span>
