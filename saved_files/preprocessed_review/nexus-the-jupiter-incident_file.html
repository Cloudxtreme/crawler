Even humor is a very strong part, but mostly hidden..you need to have a sense for it. Just one name: Rear Admiral Norbank...this guy is hilarious! ;)) If you like a mixture of Freespace and Homeworld, GRAB IT, and have fun!</span>

                                        <span> I think this game really awesome but extremely low paced. If you love epic sci-fi battles well, you&apos;ll love Nexus. On the other hand, if you&apos;re a fan of pure space strategy (i.e. HW, HW-C, HW2, Project Earth, Haegemonia), well, this game could not be for you. Anyway, i think this game an absolute must for everyone. S.M., Italy.</span>

The graphics are beautiful and the ships all look suitably unique. The explosions look utterly incredible. The gameplay is very good, when you control more than a couple of ships it can flick from slow and methodical to frantically micromanaging to keep your ships alive (especially the ones that carry over between missions) while striking back at the enemy. Do you concentrate on maintaining your shields or strike back at your enemies? Should you launch fighters into the melee or should you try to take out the flak guns first? Do you close to range and pummel the shields with energy weapons or stand off and use some of your precious, limited missiles? Do you charge your shields now and go in all guns blazing, or cloak your ship and sneak up alongside before opening up, leaving yourself similarly exposed? Making choices like this can make or break a battle, but there&apos;s no single way to do it. The story is absorbing and the characters and voice acting top notch. Your character, Marcus Cromwell&apos;s, diary makes for interesting reading, giving you greater insight into the background of the game and frequently making me laugh. Now onto the bad, even with the 1.1 patch, the game is a little buggy. It appears to vary between people, but on mine it manifested as blue screening and restarting my PC on certain opening cutscenes. This is, to say the least, rather annoying and made it necessary to save the game before starting a mission in case it crashed and lost all the modifications I&apos;d made to my ships. This is the main reason I gave it a 9 out of 10, but if you like the game, it&apos;s a very small fly in the ointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nexus-the-jupiter-incident/user-reviews?user_review_id=404793">Expand</a></span>

The developers at made an interesting story around it and in stead of the monotone storytelling of Homeworld2, Nexus has lots of conversations in it, which truely gives you the idea that you&apos;re dealing with crews and captains in stead of computerized hunks of metal in space. I don&apos;t agree with people saying that this game doesn&apos;t have any strategy in it. I found myself playing and replaying missions, trying to find the right weapons for the right situations and trying out different ways of defeating th enemy. All in all, I must say I really enjoyed this game but I&apos;m sure that, especially because of the slow pace of the game, it&apos;s not for everyone...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nexus-the-jupiter-incident/user-reviews?user_review_id=377414">Expand</a></span>

And the battles are interesting as well, you have to use your logic and creativity to win them. I really hope that the second &apos;epizode&apos; of this will be at least as great as this first one.</span>

The storyline is very sci-fi and keeps you in suspense, really liked the characters and they tend to grow on you over the course of the game, but the best is the huge battles with very customiseable ships.

It is also the buggiest game that I have ever battled through to finish. Some missions have to be done a certain, specific way; others flat out crash if things are exactly right. Great game that needed a little more work.</span>

<br>If someone playing for 2 hours still can&apos;t see the point... Well, perhaps the problem isnt with the game! Reading the manual or restarting episode1 and reading (not just skipping) the tutorial messages could help...
<br>And this is NOT an rts like homeworld. But it IS a tfs - the best one!</span>

Believable physics and AI, graphics are very nice for a game from 2005. Ships try to run away if they&apos;re getting pounded and if they&apos;re about to blow up they evacuate which, afaik, has no in-game purpose, but it adds a very nice touch. Reminds us there are living beings on board and that war isn&apos;t nice, even if it&apos;s a very pretty war in space. Gameplay reminds me of a star-trek episode. There&apos;s usually so much more to do than just &quot;shoot stuff and go home&quot;. You get to scan things, solve puzzles, make decisions... and the actual combat is very good! You get to target subsystems, prioritize them, assign repair crews, try out different weapon combinations and board ships with commandos! Overall, very good game, heartily recommended for anyone who likes scifi.

Wish it had a skirmish build, but I understand it is a story Driven game with goals other then just pass space conquest. You can get a ton of mods for it off of Mod DB which helps bring more return playability after the campaign is over. Rumor they are making a Nexus 2 as well so Look out for that title I hope they keep up to the name of the first Nexus an do not ruin it by trying to make it a Sandbox style Space game, Keep to the core of what made this game compelling an fun, please. I like the interface a lot the weapon use,repair tree, selecting to give more or less power to certain systems. The capability of single shot control of your weapons systems, or being able to switch the mode from Defensive or offensive like different Alert statuses depending on battle or recon scenarios. Only thing I find lacking is the non support for a higher Resolution for wide screen monitors with a 16:9 ratio you can not run 1600x1200 so you have to run under a lower resolution an lose a giant part of your screens viewing capability. An they have not patched this issue nor does it seem they ever will. Wish a Mod programer would address this an make a 1.2 Game Patch for enhanced graphics/resolutions. Maybe some day... cause of that I give this game a 8, cause of mechanics on options. Other then that the game is a joy to play, being able to customize the build out lay of ships is fun an brings a curve to the strategy of how to play each mission to the fullest capability your ship can have in different scenarios.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nexus-the-jupiter-incident/user-reviews?user_review_id=1808406">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the plot is classic, and that&apos;s a way I love. The rest is really well laid out, an epic story, many different aspects, sometimes not explained well enough, I agree there. It is too bad that the creators apparently did not have the time to release more patches because some things are unbalanced and a little random. If you can forgive that, you&apos;ll have much fun with this game. AND there are some game guides out there that can help you get over the first difficulties. Also, the graphics are still something to catch your eye, even today (I discovered the game only recently). In any case, Nexus sure captured me, despite the (for me forgivable) flaws it unfortunately has. BUT they are &quot;merely&quot; technical in my point of view.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nexus-the-jupiter-incident/user-reviews?user_review_id=3093627">Expand</a></span>

There is a little tutorial but after Mission 3 there is always the problem &quot;was the commando accepted?&quot; - &quot;why did the laser not fire?&quot; - &quot;is enemy1 or enemy2 near? where am i in 3d space?&quot;. Sorry - not my cup of tea.
<br>
<br>Atmosphere, Story, Music, Sound - all good.
<br>Controls and Gamesplay - no well designed.</span>

This make me a headache and had to drink coffee or tea when playing it. But, overall, this game is very good. The story is good, the graphics are nice, and the gameplay is also good, although already 10 years old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nexus-the-jupiter-incident/user-reviews?user_review_id=5533843">Expand</a></span>
