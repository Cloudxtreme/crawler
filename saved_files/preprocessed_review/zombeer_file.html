<br>cover your ears kids
<br>pleasure tool&#x2026;
<br>a pink **** yall
<br>eventually you do get a nail gun zombie grenades and a shotgun though&#x2026;
<br>but you&#x2019;ll probably miss the hearts and vibrations...
<br>Though the shooting and combat here feels awful no matter which weapon you use&#x2026;and the aiming is awkward
<br>This game is 2 hours long and takes place inside of a school as you go through looking for the right route.. Keeping your intoxication level just right so you don&#x2019;t die... and killing all of the zombies in your way...
<br>That&#x2019;s it... this is the game&#x2026;
<br>The level design isn&#x2019;t really interesting&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s pretty below average from start to finish
<br>The most it has going for it is its humor&#x2026;
<br>which sort of reminded me of suda 51s lollipop chainsaw at times&#x2026; not as good obviously..
<br>But it was enough to keep the experience to this games credits enjoyable...
<br>The soundtrack here is pretty enjoyable as well though there are few audio bugs that I ran into towards the end of the game where the game just stopped making noise and didn&#x2019;t come back until I died&#x2026;
<br>But the bugs aren&#x2019;t even the worst part of this game...
<br>The worst part is its excuses&#x2026;
<br>Apparent from the beginning of this review, this team insisted I reminded you they&#x2019;re indie in my review&#x2026;
<br>and throughout the game they constantly remind you how little money they had to make this game through its creator audio collectibles&#x2026;
<br>it felt gross, like the team didn&#x2019;t believe in their own game&#x2026;
<br>Zombeer didn&#x2019;t blow me away, but it was still a mildly enjoyable quick adventure&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s a shame that its own creators have no faith in what they&#x2019;ve done with the little recourses they had&#x2026;
<br>Did I mention they didn&#x2019;t have a lot of money to make this game?
<br>Because they didn&#x2019;t.
<br>I give Zombeer
<br>a 4.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zombeer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7340616">Expand</a></span>
