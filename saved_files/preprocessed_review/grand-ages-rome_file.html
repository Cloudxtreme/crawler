But the missions themselves are the same. The multiplayer  from what I have seen has died off fairly fast. The only way to get a match is to auto find one which makes getting to play certain maps and match types impossible. Having more playable factions should be their next step when they either make an expansion for this game or create Grand Ages 2. Overall its a great game with good graphics, in-depth storyline, decent multiplayer when it first came out ( as said before somewhat dead now ), and a half decent combat system although outdated still offers some strategy and offers a good spectacle to watch when you play a 2v2 and each sides has a good amount of units. Overall its a good game any city-building fanatic should try, Not the best but certainly the best thing for this specific time period and settings so far. Price is a tad bit high though it should be lowered to 30$ in the US.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-ages-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=83787">Expand</a></span>

While this adds some standardisation and forces a high degree of planning it also leads to a crisis of space, with its micromanagement being central to the success of your city. Grand Ages: Rome unfortunately commits two city building sins. One it does not attempt to break out of this mould and your experience will therefore revolve around squeezing all your buildings as close together as possible. And two, it is a city building game about Rome, from which there are about a dozen to chose. It does have many positive points: Diverse array of buildings, an excellent campaign which is also historically accurate, detailed models, and a good combat system. The resource management is also very good, with the production of goods always being balanced by a reasonable the demand and the trade gives ample opportunity for monetary income. But in the end, your cities will always be highly restricted and specially constrained. If you&apos;re bored with Caesar IV and looking for something more historically accurate then Grand Ages Rome will be good for you but otherwise don&apos;t bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-ages-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150571">Expand</a></span>

The biggest thing that this game lacks is re-playability; when you first play it you can&apos;t get enough of it, but after you beat the campaign two or three times things just get really boring. Free build is a fun feature, but once again, after building a few dazzling cities, things just get boring and repetitive. The family system is nice, being able to get different perks depending on what family you are in, but other than making certain missions easier, it really has no effect on the course of the game. The combat system, although the units look nice, is really terrible as there are too few units, too overpowered special abilities, and no real strategy required. The multiplayer should just be completely ignored; there are few people who play it. The Reign of Augustus expansion adds little of value; the new campaign is far too brief. If the developers were to release a new game in this series, they would have to do a massive overhaul to get even a somewhat replayable game.  Great graphics, great voice acting, great idea - poor execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-ages-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=2522561">Expand</a></span>

The mechanics are pretty run of the mill but the execution is solid. Others have mentioned its good qualities, so let me go straight to the CONS/bad parts
<br>1) The Slave Market is wa overpowered or lets say ,it makes everything so much easier. U can run half of your city&apos;s production without any citizen maintenance issue. And we all know that the biggest challenge of City Builder Games are citizen maintenance. The game takes off the weight off your shoulders, quiet considerably.
<br>
<br>2) The combat. yes, it is more of an added bonus, but its pretty crappy. AI sucks, path finding issues are still not fixed even after 1.11 patch (latest) Troops can never navigate around a mountain, they just run straight to a wall and get stuck their. Unit selection is also crappy, like 20 years behind times. The enemies are plain dumb. If you rick click them with your army, they stop engaging their current target and come chasing at your army, even if your army is far away. Its like they have a CLICK detector in their helmets.  U can obliterate the entire army simply by spamming walls, and an cavalry group to keep right clicking the enemy to EXPLOIT their dumb AI
<br>
<br>3) The campaign is well laid out till mid game, where they start posing good challenges like a certain criteria or time limit needs to be met. However, towards the last 4-5 missions, those challenging aspects are taken away and it becomes very easy. Its like the devs thought -&quot;ok , you have reached a point where you have seen whatever we have to offer you, so just go have some sand-box like fun without any time limitation&quot;.. So it all ends up being boring, easy, tedious....In the 2nd last mission i just laid out my base in 5-10 mins and let  the game to run idle till i reach the 20,000 dinari target. BOOOORING....
<br>
<br>Still, a very good game, well above my expectations...seeing such bad reviews from Game sites and publications</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-ages-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985524">Expand</a></span>

When I found out the Tropico devs (Haemimont Games) had made a couple of similar games set in Roman times, I was intrigued. I&apos;ve now spent more time playing Imperium Romanum and Grand Ages: Rome than the Tropico series.
<br>
<br>First off, the graphics are phenomenal. No longer are city building games confined to the graphics of the past, yet apparently no one is familiar with this game, unlike say, the Caesar series. What an outcry! I can daydream for hours at the highly detailed art. This game does a truly amazing job at re-creating the Roman Empire, at least visually.
<br>
<br>People who say this is &quot;just another city building game&quot;... yeah, because so many city building games have a focus on actually planning out neighborhoods via small AoE radii... not. My experience with the &quot;just another city building game&quot; is carelessly throwing down a building wherever you have room. Grand Ages: Rome is WAY deeper than that. You can build poor neighborhoods, rich neighborhoods, mixed neighborhoods, and every kind of neighborhood has its own rewards and challenges to maintaining a high level of satisfaction. But you reviewers probably play the game for an hour at most and think you can somehow learn all the little nuances a game has in that time? Keep dreaming. You guys get paid to sell your own pathetic opinion, but truth is, in the eyes of a Simulation and City-Building game fan, this game is one of the greatest things to be released in the last five years.
<br>
<br>Shame is, most people who would like this game are going to miss out because of a) bad reviews and b) an idiot publisher that marketed it as a 4x game and not a city-builder.
<br>
<br>Definitely recommend trying it out if you enjoyed Tropico, however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-ages-rome/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944257">Expand</a></span>
