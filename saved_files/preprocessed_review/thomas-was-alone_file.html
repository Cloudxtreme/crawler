It&#x2019;s a joy to follow Chris, Claire and the other coloured rectangles through their journey of self-awareness and emotional discovery.
<br>At the beginning of the tale you meet Thomas, an observant and excited red rectangle who &#x2018;reverse falls&#x2019; around the levels. You then meet the next rectangle to join Thomas on his expedition called Chris who takes an immediate dislike to Thomas. The game continues chapter by chapter, all the while we meet new, differently coloured friends all with their unique size, shape and abilities but most importantly a unique personality. Thomas Was Alone truly excels at cramming these 4 sided shapes full of charm and character. With each level requiring each character using their individual superpower to help the team progress, the game carefully crafts a calm world built upon co-ordination and teamwork.
<br>As the characters move &#x201C;up and to the right&#x201D;, the relaxed ambience of the music sets a peaceful tone across the levels. At times I wanted to rush through the levels, but often I found myself having to take a breath and carefully plan my approach to a level. When I loaded up the game I would rush to grab my mouse and start the next level as fast as I could, but the tranquil music served as a reminder to simply sit back and play out the levels at my own pace. In addition to the soundtrack, the engaging and charismatic narration by Danny Wallace filled the shapes with identity and feeling. Thomas Was Alone playfully walks the line between simple and challenging, making for a rewarding experience when you hear a level conclude, only to be met with another level full of carefully placed pools of water and spikes.
<br>Sure the game is not perfect, the music sometimes harshly cut between levels and you could complete levels before the narration was finished. However, I often found myself waiting by the end of a level just to hear the end of the voice acting before progressing just so I could really get to know how the squares are feeling.
<br>In summary, Thomas Was Alone told a pleasant and charming tale which left me with a wide smile across my face as I sat and watched the credits roll. The emotional journey of the shapes made me laugh and feel so many more emotions than I would have ever expected from a game about rectangles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=7588644">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You control several blocks in a solid and fun puzzle-type game, but the developer did not stop there.  No, each block was given specific abilities, and a specific character.  The game quickly starts as &quot;Thomas was alone&quot; but quickly Thomas (the little red rectangle) has friends (other colourful blocky shapes), and the friends must help each other.  And on top of that, the game was also given a charming narration and story told simply and clearly by the wonderful voice actor Danny Wallace
<br>
<br>I have never before felt emotionally attached to little blocks.  And I&apos;m not the only one: If you watch online reviews, you will hear many reviewers getting emotional about the little rectangles, and calling them by name.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack sets the perfect mood, I found myself listening to it for long periods just enjoying it..  And as the game neared the finale, the music perfectly matches the mood.
<br>
<br>This is a master class in how the right soundtrack and voice acting can take a good game and make it magnificent.  Other, bigger budget titles, have much to learn from this small game.
<br>
<br>So stop reading this review and go buy Thomas Was Alone.  It is a masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=4043132">Expand</a></span>

<br>Why? Because they aren&apos;t just shapes. They&apos;re people. They&apos;re dreams. They&apos;re family that we all know and love. Goddamnit, if you haven&apos;t gotten this or played it yet, three dollars during the steam sale will not account for the amount of joy you&apos;ll get out of this.

Its a story about colourful rectangles but every one of them has personality. This game portraits rectangles as real human beings with human-like feelings. Its not just a game about rectangles. Its a game about friendship, bravery, love, and so much more </span>

<br>The game&apos;s characters are just filled with personality and the puzzles are fun and challanging. Only problem I encountered was that I thought the story dragged on too much, I think that after a certain part of the story, the could&apos;ve stopped and the rest truly should&apos;ve been a sequal OR they should&apos;ve named it chapter two and let the first part sink in.

The graphics are smooth and so is the storytelling but these factors alone does not make a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3942382">Expand</a></span>

Each character has different traits and, through excellent narration, very varied personalities.  All without any more distinguishing features than the lengths of their sides and their colours.
<br>
<br>This is surely the biggest success of the game - to make you care about a bunch of otherwise &quot;boring old&quot; shapes.
<br>
<br>Gameplay itself is a lot of fun.  A few tricky areas punctuate an otherwise simple selection of puzzles, each designed to introduce you to a new dynamic by way of a new character.  You will explore each of their interactions with each other and with the environment as you guide them to the goal.  They will need to work together to overcome the varied hazards in their way.
<br>
<br>The story grips you and urges you to push on to the end, with some clever twists throughout as the guys learn about the world around them and their place in it.
<br>
<br>Special mention should go to the soundtrack too - surely a masterpiece of atmosphere, perfectly finishing an all-round polished game.
<br>
<br>It should also be added that - judging by his comments on Twitter and the game&apos;s Steam forum, the developer is incredibly humble and proud of his achievement - as well he should be.  All in all this is a perfect example to support the argument that videogames ARE art.  This guy LOVES his creation, and made it for all the right reasons.

Although the game mechanics gets repetitive soon and the puzzle are honestly too easy for an average gamer, a really positive impression, definitely worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3053928">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll give it credit for being pretty to look at and modestly pleasant to listen to. Aside from that it&apos;s simply a really poor gaming experience. First of all, it&apos;s way, way too easy: I think I was only briefly challenged on maybe 5 levels. That leaves 95 that were a total breeze. Even if a solution to a particular puzzle is obvious you still have to waste time wrangling the imprecise controls and swapping between polygonal &quot;characters&quot; as you move them into position over and over again. Towards the end I even ran into a bug that got one block stuck. I had to restart the whole level and painstakingly move around 10 different blocks step by step into the correct spots.
<br>
<br>The less said about the &quot;story&quot; the better. The volume level of the narrator&apos;s voice fades in and out, making him hard to understand. The script&apos;s attempts at humanizing a bunch of polygons is laughable and fails miserably. The ending is a complete enigma, and not in a good way.
<br>
<br>In short, skip Thomas Was Alone unless you like games that are short, easy, buggy and generally irritating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3269009">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t work very well. Half way through the game, I gave up trying to figure out what the guy was saying and piece it all together. I was left with an extremely generic puzzle-platformer. Each puzzle is basically the same, you use the boxes to jump on each other in one order or another until you get to the end. It&apos;s boring and uninspiring. The graphics are very simple, just blocks and really no texture at all. The music is just ambiance playing in the background, which is easily the best part of the game. On top of it all, you&apos;re gonna be paying $10 for a 3-4 hour long game with no replay value whatsoever. It wasn&apos;t a bad game per se, just totally unoriginal and bland. Only diehard puzzle-platformer fans should think about giving this game a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3184721">Expand</a></span>

<br>Calling this a puzzle game would be stretching it, the puzzles are mostly switching between the various characters and jumping on them. This wouldn&apos;t be a problem except that the game forces you to repeat the same actions again and again. Keyboard control is terrible, particularly for jumping, I don&apos;t have a gamepad that the game supports.
<br>Graphics are very simple, which wasn&apos;t a problem for me as I was expecting that. Music is nice, in fact the music was the only thing that was well done in the game.
<br>If you want a puzzle platformer that is much much better than Thomas was alone, try Toki Tori, that one has inventive puzzles, no story but since when does a puzzle game need a story?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=2895748">Expand</a></span>

Sometimes it becomes repetitive, sometimes puzzles are too flat. But I gave it 9/10, because &quot;Thomas Was Alone&quot; shows how a story can be told IN the game, not FOR the game.</span>

<br>
<br>This is probably one of the more refreshing titles, similar to Limbo in my mind.  It is in it&apos;s own right a very beautiful game, ranging from background music, to the hilarious narration.  When you break it down, it&apos;s just blocks and it shows that fancy graphics don&apos;t always make for a good game.  Buy this game.</span>

Its great strength is how it uses game play to flesh out its characters and its narrative, something several reviewers have said that they have never experienced as well in a game. Several users have complained about the lack of challenge, but to my mind, the challenge is perfectly weighted. Some of the levels are genuinely intricate and require hard thought, but even in these the game never punishes you too hard for failure and so gives you a constant feeling of progression, even if you get stuck on a level for a while. This is NOT a puzzle game you play to test your mind; this is a puzzle game you play to test your emotions.
<br>
<br>The game reaches its dramatic high a little before it finishes, and occasionally the last few levels lack the enjoyment and wonder that the rest of the game brings, but Thomas Was Alone is still one of the best four hours you can spend playing a video game, and at &#xA3;5.99 is an absolute bargain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3083822">Expand</a></span>

<br>A roller Coaster of Emotion
<br>Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle platforming game
<br>The first half of the game really tugs on your heart strings as characters are being introduced,
<br>As youre getting smacked with real life metaphors, it just punches your right in the gut, but after the initial introductions the narration and story feels stale, leaving you with only the experience of the games world
<br>Disappointingly though there isn&#x2019;t too much to experience.
<br>The main objective to the game is to get each character to their shaped portal, you do this by simple platforming and team work.
<br>There are the occasional really neat levels, but for the most part they are bland, colorless, boring, and offer no challenge.
<br>I was flying through most of the game, it got really boring and tedious fast.
<br>The only thing that kept me going was my love for the story, I cared about these squares and rectangles,
<br>You are introduced to 7 initial characters that each have their own mechanic to them such as inversion, doubles jumps, and floating.. All feeling equally important to the overall level progression.
<br>But as I said earlier the story gets out of hand and feels jumbled by the 6th world out of 10.
<br>I was hoping it would pick back up again, but they felt the urge to introduce even more characters rather than give a satisfying ending or conclusion for the previous characters.
<br>There are 100 levels in total in Thomas was alone, 2 collectibles in each of the 10 worlds to find, and a cute story and idea,
<br>Id recommend a play through only to experience the narrative, who knows you may appreciate the 2nd half of the game, I personally didn&#x2019;t
<br>There isn&#x2019;t much actual game here though, no risk, no reward.
<br>You can get through most levels on aggressive instinct rather than sitting back and thinking.
<br>For what it is
<br>Puzzle Platformer 7/10

Firstly, it looks great the environment and characters are about as simple as you get now but it works and it&apos;s one of the few games which at any point you could take a screenshot and say &quot;wow&quot;. The level design is clever and gives you some interesting puzzles which work well with your ability to switch characters and compensate for some of their flaws. The main part of the game has got to be the story, every character has their own issues and personality which make you become attached to them, all of them go through some amazing character development. The plot itself is interesting and is used to enhance the character development and immerse the player further, narrated by a voice that challenges Morgan Freeman: it doesn&apos;t get much better. The one flaw with the game is it&apos;s very short taking only 2 hours or so to complete, however, it&apos;s not surprising considering it&apos;s an independent game and it&apos;s forgiven through its amazing characters whom I will never forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3502891">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is well designed, but experienced players won&apos;t find too much of a challenge. I was able to beat this game with all achievements in under 4 hours. The graphics are really simple, but the aesthetic is nice enough. The music is very nice, and the narration is entertaining.
<br>
<br>This is a neat little indie game, and it was worth the time I invested. I do think the game was a little overhyped from I saw, though... this game is good and it&apos;s worth playing, but it&apos;s not a masterpiece. It&apos;s priced at $10, and I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth it, but I&apos;d personally wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3189633">Expand</a></span>

Like many people are saying, this game is not at all challenging, the puzzles are quite easy once you learn the core mechanics as each puzzle somewhat follows the same structure as a previous level you may have already completed. So why would I give this game a 10 out of 10? Because not only was this a game I can sit down, play and enjoy after a stressful tiresome day, but narration and story helps push this game to be one of the greatest indie games I have ever played, the story is beyond charming, although it may not have made me burst out laughing, the humor allowed me to smile as I appreciated each joke, each tale, each character. If you want an action packed exploding difficult puzzle game, this is definitely not for you. If you are someone who wants to play a relaxing game with a beautiful soundtrack which is perfectly integrated into the game with beautiful characters then this is 100% for you. Please do not be put of because the characters are mere shapes, these characters have more personality than many triple A titles I have played. This game is worth the support, and I want to thank whoever made this game a million times. Just beautiful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3485289">Expand</a></span>

Thomas Was Alone is not so much about challenging puzzles or platforming as it is about putting a smile on your face.  While the idea and graphics were simple, having various shapes and sizes to use to get from the beginning of a level to the end, what stood out is that the narration gave each block it&apos;s own personality, ans at one point or another these personalities were used to create fun little stories about the interactions between each block.
<br>This narration is obviously the highest point of the game to me, as sitting along side the music and sound effects create such a relaxing atmosphere.  However the platforming and puzzle salving themselves have yet to be very much of a challenge (granted, I&apos;m not too far into the game as I write this).  At a few points the puzzles even can become a little off-putting, as you will have to repeat certain patterns  with the blocks over and over in order to, say, climb a stair case.
<br>So while the game play may not have me squinting at my screen in contemplation like Braid had,  the atmosphere, story (if you could call it that), and the easiness of the controls makes the game into a very relaxing, light-hearted experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3131978">Expand</a></span>

You play as a series of rectangular blocks that serve as the avatars of AIs. Your mission? To escape the simulation your characters find themselves in. The writing and the narration is great, and you actually feel fairly attached to the little cubeoids fairly quickly due to how well personalized they were.
<br>
<br>The puzzles themselves are all fairly well designed, and they do a good job at making them fun to solve without being far too easy or impossibly hard. You even use the characters themselves to form stairs and the like for some sections. There are occasional points where you realize you have to backtrack a character due to needing them to move some other character, and while this is annoying, you usually feel as though its your own fault for failing to notice something rather than the game being tricky about you.
<br>
<br>My only other complaint is that the ending feels a bit weak to me, but the rest of the game more than makes up for it. Thomas Was Alone is definitely worth a playthrough!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201203">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only downsides to the game are the difficulty is pretty low. Not once did I get stuck and have to rethink things in order to continue. Also, it&apos;s is quite short. DLC would benefit this hugely, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s something that will happen unfortunately. DLC adding harder puzzles and new abilities would make this replayable. As it stands, once you&apos;re done... there is little to bring you back.
<br>
<br>I think those who review this badly are missing the point of the game. If you want good graphics and an in depth plot, go play Alan Wake or something. This is a puzzle platformer Indie game, and I think it was awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3232787">Expand</a></span>

It also gets a little frustrating at times finding the correct block you need when there is a lot of them to keep track of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3246605">Expand</a></span>

The puzzle aspect is fun and adds some game play into the game which is more than i can say for the walking dead&apos;s quick time events. The puzzles can get in the way towards the end as you try to complete the compelling story. A brilliant game that is well worth the money.</span>

This game really shows how minimalist graphics produces awesome storytelling and ambiance, as well as make you focus on the actual puzzles. The music is also wonderfully composed in this title. Anyone who can pick up on patterns and solve puzzles fairly quickly can easily finish this game in about 4 hours. Though it does have a lasting impression on you when you figure out the story and is a very satisfying experience. Despite the short game span, it is well worth the 10 dollars (although I would recommend the developer to cut off a few dollars). Perfect example of how indie games pack a whole new experience to the average gamer. I give it an 8/10 for its compelling story, unique mechanics, beautiful yet simple graphics, and its awesome ambient soundtrack.
<br>Note: To any of you Portal 2 fans, the voice actor of Wheatley is the narrator throughout the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295845">Expand</a></span>

<br>Some people might find it too easy, and I agree, but still, the experience is extremely refreshing. The soundtrack is nice and soothing, the narrator sound great, the controls are tight, and the story is pretty engaging.
<br>
<br>On the downside, the ending is a little bit anti-climactic, and hardcore puzzle gamers will find it way too easy.
<br>
<br>Other than that, a simply charming and endearing title, a must have for the indie games lovers </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3445571">Expand</a></span>

Like when Copernicus showed everyone the Earth revolved around the Sun. This game is similar.
<br>
<br>The main highlight in this game does not lie in its gameplay, although it does have tight controls and interesting puzzles that keep you interested. Thomas Was Alone achieves the score it has achieved because of the remarkable storytelling, and how a simple narration by a splendid voice actor can give birth to so many three-dimensional characters that you genuinely care about as you&apos;re taken through the story. It&apos;s truly an experience to have and one you won&apos;t forget.
<br>
<br>But, like any revelation, if you tell anyone that the Earth revolves around the Sun today, it won&apos;t blow their mind again. At most, it may remind us of how grateful we are that we&apos;ve evolved beyond that. Point is that the replay value in this game is kind of slim. It is a little fun to return back and say hello to the characters you&apos;ve been introduced to once again and maybe try to grab some secrets you missed on the first run around, but it&apos;s not something that&apos;ll have you hooked forever.
<br>
<br>Bottom Line: Thomas Was Alone is a game you can really sink your teeth into if you love stories and character development. It won&apos;t retain replayability, but it still gets a recommendation for the wonderful experience your first time around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3505351">Expand</a></span>

When these two elements combine so well as they have in this game, it puts many triple A games to shame. Graphics wise, the game uses a minimalist style with squares and rectangles to represent the playable characters, but this is in no way a bad thing. The art style is pleasant and charming and colorful. With narration by Danny Wallace (who won a BAFTA for this role), the squares and rectangles become more than just shapes. They feel like actual human beings, that you actually care about. When a game can make me care more about simplistic shapes than fully animated humans in say Battlefield, then that game has done something right. While its a short game, you will laugh, cry, and feel a profound warmth and satisfaction when its over. I love this game. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=3514057">Expand</a></span>

Although the puzzles are rather simple, the story left me cringing, although it was just a bit misleading.

<br>
<br>You&apos;ll start out as Thomas, a curious red rectangle which is meant to represent a rogue bit of AI. As you progress through the levels, a smooth voice will narrate what Thomas&apos; thoughts and surroundings are, giving a relaxing feel of someone just roaming about, guided by a sense of curiosity. Gradually, you&apos;ll meet (and be able to play as) many different characters, all personified with names.
<br>
<br>It is the interactions of these shapes, told solely through the narrator, that gives this game heart. Who&apos;d have thought that you could be rapt in the interactions of such simple quadrilateral and monochromatic shapes? They all seem to represent a different mental state; Thomas, the optimistic observer; John, the love-struck grump; and Laura, the cautious outsider, to name a few.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also pretty funny at times, with humour that sometimes breaks the fourth wall.
<br>
<br>Soundtracks are incredibly important to me, as a great one can ensure you&apos;re fully immersed in the game, putting in as much emotional investment as you can. Gladly, Thomas Was Alone perfectly captures an environment that ranges from the serene, to the fast-paced. Apt music at every stage.
<br>
<br>For the completionist, there&apos;s also additional challenges, mostly involving reaching difficult places, that can squeeze a bit of replay-ability out of you. Unfortunately, once you&apos;ve had one play-through, there&apos;s not much else cause to boot it up again.
<br>
<br>That being said, it is a game that must exist in your Library, because what it does, it does extremely well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909047">Expand</a></span>

Some games like LIMBO have lost their charm with age as all the things that have made LIMBO great are now typical and lackluster. Does Thomas Was Alone suffer a similar fate? Should you care to give this game a look?
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>
<br>Without going into much detail, the plot of the game is simply about a group of AIs gaining sentience and dreaming of the outside world (ours). If you want to know what happens throughout the game you must pay attention to the dialogue and the introduction texts at each chapter. Similar to the art style, the game&apos;s narrative is also minimalistic and the ending will leave you lacking if you aren&apos;t interested in piecing together the story. So keep an ear open while you play and you&apos;ll get the gist of this game.
<br>
<br>Even though the theme of the game is about friendship, it&apos;s not that PC, watered down, benign view of friendship we get in Carebears or something for kids. This game handles friendship as it should be handled; friends squabble with one another about petty stuff, they form bonds in mutual gains for each other, they learn a little about themselves with time and, eventually, they help one another because they want to help their friends, not simply for personal gain. This is the reason why I think many people enjoy the storytelling of a few blocks because the game handles the subject of friendship quite accurately to people you may encounter everyday, and lets you imagine what might those AIs look like as your friends.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>
<br>Calling this game a puzzle-platformer is a bit generous. The puzzles tend to be simple problems for the first few chapters, and until you get four or five blocks (chapter 3 out of 9) the game stays monotonous in getting Chris over every obstacle. The obstacle is simply getting the weakest block over to the end, and then getting everyone else in their spots. Up until the last chapter (excluding the DLC chapters), you have seven characters that have abilities (or lack thereof) that suit each personality.
<br>
<br>Some levels offer multiple paths such as jumping on small blocks that hang off an edge without getting the larger blocks involved. For the most part, each level has one and only one solution. There are some levels that test more of your reflexes rather than your puzzle skills, but it&apos;s nothing too difficulty for any age to figure out. The only skill that might not be intuitive is using James and Thomas together; one has reverse-gravity while the other has a basic jump, and you can put these two together to move in the air without platforms. It takes a little practice to get use to that trick that&apos;s used in two levels.
<br>
<br>One criticism I have with the game mechanics is the lack of momentum in certain situations. Some of the bigger blocks can carry the other blocks on top of each other, and as you move forward you would think the other character would try to stay above your character. This doesn&apos;t happen. The character just falls from where it is and you have to wait for the block to stay still before you can move on. Falling into water and Laura&apos;s trampoline ability are the only instances where this becomes noticeable. But it&apos;s a small thing that could&apos;ve been fixed for better gameplay.
<br>
<br>As much as this game may be easy, it&apos;s decent in its execution. The game is only around 3 hours if you know what you&apos;re doing (with the DLC included). If you want to play a dumb-puzzle platformer to relax for a few hours, this game&apos;s difficulty spikes up a little bit better towards the latter half of the game. I never felt bored, but maybe you were expecting something more challenging. If the narrative or the delivery of the dialogue doesn&apos;t interest you like Portal, then I would recommend this game for you.
<br>
<br>The DLC adds two prequel chapters of Benjamin, Anna and, one character you later meet, Sarah. Story-wise, it&apos;s okay; it&apos;s a sad, small tale that was referenced in the main-game but it&apos;s sad it watch it unfold when you know what will happen, especially with the game&apos;s gorgeous soundtrack. Gameplay-wise, the jetpack adds more annoyances with the controls than any other character and some levels are infuriating to get through because of the delay of the jetpack.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>I think years from now this game will still remain a gem for many gamers. The mechanics might be too simple for some, but the presentation keeps the game as charming as it was years ago when I first listened to Thomas&apos;s ramblings. With Steam&apos;s new refund policy, I would encourage players who were hesitant before to now give the game a try. Maybe on a 50% sale at the least for the amount of gameplay you get from this game, but the game is worth your time for a thought-provoking, charming little tale of a group of quadrilaterals. So don&apos;t be such a square.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5469643">Expand</a></span>

It has a beautiful, atmospheric feel all throughout the whole experience, and I was fascinated at how well the game mechanics conveyed a story. It takes some skillful game design to get a player emotionally invested in the fate of little rectangles. And this game succeeds at that.
<br>
<br>As has been said in other reviews, this isn&apos;t an extremely complex or even difficult puzzle game. It&apos;s more like a favourite book or movie that you come back to once in a while, to enjoy the story time and again. I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/thomas-was-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=7422290">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I liked this game quite much, it&apos;s fun and simple, but it gets kind of deep. I don&apos;t know how a game about boxes can get deep, but i felt that the different boxes grew on me x) I spent a lot of time in this game, i explored, tried to get the achievements, but i gave up. it&apos;s worth a play.</span>

The story and characters are also supported by a good set of puzzles that keep the entire experience both entertaining and interesting throughout. Also, one of the best soundtracks I&apos;ve heard in a while!</span>
