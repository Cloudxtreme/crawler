The campaign is long and challenging, which is good, excluding the Scrin campaign which was only 4 missions. While playing through the campaign you are presented with HD cinematics (before, after and during missions) which are fairly cheesy and unconvincing, however, it&apos;s better then nothing. The graphics, although not perfect, are very nice. In addition to the graphics is the neat sound design which is usually overlooked, so I suggest pumping up the volume. Balance wise, the game seems to be almost balance in patch 1.09, except for a few units, so if you&apos;re playing still with pre-1.09, I highly suggest you download the patch because it changes several major gameplay mechanics such as the economy which cutsdown &quot;spamming&quot; by a lot. Bottom line, if you have ever liked any C&amp;C game, or you like RTS games in general, then I highly suggest you buy this because your missing out on a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=410963">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion, the game was prematurely released but I&apos;m sure patches would solve many problems. My system can handle the game perfectly fine and it is honestly quite different from the previous C&amp;C games (in terms of gameplay) because of many brave new implements and greatly improved coding(Lag is minimal. Very very smooth gameplay). Overall, its amazingly fun but the fact that there are problems that significantly affect the gaming experience(I read in the forums about many people with problems), it doesn&apos;t get a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=397023">Expand</a></span>

Besides Starcraft 2, there haven&apos;t been many big players entering the &apos;real time strategy&apos; genre lately, and Tiberium Wars holds up very well.<br>Gameplay: C&amp;C3:Tiberium Wars is very fast paced. If you&apos;re playing on easy you&apos;ll be wondering why some of the units are so much more powerful than the others, and think it unfair; but playing against a difficult computer or player you&apos;ll find that there is usually no time or money to get to the bigger units, for better or for worse.<br>Visual: In my personal opinion, I think the art and unit designs are great. The factions look like they should (GDI: Very professional, military-like, NOD: Sci-fi&apos;ish, SCRIN: Buglike alien). The engine though hasn&apos;t held up very well, though on some maps (with particular lighting) the game looks just as good as anything released today, but the majority of the maps showcase a game that is only decent looking by today&apos;s standards.<br>Single/Multiplayer: The single player is great, with many missions for each faction and live action scenes between each mission. I haven&apos;t played online, but I have played LAN a few times, which was pretty fun but we did experience synch issues a few times, and the game just wasn&apos;t as fun on multiplayer as it&apos;s predecessor, C&amp;C:Generals.<br>Overall: It&apos;s a great game, and if you&apos;re a fan of the genre it&apos;s a great buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1787682">Expand</a></span>

I highly recommend this game to any and all strategy game fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2209668">Expand</a></span>

Its really awesome and i would just love to see that in more games. Anyways something that could be even better would be EA finally giving the budget to a decent team and stop letting the C&amp;C franchise from going down the sewer with mediocre games.</span>

I did enjoy the HD videos (Kane Rox) but the gameplay was extremely ordinary, it was fast and responsive but I think they forgot the FUN part.

The game was clearly designed for the soul purpose of shooting for the lowest common denominator. The game is just pure shallow, they even removed the intense micro CnC was known for and made it all automatic, you just can&apos;t do that in a small scale 10 unit a faction a game. On top of all this the balance is horrid, the Mammoth completely obliterates anything, compare it to the NOD&apos;s Avatar it is crap, the Avatar when fully upgraded costs more then twice the price of a fully upgraded Mammoth and it&apos;s weaker then the Mammoth and doesn&apos;t have anti air! The Mammoth basically then owns all tanks, owns infantry, with the rail it makes infantry entirely pointless and it owns most of the air AND THIS IS A TANK YOU CAN GET A FEW MINUTES INTO THE GAME?!?! All these factors come together to make CnC 3 literally the most shallow RTS game ever made and don&apos;t think the balance will be fixed in the final oh no they already are finished with the game and are working on it&apos;s first patch which likely won&apos;t come out for months and will end up making things worse then they are. I didn&apos;t think RTS games could be made so casual and just so wrong on so many levels. The game is complete trash really, they took a step back from the intense micro of Generals back to 1 unit tank spam. The game has a nice old novelty to it at first, but once you dig in you get hands full of crap. The game was clearly dumbed down for the console version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=396158">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>EA should learn that high production values =/= fun gameplay. The cutscenes with Kane and Michael Ironside are cool, but that gameplay itself is tired; we&apos;ve all played it before. The RTS genre innovates at a snail&apos;s pace; C&amp;C3 shows why. If you&apos;ve been spoiled by SupComm and CoH, save your money.</span>

C&amp;C 3 is a shining example of mundane game-play wrapped in a pretty package. No wonder why the reviewers like it.</span>

I guess if you consider clicking really quick a sport than C&amp;C 3 might fit the bill. Can I get my money back please? Pretty graphics can only cover up so much.

<br> Quite buggy too, many times tanks and especially harvesters will clip, sometimes even crashing completely. (don&apos;t tell me its my rig cause I have 6600e core duo, 2 gigs, 2 7900GTs in SLI).
<br>
<br>Single player is the same as the old CNC games (stop the rocket from launching with Kane sending corny &quot;you&apos;ll never stop me&quot; messages is just old).
<br>
<br>How much CNC nostalgia can you have? Well apparently EA thinks you have quite a lot.
<br>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they start a CNC2008, CNC2009 etc series since the Fanboys will buy.

Like a ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME. That is why this sucks as soon as you relise this. This really disappointed me because I was expecting a really balanced game.</span>

The storyline feels forced, the FMVs are painful to watch; gameplay feels incredibly generic, and the fact that there is no innovation whatsoever makes for an utterly forgettable game.</span>

So I never knew that the Red Alert Franchise (prequel) was released after the sequel.... And then remade with tiberium and all that stuff. I liked the original Red Alert 2, I never bothered the campaign since I just liked going to war and having like 30 factions battle on the map. Was some crazy stuff. Red Alert 3 only had 3 factions which was like 1/10 of red alert 2. As for this game, didn&apos;t meet up to my expectations at all. Maybe because it said it was newer on Steam then RA, so that maybe it&apos;d be better, and they&apos;d just keep improving. Main things that bothered me:
<br>
<br>The **** user interface, the menu is confusing as **** with all these modes and it&apos;s like dark blue.
<br>
<br>The Babes, this ticked me off right at the beginning,  I was expecting it to be like RA 3, the point of going to war is so that when you end the war, you have babes to return to., there are like no babes in this game.
<br>
<br>The in-game user interface, they switched all the buttons, why the **** would they do that.
<br>
<br>The graphics, how does a newer game have more horrible graphics than an older game. First of all, no explosions, yea things explode on airstrike, but guess what. You can airstrike a wooden house, and it won&apos;t explode. It plays the sound effect and then it sinks into the ground. WTF. Also, the reason RA didn&apos;t let you zoom all the way in to see your troops were to not show the low-rez landscape. When you zoom in to your troops now in squads (1 squad can contain like 5 people),  the background looks like a solid crap color.
<br>
<br>I look for gameplay over graphics, but the gameplay is extremely repetitive.
<br>
<br>They used crappy colors for the user interface, everything seems so damp, so I guess it&apos;s like an apocolyptic situation where some dude called Kain is trying to **** with everybody and your base is like under a rock doing research. Man, they needa continue the red alert series, I liked those graphics, gameplay, explosions ftw, music, babes, everything about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574114">Expand</a></span>

The single-player campaign is unbelievable with all of the live action cutscenese (it&apos;s soooo damn cool having Michael Ironside and Boomer from Battlestar Gallactica telling me what to do, not to mention LANDO from STARWARS!!!) EA definitely pulled out all the stops and made this title worthy of the name Command &amp; Conquer!</span>

GDI has a mobile battle base which can repair tanks and vehicles. They must have forgot to give NOD a mobile repair vehicle which is sad. The Avatar (NOD&apos;s heavy unit) is awesome but is way to expensive and time consuming to upgrade and doesn&apos;t even come close to the Mammoth tanks cheaper raw power. Well enough of my balance rant! This game is definitely great for all the Command and Conquer fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=396949">Expand</a></span>

It takes the RTS genre to a whole new level in entertainment for me, just the right amount of units and with only three sides the battles never stay the same but never get overly complicated. In my opinion, this is the best RTS ever.</span>

Sure, there are no innovations as in WCIII, but this game was made to give back CnC to the fans after the rather untypical and generic Generals. The campaign is very diversive, and great fun, the graphics effectladen and still well performing, the engine itself very stable. The atmosphere and feel is just adorable, like the wonderful units and buildings, the main idea, the cheesy cutscenes, the military drill, the strategical options, the fast paced action etc.
<br>We should not forget what CnC and Dune did for this genre. For Red Alert 3 tough, there have to be innovations, regardless how they mastered and slicked what we loved about the old CnC games. That everyone gives the series the credit it deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=63208">Expand</a></span>

I was hopeing for better graphics than this the units fail the terrain is nice. Overly the Single player is a little depressing it doesn&apos;t grab me like previous storylines but the FMV is great and I look forward to them Kane is godlike again but NOD are owned far to easy. The scale of the maps is pitiful and at times restrictive. Now that we have games like Supreme commander that show what a modern PC can do with 80kmx80km maps its annoying ti find this Generals Update so limited. Its still got the cracking multiplayer aspect though which is fast paced but I still find my self turning it off and going back to RA2 for the multiplayer. Great for a pick up put down game but its no stayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=397055">Expand</a></span>

<br>To Ham &amp; Cheese Beef: My guess is, from your review that you dont have a high end pc and are jealous of those who do. As for calling the game dated, you clearly dont understand the concept of RTS if you call the game dated. Gameplay in RTS is almost always the same. EA move on from RTS? thats an insult to gamers, EA and Cnc fans alike.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Not a review, just a response to some stupid reviews.

EA move on from RTS? thats an insult to gamers, EA and Cnc fans alike. CnC is an RTS classic, and EA have done a great job keeping it going, refer to Generals and now Tiberium Wars. I&apos;d say its time for YOU to leave RTS.
<br>To Peter G: Horrible console tailored interface??? Your kidding right? any gamer knows that the main platform for RTSes is PCs. The challenge is to make an RTS on a console, because its difficult to make an interface for consoles. So you&apos;ve got the story the other way around man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=62758">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll play it but supreme commander is still the king of the RTS games.</span>

Its not even only bugs that screw up the gameplay, like not getting unlockables no matter how 100% you play through the game, or not getting the right end sequence of the game while replaying the last mission all over again for it. Sadly there are even exploits too that can be used in multiplayer part of the game, like mothership + buzzers + wormhole = instant boom of half the enemy base or army. Well and even besides the bugs and exploits this game is just plain boring too often. GDI singleplayer gameplay is like massing mammoth tanks and firehawks as much and as often as possible. Right now iam done with gdi campaign and didnt go on playing the nod campain for like 2 weeks, since it is too boring, looks more like work than fun and it feels like there is nothing really new too see there anyways. Multiplayer mode of this game is like 3 - 10 minutes of rushing in like 90% of the games. No 45 or 60 minutes long matches like you see between some starcraft gosus, no 3-5 side bases, no parallel attacks with different unit types on different locations of the map. It is all much more straight forward rushing and with less potential than other games. Since the overall presentation of the game with its actors and videos is ok and some units feel pretty cool (some sadly feel a bit overdone) in the beginning, this game still gets 5/10. Maybe 7.5/10 or something like that when the game is fully patched and ea releases some totally free content upgrades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=397544">Expand</a></span>

With so so many online problems I&apos;ve had with it, I just can&apos;t justify giving it a higher rating than 7, even though the Campaign on the whole is brilliant and my only complaint is that the Scrin campaign left much to be desired.</span>

The gameplay will have you mass spamming a select one or two types of units and hurling them at the enemy. The game lacks any type of strategic depth, despite the introducion of things like directional armour. Spamming and rushing with your vanguard units are the order of the day and ultimately doesn&apos;t amount to much more than a refinement of 90&apos;s RTS mechanics. Even tech buildings, while sometimes worth capturing, are fairly uninspired. If you enjoyed the previous games I guess this is worth playing, even if it&apos;s trying to seel you repackaged 90s gaming. Be warned though, if you liked the GDI/NOD story and expect this to be a faithful successor to Tiberian Sun, you can forget about it. You can literally count on a few fingers the number of elements that survived from TibSun. CNC3 feels more like a regressive sequel to Tiberian Dawn than anything else. The bottomline: if it wasn&apos;t for the weight of the CNC name, the polished graphics, marketing and the general big-budget extravaganza in its production, Tiberium Wars would attract the score it really deserves - which is 60-70%.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=409583">Expand</a></span>

The campaign was true to form of previous C&amp;C games set in the tiberium universe. The storyline was great, the mission gameplay was great. The FMV and CG scenes left a little to be desired, but were also quite good. Skirmish play is excellent. There are different difficulty levels that your AI opponents or allies can be set at. They can also be set to use different play styles. The multiplayer portion, while lackluster during the first few months of release, has been fine-tuned and is now very enjoyable. It&apos;s funny what 9 patches will do to a game :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=407175">Expand</a></span>

I suppose that there&apos;s some logic in providing an RTS games that more lower-end PCs can run smoothly but overall, this game just feels too &apos;meh&apos;. The whole fast-paced rush-rush gameplay is no longer as fun as it was in the dawn of the genre and the game brings no new innovations and actually foists off some clunky User Interface designs that actually make the game less user-friendly that some older games in its category. Just an average game all-around. Don&apos;t fall for the hype, buy Supreme Commander or Company of Heroes, or even Medieval 2 before you pick up this throwback game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=396593">Expand</a></span>

Its really sad to see games that have come out and with this quility beating so many new games. I thisnk if more put the investment and look as they have with this one. This game would have been ignored. Old theme just redone. Its still fun but gets old fast....build allot of med tanks and RUSH RUSH...they still cant fix that with something like 5 min wait time or ubder base defenses that would eleminate the rushers....but that mot why for my vote. Its just the same sage repackaged...last about a week of fun then its repeat, repeat, to the point its too boring. There so much more that could be done with this on a multiplayer side then the limited way its setup.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=399012">Expand</a></span>

There are 3 factions to choose from, each of which are very well structured, yet still have their unique advantages and disadvantages. This balances the gameplay beautifully. Many RTS games have very complex gameplay mechanics, which often turns off newcomers of the genre. The gameplay in Tiberium Wars is very easy to grasp and the customizable AI gives you a fun, comfortable learning curve, but there is a downside to this feature. Tiberium Wars lacks any innovative RTS features and doesn&#x2019;t bring anything new to the table. In addition, the limited amount of custom maps restricts the fun Tiberium Wars has to offer in skirmish mode. Fortunately, these imperfections are easily overlooked with its incredibly satisfying gameplay that deserves the attention of any RTS fan or gamers new to the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=3124864">Expand</a></span>

Also no awesome soundtrack by Frank Klepacki  but they did bring on Steve Jablonksy.</span>

I don&apos;t know much about balance and I wouldn&apos;t exactly call the game very tactical, but I can say I was so addicted to this game for a few months that I started seeing buzzer swarms everywhere. The single player campaigns are fun, the missions are varied, the story is surprisingly interesting. I think this is the only RTS game where I&apos;ve given a crap about the story. Kane is just awesome. I played the skirmishes so much I played them in my sleep. My only complains were that it lacks a good sound track and most of the environments kinda look the same after a while, but the expansion fixes the environment part. If you like this game, I&apos;d definitely recommend the expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2520385">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer side of this game was very good, and i got to rank number 1 in this game for 1v1 and the expansion when the games were released.</span>

This is truly a treat with the campaign being decent, but challenging even on the hard difficulty for people like me who play love the dying genera. This Uber late analysis of the game spawned from me coming back to this game in 2015, which really is rare thing for me to do with a C&amp;C game. I beating the campaign that I cannot talk about due to spoilers because it was a interesting twist. I highly recommend staying away from skirmish or multi-player until you beaten either the Nod Campaign or GDI Campaign just to make the experience a little more authentic. This game is so good that the only reason it is not a nine is because one of the factions is slightly more overpowered over the rest, even if it feels like they deserved this OP nature considering where they came from.
<br>
<br>I recommend playing previous C&amp;C games and avoid any C&amp;C game released after this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-3-tiberium-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5050420">Expand</a></span>
