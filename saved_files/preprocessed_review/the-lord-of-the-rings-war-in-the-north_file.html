They&apos;ve left their mark on the gaming industry. Kudos to you Snowblind, this really is a nice gem. War in the North brings a 3 person co-op style of gameplay. The players have a choice between three different characters. Each with three skill trees and a multiple number of abilities. All three characters can either go melee or ranged during combat. Primarily there&apos;s two basic defensive moves, block and dodge. There&apos;s other abilities that can further defense. The games merits rely on the charming Tolkien lore which only enhances a unique and plausible storyline. Warner Brother&apos;s has really done a excellent job with expanding Tolkien&apos;s universe in various media outlets. Artwork is amazing, the plain fluid motion of the camera is flawless. Middle-Earth is painted with a darker brush, there&apos;s a gritty and grainy feel to the game. My only peeve with the game is that the two hardest difficulty settings aren&apos;t unlocked until completion of a play-through.<br><br>Snowblind studios delivered easily a worthy pickup both on consoles and PC. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=1825113">Expand</a></span>

It is a co-op action RPG. That said, it should be obvious that as far as RPG elements go, it has limited skill trees where skill points basically distribute themselves, conversations rarely lead to anything past the linear story&apos;s progression. Characters, once again, pre-made in a game with minimal character development with very little customization options. Story, while riddled with cliches and not worthy of a LotR game, will not bother you as you will probably largely ignore it. Gameplay comes down to a handful of powers that each character has, which get underused due to ridiculously slow mana regeneration and button mashing. All there is in the game is left clicking for light attack, as well as a heavy attack that is only used for executions on weakened enemies, since it&apos;s twice slower and does twice the damage of a light attack, but requiring better timing and thus being useless. Graphics are decent, but with bland and forgettable environments.Voiceovers are done well, with several familiar voice actors. The game is very unstable, I have not been able to have it running for more than an hour without it crashing. Ultimately, your experience will rely on: whether you like LotR, with whom you are playing and how much you are playing. I am a big LotR fan, played alone for about an hour a day and would&apos;ve probably finished it, had I not been stopped by crashes and bugs at Carn Dum.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881105">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One negative I&apos;ve read about, are the zombie like facial movements (or lack thereof) of some of the characters you meet in Rivendell, I have to agree with this, and it bothered me a little. Strangly I only felt like the facial animations lacked in Rivendell, in the rest of the world they were fine.
<br>
<br>I loved the amount of gear you could find, and that you really had a choice in equiping it: it differed enough to make it an interesting trade off, between for example damage and magical effects (of the item).
<br>
<br>I loved it, and will probably do another play through as a mage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2921567">Expand</a></span>

Everything is pretty well tied to the lore, beyond the game-y elements however. The story is typical &quot;Save the world&quot; as your heroes gain strength to stop the titular &quot;War in the North&quot;. Dialogue is pretty well crafted and there are side quests to do that will give you extra experience and money to spend. The combat is usually fast and frantic, with you and your allies able to lay out the pain but still able to lose if you don&apos;t keep your head. However, some enemies are just health sinks, taking minutes worth of combo&apos;s to down even with your most powerful techniques. They are thankfully few of these moments for the most part. The trolls however are the biggest perpetrators of this crime.
<br>
<br>The game has co-op and single play, with up to three selectable characters. The hardy Dwarf Warrior that can act as the parties tank or melee monster, a Dunedain Ranger that mostly is the ranged support but can also mix it up in melee just fine with the right skills and the Elven Loremaster who acts as the support caster and healer, with a few &quot;nuke&quot; like spells to help deal with crowds. However the game has a very odd way of handling character switching; everyone shares an inventory pool but do NOT give any items to your CPU allies, as it&apos;ll be lost forever. To that note, your CPU allies equip their own gear and it&apos;s separate for ever variation. If you play the Dwarf through, your Ranger and Loremaster will have their own gear. Switch over to the Ranger, and your Dwarf and Loremaster will have different gear depending on what they&apos;ve found and the same if you play as the Loremaster.
<br>
<br>As for difficulty, it&apos;s fairly standard progressing onward to the final boss, but there are some parts that are downright impossible without human companions(a defense mission on the hardest difficulty comes to mind) but beyond that it&apos;s a fairly by the numbers hack and slash action RPG.
<br>
<br>In ending, if you have any love for the land of Middle-Earth and want to wander some of the more known environments of it in the shoes of the brave and bold warriors of the land, give this a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3732436">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Dated graphics
<br>- Poorly optimized PC port
<br>- Uninspired voice acting
<br>- Cardboard characters with little personality
<br>- Generally poor plot progression and writing
<br>- Mediocre soundtrack and sound effects; sound design in general is poor
<br>
<br>Pro/Cons:
<br>+/- Bare Bones RPG system, though it is appreciated and adds much needed depth and progression
<br>+/- Fast paced, yet repetitive combat that is only satisfying during executions and some abilities
<br>+/- Online mode yet seems to be plagued with connection issues, the developer&apos;s effort is still appreciated
<br>+/- The difficulty is challenging, but at times frustrating. Your AI partners will often neglect coming to your aid, costing you your life. This doesn&apos;t become an issue until the latter half, with the majority of the game&apos;s first half being quite easy.
<br>
<br>Summary: A standard hack n&apos; slash that is very contrived yet manages to be entertaining. Nothing about this game is unique, organic or original, it is very much a cookie cutter action rpg and not a very good one at that.
<br>
<br>Who should buy this game:
<br>*Hardcore Tolkien/Lord of the Rings fans
<br>*Those seeking a cooperative console game to play with friends
<br>*If it&apos;s on a bargain of 10$ or less, it&apos;s a steal, especially if you meet one of the two above criterias
<br>
<br>Who shouldn&apos;t buy this game:
<br>*PC gamers looking for a cooperative experience: online mode is buggy and local play is not available
<br>*Those looking to buy at full price, it&apos;s not worth it
<br>*Anyone who wants to play an above average action rpg
<br>
<br>6.5
<br>7.5 if playing co-op and 8 if playing co-op whilst drunk</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3766216">Expand</a></span>

<br>The locations, graphics.
<br>The battles, I like the simple skills and the easy key mapping. I can manage my weapons well.
<br>I love the armours.
<br>I love the mirror you can change your hairstyle and face features etc whenver you like.
<br>Simple potion making and upgrading armours is nice.
<br>
<br>The Not so good
<br>The check point system, no way to load a previous save, ridiculous.
<br>The normal setting was way too hard for me, I was only ever able to play at easy level.
<br>Would prefer more inventory for potions and stones etc.
<br>
<br>It is a very linear game that closely follows the story, there are a few incidental side quests but for sure you will be caught up with the story, at least I was. I played all the other LOTR games and this is a great effort. Not up to Biowares standards but still a nice way to spend some time.
<br>But dont buy this game unless you can deal with the restrictions I mentioned and you dont mind a very linear game.
<br>
<br>The world itself is very pretty and pleasing. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2012021">Expand</a></span>

To say that the graphics suck or that they look like PS2 or they are 5 years old?...that is ridiculous. I am about half way through this game and while there are aspects I am not crazy about I am having a very enjoyable time.<br><br>1. Graphics - These are fantastic! In between battles I find myself just looking around at the beautiful elven gardens, snowy crags of mountaintops, creepy forest tangles, or the many other gorgeous environments in this game. My wife is playing the new Star Wars online and her game looks like a cartoon compared to this game. 9/10<br><br>2. Story - I find it very enjoyable to have the story and characters from LotR existing alongside and at times intertwining with this game&apos;s story. I don&apos;t really care to replay the books or the movies, so playing this &quot;side story&quot; is perfect. I feel like I am contributing in a major way to the fight against Sauron, but not replaying a known story. This gives it some gravity and some mystery at the same time. 8/10<br><br>3. Gameplay/RPG Elements - While not as complex and thorough as many RPGs I&apos;ve played, there is enough to do when leveling up to customize your player character. You add to the usual stats and then get to select between 3 skill areas. You also get to customize wearables with gems, and there is plenty of loot so you will frequently be upgrading your armor and weapons. 6/10<br><br>4. Interface/Controls - This is perhaps where I&apos;d make the most changes. Basically, you select one of the three main playable characters for a section of the game, then as you progress through the game there are points at which you can choose to remain as the same character or switch to one of the other two. At first I did not like this approach, but after a while I grew to enjoy playing three different character styles. It creates more varied play and encourages those of us who typically play RPGs as one character type to try new types. One thing I would add to the interface screen is a progress bar to the next &quot;switch&quot; site so I would know how close I am to being able to change characters. Also, I became aware that you must play as a character to level them up and swap wearables.  6/10<br><br>5. Miscellaneous - Music, sound effects, and voice acting are superb. Art design is perfect for the story...a great mix of realism and fantasy. The game has gotten quite challenging here about half-way through, though I&apos;d say the &quot;boss&quot; fights are (oddly) somewhat easier than the rest. One &quot;glitch&quot; I have found is that the two characters you are not controlling actually use more advanced skills than when you are playing as that character. For example, when playing as the ranger I noticed the dwarf shooting exploding bolts. When next I plated as the dwarf I saw that this was an advanced skill I had not been able to select yet.<br><br>Summary - This game was a huge surprise, and a very enjoyable one. I actually prefer more detail and micro-managing in my RPGs, but this game is great for what it is. It is a bit linear and lacks the depth of some other traditional RPGs, but makes up for it with fantastic artwork, great story, and challenging battles.<br><br>Overall Rating - 7.5</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2302372">Expand</a></span>

The textures a bit blurred and badly polished but the overall art style makes up for it, the presentation is just fantastic, recreating the world of Tolkien with a near perfect fidelity. Graphics Grade: 7/10<br>Gameplay: Very repetitive, the game is not as violent as many expected, it just contains a bit of blood but nothing really spartacus-like. The problem is that the game will focus a lot on the xp your character has in order to defeat the enemies and the the player&apos;s skill. Gameplay Grade: 5/10<br>Story: The Story is very well crafted because it goes parallel to the film&apos;s events and there are some mentions of those events but aren&apos;t really the focus. A good plot but not very strong overall. Story Grade: 7/10<br>Soundtrack &amp; Effects: The effects are well done but not as good as they could be. The Soundtrack is great and well placed, nothing revolutionary but very good nonetheless. Soundtrack &amp; Effects Grade: 8/10<br><br>LOTR: War in the North Final Grade: 6.75 which means 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2079966">Expand</a></span>

As others have commented, the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is engaging.  My one complaint is that the multiplayer is simply the singleplayer campaign with online play.  No new maps or co-operative gameplay styles, as I was hoping.  Also, the difficulty levels above Normal must be unlocked one at a time, but this disadvantage is also an advantage, in that it gives you a tangible reason to replay the game&apos;s single and multi-player adventures.  All told, War in the North is a great game.  It&apos;s light years ahead of most movie-based games, and is great fun to play.  The only thing that would make it better in my books, is a more varied multiplayer experience.  8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=1907372">Expand</a></span>

The positive side of this game is that its addictive, if you are a LOTR fan, then you&apos;re gonna love this game, otherwise, you wont like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2126608">Expand</a></span>

The community didn&apos;t like that either, and Snowblind didn&apos;t listen to the community or bother to read their own forums. Thus the Elf is the Loremaster.  Still, to be honest, the most disappointing aspect of this game is that there is no character creator/deep customization at all, which would have really made the game go over well with the fans, even if the critics don&apos;t know what they are talking about.  One can hope they do add some other player models or customization options with DLC, but with the lay-offs at Warner Brothers,  thanks to horrible reviews this site compiles, from critics who only played up until they got to Rivendell, any hope of DLC is slim.<br><br>You see, if you play the game past Rivendell, watch the characters grow in levels and abilities, it&apos;s one of the best games you&apos;ll play in a long time. Like Batman Arkham Asylum/City is the best game of the Batman franchise, so is War in The North for Lord of The Rings. Now compare it to Batman and it&apos;s not quite as good, but for a LoTR game, it&apos;s the best one you can play. Forget the LoTRO MMO, since the developers make huge group content, yet not many people actually play their game, so you can&apos;t get anything done.  This game is how LoTR multiplayer should be, in terms of a 3 person fellowship. The gameplay at a glance can be repetitive but once you unlock skills and new abilities for your class/character, you will see a whole new game appear. The characters also are not flat at all, as some amateur critics have said at IGN. They all have personality, though I must say Andriel seems to have the most, voiced by the same lady that did BloodRayne, E&apos;Lara in Hunted and other games, she really comes across as a great character, as do most all the NPCs you will encounter.  I also like the conversations you can have with the NPCS, because you get to ask the obvious questions people had of the novels/movies, such as &quot;why didn&apos;t the eagles just fly Frodo to Mordor?&quot;<br><br>I also have to say this game is alot better than the Dragon Age games, or anything Bioware does. I will never understand how they got acclaim, when their maps are just plugged in sections of other areas you&apos;ve seen before. In War in The North, every section is new and detailed.  You won&apos;t see the same looking areas all over your playthrough like Bioware games. Graphics, sound and story are amazing in this game. Gameplay is fast and precise. There are no invisible walls or hitbox issues like some critics has claimed. Maybe they were reviewing the inferior console versions, but the PC version does not suffer from any of these issues.  Both this game and Hunted: The Demon&apos;s Forge were excellent games. I think the critics just don&apos;t play them deep enough to understand. While I will be buying Skyrim, I am sure that game won&apos;t have an epic tale that LOTR does or the same caliber of voice actors this game does, if it has any at all. It doesn&apos;t even have multiplayer, which in this game works flawless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=1826874">Expand</a></span>

Buying this game will mean immersing yourself in one of the most imaginative, fantastical, majestic and magnificent realms of fantasy ever created. With full license to all of Tolkien&apos;s books, from The Silmarillion to The Lord of the Rings novel-turned-trilogy, as well as the movies, Snowblind Studios does an excellent job of providing you with a deep narrative that runs simultaneous to Frodo&apos;s near impossible quest. In the process of doing so, the people at Snowblind also enrich your experience with Tolkien&apos;s world by providing deep lore and believable characters that the player may interact with (favorite among them for me is Radagast the Brown). Combat itself, the meat of any action game, is well done and provides enough entertainment that you will be more than happy to do multiple playthroughs (as I am doing now). While they could have added more variety in attack animations, such as left click (LC), LC, right click (RC) or LC, RC, RC, LC, the ways of customizing your characters from being a staff wielder or staff + sword wielder (Lore-master), 2-hander, duel wielder and/or bow + arrow shooter (Ranger) and 2-hander or sword + board and crossbowman (Champion), along with the loot system/reward system for quests, all provide enough interest to prevent the monotony that occurs with common action games. Indeed, the idea of integrating action with that RPG looting system is ingenious. But that is not the only RPG elements you may expect in this action-RPG. Character development is also a key component, and every class has different talent paths, assuring no one will be the same. For instance, on my first playthrough, I played the Elf Lore-master, a sort of semi-mage and/or support character. Generally I would have been expected to take the support route, but since at first I was soloing it, I instead chose to transform this &quot;glass cannon&quot; into a melee heavy, spell heavy killing machine. The result is that, while I could have had a skinny Elf throwing up &quot;bubbles&quot; to shield from ranged attacks and healing, or a puny Elf who flashes bolts of energy (?) from behind the roars of a Dwarf Champion, I instead became a knight-like Gandalf rolling and blasting her way into combat whilst hacking and smashing and severing limbs off with my sword and staff. The result in multiplayer was that my damage could compete with that of a Dwarf or Ranger.<br><br>Of course, despite all the great things, a game can always be better. For War in the North, improvements could be in the looting system, where more magical items are more common. One disappointment is that even after spending five minutes fighting those massive trolls, the rewards were often mediocre and non-magical on normal difficulty. Instead, most of your equipment is white and has little effects on them. Additionally, in single player, the game is a one-person show, as the A.I. is useless outside of annoying the enemy and reviving you. As mentioned, more animations and variety could have been put into the melee, because the constant use of skills without drowning yourself in power potions does not open up until much later--and then only for those who have invested in the Will stat. But don&apos;t let these minor nuisances take away from this otherwise brilliant game. Instead, I recommend you find a buddy or two, each buy the game, and go have some great fun in arguably the greatest fantasy products of the imagination to exist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=1828848">Expand</a></span>

The more I play this game the more I love it, though I must admit the first hour or two didn&apos;t impress me. It does get much better and Snowblind deserves better than some of the negative/mixed reviews I&apos;ve seen. Keep in mind that this game is more oriented to action than classic RPG, though you can adjust stats and skills to customize your character. I can see now after having played for many hours that it would be so much more fun with human teammates rather than bots. Gonna try multiplayer in a week or so just to give the rest of the world a chance to catch up. For Tolkien fans , this is a must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=1829503">Expand</a></span>

The cooperative play of this game is undoubtedly what makes it worth playing and to pick this hoping for an engaging single player experience would be at best, a terrible idea. What drives a worthwhile single player rpg is a focused, well-developed narrative and a feeling that your actions and decisions leave a discernible mark on the game&apos;s world - both are thing this games is lacking entirely.<br><br>The cooperative play however allows you to abandon any pretense of narrative or impact and allows for some good old fashioned hack&apos;n&apos;slash goodness. The combat system, although sometimes repetitive, is continually freshened up with an abundance of weapons, decent leveling system, and an above-par fighting engine that rewards timing and delivers visceral battles complete with decapitations and plenty of blood. The three characters are extremely well balanced and you&apos;ll find that your trio will never feel as though one player has the advantage in battle. Teamwork is often essential to survival, especially in the later stages of the game as well as in the challenge levels. Needless to say, the combat is the game&apos;s driving impetus and coupled with a few friends makes for an exhilarating time.<br><br>The level design is extremely linear but in a game where you and your friends will simply be itching to hit the next battle, the lack of exploration works to your advantage. The environments are well-realized and expand on the aesthetics realized by the films. Each location has a unique feel, offers plenty of loot and presents the player with new and exciting opponents. The game is marred, as mentioned, by a repetitiveness caused in part by a lack of customization and character abilities. It would be nice to see a broader range of upgrades, abilities and special moves in a game that focuses so much on combat. Other things that dampened my experience were the occasional glitch and troublesome always-on voice chat that could use a push-to talk option at the very least. All in all, I would definitely recommend War in the North to anyone looking for a solid, well realized and genuinely fun co-op experience to blast through before Skyrim hits next week.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827299">Expand</a></span>

I have frequently observed how things go awry when a console game is transformed into a pc game. LOTR- War in the North is no exception. Its just another example of how a game with high potential can be a let down of sorts, thanks to short-sightedness. This is an RPG game with fabulous graphics and the bells and whistles that go with such genre of gaming. Unlike a Diablo or warcraft, the characters are visibilly bigger like a 3rd person shooter- something we often see in POTC and LOTR games. While the experience of game play is pleasant, the following issues sure are real turn offs- namely interface glitches and game play. Let&apos;s see how-<br><br>*There are 3 charcacters. While U play one, the other two companions are controlled by AI &amp; U have little control over what they do. Customization of characters is not too innovative either. Weapons not too fancy, skill tree not very inspiring. Not much combat, magic combo to build up. This is a let down.<br><br>* Movement is a real pain and spoils your gameing experience. &apos;The back of your&apos; head camera/view can often go awry. I wonder whay can&apos;t developers take a clue from the Max Payne game engine while designing characters.U can loose track of your character and his direction while playing. Especially during combat U often find yourself hacking in the wrong direction with your back to the enemy!!!! . or come up from a roll and you wish to turn around-- spite of pressing the buttons you are immobile for a few precious moments.<br><br>* For some reason the interface/key board controls are not very response friendly- Not allowing you the desired action the very moment you need it. For example, Health potions may not activate immediately. Dodge, role, move forward buttons don&apos;t always give you the combo movement when pressed together. Your charcater is thus left to stand in the middle of a mele` for a coup degrace! how idiotic. walking over loot items has a pop up window asking if U wish to loot!! that too in the middel of combat surely lacks some fore-sight. * Fighting the bosses are way too unrealistic. Especially with sloppy controls. There are many who complain about fighting the first boss- Tharzog the chieftain- Your fingers will fall out of their sockets while clammering across the keyboard- U barely go 50% of the way before either U or both your sidekicks fall and the game is over..... As if the boss wasn&apos;t enough, his minnions just keep coming. It is extremely hard for a player to make way...Not realistic at all. The percentage of gamers who claim to have made it thru is very less! My own nephew tried in vein for some 39 days before he deleted the game!!! Says a lot! With no cheat options U R stuck in the rut. Now that&apos;s sad. * After a while the combat and enemies become very repetative and boring. * No save options. I wonder why this is becoming a trend. Let the gamer decide how long he wishes to play. Without these glitches, it could have been a much more enjoyable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2114638">Expand</a></span>

I also own the hard copy (not downloaded) LOTR WITN and only play it on PS3 so I cannot vouch for any other consoles.... The 1st thing I do whenever I open up a brand new game is pull out the user guide that comes inside of the game case to familiarize myself with new controls and game set-up. What I found was a 6 page booklet (most of it user agreements and epilepsy/seizure warnings) that didn&apos;t even have all the controls listed on it. With a Lore-Master voucher for free complete armour set and a weapon. (Possibly the worst set in the game) [-1 point] So I then popped the game disk in with my girlfriend to watch the &quot;epic just put the game in intro movie&quot; and... nothing happened. It just brought me to the start menu [-1 point]. So then we press start and choose our characters... except when my girlfriend was trying to choose a character she couldn&apos;t make her own saved data on my PlayStation profile. Wait a minute! you can&apos;t play and save data from only one playstation profile!! So I exited out of the game to make her own profile so she could play. We each choose our own characters and away we go. Once the game loads My very first thought was ``F*** this split-screen ``[-1point] and [another -1 point for not being able to change that] (when playing 2 player the screens are side by side instead of with every other multi-player split-screen, top and bottom [-1 point]). To make matters worse your character takes up the entire screen. So although you have can have a great view of a Dwarfs` ass [-1 point] &#xC3;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2247043">Expand</a></span>

We are back at hammering one button for combat.... the other button is a &apos;critical attack&apos;.    NO combos to speak of.   No utiilization of the light and heavy attacks together..   You have ONE light attack that you do over and over (and over.... and over... ad nauseum)  It never changes.  On top of that you get a ranged attack.   Then you can do a &apos;heavy attack&apos; that breaks shields... that never changes.   The entire game is based on combat and I cannot imagine a duller system than this.   Yes each character has 3-4 &apos;power moves&apos; where you press &apos;shift&apos; or whatever w/ the appropriate key.    This game couldn&apos;t be worse.   Graphics are decent with some nice &apos;bloomy&apos; background effects.   Some of the levels look nice.    Utterly attrocious combat.. this is like an updated version of Return of the King from 2002 but Return of the King was literally like 10 times better...each of the 10 or so charcters had like 12 different unlockable combos...... you had light attack , heavy attack, grab, throw, &apos;finish&apos;... and you could combine all of those to create combos... (i.e. L, L,L, H, H would create interesting ... NEW moves)... Whoever&apos;s idea it was to have you hammering one button over and over again was obviously a *****ing genius.  This game is a total failure.    Even the graphics of Return of the King from 2002 are almost as good as this.. 10 years later...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2606780">Expand</a></span>

A cheap and unsuccessful attempt to capitalize on the LOTR name.  About the only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics, that is if the game didn&apos;t have a severe stuttering disorder no matter what hardware you have or whether graphical settings are maxed out set to minimal.  Level design is linear, characters are shallow, dialogue is somewhat grating on the nerves, and the side quest elements are a joke.  Combat is generally boring with boss fights are a total mess. You&apos;ll spend more time being revived by your allies than damaging your enemies. Character and equipment management is sloppy and uncoordinated, character advancement is minimal and the control setup is unintuitive and muddled.  And there are bugs galore.  Quest people will disappear and reappear at random, moving a character from single player to multi-player and vice versa can cause losing your save games, and in single player your allies really do their best to block you path as you can&apos;t run through them, so you&apos;ll find yourself blocked from the action a lot as many combat areas are cramped.  This game is just bad.  It&apos;s not even an average hack-and-slasher.  It&apos;s a terrible RPG.  And it&apos;s down right abysmal for the LOTR brand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320704">Expand</a></span>

Your ally AI is so horrible that any remotely difficult fight they will go down in a couple seconds and there is no way you&apos;re getting them back up without dying. There is a boss fight a couple of hours into the game that took almost 20 minutes of running and slashing to beat. If he didn&apos;t have unlimited minions it might have been a bit better. After that it got easier for another 20 minutes and then another huge difficulty spike.
<br>The games combat is boring and repetitive. After about an hour you get tired of the crit kills and it just is the same over and over and over. I quit after reaching the midway point in the game and I felt like I had just wasted my time. I got stuck on a ridiculously hard boss and just eventually stopped retrying.

It&apos;s mostly a tedious hack &apos;n slash with just enough RPG elements to drag down the action, but not to actually make it interesting. As with many obvious console ports, the controls are awkward and the menus are difficult. The graphics are decent but are not enough to distract you from the bad voice acting and poorly-scripted, dull story. I made myself suffer through several hours of this game, hoping that it would get better, but it didn&apos;t really. If you&apos;re a big LOTR fan then maybe you&apos;ll find this tolerable, but otherwise I&apos;d recommend avoiding it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=2808114">Expand</a></span>

But really what bothered me is that it&apos;s a pure railroad story, there&apos;s one path, one way.

<br>+ You can play with friends or strangers from the internet  Coop for three. Pluses on this end .
<br>- The combat system  primitive zadalboivanie LMC and in the end the decisive blow on the right button  it&apos;s all very pathetic  just like in Gothic 4  Index finger will be sore after 2  3 hours of the game.
<br>- Miserable graphics, the game was released in November 2011  a week before the release of TES Skyrim. They do not even compare to the level of graphics as the earth and sky. The game looks like it was made in 2005, the doge with TES Oblivion does not compare  it is pathetic .
<br>- Endless repetition, was a little gut  map  you fight  killed all again all over again. Repetition of small bosses Trolls and other creatures  all wildly angry.
<br>- Leveling  no balance  it is virtually useless. All to the disgrace of all 3 branches of skills with perks  Magic, and generally ranged attacks are useless  worthless and cause damage. Need to get into the head orc 9 times to kill him  well, it&apos;s just awful  But this is far from the enemy&apos;s attack is applied three times more damage than yours, even if the pump bow  crossbow or staff at the seer .
<br>- Impassable moments because of a notorious enemy imbalance  12 hour pass threw the game.
<br>- Locations  all done sloppy and ugly  even though the game takes place in the world of LOTR, invisible walls everywhere  sometimes just in the way and annoying.
<br>- Exceeding the opponent in an amount enough that they killed only after the 6-16 attacks  so still a lot of them  to the middle of the game simply unplayable and impassable  You can probably pass with only an irreparable loss to the nerves or the trainer.
<br>- Magic  spell damage and staves completely negligible  at least in Elf   and perhaps that is capable tickle opponents.
<br>1/10  Game frank vyser igroporoma how could all so nalazhali with RPG component  I do not know, probably just have not tested the game  did anyhow for 3 months  and released  cut the dough with the fans of the universe  The only plus point games this scenario  interesting conversations  I am glad that the game did not buy the incentive. Can be traversed only if the trainer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3761992">Expand</a></span>

BUT, graphics have moved on, gameplay has moved on and expectations have moved on. Try and find a demo before buying and make up your own mind... but I would definitely say don&apos;t waste your money on this game.</span>

The characters are practically emotionless. The graphics look like plastic action figures you would play with as a kid. The frame rate is also bad. It was never over about 10-20 fps.</span>

First off, the game NEEDS to be played on a decent PC with a controller, as its console counterparts suffer from some ugly technical hiccups that ruin the experience, while the mouse and keyboard controls just aren&apos;t right for the third-person real-time combat.  Also, it&apos;s very easy to dismiss the game in its first 3-4 hours, since you don&apos;t start to see the depth of its streamlined RPG design until you&apos;ve leveled a bit.  And lastly, the Lord of the Rings setting and characters are honestly just brand recognition and window dressing for what would have been a fine action-RPG under any other name.  It&apos;s not like the concept of a male human, a female elf, and a male dwarf cutting down orcs and trolls is all that original in fantasy these days... and it doesn&apos;t need to be.  Snowblind&apos;s games have always been this way; Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath never really benefitted from or had a great impact on their respective D&amp;D and EverQuest IPs, but they were good games nonetheless.  In other words, don&apos;t play War in the North because it&apos;s Lord of the Rings.  Play it if you like dark fantasy action-RPGs, as it handles its violent combat-driven mechanics very well.  There are a few extras to be explored, from the occasional side quest and replayable areas laid out on a proper RPG map, to challenge quests and even Dragon Age-esque branching dialogue (though you&apos;re never really faced with consequences for those choices).  The real fun is in unlocking skills that have a sizeable impact on your fighting style, and each of the three characters offer a fair amount of visual and stat-based customization.  The only weirdness in customization is how your selected character reflects changes, while the other two auto-level and stick to preset builds when controlled by the AI.  While they retain changes you&apos;ve made whenever you actually play as them, they revert to the auto-builds whenever you switch.  They don&apos;t lose your changes upon switching; they just don&apos;t use those changes when AI-controlled.  That may seem confusing and odd to solo players, but it&apos;s obviously a design choice due to WitN&apos;s focus on co-op.  It means that other players can easily drop in or out without messing with your saved builds, and it also means that you can sell any unusable equipment without having to hold onto it for another character.  In the end, most solo players will stick to a single favored character anyway, so it doesn&apos;t matter that much.  And on the flip-side of that point, WitN does offer an excellent cooperative experience for up to three players, if you&apos;ve got friends willing to play it.  The game also presents a fairly wide variety of locations and enemy types, drawing inspiration from Tolkien&apos;s lore even outside of the original novels or film adaptations.  It&apos;s lengthy, too, as the game generally takes 20 hours or more for a story run (as long as you&apos;re not skipping the dialogue) and could easily eat up 60+ unlocking everything.  And despite its length, the combat doesn&apos;t get old.  In fact, it gets better the further you press on, and due to its moderately high challenge, it becomes quite rewarding.  The ability to call on a great eagle for occasional air strikes or form a protective/restorative dome using the Sanctuary skill are particularly cool, and you&apos;ll often be left with a smile on your face after downing a massive wave of orcs.  In the end, I have been pleasantly surprised by War in the North, and even if it shouldn&apos;t be placed in the same basket as Skyrim or Dark Souls, it serves as an enjoyable [and usually cheap] option for anyone looking for a solid action-RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866813">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game play is simple and that&apos;s a good thing.. when your mobbed with enemies and have 3 people fighting off everything from armored orcs to orcs with explosives strapped to their back and have to swap weapons quickly it doesn&apos;t need to be complicated. Graphics are beautiful and the story and side missions are interesting and all have the Tolken &quot;feel&quot;  well worth playing. controls are very easy and many games have the same control set.. people are stupid.  No customization?  you might want to look around.. in the Prancing pony you can change face, hair, facial hair, eye color etc.  your lack of intelligence doesn&apos;t mean something isn&apos;t there it means your too stupid to find it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3754754">Expand</a></span>

The fighting system is nice and reminds me of Demon&apos;s Souls (block, attack, block and so on). But above all, this game immersed me quickly and I have difficulty in putting aside the controller once I start to play it. To hell with the graphics... If it reminds people of PS2, so be it. I used to love that machine. This game deserves a solid 8 in my book. But I&apos;ll give it a 9 because of the people cursing at it. In the meantime I played the game with some randoms and saw that they didn&apos;t have an idea about what to do. And I think people giving low scores are &quot;mostly&quot; of that kind (I mean, noobs...)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3089257">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and effects are well done, so is the voice acting and other sounds. There is gore and blood as well, which is cool. The RPG elements aren&apos;t very deep, so it won&apos;t be confusing at all. That is something I like, there are only 4 different attributes to put points into, and there are very simple skill trees that are easy to understand. The skills are varied enough to feel original and the 3 different characters all have their special abilities that are useful. It is a hack and slash, so you&apos;ll be spamming mouse1 more often than you&apos;ll be thinking tactically about the situation. Overall, though, I enjoyed it for my first couple playthroughs as the new game plus-esque mode kept me entertained. It did start to get a bit boring though as the story is a bit short and the combat is a little repetitive. If you are a fan of the LotR universe you&apos;ll most likely end up enjoying this game, too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192180">Expand</a></span>

As stated, the story is light and none too involving. The graphics are clean but lack any real imagination, which is probably its biggest downfall. I barely remember the nondescript music. The levels are extremely linear, offering no discovery. It lacks any deep RPG elements, I auto-levelled-up without even needing to think about which traits are better. And there&apos;s no real replay value. Overall though, there&apos;s enough enjoyment to be had here from a bit of orc hack-and-slash for a few hours, diverting easy fun.

My friend had a blast playing the elf mage, so I suspect the mechanical abilities are solid for all three characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3818191">Expand</a></span>

Intro music for our band of stalwart heroes, a human ranger, a dwarf fighter and an elven wizard(the only woman of course), who set out from the Prancing Pony at Bree, a place cursed with being drenched in perpetual rainy nights, after receiving instructions from non other than stapper, which is the Dutch translation for the nickname for Aragorn, who in this game looks remarkably like an actor called Viggo Mortensen.
<br>
<br>The going is pretty unidirectional from the start. Stop the main bad guy Aganda&#xFB;r from intervening with the rest of the world by killing him dead until he is. Easy enough. In between Bree and Aganda&#xFB;r&apos;s grave you meet some critters that are in the way, but that is how this game should be. They consists of nasty orcs and goblins, undead, biggers orcs, very big trolls, a huge giant even, humans in all shapes and sizes, spiders small, large and very large and that is about it really.
<br>At various moments you get helped by token people you can do well without. At least they don&apos;t die on you most of the time, which saves you from that headache. The coolest thing around is however the giant eagle friend your team gains, which gives a nice air asset that you can throw against some of the bigger nasties, provided they are in the open and you didn&apos;t waste your limited supply of airstrikes on something smaller.
<br>
<br>Somewhere in between you make a stopover at Rivendell where you are briefed by someone who looks remarkably like the actor Hugo Weaving. Incidently Hugo doesn&apos;t even hush up the fact that Frodo has a powerful ring that needs to be destroyed. So far for secrecy.
<br>You get to speak to other actors too, like Orlando Bloom, Ian Holm, John Rhys-Davies, Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler and yes by now you know the game takes its cues from the Peter Jackson movies. It isn&apos;t bad but it isn&apos;t very original either.
<br>
<br>And that might be the overall theme of this game. It isn&apos;t really bad, but it isn&apos;t really good either.. It is okayies. A word I just invented for this purpose. For instance; to lengthen your game experience they threw in a truckload of containers for you to plunder. You have to loot them all cause that is the only way to get neat new gear and what you find is pretty random. So there you are, hero of the war of the north, defeater of many a container...for you destroy or open more caskets, caches, barrels and other containers than you ever want too, because you will not only need to find loot for your own character, but also for your ai buddies, who might have no use at all for that stuff as far as can be told, but maybe they do or at least you can sell the stuff so you buy better stuff for you own, but most of all because this game is meant to be a co-op and can&apos;t quite figure out that you play it as a single player or as a co-op.
<br>
<br>Your ai buddies require some hand-holding for them not to be killed and if you are the elven maiden wizard it is doubly up to you to make sure that your ai buddies don&apos;t get killed, for the wizard biggest task is preventing the other two from turning into pin cushions.
<br>
<br>The overwhelming sensation you get when proceeding through this game is: if they just had.. If they just had added some more variety. If they just had added some more ways to do the quests.. If they just had added some more options in character development. If they just had added some interesting side quests. If they had just added some meaning full conversations.
<br>
<br>The biggest surprise is at the end when you discover that after all is said and done and the dead are buried and the living celebrate, you still are only halfway developed. And why? Cause you can then redo the whole game again on a higher difficulty level and gain more levels. Oh wow..
<br>
<br>War in the North is amusing enough to do once, but it totally lacks the charm to play once more, even as a different character. It is after all only okayies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=5522119">Expand</a></span>

The combat feels like a blend of the best of Skyrim and Warcraft. The only legitimate thing that could be said against it are the inventory system could be a bit more polished, the story could be longer and there could be more scope for exploration. These things are easily forgotten as you play through the game hacking the heads off orcs, eagerly awaiting your next level. I have had no connection issues. I thoroughly recommend the game as one of the finest co-op action rpgs out there..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3113599">Expand</a></span>

Has a reasonable backstory, but at least consistent with Tolkien&apos;s world, with important characters (such as Elrond and Bilbo) making appearances on every corner. It&apos;s a fun game, but that was not to be overestimated.</span>

Accurate and interesting LOTR lore is what kept me wanting to play. Any Tolkien fan will be happy with this. That being said, the story is very linear, and the same should be said about the levels. Equipment management is pretty lacking, with a rather unfriendly equipment interface.The game play is a classic hack&amp;slash with little variation. The three playable characters have different play styles which can accommodate most players; But it&apos;s still just a hack&amp;slash. I actually found some of the voice acting pretty lame at times, but it was average on the whole, I suppose. I had no issues with bugs like some of the other guys. I payed $20 for the game, and I feel like I got what I payed for out of it, but no more. A solid 7.5. This game will please LOTR fans, but unfortunately it will not make any new LOTR fans. It&apos;s too mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3377118">Expand</a></span>

The storyline is original but very true to the established lore.  The graphics are superb- I&apos;m playing on a 660Ti and they are fluid, detailed, and gorgeous.  The combat system is simple but very fun and I found the combat animations excellent.
<br>On the negative side- give us more!  It&apos;s too linear and feels too much like a console hack n slash.  If players had more flexibility with character creation and if it were a larger, open world this would have been a much better game.  I&apos;m imagining this game with the scale and depth of Skyrim-now THAT would have been a game to talk about.
<br>I&apos;m playing mostly multi-player with a partner which is very fun, but kind of poorly integrated with some buggy moments mostly related to simply getting two (or three) people into the same game at the same place.
<br>In summary, this is a very fun game- but not an &quot;alpha&quot; game.  I blame that on the industry&apos;s ill-conceived focus on console gaming and disposable games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3850098">Expand</a></span>

In fact the graphics looks pretty goof even now in 2013 and if you&apos;ve a decent hardware  the frame rate is realy fluid even with everything at max. This guy &quot;drachehexe&quot; says &quot;You&apos;ll spend more time being revived by your allies than damaging your enemies.&quot; if you don&apos;t know how to play then probably yes but according to Steam I was playing 6 hours until now and I was revived one time only. He also says &quot;your allies really do their best to block you path as you can&apos;t run through them, so you&apos;ll find yourself blocked.&quot; that&apos;s not 100% true, I mean yes they will block you sometimes and you can&apos;t run through them but the issue is so simple as hit the &quot;space&quot; key and you will do a roll that it will go through them so it&apos;s not really a problem.
<br>
<br>The game is not perfect of course (and I would agree that LOTR deserves a better game in the line of Skyrim), if you want an rpg in TES style this is not what you should look for but still it&apos;s an enjoyable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843651">Expand</a></span>

The game focuses on events in the Northern part of MIddle Earth and the gameplay is set at the same time as Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring are travelling south towards Mordor and Mount Doom.</span>

<br>2)Long boring GAMEPLAY,with slow moves,and stupid animations,that cant focuses in 360 degrees.
<br>3)The MOBS,are stupid as **** around without trying to avoid you.The bosses are also stupid AI,and the best is that you cant avoid all the attacks of them.
<br>4)The music has no place in the game at any point.
<br>5)The EFFECTS are ridiculous awful.
<br>6)The story it self sucks,a fictional **** that has no place in the universe of the LOTR or soever.
<br>7)The characters are fictional too,with no life to know or characteristics to remember..
<br>8)The player customization are ****,few choices and lame changes.
<br>9)The inventory is nothing much special as the skill tree too.
<br>
<br>At the end,if you want to loose time from your life,go on,this is the perfect game for it,besides, 2659 USERS agrees with it.

<br>
<br>Now, in terms of game play, theres nothing special here. It isn&apos;t ground breaking. But then again, whilst playing I felt a humble sense of nostalgia for the level based game&apos;s of my child hood. In this day and age games get slated unless they are breath taking and ground breaking which personally, I don&apos;t think is right. You should play games for your love of them, and, as a Lord Of The Rings fan, I love this game... so will you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=3906155">Expand</a></span>

I was really pleasantly surprised though as this turned out to be quite a gem. The in-game menus and GUI elements aren&apos;t great and look really outdated but the core functionality of them is excellent , incredibly simple and handy inventory , stats , skills system which I loved. The movement and general feel is decent but can sometimes feel a bit bulky. Decent though. The real pleasure in the experience is in the combat , it feels sturdy and swinging a frosty two handed broadsword has never felt better. Chopping of limbs of orcs and goblins is incredibly satisfying. The co-op dynamics is really well conceived aswell and the player to player system feels great. Graphically my opinion varies. The modeling is extremely well done and the displacement and normal mapping is great with large textures, yet runs really well. However , some things like nature and lighting feels unfinished and rushed. At times there are 2D trees randomly looming in the background and the skyboxes are really awful - minor things. If your in the market for an RPG that feels like Dragon age and plays like Skyrim you cant go wrong here. Enough said.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343205">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, this game is buggy. From messing up your saves to freeze ups, glitches can ruin your game.

<br>BUT, it is, without a doubt, some of the finest co-op game play I have ever experienced. Battles feel wonderfully fun and realistic. Graphics are sensational. The music and voice work is top-notch. And you FEEL like you are in Middle Earth. For all it&apos;s flaws, the game is a hell of a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=4724631">Expand</a></span>

<br>About the only &quot;flaw&quot; I found was that we were able to burn through the story relatively quickly..... I think there are about 10-12 hours of play for one full run through.

The english characters of the franchise are voiced by American voice actors, which I find to be unacceptable. There is no character development (there doesn&apos;t need to be, but in this case, it couldn&apos;t hurt), barely any unique story, and the coding is sub par. Instead of placing visible barriers, you will constantly hit invisible walls when playing. Its also incredibly inconsistent. It goes from easy, to insanely hard, to easy. Its just not a very good game, and I cannot recommend you buy it. Save your money, buy something better. If it wasn&apos;t for the game&apos;s graphics, combat and connection to the Lord of the Rings franchise, I would&apos;ve given it a failing score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=6779353">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I could only play to chapter 2 because of the game breaking AMD bugs. However what I did get to play was a lot of fun. There are towns where you can pick up quests, but there are only a few people in each town so you never feel overwhelmed with tasks and dialogue when what you really want to do is get back to the action. There is a lot of loot and it drops plentifully but gives you the option to sell it remotely. There are set items you can combine and augmentation slots. There were not a lot of skills in totality, 4-5 I think, but there are 27 places to put skill points. Combat was fun and fluid (minus the stuttering from AMD). I played by myself but if I had a friend or brother to play with I&apos;d probably give it a 8.5. For what I did play they nailed the feel of middle earth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/user-reviews?user_review_id=7558326">Expand</a></span>
