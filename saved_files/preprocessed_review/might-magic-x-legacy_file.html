<br>
<br>This game is retro done right - no weird art styles to make the game &quot;look&quot; retro, instead they took an old game system and rejuvenated it . The entire game is turn based - in dungeons and overworld. And every step has to be thought about. The fights are brutally hard, even on adventurer level. If you don&apos;t think about every choice, you&apos;re going to die.
<br>
<br>The loot is interesting. The battles are fun. The enemies are varied. The overworld has a lot of interesting stuff - exploration pays off, that square of land a few steps away may contain some loose dirt that needs to be dug in, or a hidden shrine to some god tucked away on the side that will give you valuable benefits you may *need* to get past the next fight.
<br>
<br>Fights are tough but fair. Magic is interesting. Character/racial choices have a huge effect on gameplay  - for example some characters may only be able to get to &quot;novice&quot; on swordplay, whereas someone else may be able to become a grand master. (There are four levels: Novice, expert, master, grandmaster, for every skill.) If you particularly want a grandmaster healer, you better pick the right race AND occupation.
<br>
<br>There are a few minor blemishes - movements keys are set up so that WASD, rather than being what most people are probably used to, is Forward/Left/Backward/Right. But as the keys are reconfigurable you can fix this in seconds. Also on the overworld map trees spin in place each time you take a step. Minor stuff indeed.
<br>
<br>What you need to know is, this game is FUN. Not because it&apos;s retro, but because it&apos;s tough but fair and thought is rewarded. It&apos;s as if chess and D&amp;D had a beautiful baby.
<br>
<br>If you like RPG&apos;s or  if you like strategy, TRY THIS GAME.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t wait to see what the devs do next. I congratulate them for a wonderful first outing and I&apos;m really hoping they do an M&amp;M XI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3935008">Expand</a></span>

It is surely an improvement over the disaster that was MMIX, and it is an honest attempt of reviving the classic gameplay of the series.
<br>
<br>My main issues with the game is that it is not properly balanced and that it is relatively short for a Might and Magic RPG. There are too many instances where you have to die again and again in order to discover what you need to do and that is a feature of classic games that we should definitely leave in the past. Some spells are completely useless in most occasions and absolutely critical in some point, like the trap-finding spell. There are hardly any traps anywhere and at one point in the game they are downright lethal. Another example is the Searing Rune spell. It is a very useful spell, but if you cast it while the enemy is too far or in melee range then you just end up frying yourself - and often with no way of escape. There is no way to choose where you set it, it just targets itself.
<br>
<br>As far as combat is concerned, there is no way to tell how powerful an enemy is before engaging them and after doing so there is no way to escape. A striking example of this are Air Elementals. The Elite type are far more dangerous than any other elite elemental type, regardless of your elemental protection. In fact they are more dangerous to engage than the Air Elemental Lord, supposedly the most powerful Air Elemental around.
<br>
<br>Therefore, you often find yourself in a position where you take a wrong step, you die. You open the wrong door, you die. You meet the wrong enemy, you die. This sort of thing can be avoided, without making a game wimpy (Legend of Grimrock is a perfect example of this). In fact, there are quite a few lessons that Limbic could have learned from LoG in order to elevate their game from a classic RPG fan service to a truly outstanding title in its own right.
<br>
<br>When all is said and done I enjoyed the game, despite its faults, and look forward to the next installment. Classic RPGs with tactical gameplay can still be a lot of fun and we need more, better titles to make publishers understand that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4144107">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After few hours I see that M&amp;M X is bafflingly simple, both to mechanics and difficulty. Or the lack of them both. I know I will finish it eventually, it&apos;s not a dreadfully bad game, but it feels almost like a minigame that got turned into a full release in the middle of a development.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s almost a game breaking issue for me, though. The game has insanely bad optimalization and overheats THE **** OUT of by GPU, where not a single other game does that. Shadows on/off, vsync on/off, doesn&apos;t matter. It will quickly hit 90C&lt; after few minutes (like 10 or 20 minutes).
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a dungeon crawler, almost any other choice is better. Comparing it even to M&amp;M9 is a joke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5225056">Expand</a></span>

Most dialogue is not voice-acted, battles aren&apos;t very tactical and there are a couple of joy killers in the user interface (no &quot;end turn&quot; button or hotkey, no tactical retreat). Whatever you do, don&apos;t pay full retail. If you wait for it to go on special, and you&apos;re a fan of the series, you probably won&apos;t hate it.</span>

Worst of all, it will not tell the player that the content is blocked, it just refuses to advance the story.  The player has to research online in the ubisoft forums to figure out what the problem is and how to fix it.  Very poor game design.</span>

Like those games of yesteryear, you end up playing a party of 4 adventurers who make their way through the world tile by tile and engage in combat turn by turn.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Challenging yet well balanced gameplay that keeps you on your toes tactically. You&apos;re encouraged to think carefully and plan ahead before engaging in combat, particularly with regard to boss fights.
<br>
<br>- The bestiary is a nice touch. This is basically a journal which your party keeps of each monster encountered that lists all its stats like attack bonuses and resistances to various types of magic. The entry on each monster does not have much info to begin with, but as you encounter that particular monster type more often, more stats are revealed. This helps you plan your combat strategy when next you happen to meet that monster type.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Poor performance. Despite the game not being particular graphics-intensive, it occasionally lags while you are travelling through the countryside, and entering any dungeon or city involves a loading screen (with the same picture every time) which takes ages to go away. Crashes occasionally occurred after I had been playing the game for a few hours at a time and was waiting for a loading screen.
<br>
<br>- Dull storyline and somewhat lifeless, generic fantasy world which you feel very little connection to.
<br>
<br>- Character customization is very limited. You only have a choice of 4 different races, with 3 different classes unique to each race that focus on combat, magic or a combination of the two. Each race and gender only has a total of two different voices to choose from, and two different character portraits. I really feel the developers could have made more of an effort to include more portraits and voices but I suppose the budget was fairly tight for this title, given that the last Might and Magic title came out years ago and was not a success back then.
<br>
<br>- All characters have a fixed portrait on their inventory screen, unlike the proper paper dolls used in some previous M&amp;M games that reflect the actual gear the character has equipped. It ruins immersion somewhat when your mercenary is toting a greatsword, chainmail and a nifty horned helmet, yet you&apos;re stuck with a default portrait that shows him/her in plate armour with a shield and no helmet.
<br>
<br>- My main gripe is that there seems to be no option to flee from combat. It is all too easy to venture into a dungeon, cave or castle off the beaten path and come face to face with an enemy that can obliterate your entire party in a couple of rounds. A good example of this is when I decided to check out what was described as a &quot;dangerous cave&quot; and found myself facing a huge Cyclops who was a square or two away from my party. I fired a couple of arrows at him and when I found out how much health he seemed to have, I decided to try and flee as the exit was literally right behind me. However the game would not let me exit the cave so I had to fight gamely on for a couple of rounds as he proceeded to beat my party to a pulp. My advice? Be cautious and stick to only entering buildings when you need to for specific quests, or else explore the nearby wilderness for monsters to take on. Steer clear of everything else unless you absolutely cannot.
<br>
<br>- Combat does get a bit repetitive after a while. There are two spells you will inevitably find yourself using until your eyes bleed (yes, I&apos;m talking about you, Celestial Armour and Regenerate) and health and mana tend to deplete very rapidly, leading to tedious levels of potion guzzling almost every round.
<br>
<br>- The hotbar on the screen for the currently selected character only contains 10 slots. This is ridiculously meagre as you will typically use 3 of these slots for the attack, defend and missile actions, leaving you with only 7 to map spells, special abilities or potions to. Inevitably you will not have enough space for everything and you&apos;ll have to keep opening your spell book repeatedly during combat to access other spells or abilities, making combat even more tedious.
<br>
<br>- Poorly staged encounters. Monsters will often spawn out of nowhere in response to specific events, such as the party finding a certain item in a dungeon. Typically they will be right next to the party which means there are limited opportunities to use missile weapons as these only do 50% of normal damage against opponents adjacent to the party. This seriously devalues any of the classes that specialize in missile weapons.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>Not a bad game, and a refreshing old school turn-based alternative to PC RPG gamers seeking a more tactical experience who are tired of the realtime RPG action games that the market seems to be flooded with nowadays. Sadly the game has something of a rushed feel though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4507261">Expand</a></span>

Great game indeed though i wasn&apos;t expecting too much and didn&apos;t participate in alpha testing. I was so afraid of being disappointed because of &quot;betrayal&quot; (c) of the earlier games.  in the result, turns out, was wrong. Hard to explain why i do like M&amp;M franchise so much (since parts 4 and 5 aka World of Xeen), they&apos;re just great and classy and have that nice atmosphere, likeable characters, interesting puzzles and big amount of oldschool exploration, so i&apos;ll make a list of the things, which, in my opinion, prevented it from getting a higher score.
<br>
<br>Things i didn&apos;t like:
<br>- Restrictions, that make your experience more linear, especially at the first part of the game. Don&apos;t mean difficulty of the enemies, i only mean when game prevents you from moving anywhere else than next mainquest or sidequest dungeon, because of the &quot;pirates on the sea&quot;, &quot;brigands on the road&quot; or &quot;lack of God-dragon blessing&quot;. Don&apos;t remember having that amount of restrictions in earlier games
<br>
<br>- Lack of content. World is big and well designed, game has like 60 hours of gameplay, but just higher variation of enemies, spells, weapons, conditions etc.would be really nice. I especially miss cursed weapons, traps on the chests, conditions like &quot;petrified&quot;, &quot;insane&quot;, &quot;drunk&quot; or &quot;eradicated&quot; and magical and regular aging  (not telling about &quot;Heartbroken&quot; or &quot;In love&quot;, its ok for me to not get my characters into these :) ). Not sure if reputation or alchemy from the later games are needed, didn&apos;t like them that much, but having a chance to donate in the temple would also add much to the atmosphere for me. More customisation at the making of the party (i mean character avatars and voices) would be nice. And of course more classes and races -  all that good stuff that we did have in the earlier games. upd, I do not understand why Town portal was removed from the game eather. That spell didn&apos;t make the game easier (if you cant use it during the fight), just helps to save some time you usually spend on backtracking.
<br>
<br>- I know its an ongoing problem, had it in the World of Xeen, but i didnt like ranged weapons in this game as i didnt like or didn&apos;t use them that much in m&amp;m 4-5 too. So, it seems for me, that some classes are still more helpful than the others. Not sure about it, yet about to test the completion of the game with only characters like rangers and hunters in the future, but still. Ranged weapons need some buffs.
<br>
<br>- Game has a great amount of dungeons and sidequests, but even on the warrior difficulty. if you ll spend enough time visiting them, you&apos;ll quickly find out that noone is able to stop your overpowered team anymore. I don&apos;t mean the mainquest, but i really was disappointed to not even have an option to visit a dungeon, where packs of dragons will explain me who I am by klling the whole team whith a single blow - so i&apos;ll need to expand my strategy, try to find a use for items that i&apos;ve found earlier and didn&apos;t sale. Which brings me to the next point.
<br>
<br>- It would be really nice to have a place to store your items (with an amount of properties that aren&apos;t useful now, but may help vs. certain enemies, for example by giving higher resists agains their weapons). My horse and backpack weren&apos;t enough at later stages. Maybe i&apos;m just too foresighted and greedy, but still.
<br>
<br>- I know they&apos;ll never come back but i still miss sci-fi elements. Not much of a concern, just design choice, i&apos;m ok with the one they made.
<br>
<br>- The most significant: bugs and lack of optimisation. I still hope my graphical adaptor didn&apos;t get burned or damaged whlie i was playing this. Loading times are just too long. At some places it starts to freeze or lag. Sometimes music don&apos;t seem to stop - sound design is great, but seems obviously bugged. Its just technical issues, but they do harm the overall experience.
<br>
<br>But, aside from it, great game, love it so much, and was waiting for it for so long. A big thanks from me to the developers for deliviring that kind of experience. I&apos;ve bought a deluxe edition and am looking for the next games in the franchise. And yes, i do hope, some of these concerns will be fixed by modes, patches or (*here i sigh*) dlc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943458">Expand</a></span>

Simply too many corners were cut while developing this game. Fights almost totally lacks strategic planing - those difficult ones just rely on pure luck with block/miss/critical hits. Save/load the game 20 times and you will finally win the big boss fight. Also game is pretty unbalanced and the freedom of party creation is limited by lack of imagination on the developer side and their lackluster decisions - ie. try not to choose a freemage as a member of your party and you are pretty much screwed as she is the only character that can cast spells required to find hidden doors. Want to make some party with shields users - well you can but because of the linear structure of the game if you reach expert level by the end of the Lighthouse quest you cannot train it to the appropriate level because the trainer is in other town which you cannot reach at this stage of the game - so you are screwed with a party that cannot defeat the boss because you were putting your skill points into something you cannot train yet. Well unless you want to save/load it several dozens of times that is. The world is small, how to make it bigger - make the player run back and forth to town for supplies required to rest and to repair broken equipment. Those are just examples of how the game was poorly put together - it has a lot of parts but there was little tough into putting them into an enjoyable experience. Seems like the developers are fine with the game being just &quot;playable&quot;. And when after 20 hours of playing you realize that you have to start over because the mechanic is broken and the party you assembled is unable to do something essential - the whole charm and nostalgia the game brought back is replaced with frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3936679">Expand</a></span>

Beware: the game is not holding your hand to do anything and tutorial</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game is a breath of fresh air in a genre which was dumbed down to appease a wider audience for years.
<br>
<br>While the story and certain elements (tile based in-town movement) are keeping this game from pure excellence, the return to its roots makes this game unique in current age and this is a wonderful experience.
<br>
<br>Beware: the game is not holding your hand to do anything and tutorial is practically non-existent. If you cannot bother with thinking about proper group composition, careful progression and lack of in-game help, this will be a painful experience for you, even on the easy difficulty. Those who are more accustomed to modern &quot;RPG&quot; like Mass Effect or even Dragon Age are in for a bit of a shock.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, it&apos;s worth it. The game is rather difficult, but the time you overcome a particularly nasty boss because of proper utilisation of your party skills is a great experience. The game rewards you for spending time upgrading your skills, finding proper equipment, and while the challenge is not always fair, there is rarely an obstacle that you can&apos;t overcome with proper planning and execution.
<br>
<br>M&amp;M X has small problems with graphics and optimisation for certain rigs, but this shouldn&apos;t bother you, because this is absolutely the game to try. It is great that Ubisoft and Limbic took a chance on creating such a game, but it is a wonderful return of a beloved franchise.
<br>
<br>Thank You, Ubisoft, and, please, give us more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943602">Expand</a></span>

<br>After reading some mediocre reviews, I was not expecting such a good game. I really LOVE turn-based, grid-based dungeoncrawler. And this one is no exeption. Could not stop playing this weekend...just small breaks for eating and sleeping. This did not happen to me since Dragon Age: Origins (PC) :)</span>

<br>
<br>The bad: Low production values. Ubisoft didn&apos;t invest much in this game&apos;s development, and it shows in the voice acting and optimization. Expect framerate drops on any machine. Don&apos;t play it on a 32 bit OS. Story and writing suffer compared to past entries, as well. To me, this is all overshadowed by the meat and potatoes of the gameplay, which scratch an itch I didn&apos;t even know was there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3947370">Expand</a></span>

Some of the worst aspects are combat related, such as being locked into combat and no monsters are in the local area, a bug that STILL has not been fixed, this particular bug occurs because of the ridiculously decision to make the combat turn based, where as the previous games was all psedo-turn based meaning you could move your party/pause the game and attack.   MMx locks you into a fight to the death once monsters reach a certain distance from your character, unfortunately I&apos;ve had this bug out far too many times forcing a reload to a previous point to fix - not to mention this particular type of combat also punishes the players rather harshly against ranged monsters, because you sometimes can&apos;t move into melee range!! Absurd but true!!  Honestly - the person who thought up this mechanic should be fired because its one of the serious gamebreaking issues MMx has.
<br>
<br>If your a veteran of the MM series, you&apos;ll know that skill points are valuable but in previous games you had somewhat leeway into making some mistakes with your builds, MMx forces you into very specific builds and characters classes otherwise you could literally become stuck in game without the ability to progress either because of bosses being too difficult or some encounters completely overpowering your characters, so creating your party requires very careful planning and even more careful skill point allocation.
<br>
<br>Another major problem MMx is balance, or lack off it.  The balance problems are so bad that I don&apos;t think the game was ever playtested properly.   Overall game difficulty is another issue as it wildly increases/decreases, for instance you don&apos;t know the level of any monsters and since they cut corners with monsters design (they just re-color) the difference in color of a monster could mean that you have your entire party one-shotted or you one-shot the monster.  But for the most part, you&apos;ll die ALOT when exploring, so save literally before every encounter.  Because a typical scenerio when exploring is...kill basic monsters...no problems...oh new monster!! Game Over...reload, avoid area until higher level, it happens far too often which makes me wonder if this development team ever played any of the original might and magic games...
<br>
<br>I could write on and on about all the complaints and issues I have with this game, but this is one of those games you&apos;re either going to love it, or hate it.  I just don&apos;t recommend this game to anyone who easily gets frustrated.  It is also especially time consuming because MMx also suffers from excessive loading, with entering buildings/inns...loading...enter/leaving areas...more loading...entering dungeons/new floors...more loading.
<br>
<br>Basically, This game needs to have the movement lock removed as that would solve many of the issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893401">Expand</a></span>

Experimentation with party builds and a decent range of skills have been generally missing in the last decade of gaming and its great to see these come back. The fresh and cartoony graphics are rather enjoyable (given a reportedly limited budget) but really help throw the series into this decade. All in all a great game for people who love a serious RPG classic!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933388">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Older gamers that grew up with game series like Might and Magic and Wizardry will enjoy the new part of MnM fore sure! The game will not hold your hand (no quest markers etc.) , the exploration is deep and rich, the progress through the world is not linear at all (must visit older areas to clean harder monsters and dungeons yoy left) and has the feeling of &quot;adventure&quot; as you manage to overcome the difficulties (and they are many!) New gamers have a chance to play a really different style of cRPG, although they might need patience to understand the philosophy of this sub-genre.
<br>
<br>The game though has its problems, like the terrible online-DRM Uplay, the &quot;heavy&quot; engine and minor details that could make the game a really masterpiece (f.e. the few choices at appearances and voices of your party members), but imo those flaws are not enough to prevent you enjoy a really good game, who like a visitor from the past bring us many gaming hours of a forgotten rpg-genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3940224">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Admittedly, the graphics are generally sub-par compared to even low-end contemporary games (textures and aspect ratios are a primary culprit), but if you buy this game, you should buy it knowing that it has a greater emphasis on gameplay than on graphics, and so far gameplay stays true to the classic MM formula (where &quot;classic&quot; is MM1-5). Step movement makes for a better turn-based experience and strategic planning during battles. It&apos;s may not be as &quot;fun&quot; as the later MMs in the series, but it has its own appeal.
<br>
<br>Bottom line - get this game if you place more emphasis on careful planning and turn-based battles rather than graphics. It will definitely appeal more to MM fans, and is undoubtedly very buggy in its current state, but the devs are clearly moving in the right direction I think.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933374">Expand</a></span>

Even a slight influence from M&amp;MXI can be seen. If &quot;fan of Might and Magic 1-5&quot; does not describe you, you are more than likely NOT the target audience for M&amp;M X, and will likely not enjoy it as much as your usual entertainment. Legacy utilises mechanics and design concepts that are more and more in this day and age, seen by the mainstream as archaic, outdated and unnecessary, such as turn-based combat, grid-based movement, and relatively little wiggle room for difficulty on the harder setting. If any of this doesn&apos;t sound like your cup of tea, M&amp;M X is not for you.
<br>
<br>If you are a fan of previous Might and Magic titles, there is plenty of nostalgia for you to enjoy here. Despite a clearly limited budget and (probably) very little support from the publisher (though who can really blame them with such a niche title - let&apos;s be thankful they made it at all), there is plenty of love and care lavished on M&amp;M X. The creative director is a huge fan of the series, and has made this game with painstaking reference to the previous titles, rather than trying to reboot the series with new graphics and mechanics.
<br>
<br>Might and Magic X stays true to its legacy in basically all the important ways. The only things lacking here for a Might and Magic fan are that there are no non-combat skills (the game is completely combat focused - this is not really a negative, they had a fairly low budget, and the publisher was testing the waters), the game is set in the relatively bland fantasy world of Ashan (ala Heroes of Might and Magic V and VI), and it unfortunately requires Uplay to run.
<br>
<br>Still, I&apos;m not complaining. After a decade or so, I finally have my hands on some awesome new Might and Magic again. Hopefully sales are strong enough that Ubi is willing to continue the series. Props to you, Ubisoft, for getting this made. For the next installment, give the guys at Limbic a bigger budget and some more creative freedom, and see what they come up with.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - If you like the (early) Might and Magic series, you&apos;ll like this. If you aren&apos;t turned off by low(ish) budget graphics or &quot;archaic&quot; turn-based combat, M&amp;M X is probably worth a try. Would get a 10 if they brought back Alchemy, Enchanting, Shops and Homes with pre-rendered backgrounds, and mah Horseshoes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3934743">Expand</a></span>

<br>I bought the game last week and have played to it for hours. This is difficult to explain the feeling and experience this game has provided to me, but it&apos;s really fresh and unique. This game manages perfectly to bring together exploration, RPG and tactical combats for a deep and challenging adventure you will never forget.

Just don&apos;t expect a cutscene-heavy, &quot;cinematic&quot; RPG, MMX is pure gameplay with a very basic story, but a nice balance between open-world exploration and turn-based combat, tons of dungeons, creatures and powerful items to find.
<br>
<br>This is one of those games that gets the character progression just right - you feel really helpless in the beginning, struggling to kill a bunch of wolves without someone dying, and the game stays difficult until the end (on warrior difficulty), but in the end, once your characters have earned their promotions and have got grandmaster ranks, they finally begin to feel powerful, annihilating hordes of monsters with a few spells, which feels really satisfying.
<br>
<br>One thing that I didn&apos;t like about the combat mechanics is that once you enter melee range there is no way to move around, and no way whatsoever to escape from a bad encounter. Because there is a lot of exploration involved, and because even the starting area contains some creatures that are unbeatable until much later, this results in frequent save/load abuse. Scripted &quot;trapped&quot; chests or doors that cause enemies to spawn behind your back are also quite lame for the same reason, thankfully there are not too many of those.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3957553">Expand</a></span>

I played parts from V to IX, and really played them, probably for months. Games then were not like they are now, you had to write little things down in order to remember them later, like &quot;Where can I train master of Earth magic skill&quot;. I didn&apos;t have internet back then and games were much harder and more exciting just because you had to put some effort and didn&apos;t have this &quot;instant knowledge&quot; we all have access to now.
<br>My long and boring introduction is meant to say: I like this game. Reminds me of a better time for games. It is old school by all means, it has a grid-turn-based movement and combat system like some older parts in the series had. The production values are not up-to par with the current standards, but the game definitely has charm and I was eager to come from work to play it (30 years old now). Dungeons are a contrast to some of the outdoor scenery, it seems the authors put a lot more effort designing those. They are quite beautiful at times and their design and layout is different in almost every one, which I particularly liked (its not &quot;you&apos;ve seen one cave, you seen them all&quot;).
<br>Combat is a bit repetitive, but somehow, still engaging and satisfying. The atmosphere in some dungeons is quite spooky which really adds to the enjoyment. There is also all sorts of old school puzzles (pressure plates, switches...), secret walls, secret rooms and such. Also, this is the first game in a long time I was actually interested in reading quest notes, books I found, listened to lore from NPC&apos;s, so I can say the quests were quite interesting and most importantly, you have to do them without map markers and quest arrows.
<br>Finally, I would really recommend this game to anyone willing to play a solid, charming, quite old-school RPG. If you are very young, you will perhaps feel some of the magic of the old, and if you are an old school gamer... well, you will have a strong, pleasant nostalgia feeling all the way to the end game screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3942880">Expand</a></span>

Pure retro gaming with beautiful modern overlay. Nice visuals and hand-drawn pictures, catchy gameplay and storyline, engaging character development, challenging tactical combat, it&apos;s all there. You can clearly see this game has been created with love and respect for the original series and when it worked I had a great time that lasted for about 60 hours of gampeplay...
<br>
<br>BUT... they rushed the release! Not sure if the devs or publisher is to blame, but this is unacceptable. Legacy is massively infested with game breaking bugs that it&apos;s almost unplayable in places. Graphic glitches, low-res or missing textures, stuttering, really badly optimized engine causing overheating of the GPU, audio problems, quest errors, missing crucial quest items, crashes to desktop, corrupt saves, completely missing quest tokens in journal, unfinished cinematics, missing voice-overs, even ending of the game resulted in a crash and the final boss didn&apos;t even bother to show up. This is the worst case of the buggy disaster I have ever played and it just saddens me that it must have happened with such a beautiful game in it&apos;s core. It almost feels like you&apos;re playing a beta and you&apos;re paying the full price for this game to be their beta tester.
<br>
<br>This could have been easily 10/10 piece and I just love the heart of this game, the atmosphere and the experience when it works, I even love the nice deluxe packaging with cloth map and all the goodies, this could have been really something, but the overall experience has been so damaged by bugs, that I am being extremely generous by giving this 8. When they patch everything and fix all the bugs (and I hope they will eventually), this will be the full score. For now - 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988446">Expand</a></span>

The voice overs are weak. The more I played the better the game became. The voice overs do not get better and the graphics are of a dated style. But it does recall might and magic world of xeen.  The movement is grid-based and combat is turn-based. Many might be turned off by that but old-school gamers may find it refreshing and nostalgic. The full release of the game is much improved over the early release version. The  combat in the game relies heavily on planning for the types of mobs you fight and even using the environment to lure enemies around corners. You can easily run into areas where the mobs are far stronger then your party and you will have to seek the right path to get stronger. The only complaints I have so far is that I do wish the story was stronger and the spell graphics where better. Add that voice overs could be more varied. Other then that so far I have truly enjoyed the game so far. I will agree with some of the negative comments that the game could be better optimized and there are some bugs that need work. As of the time of my review the developers have commented they are aware of them and are working on it. Despite its flaws, the price of the game plus what I have seen so far makes MM legacy a worthwhile game. I hope that Ubisoft will continue with the series and bring us more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3952279">Expand</a></span>

Normally I wouldn&apos;t compare games to others in a review, but the quality of this game really lies somewhere in between MM1 and 2.  It&apos;s got potential to remake the series, but really does start back at the beginning.
<br>
<br>The major problem is a common one these days.  Too much focus on graphics, not enough on the game.  It will never have the level of story or immersion that World of Xeen had (or the clever mixing of two titles) because of the work needed to add any resources to the game.
<br>
<br>The UI also takes away from immersion into the game.  Much of it is about as awkward as forcing a recent game to adhere to an old-school grid system (go figure).  Small text, slow response on conversations, and many other issues make doing anything a bit of a hassle.  It&apos;s better than beta, but still has some way to go to truly be an immersive game.
<br>
<br>The game itself is fine, and a bit entertaining.  I had a hard time deciding between a 6 or 7.  But don&apos;t expect anything to really draw you in.  It&apos;s a mish-mash of all old ideas that weren&apos;t even all the best ideas of the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933437">Expand</a></span>

There is no similiar game on market with such a depth and 4 charackters in one party. Grimrock is meh with real time and mouse clicking combat.

<br>Dont look at bad pro reviews they didn&apos;t play game at all there are generic same screenshots in every bad review. MMX is true Might and magic succesor.

<br>Overall, this game satisfies a great sweet spot if you were reared on old-school RPGs - not every game needs to look/play like Witcher 3 to provide fun, entertaining gameplay.  Think of this game in the same wheelhouse as the Grimrock series and you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933850">Expand</a></span>

It just looked bizarre to me, with its mix of sci-fi and fantasy and the overall feel. So, from the Might and Magic series I have only played 6, 8 and 9, with 9 being my favorite. I did lay some tile-based RPG such as Eye of Beholder, and others. So to me the main reason for buying this game was the Ashan universe, which I love, and the overall game experience that I thought would be similar to 9. Well, its not really. But that&apos;s the good thing. Because this game is awesome.
<br>
<br>This game is very brave, I give you respect for trying out such a game in this period of mindless shooters. So thank you devs. At first, it was hard t o me to get into tile-based game like that, but the more I play the more I love it! It has its unique feel and charm to it, so please don&apos;t change it to a free roam in out of battle situations. However, I am all for more speedy movements out of battle when holding W for example.
<br>
<br>The game is very vivid and colourful. Despite some washed out textures, I think the game looks extremely good. It is a thinking man game. So many possibilities! Skills stats, spells, hirelings. Love all these old-school mechanics. Teamwork  Other players made a lot of suggestions lately, and I agree with most of them. But just some points I would like to make:
<br>
<br>About reusing Heroes 6/DoC assets: at first, I thought it was a bad idea but in the game it looks really fitting and impressive. So don&apos;t worry about that, at least for me, even though I played a lot of heroes 6, it does not seem boring or repetitious.
<br>
<br>Overall thank you for making this game, I wish you all the luck and success.
<br>
<br>Solid 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3451623">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is more linear than a dry noodle and the main map is by far the shortest might and magic world , wish they kept the &quot;choose evil or good alignment allies&quot; path from the older games like in mm7 and most of the side missions are uninspired , at one point near the end of the game there&apos;s a side mission you must complete in order to progress further into the story , so why not just put it as a main one?.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4132378">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Make no mistake, this game is a throwback to those days and compares quite favorably to M&amp;M VI (arguably the best in the series). I would like to see more enemy variety, but so far the developer has been churning out little blurbs of content on a pretty regular basis, so I am not too worried.
<br>
<br>Even on the default setting, this game does not hold your hand and you can be prepared for some tough and interesting battles. Like the RPGs of yore, it is quite possible to wander into a group of foes you simply can&apos;t handle early on in the game.
<br>
<br>This is worth a look if you are a fan of oldschool CRPGs or simply wish to try something &quot;new&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965389">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game certainly isn&apos;t for everyone but it isn&apos;t just for old school rpg fans either. While the game will be a solid nostalgia rush for any fans of the early M&amp;M and 90&apos;s Western RPGs, it still stands on its own feet well and doesn&apos;t need that nostalgia to be an enjoyable title.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t played a game like it before then the grid based movement and the first person turn based combat will be quite jarring but trust me, after a few hours of playing it&apos;ll become second nature and you&apos;ll be loving it. It&apos;s a title that does take a bit of getting into to, and it&apos;s pretty difficult [the first boss on the lower difficulty is quite likely to kill you and the game isn&apos;t forgiving about it] but if you&apos;re an rpg fan then I&apos;d highly recommend this.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also incredibly excited to see this type of game making a return in some form, so here&apos;s to hoping that M&amp;M XI followins in the footsteps of M&amp;M6-8!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962641">Expand</a></span>

<br>The music is reminiscent of some of the classic Might &amp; Magic titles as well as the Heroes of Might and Magic series. Sound effects are simple and repetitive.
<br>
<br>Playability: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;
<br>Easy controls and interface like its predecessors.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;
<br>If your familiar with games of the past like the Wizardry series or the Might &amp; Magic games, you will love this title as it takes you down memory lane but for those who are new to these type of games may get bored as the gameplay may get repetitive.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;
<br>I feel the game has a High replay value especially since your party consists of 4 members and there are a total of 12 possible Classes to mix and match with the 4 races.

<br>MY PERSONAL REVIEW
<br>
<br>The Game takes place a few years after the events of Might &amp; Magic: Heroes VI. Might &amp; Magic X - Legacy takes place on the Agyn Peninsula. It&apos;s a throwback to the hack-and-slash RPGs of old and no knowledge of the past series is required to play it. You can create a Four person party consisting of 4 Races and 12 Classes to select from. While the party size is locked at four, players can pick up additional hirelings to fill specialized needs that give certain buffs or the pack horse that adds a considerable amount of inventory space which I found a must. The classes offer lots of skills and spells to choose from. The individual skills can be ranked up starting at novice and going up to Grandmaster. Some of the spells you get at Grandmaster are devastating but the road to get there is a long one. If you liked the Diablo style loot drops than you&#x2019;ll like this game as there is a ton of different types of loot. The game adds some puzzle and riddle solving to take away from the constant combat grind.  Players can roam towns to find various power ups, coins, and quests that send them out into the wilderness. The game offers about 60+ Hours of play time if you explore every nook and cranny and take the time to read all the Lore it offers. This game is nothing like the Heroes of might &amp; Magic series but if you liked games of the past like the Wizardry or Eye of the Beholder series or even the new Legend of Grimrock than this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944557">Expand</a></span>

The core of the game is tactical combat with many strategic options, and in fact it plays like a combination of the HoMM series with Ultima series.
<br>
<br>Rather than major on  the FPS, Action roleplays that saturate the market, here is an elegant updating of the oldschool  turn-based interface.
<br>
<br>The automapping is serene because you can turn and move either in-map, or in 3d. The options for combat are hotbarred, and very extensive.
<br>
<br>The square grid allows you to retrace and check that all areas have been explored, and also keeps track of shops and trainers in a very economical way. Yes it might feel a bit clunky, but in the mind the action flows sequentially, if you can get over the turn based idiom.
<br>
<br>There are some minor niggles as listed elsewhere - the potions resetting to the best and overwriting the lesser potions on the hotbar is currently annoying me, but this is really a wholesome retro experience, the likes of which have been absent for 5 years. Like buses they come in twos and Blackguards launched right over the top of it.
<br>
<br>Do yourself a favour though - rather than debating which is slightly better or cheaper, get both, and play them for the next 5 years until they next revisit the old school.
<br>
<br>Ignore the guys reviewing this as a modern fps action roleplay - do yourself a favour and get (back) into what retro rpgs were all about....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3960936">Expand</a></span>

<br>What did I enjoy the most?  Probably the character progression and loot, both of these elements were done nicely and I enjoyed experiencing how my character level-up choices and a new skill level or legendary piece of equipment directly improved my character&apos;s in game combat abilities.
<br>Things that were limited: the balance was off, i.e. combat became far too easy later on in the game, the grid based system really made the world and whole experience seem overly &apos;structured&apos; and the quests and story were a bit lack-luster.
<br>
<br>A fun game while it lasted but I am happy to have it finished to be able to move onto another game. In my opinion Legend of Grimrock did this grid based &apos;old-school&apos; style of game much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4556317">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In theory the game was great.  In practice it wasn&apos;t quite what I had hoped for.  The graphics are good and it does indeed feel much like the classic games that I had missed, but the difficulties of the enemies seemed higher then it should be at parts.  But that isn&apos;t because they were too hard, it is because the game gave you no direction.
<br>
<br>It did very little in leading you to where you needed to be.  I am all for open world games, but to be effective in an open world game you still have to have some kind of guidance to know where it is level appropriate to be or at least have the creatures in the world scale to your level.  This game doesn&apos;t do that.  If you aren&apos;t careful you will find yourself over-whelmed very quickly.
<br>
<br>But if you are looking for a game to play to remind you of the &quot;good old days&quot; or if you are younger wanting to know what you old man&apos;s RPG games were like, then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5138853">Expand</a></span>

Best parts of MM was 6 and 7 but this is far from it .. they came from heroes 3 and that was also great game but this comes from heroes 6 and thats also average or even below.. Skill system is weak combat feels too simple.Technically very weak game.Sounds are ok.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3939555">Expand</a></span>

<br>So you have 4 heroes in a town and you after short walk in the city you are fighting spiders in cave and then you die. This game is ruthless you go and see Cyclops and your first time out in the open and you don&apos;t stand a change. In the good old days that happened, we did not do balance in those days.

I got surrounded by mobs of dozen &quot;elite&quot; enemies or so. Some of them like the ghouls do so much damage they can barely be handled and they all have huge amounts of health.. The game has horrible balancing issues. In addition add that you can rest only limited amounts of times until you run out of supplies which you buy in taverns, there is very few health potions you can buy,  equipment stores rarely have anything worth buying and the little good stuff they do have is ridiculously expensive you have to spend all your money. You have a locked quick-bar unlike other rpg&apos;s meaning you  run out of space for placing spells, potions, etc. There is no fast travel making going back to towns for resupply a chore and huge time waster, enemies don&apos;t respawn so there is no point in walking back to town. Character creation is very disappointing as well. You have two portraits and two voice templates to choose from per gender and thats it. There aren&apos;t that many classes to choose from either, 3 for each of the 4 races, classes aren&apos;t that good either. I am quite disappointed by this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4445269">Expand</a></span>

<br>Next, the fighting is now ONLY turn-base, I miss the time when I could run about to shoot and avoid arrows by monsters.
<br>
<br>Then and again, I always hated the loots and items in M&amp;M9, because I don&apos;t like tiny icons of items. And here we have, not only icons of items, but a &apos;table&apos; for the baggage~
<br>
<br>And if I am not wrong... even M&amp;M6 has a much much open space to move and travel.
<br>
<br>And Legacy is not going to have a sci-fiction ending, and worse...
<br>
<br>...while I can see attempts on making a beautiful graphical game, I hate the idea of damages popping... and the highlighting of enemies... so childish! So unnatural! Is this &apos;Pokemon game&apos; for kids?
<br>
<br>I am giving a rating of 2 because of the enhance graphics... but the graphical expression is really ridiculous!
<br>
<br>And yes... after M&amp;M9, now we have not NPCs to visit but pictures of homes... ... and many many things in Legacy which I think... ain&apos;t right. And I miss the streets of M&amp;M9 littered with NPCs~</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4189469">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d hold off a couple of months and buy it during the next steam sale when it&apos;ll be about a third of the price.</span>

Ridiculous amounts of game breaking bugs, terrible framerate drops for no apparent reason on certain hardware, a paper thin storyline, the most drawn out, long winded, tedious, eye droopingly BORING introduction to any game I have EVER seen.. ever.
<br>
<br>Nevermind that if you try to create an original party (something that was always oodles of fun in previous M&amp;M games.. the game outright punishes you and can actively PREVENT you from proceeding in the game!  Game routinely either outright limits the mobs w/ no respawn or even different areas to go to.
<br>
<br>When it&apos;s NOT limiting (re-crippling) your options, it&apos;s outright slamming you.  Turn a corner in an area?  Suddenly get smashed by monsters WAY out of your league.  Previous MM games?  RUN AWAY.. this one?  Nope.  Screw you, die.  You CANNOT disengage or run away from anything.. once you get into combat.. you either win or die.  While this might sound amusing.. akin to Dark Souls, at least Dark Souls had SOME pacing to it.. this does not.  In the Undercity, I literally discovered the hard way by simply taking the &quot;wrong&quot; tunnel in the SAME map as I was directed to go too... only to get my party 2 shotted by Ravenous Ghouls that were WAY above any level I could have possibly achieved at that point in the game.
<br>
<br>Bottom line - This is a turd that will quickly (hopefully) be forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943174">Expand</a></span>

Namely one that said it was a rough start, but gets great.  First dungeon, you get poisoned.  This is awesome, because it is persistent and you cannot counter it yet, which you sort of figure out by resting multiple times and it not going away.  Of course, this is not communicated, but a quick Google shows that you have to run back to the temple to heal...  just like Diseases.  So two labels for the same game mechanic; apparently we have learned nothing in 20+ years of game design.  Now that you are poisoned, after defeating one spider, you run back to temple and pay to be cured.  This repeats, because spiders are poisonous and you can do nothing about it.  Finally, the first boss, which requires every potion you have, leaves all of your party poisoned.  You try to make it back to temple, but then realize that you get limited rests. So you die.  In the city. After the first dungeon.  On normal.  With the default party.  Within one hour of gameplay.  This is not nostalgic gaming; it is poor game design.  They used something great as a template and did not innovate.  So if immediate difficulty and lack of knowledge transfer is what you are interested in, spend the $25 and get ready for hours of what some might label frustration, but you apparently call &apos;fun.&apos;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943365">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is not good, its buggy, unbalanced, poorly designed, and just not fun anyway.
<br>
<br>Im not sure there&apos;s really potential in a turn based game like this though. The combat strategy would have to continually evolve and change as the game progresses for it to be interesting for the whole game. What ends up happening is you figure out the basics on how to successfully battle enemies, and then the rest of the game is pretty tedious with very little change to those initial tactics you figure out. a new spell here and there or new equipment do not really change much about the combat other than a small boost here or there. so basically this game gets boring as hell in the last half of it. at least in MM6-8 you could blaze through stuff in the later stages of the game because no turn based combat.
<br>
<br>a couple things i did like though:
<br>- the class system is well designed and *should* give it replayability - only certain classes can grandmaster in certain skills, so class makeup is going to be pretty unique to your playing experience. after beating the game, though, no way in hell i would play this again to try a different class makeup, just too boring.
<br>- some pretty good puzzles. the combat is really boring, so this is the only real interesting part of the game. there were a few that were roughly comparable with the legend of grimrock puzzles.
<br>
<br>if all of the bugs were gone, and the game was more balanced and properly tweaked, better sound, fix load times etc... i&apos;d still only give this game a 6 or so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3971589">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Personally, I&apos;m on the fence about this one. I came into PC gaming with Might &amp; Magic IV: The Mandate of Heaven, which was basically a new starting point for the Might &amp; Magic series. It was a fantastic game, with a huge open world, tons of loot, and huge amounts of enemies. Eventually the series would crash hard with Might &amp; Magic IX, which was basically a bug-infested travesty. A shame, and when the news came out that Might &amp; Magic would return for a tenth instalment, I was very, VERY happy. I mean, with all the technical possibilities we have today, and the series it was based upon, it HAD to be a great game right?
<br>
<br>Well...not really.
<br>
<br>Sadly M&amp;MX isn&apos;t based on the fantastic sixth/seventh/eight instalments of the series, but rather on the ancient first five. Great games in itself, but gaming has moved on, and not for nothing. Of course, it is &quot;hip&quot; to go &quot;old school&quot;, yet now we have a game that only sad, stuck in their ways men (no woman will play this, EVER) will love. The rest might like it, but most will give it a pass.
<br>
<br>My main beef with this game is that they went back to turn-based grit movement/combat. This makes the entire game feel very sluggish and slow, less open world, and, especially, very old. I used to love it when I could just run around a map full of enemies, pelting away arrows and spells at a huge group of enemies. It was one of the best parts of the newer older games (VI to IX). In M&amp;M X, you have to move grit by grit and wait until the enemy is within range for some slow turn-based combat. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the combat works, but it&apos;s not much fun when you have to do it against every single enemy. But I guess it&apos;s one way to make a 20 hour game last over 50...
<br>
<br>Graphics are a bit dodgy for 2014, but the M&amp;M series was never a graphic marvel so it&apos;s easily overlooked. They work, let&apos;s just keep it at that.
<br>
<br>Sound is solid, with some epic music that hits the spot.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is OK, if you don&apos;t mind very slow turn-based fights. You need to use your smarts, especially in the beginning of the game, and that might put some people right off. The lack of &quot;modern&quot; implementations like fast travel or town portals is another thing that will make a lot of people leave this game alone. You have to walk, in turned based fashion no less, over the entire map to cities, if you need to buy a rations/potions/level skills. It&apos;s a chore, one that should have been lightened by including a town portal spell (even if it was on a CD).
<br>
<br>Still, the game is fun in it&apos;s own way. You get a real feeling of accomplishment when your piss-poor party slowly turns into a lean mean slaughtering machine when you level them the right way and pimp them out with the right kind of equipment. There is loot is a-plenty, and even though it is never spectacular (even artifacts, sort of unique items, won&apos;t blow your mind) it is a joy to sell off big amounts of stuff you don&apos;t need to buy equipment you do, or to find stuff you can actually use (take that Diablo 3...). Also there is plenty to discover, in a big more or less open world. It&apos;s RPG heaven really.
<br>
<br>This game would have gotten a solid 9 from me, if they wouldn&apos;t have walked the trendy &quot;old school&quot; line. It&apos;s aged and therefore bothersome gameplay (turn-based movement in a grit, no quick ways to travel),  sadly takes a lot of fun out of the game. It might be great for old farts who like to complain on the internet about &quot;how great games used to be&quot;, but for more modern or casual gamers, it can be off putting. And that&apos;s a shame. Oh well, better next time!

I wasn&apos;t following any news about it even though I consider myself a big fan of the series (especially M&amp;M 6). After getting some info about the game I got really excited about it. Moder remake of old-scool RPG - yes please!
<br>
<br>The beginings weren&apos;t very impressive. Character creation system seemed unimaginative and available classes look very imbalanced when it comes to what each of them can offer.
<br>After creating my first group of adventurers I was ready for some action.
<br>
<br>First things that struck me were graphics and movement. Graphics do feel oldschool but I&apos;m not sure if that is a good thing. Movement is just so oldschool that it is a big step back compared to M&amp;M 6 - released almost 16 years ago... There is absolutely zero freedom about moving around - we can only follow square tiles - yep, squares, not even hexagons! It makes even simplest chores as running around town frustrating experience and it takes at least a couple of hours to get used to it.
<br>
<br>Difficulty is also worh mentioning. Playing on warrior - more difficult mode - the only challange is to create a good party of characters. Playing the game for ~15 hrs I can only tell that physical damage dealers are mostly wasted character slots and while my first group of mixed classes was having lots of trouble with some enemies, my second group - full of casters - was just destroying everyone. Hint: instead of heavy armored tank you might want to choose a mage with a set of defensive spells.
<br>
<br>Combat is another step back from M&amp;M6. Most of the time we fight less than 4 enemies at the time. Real time combat is gone. Whenever we get engaged i melee combat we can&apos;t move... The list goes on and on so the fact remains - seemingly simple combat that M&amp;M series would offer us got simplified even further making it less enjoyable, more random and basically - worse.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong - the game can be quite fun at times. But I couldn&apos;t stop the feeling that I would have much more fun playing M&amp;M 6 one more time.
<br>
<br>At this point I would rate the game around 6 or 7, simply because after some time you kinda get used to all those frustrating mechanics and you can focus on having fun BUT:
<br>
<br>After about 15 hours played the game crashed. Ok, happened before, no big deal. After launching the game again I realised ALL of my saved games were gone. Boom! Game over, play again?
<br>
<br>No, thanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941985">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I got MnM X several days after it was offered for Early Access, as I love oldschool first-
<br>person party RPGs and loved how Legend of Grimrock turned out. The game had many issues, both design-wise and tech-wise and up to a point I actively reported them on forums, etc. and for the most part it seemed like the developers listened.
<br>
<br>Today the full product was released on Steam and I regret I ever spent my time and money on it. Starting from the top, here&apos;s what is very wrong with this game:
<br>
<br>Game is completely crippled if you run it on a 32-bit Windows. The developers decided to put a
<br>cap on texture quality and the best you will get is MEDIUM textures that literally look like Quake 2.
<br>
<br>Even with EVERYTHING ELSE maxed out - terrain details, terrain quality, view distance and object detail are set to ULTRA, the game still looks pitiable. The developers obviously lack the most basic knowledge of asset and RAM management and decided to make up for it by simply cutting ambient sounds and higher texture detail from the game when it&apos;s run on Win 32-bit.
<br>
<br>This alone is absolutely ridiculous, especially as PC setups that can run Crysis 2 maxed out (mine included) will be greeted by this blurry mess just because they run 32-bit. Such programming sloppiness is, to me, simply inexcusable.
<br>
<br>Further, the game lacks some very simple and fundamental features such as 16x10 resolution support. The official developer explanation for this is this: &quot;Our team focused is efforts to offer the best game experience and we had to make some choices (converting 2D assets to 16:10 would have required lot more time). You still can play on 16:9.&quot;
<br>
<br>This is like saying &#x201C;Well, we know that you didn&#x2019;t want a handheld vacuum cleaner, but look how comfy it is!&#x201D; This is also not something that came up in the last minute. I wrote about the lack of 16x10 support back in August 2013 and got pretty much the same response, together with a vague promise that it MAY make it in the full game. Well, it didn&#x2019;t, much like a Mac release that should have come together with the PC one.
<br>
<br>The game is a fine example of technical incompetence on almost every level imaginable. There is horrendous object pop-in even with &#x2018;view distance&#x2019; and object detail maxed out. Combine this with the state of textures on 32-bit Win that make Quake 2 look good and you get one of the worst launches by devs that simply lied that they will optimize their game back in September 2013 and obviously cut huge corners while pushing for release.
<br>
<br>I wanted to like this game. I was hugely into it, I had such high hopes for it. Sadly, in the end it ended up this clumsy, ugly, broken, incompetent mess full of broken developer promises. I am deeply sorry but I cannot and will not stand for this.
<br>
<br>In closing, I recommend that you save your money or simply give it to a developer who is not so incompetent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3932938">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing PC videogames for nearly two decades now, starting off playing games in Dos. And have been playing games on PCs on a regular basis ever since.  I can&apos;t remember which of the M&amp;M games I&apos;ve played in the series, I believe 4, 5, and 6, It&apos;s been a long time but I remember enjoying those games.
<br>
<br>Ok so, I&apos;ll start off by pointing out some of the things I actually didn&apos;t mind about the game. The character creation and party system was well laid out. I enjoyed creating my team. It was well fleshed out, customization could be improved but I&apos;ve never been huge on altering every little detail in a character model anyway so no loss there for me.
<br>
<br>This game is heavily tile based, and not in a nice way. My main beef here is not that it&apos;s tile based, but how poorly done the tile based gameplay is. You can only face four directions, movement feels very mechanical, not natural at all. I just had this intense feeling of the layout being, well, lazy. Within ten minutes of playing it I saw at least a dozen simple fixes that should have been implemented, things that would make the experience more rich and detailed, but instead you&apos;re left with a clunky unnatural design and I just couldn&apos;t get into it. One of the things I enjoyed about the other M&amp;M games was you really felt like you were part of the game, and with this game that feeling was completely gone.
<br>
<br>I could only play it for another hour maybe, and I really tried to like it, but I couldn&apos;t. The storyline seemed poorly scripted, and all around I just had this feeling like they could have done a lot better with almost every aspect of the game. It felt rushed, and as I said earlier, just had a feeling of laziness about it. You couldn&apos;t even get much of a nostalgia factor out of it, as the graphics seemed like they might have been trying to compete with more recent games, but well, failed. They could have used other styles of graphics that didn&apos;t try to do the 3D model rendering, but they went that route instead, and everything is just chunky and unrealistic. I&apos;m not playing a game like this for graphics, don&apos;t get me wrong, but ya...
<br>
<br>All around I&apos;m really disappointed with this game, and am kind of surprised how many positive reviews it&apos;s had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3958491">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are pretty decent, nothing to complain here. BUT it brings my graphics card to new heat records. If it would be summer, i would probably die because of heat stroke. Or my graphics card before me. Now, it&apos;s just lowering my heating costs... but i dont think thats a plus for a game.
<br>Furthermore, i have RIDICULOUS slowdowns when moving from square to square in some areas of the game, and thats, although i thought it&apos;s hardly possible, making the square movement even worse.
<br>
<br>The tile world map is confusing and i felt completely lost way too often. With no quest markers, you just explore the map, find enemies that are too hard, explore elsewhere, get raped with a one-hit-kill by even harder enemies, explore, cant walk over water, searching, searching, searching, oh whats is that *PEWPEWPEW* DEAD, ok now what... f*** this game!!!!!! click on the quit button and write an angry review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3940217">Expand</a></span>

Maybe not a true 10/10 but it&apos;s maybe the last decent game from Ubisoft ever and that deserves a good score. If you liked Xeen, don&apos;t doubt about picking this game up. Even my father has played this game (he also played Xeen back in the days) and mostly all he is doing is the Sims :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5750691">Expand</a></span>

<br>The paste in M&amp;M is slow, the combat turnbased, the loot rare and the game very enjoyable. I spent a lot of time googling, looking for places and clues to riddles.
<br>It&#xB4;s a great game, it really is and unfortunately they don&#xB4;t make a lot of these anymore.

It&apos;s for an audience who doesn&apos;t care about CryEngine but wants challenging and deep combat with lots of depth to the story, the world, the mechanics, etc. This game achieves all that while being accessible to newcomers and while looking and playing good enough (like LoG but better!) to not scare away everyone.

If you are a modern gamer, get this if you want to try something different to the usual 1 character pew pew pew shooting fire out your hands thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/might-magic-x-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4099252">Expand</a></span>
