You don&apos;t have to be an aviation nut (I am), you don&apos;t have to enjoy steampunk (It helps) and you certainly don&apos;t have to dedicate hours (which I sometimes do) to enjoy this title. It&apos;s the type of game that you can log in for 30 minutes and leave with some great memorable game experiences.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been beta testing since August, and I have to say, impressed is an understatement. The Muse Games team has a real gem of a game and here&apos;s why:
<br>
<br>1. Voice Feature. Sounds simple, but really, how many games do you play today that has a push to talk feature built into the game? This voice feature really enhances the game experience and promotes dialogue among strangers. This is worth it&apos;s weight in gold.
<br>
<br>2. Continual improvements. While this game just left Beta, that doesn&apos;t mean the team is slowing down, they are constantly adding new content, new maps and are focusing on producing a persistent DLC adventure mode. 3. Balancing. Ships feel well balanced, as does the logistics, the development team is doing a great job of addressing player concerns on a case by case basis. There is room for improvement, but as is, the game feels polished and engaging. The one point I&apos;d dock is for lack of an ability to fire on another ship with a blunderbuss or a pistol. I hope they re-evaluate there position on this, but as it stands, this is a ship-to-ship strategy game.
<br>
<br>4. Graphics and Audio. Pump that settings up to high and fly your way through a very beautiful world. Muse has created some very interesting environments that allows for some very fun gameplay options. When your in there world, you feel immersion, excitement and drama.
<br>
<br>5. Developer Team. Very small but very connected to the community, they listen and they respond to the tester team, they continually improve the game and they keep a very transparent policy when it comes to artistic direction, technical specs and resolving issues. I see this team growing along with there wonderful concept of a game.
<br>
<br>Now go buy the game and see what I&apos;m talking about. You will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2722372">Expand</a></span>

Captians have to talk the other teams Captians to organize attacks. Engineers and Gunners will often spot an enemy long before the Captain sees it. And of course when the ship is damaged sometimes everyone has to chip in an repair. Lots of frantic shouting over the games voice communication normally leads to success. A great game if you have a bunch of friends that want to man a steampunk combat airship with you.
<br>
<br>2) Graphics: Very good at making yo feel like you are flying. Lots of cool smoke and cloud effects. Could use a little work here and there but overall very convincing and good. 3) Gameplay: There are three classes to choose from Captian (Pilot), Engineer, or Gunner. Obviously the Pilot is very important for the success of the ship. He/she has to constantly evaluate where the best place is for the ship. It helps if you have a crew that communicates... ie hey move the ship to the left a little so I can actually hit an enemy (since the guns have limited movement), or hey there is an enemy below us (since the Pilot can&apos;t see everything). Altitude advantage and knowing where your guns are is important. The Engineer is very meh for me... you run around trying to repair stuff or buff stuff. The Engineer can man guns but he has limited types of ammunition o choose from. Still... good engineers can really increase a ships survivability. The gunner is just raw fun. Point and shoot at stuff. Use cool ammo and make stuff blow up! Regardless of what class you play, EVERYONE has to chip in to help the ship succeed. Voice chat (already provided) is great in this game. There are also a large variety of guns and ship classes with different pros and cons. 4) Interface/match making. This aspect needs some work. It would be nice to be able to just form a party with a group of friends and join an available match. Also there are some glitches where you will exit out of match (you can rejoin though. Overall, for $20 its great for some cheap thrills with friends. You can just hop in for a thirty minute romp. Or you can play all night. Its a casual game but has some depth too. Its very novel and fun. As long as the developers keep working on it (and they seem to be) this game will grow into something awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2726224">Expand</a></span>

The biggest reason why I did not played this game after is because it requires some serious team communication to even destroy a single ship. Back than I did not have any friends who played this game so maintaining a ship and trying to fight was not so smooth. However recently this game went on sale for $7.50 for 4 copies of the game so i bought two 4 pack bundle and played with 7 of my other friends controlling the 2 ship. I got to say when you have a team communication with your crews and captain of other ship in your team you can have some major fun in this game. It is worth the money you paid for. When you are in the middle of battle screaming for orders from captain and all the explosions happening around you, you will be seriously immersed in this game. Now if you will be playing this game with your friends it is no doubt 9 or even 10/10 but I have got to say it can get frustration and even seem very unfair and brutal if you play by yourself with uncoordinated team. So my final verdict is 8.5 out 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4196681">Expand</a></span>

The fact that you will be part of a crew of 5 ( i think ) is a very good factor. Communication in this game is the key to win. The Leader will pilot the ship whilst the powder monkeys will manage the guns and the engineers will repair any damaged parts. The only flaw of the game is there are different game modes but they are all identical (You just have to destroy destroy destroy) Its not a boring game at all, but it gets a bit repetitive. One more thing is that players can freely quit the game without any penalty. Graphics are very detailed, you could also customize your character for show. My conclusion: It is a very fun game, good communication system ( you just have to press x to talk ), good for co-op people, but just a bit repetitive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3922355">Expand</a></span>

If you cannot find that, you will not have a good time with Guns of Icarus Online. If you can&apos;t use a mic, then it is not a good idea to be a captain, for it is more than just flying a ship. These reasons are why I find that player retention is quite low.
<br>
<br>This game is an incredibly immersive experience. Several different ships that you&apos;ll need to learn the ins and outs of, the weaponry, tools, pilot and gunner slots.
<br>
<br>This game has a very high skill floor and skill ceiling, as every weapon you use has it&apos;s own arc, pattern, and momentum inheritance. Making just about every single shot you take require about as much skill as the next weapon. Not to mention that every weapon has their own unique damage types, some doing well at damaging certain areas of the enemy ships.
<br>
<br>This game features no progression system to get any new ships, weapons, tools, or slots. All of that is given to you at the start. There is an achievement and leveling system, and there are cosmetic rewards for earning those achievements and levels, as well as badges and prefix titles.
<br>
<br>Expect to wait in lobby&apos;s for anywhere between 10-30+ minutes. It takes time to build several crews! Thankfully, alt-tabbing won&apos;t crash you on most computers, so feel free to listen to some music. Or bring a gameboy while you wait in the lobby.
<br>
<br>The artwork is incredible as is the steampunk setting. The amount of cosmetics and dyes you can either purchase or earn will allow you to give your character a unique and stylish look so that you don&apos;t feel like some copy/paste clone.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy games that give you all the tools you need to succeed in the beginning. Absolutely no pay to win system, as well as a very well-made and well-balanced steampunk airship crew-style game. with a very high skill ceiling. You will love this. A lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4194228">Expand</a></span>

An original and engaging game, Guns of Icarus Online is an absolute thrill to play either with strangers in its matchmaking mode or with your own crew of steampunk rogues.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s really nothing like dashing in and out of pitched battle raining fire in your Squid, opening up a full broadside barrage with a Galleon or dashing in headlong with a Pyramidion, putting your navigational skills and cunning to the test.
<br>
<br>How about dashing to and fro, making your way through the inner corridors of a mighty Mobula, dousing fires and repairing damage as you, your toolkit and your technical ingenuity become the only things keeping the great beast afloat?
<br>
<br>Or maybe that&apos;s not your style. No, leave the fiddling about to the wrench jockeys. The gunner&apos;s for you. Be it taking your enemies apart piece by piece with the deadly accuracy of the Mercury Field Gun, or  simply letting loose with a gatling gun like Reb Brown (screaming optional but encouraged). Break out the big guns and fire off a few dozen missiles with the Manticore Hwacha, or turn their balloon to shredded cloth with the colossal Lumberjack mortar. If you&apos;re feeling particularly nasty, perhaps use incendiary rounds. Need one massive blast in a pinch? Let them have it with a single massive Lochnagar blast. The choice is yours, and there&apos;s plenty of it.
<br>
<br>Whatever your preference, you&apos;re sure to find a role in the best, most cohesive teamwork I&apos;ve ever seen in a game since the release of Artemis. Make no mistake, though. In the words of Malcolm Reynolds, only a fool don&apos;t know that his family&apos;s his crew, and if you haven&apos;t joined up with your own, you&apos;d best make friends fast, or there&apos;s no way you&apos;ll survive.
<br>
<br>The only reason I&apos;ve ranked this a ten is because I can&apos;t rank it higher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4050255">Expand</a></span>

It runs great, looks great (especially compared to other Unity Engine games) and is very enjoyable with a group of friends. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4195113">Expand</a></span>

There is no PvE mode, only competetive modes. Each ship has crew of 4 players on it, with different roles (gunner, engineer, pilot and one is additionaly a ship&apos;s captain). Co-op part of the game is done very well, victory usually depends on a good cooperation between crew members and ship captains. Surprisingly large amount of people use microphones and are actually willing to coop, so playing with randoms is perfectly viable if you don&apos;t expect to win every time. You can also play with bots in your team, and they are quite decent. Learning how to play it&apos;s quite easy and controls are pretty intuitive, so it&apos;s easy to pick up.
<br>There are various types of ships and captain can customize ship&apos;s weapons to his liking&apos;s, which is a good thing, but it could have been deeper than just weapons...You can also customize your character with special equipment (like special ammo types for gunner) which makes the game a bit more interesting, and customize looks of your character with a huge selection of masks, helmets, costumes and what not, however keep in mind that FOR MOST COSMETICS YOU HAVE TO PAY WITH REAL CASH  those that are free don&apos;t look hideous so you can enjoy it without paying. Also all usable items are unlocked for free, without paying.
<br>Technically game is quite good, very stable and with almost no glitches. Graphics look a little dated, and there are silly things like not being able to see other ships&apos; crew members, which makes you fight ghost ships that steer themselves.
<br>The game&apos;s main problem is lack of content. Even though devs are pumping content patches every now and then (over the course of 3 months it was hmm I think 1 ship and 1 new map, so not much  .
<br>It is getting bored really quickly, because there are about 4 maps in this, not counting the tutorial map which is just a huge empty desert. There is not enough equipment and ship types/weapons to keep you interested for long. It all becomes extremely retentive after a few days/weeks deepening on your repetitiveness tolerance. Having a friends as your crew certainly would help increase the fun though.
<br>
<br>Overall this is a decent game with a great price (I bought it for about 5  I think). Grab it if you like steampunk and co-op PvP games that are challenging but easy to pick up </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3759292">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. The Bugynis that most &quot;professionals&quot; are mentioning is no longer existent, shure there is the occasional bugs, but they are barley noticeable
<br>2. It requires a LARGE amount of Co-OP and with out communication and Cooperation you WILL lose and it WILL NOT BE PRETTY</span>

<br>You can play either deathmatch or capture point modes on 6 completely different ships with a 4-man crew in 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 team matches. Teamwork is extremely important but since the actualy work is pretty straightforward you don&apos;t feel burdened.
<br>
<br>Since you can choose the guns you&apos;re going to use on your ship there are a lot of really interesting and often crazy combinations you can try with endless results possible. Not to mention a lot of vanity items being either sold for a small price or freely distributed to players playing certain matches, along with steam workshop support.
<br>
<br>One of the things I found extremely intriguing of this game is that bullets have realistic recoil, drop, etc based on their weight, rotation, shape, etc. This makes gunner&apos;s job extremely interesting because with different guns you&apos;ll have to aim in completely different ways to hit your targets.
<br>The same goes for ships, you have mass, aceleration, max speed (simulating air friction) and mostly because of this flying a ship is EXTREMELY fun, not to mention strategies and combat tactics.
<br>What about the last class remaining, engineers, don&apos;t they have fun? Yeah they do, putting off fires,trying to repair parts faster than enemy gunners damage they take, etc.
<br>
<br>Gameplay aside you have extremely well designed graphic, all post-apocalyptic steampunk flavoured with stunning light effects (which you get to enjoy the most, flying in the skies). Not to mention the music, just a few themes but perfectly fitting the environment. Probably not 10/10 is the sound effect compartment, but still not below 9/10.
<br>
<br>Also, the game uses the Unity3D game engine, which means that it virtually supports any known to man device, and the devs did a good job on that so the game works (with cross platform internet play) on MS Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, PlayStation3, ...
<br>
<br>This game has (always had) just one big issue, since it&apos;s a niche game (actually almost the only of its kind) there are really few players connected at the same time around the world (200~500), still I have to say I never failed to play a match within at most a bunch of minutes from when I started searching for it.
<br>
<br>So, well, extremely suggested for everyone: you like chess play and such, go piloting your ship; you like to burst things down with huge cannons, go gunner; you don&apos;t like chess play and you&apos;re really bad at aiming, go engineer, and keep your crew alive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5055523">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s delicious and creamy with cherry on top if you can get your friends to play it  I unfortunately could not because my friends are not into steampunk (I&apos;m not either, or I wasn&apos;t untill I played this game). There are microtransactions but they are ONLY comsetics so don&apos;t worry about it and you get some of them for achievements. Graphics are pretty decent, airships look very detailed and interesting. It bored me after some time because of not much content atm (though they&apos;re producing new monthly) and because each match with random players is a roulette you can find friendly, experienced crew members or retarted kids with no brains and girly voices. Luckily it&apos;s usually the 1st case. Give it a try, don&apos;t hate steampunk untill you try it </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3197295">Expand</a></span>

The game is super easy to learn, and is some of the coolest gameplay I&apos;ve ever seen. Teamwork is a must, so if you don&apos;t have buddies to play with, it might not be the best game for you. My only complaint is that the in-game costumes for your character cost real money.</span>

While not High Victorian gaslight fiction, the post-apocalyptic setting has plenty of exploding airships, intricate Gatling guns, and dapper aeronauts clothed in leather and canvas.  The pace is hectic, and the amount of coordinated teamwork necessary for victory makes for a satisfying multiplayer experience. Playing with friends, with voice chat enabled, is very enjoyable.  The firefights are intense, but its also nice to sit back and watch the scenery go by in the calm before the storm. The artwork that surrounds you is  detailed and full of atmosphere.  Little touches, like film grain and post processing effects, really add to the experience and make it feel like you are part of an old film.  It&apos;s a little rough around the edges, but a fun time overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2927178">Expand</a></span>

Different ships, weapons, and character upgrades work together to make for many different strategies whether it is sticking back picking other ships off from a distance or running up and close in a speedy ship in hit and run missions or just bashing your way through on the tank of a ship absorbing damage but being a sitting duck compared to the more maneuverable and quicker ships. All the weapons and ships seem to be pretty well balanced, The important thing is that the four person crew works together. Voice chat is a plus and the in game voice chat makes that easy. Every now and then you get someone in a pick up game who refuses to work together but all in all the community seems to be very friendly and helpful in getting new players into the game and comfortable with the roles they choose. Combat is a good mix of frantic gunning  repairing  and piloting one minute then short breather and doing it all over again. Strategy lovers may enjoy the strategy and planning that goes in equipping their ship out with different combinations of weapons to meet different situations then the challenge of piloting their ship to get off the perfect broadside or hit and run strike on a heavier armed vessel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160764">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Guns features outstanding visual, sound, and gameplay, and packages them together in such a way that wining or losing comes down to team work first, and experience a close second.  Every ship handles differently, and it took an investment of around 15 hours for me to get over the steep curve and really begin to enjoy flying the skies.
<br>
<br>I can honestly say that I have had more fun in one 45 minute match with Guns that anything else I have played, ever.  When your team is really on, it&apos;s like winning a superbowl.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t bother to review the 3 different classes, or how each ship differs, or what gun is the shiniest, all that really needs to be said here is this:  If you are looking for an online, co-operative experience, you owe it to yourself to join this fantastic community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3320910">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics/sound

<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>Piloting, gunning and repairing all work really well and are fun, and with the right team it can get even more fun, but bad or mainly uncooperative teammates can change that. With an uncooperative teammate on your team, it can ruin the game, because it depends so much on teamwork. if one person refuses to do their job, you&apos;re going to lose. But with the right teammates, you can have lots of fun evading and outgunning the enemy.
<br>
<br>Value
<br>The game has high value, you can play it quite a lot before getting bored with it
<br>
<br>final score
<br>8 out of 10, i would give it a nine or ten, but bad teammates ruining the game can be quite a problem, which is to big of a flaw to look over</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3966975">Expand</a></span>

The general idea of the game is already enough to make most people to at least try it out. I hope the developers can create more amazing games such as this one.</span>

Does that sound interesting? Well let me tell you more. There are 3 character classes, pilot, gunner and engineer, each which a primary role. Respectively: steering the ship, manning the guns, and repairing damaged parts. Now, when you start playing a match, you can&apos;t switch classes anymore (for obvious balancing reasons), but fortunately you get the option to multitask. You can freely run around the ships while you fly and are not stuck doing the same thing every time. If there&apos;s no need for repairing, an engineer can for instance quickly man a gun. Each class gets to choose 3 skills or tools for its own specialization, and one for the other two types. For instance, when being an engineer, you can pick 3 engineer perks, one gunner perk and one pilot perk. That way you&apos;re never completely useless taking over another role briefly, something which I really like. Now let&apos;s talk about the ships, seeing as they&apos;re the stars of this game. Each vessel is customizable to a certain degree. There a 6 different types of ship you can choose from. They range from quick but frail to sturdy but sluggish and several variations in between. They&apos;re all layed out differently as well, forcing you to learn the pro&apos;s and cons and how to get around on each one if you want to get good at the game. This isn&apos;t just important for defensive purposes like knowing the best route around the ship to get to a damaged part, but also to know what to aim for as a gunner, and what to steer clear from as a pilot. The goldfish for instance has its heaviest gun on the front. So you have to either try and stay at its side or be able to decommission the main cannon to stay out of harm&apos;s way. That brings me to the ship customization. There are a fixed number of weapon slots on each ship, predetermined for heavy or lighter gun types. While you can&apos;t just put any heavy cannon randomly on your ship, you do get to choose between various different guns for each slot. A fun setup for instance, is getting a lighter ship and having a heavy lumberjack cannon on the front, which does extra damage to balloons and also put some flamethrowers on the side. That way you can swoop in, cripple your enemy&apos;s vessel by forcing them into a descend, and then turn up above and around them and burn the ever living hell out of their ship. This will set their equipment on fire so any repairs are hampered, forcing them to keep plummeting and smash into the ground underneath! This is especially handy to take down the very sturdy but sluggish galleon type ship, as their main guns are on the lower sides and they would have a hard time aiming upwards at you while you burn them. It is well balanced however. This approach isn&apos;t going to be that effective when you take on more agile ships. People who complain that this game&apos;s not very tactical clearly don&apos;t have a grasp of the mechanics. In fact, if you fly into battle with no clue as to what you&apos;re doing, you&apos;re going to get crushed. But despite the learning curve, it&apos;s still tons of fun. Especially when you have a good crew going and have a mic. Another plus is that there&apos;s a built in voice chat with two channels: one for your own ship&apos;s crew, and one for all ships on your team. Pretty damn handy. I do have some very minor gripes with the game. It tends to crash to desktop every so often. However, the loading times are incredibly short and there&apos;s even a quick re-join button on the main menu that gets you right back into the match. If you crash it might literally only take 30 seconds to get back to your crew. Another thing is that the spawning might get a little glitchy for a few seconds, graphically. I think it has to do with the way the game loads. I&apos;ve had the odd ship part glitching out too, but nothing too terrible. Actually, I&apos;ve encountered very few game-breaking bugs overall. Another low note is the character progression, there isn&apos;t really much to say right now. Since the latest update you can level up your classes by doing various challenges. However, the only thing that you can unlock right now are costume pieces, which means that if you&apos;re going into the game as a complete newbie, you&apos;re going to have all the abilities and tools that a veteran player has. I can&apos;t think of anything more fair than that. I kind of regret not having the possibility to create a more personalized character model though. While you can also buy costumes from the (real) cash shop, there&apos;s very little in terms of facial editing. I ended up getting a (admittedly awesome looking) gas mask for my male avatar, because of it. The developers also promised to keep adding more content in the future and up &apos;till now, they&apos;ve definitely kept their promises. You can also often see them online in the regional chat in the main lobby, actively conversing with the players. Concluding: I definitely recommend this one!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2869080">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is a great idea but for me it quickly got repetitive and rather boring as I found my self repairing the same thing over and over again. If you can get a decent group of friends together the game can be alot of fun and you can have some great moments when you and your buddy&apos;s ambush another air ship.</span>

<br>Finally, a game that relies on teamwork and strategy, like an action packed game of chess. Super addictive and thrilling. So many interesting maps and play modes. Love the stylized art and animation.

<br>I love this game so much i created an account to give Muse their much deserved props! 64 is a terrible score for such an innovative well designed game. With adventure mode on the way, and plenty of other things the future for this game and it&apos;s developer is very bright indeed! The classes work well, the controls are tight, the visuals are very nice, and it also runs perfect on a low end system such as mine.
<br>
<br>The music is nice and ques in and out when it seems to fit the situation best, all of the sound effects are spot on. Communication in this game is the key to victory. Captains will have to talk to their crew, and the crew will have to relay enemy positions to the captain. Captains can even talk with other captains using the C key to keep the team up to speed and coordinate attacks and defense.
<br>
<br>I could go on and on about the things that make this game an absolute blast to either pick up and play for 20 minutes, or set aside a weekend with some friends for non stop competitive mayhem! This game has my FULL support and respect! Well done muse!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176588">Expand</a></span>

The steampunk art-style is well designed and fit perfectly, remind me of Treasure Planet. The felling of the guns are good and the felling of driving the ship is even better.
<br>Except few bugs this game is perfect, find a couple of friends to play with, open Teamspeak and have fun.</span>

People seem to complain to much about things that are extremely small, for example the in-game shop that allows players to change their characters look, for 5$ you can get a complete outfit for yourself and your class, but this is not in any way going to give you any unfair advantage, purely cosmetic. Aside from that they are working on expanding the game for free! An adventure mode that allows you to interact with NPC&apos;s creating great quest&apos;s that interact with other opposing city&apos;s. For more information check their website, they are an incredible team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3157484">Expand</a></span>

Will say you need friends to play it, so buy the four pack which is cheaper technically if you can. As far as matchmaking and server stability goes: Firstly, matchmaking works in that you can form your crew before hand and up to four ships worth of people which means you can search for games with a pre-made party of 16 people (ships do not need to be full btw). Finding a Lobby that fills up quickly depends on how many people you brought in but in my experience with usually one boat full of people it can take from being immediate to up to around 5 minutes which is pretty fast. Secondly, the server stability is pretty good, only had a friend lag out once and sometimes i would get a lag spike but it only lasts a couple seconds and maybe happens once or twice every other game (matches are longish, so ten seconds worth of lag in a ten minute game is not too bad).
<br>
<br>Also, if you wanna be a pilot in this game you may want to use a controller (which I use) because according to my friends controlling the ship with keys is incredibly difficult due to the multiple awkward key positions you need to use.
<br>
<br>As far as game-play goes, whatever you thought this game was gonna be by looking at it, is what it is exactly and works perfectly as intended. Teamwork is a necessity for success, and each class gets a different perspective but in the end everyone feels like they were a big part of a victory.  The game is a little bare bones at the moment in regards to map variety (only three maps), game modes (only 2 i know of), and the level up system only adds items for your characters aesthetics. However the devs seem to be working on that and a new patch is coming soon with content. Also at the time being. the core of what you want from this game is there, there is a decent amount of class customization options, and a great amount of ships and ship weapon customization to choose from.
<br>
<br>Overall its great game that i would recommend for people with friends to play it with. Definitely try to purchase it now while its on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3876312">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay and Content 8/10
<br>The game is an awful lot of fun especially when played with friends. I am 30 hours into the game right now and moments where I ran into totally incapable crews were pretty rare as were situations in which I was overly frustrated with the game  even being shot into pieces can be a lot of fun. There are quite some maps, every single one well designed and most of them able to be played in 3v3 matches with a few featuring 4v4 battles. Every map plays different with different hazards to keep an eye on and different overall difficulty but the game suffers from a lack of game modes. As for now there are Team Deathmatch which is as simple as it sound, King of the Hill which you&apos;d know from pretty every FPS out there and Crazy King which is basically King of the Hill but with changing Capture Points in a set pattern every 6 minutes. Teams in this game are split up into crews of 4 players who can choose between 3 classes, Pilot, Gunner, and Engineer. Each of the classes can choose up to 3 class-specific tools or skills and 1 tool/skill from the each of the other class. Adittionally the Coammander of each crew (the pilot) chooses the ship he wants to use as well as the weapon loadout of his ship. All the ships, weapons, tools, skills and so on are unlocked from the very first moment and the right combination of ships, used classes and the tools they choose usually means victory  but there definitely is no such &apos;Ultimate Setup&apos; so everything is higly competitive and dependant on personal skill and the ability to work as a team. There is a tutorial to teach you all the basics you need to get started and a sandbox mode to practice and mess around with different Loadouts and lets you spawn training dummies for weapon tests. there also is overwhelmingly detailed manual accessable from the ingame menu. The least to mention here are hte Communication Tools Guns of Icarus provides. There are different chat- and voice channels for match-wide chat, teamchat and crew chat as well as an Captain-exclusive voice chat which helps a lot coordinating your moves with your teammates.
<br>
<br>Controls 9/10
<br>Controls are FPS standard with nothing too exotic and mostly intuitive when it comes to ship steering, although you might happen to still press the wrong button in the heat of battle during your first matches. All the keys are fully rebindable.
<br>
<br>Graphics 7/10
<br>There are some really amazing looking elements. The clouds, which are an essential part of of the gameplay by the way, look fantastic, the ships are well textured, the character models are very detailed and look good enough, animations are nothing special but do their job but there are some really ugly terrain textures here and there. Graphic Options pretty much follow the standard of the FPS genre and there is a slider for FOV (which goes up to 90)
<br>
<br>Sound 9/10
<br>It is no Battlefield by any stretch of the imagination but overall the sound is very immersive and satisfying. As for the Sound Options you can mess with pretty everything. There are 5 different sliders which is not standard these times. SFX Volume is automatically tuned down when there is someone speaking over the voice chat which is always nice to have.
<br>
<br>Performance 7/10
<br>Overall the game runs stable on my righ although there are some framerate drops with a special lighting effect that comes with deployable flares for no reason I could imagine. There are some lag issues as well every now and then but as I don&apos;t have the fastest internet connection it might as well be on my side.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer 9/10
<br>As this game ismultiplayer only and the gameplay is already described in the Gameplay Section i will focus on the technical part. Guns of Icarus features a server browser which I personally prefer as I am able to pick the server with the lowes ping and a Quick Match function which seems to work nicely as this game is highly competitive and ranks mostly for prestige. the Server Browser provides you with all the information you need and can be filtered in various different ways but it lacks a Refresh button which can be irritating at times. Account Progression is dependent on class related achievments and new ranks will only unlock cosmetical stuff  that&apos;s good btw. Otherwise you could buy this from the ingame store for real money. Overall the prices are reasonable and as the store features only cosmetical items I am fine with it.
<br>
<br>Overall Rating 8,2
<br>
<br>Guns of Icarus Online was on my screen a long time ago but as I am not really into steampunk I hesitated to give it a try. Probably the worst decision I made last year as this is clearly one of the best games I played this year, maybe even my personal Game of the Year</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3743769">Expand</a></span>

My only quibbles with the game are somewhat anemic and occasionally muffled gun sounds and no real clan support beyond letting you add a clan tag. Otherwise it&apos;s top notch. The game is around $5 on Steam  go get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3879475">Expand</a></span>

It has a heavy teamplay and coordination focus, not only among the crew on your ship, but also other ships you play with. The game certainly needs polish, but the dev&apos;s improve  the game regularly (for which I grant them a +1 to the score).</span>

<br>The Bad: Bugs, bugs, bugs, crashing
<br>
<br>Guns of Icarus is probably one of those love or hate type games. It has a great theme to it and the air battles are loads of fun. The downside to it is it is online only and the practice version of the game is pretty basic and doesn&apos;t give you the complete feel of a battle, so what might work in practice... might get you killed in the actual battles.
<br>
<br>Being a heavily skill based game it can feel the teams are extremely lopsided at times, often I&apos;ve found teams to be 0 and 5 in a duel match and  you throw in a Captain who doesn&apos;t understand all their skills and when and how to use them they might be doing more harm to your air ship than the enemy is.
<br>
<br>Speaking of Captains, it&apos;s a tough two-sided coin, a Captain needs experience to be any good and in order to do so they&apos;re going to have to man a ship online at some point, and this can be a frustrating experience for the crew as well, constantly out of range, getting themselves in death traps, etc.
<br>
<br>All this doesn&apos;t break the game and I think gives the game a lot of great depth, but a more casual player may find this game a bit rough, at least if they find themselves in the captains spot.
<br>
<br>My main problem with the game is the crashing, my game crashes typically once every round, if I&apos;m playing with a friend this isn&apos;t to bad because the game loads very fast (Thank you Muse games! Seriously, thank you!) so I might crash but I&apos;ll be back on the ship in a matter of seconds, literally.
<br>
<br>A great game overall and I enjoy it, I wish there was more suspenseful moments in it though, since you never really get the feeling your are being barraged with thousands of rounds, even falling off the ship is inconsequential since seconds later you are back on board doing whatever it is you do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789226">Expand</a></span>

Lots of space for strategy. Epic music, too. Bad points: Half-developed game on a background that just screams for more; ankle-biting bugs regarding animation and communications; lack of a user-friendly tutorial, and finally, an accessory store that takes real-world money - but on the last point&apos;s defense, these items are purely decorative, and bestow no in-game bonus of any other kind. 7/10 for all the potential; the introduction of adventure modules would probably give it more value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2825684">Expand</a></span>

Even if you&apos;re playing with random people, I found that they were helpful and informative. A big complaint I have with this game is that the tutorial is pretty poor because they only teach you the very basics of the game, but with a little bit of digging and asking around you could figure it all out. The lack of people is another issue,  although it&apos;s not too much of a game issue it really can hurt a multiplayer only game, but even with the low amount of servers this I never find a problem in finding a game. I haven&apos;t experienced this myself or haven&apos;t realized it, but I found it worth mentioning that the developers play there game often and you can chat with them about the game, which is pretty cool. (Got that info from a friend who players the game.) About the low ratings, it&apos;s due to the fact that this game started off really buggy and glitchy but has since then been fixed and works perfectly fine. (at least to my knowledge.) In general, I really like this game and it&apos;s worth picking up, especially since it goes on sale a ton on steam. (Currently 66% off.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3381677">Expand</a></span>

<br>You chose from one of three classes: Pilot, who flies the ship; Gunner, who shoots stuff; and Engineer, who keeps the ship in the air by repairing damage.
<br>Overall, the sheer focus on teamwork is what makes the game great. In this game, more than most, a team who communicates and works together will almost all the time prevail against a team that does not. If you are at all interested in this quite unique game, you should definitely try it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3284393">Expand</a></span>

<br>The whole crew is put under constant strain of keeping your ship in the air, and at the same time work on taking the opposing players&apos; down. I would say that a certain bond is formed between the crew and the ship as every shell that hits feels like a slap across your face.
<br>From a technical standpoint the game could use some polishing, but being somewhat minimalist I find no problem with that. On no occasion have I encountered a serious, game stopping bug, although some graphical glitches still persist.
<br>All in all, a fun airship battle experience whether or not you bring friends along or join up on the spot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436752">Expand</a></span>

This game is one of a kind, emphasizing teamwork in a way that only a three-legged race could before it. In any other &quot;team game&quot; I&apos;ve played, you still kill players, and each player has a k/d of his own. Not so with Guns of Icarus.
<br>
<br>Each kill is a ship destroying another ship, not a gunner gunning down the pilot or something. Every ship requires teamwork to fly, repair, and gun. While the beginner random matches are still fun, this game really shines if you join one of the many clans or teams for GOI, and start practicing with that group.
<br>
<br>Then, Guns of Icarus Online becomes a search for perfection. You and your crew try to work as one unit, as a united ship, the ultimate goal being to basically merge into that one fighting unit.
<br>
<br>This game includes beautiful steampunk/deiselpunk maps set after a catastrophic World War I that never ended. The ships are amazingly well designed, both for gameplay and for visuals. The guns feel powerful and handle well, ranging from the close-range shotgun weapon, the carronade, best at destroying the enemy balloon, to everyone&apos;s favorite Manticore Heavy Hwatcha, a 20-missile barrage that can utterly destroy every gun and engine on a ship if aimed right. (Oh, and it has a lion head, and looks epic. Possibly the most satisfying weapon to fire.)
<br>
<br>But gunning isn&apos;t all there is to Guns of Icarus. On the flip side, it is the Engineer&apos;s job to fix the damage those enemy gunners do. Being an engineer is a frantic duty, and after a few hwatcha barrages, and everything turns red (completely destroyed, needs to be rebuilt from scratch), you&apos;ll find you have quite a task. Playing engineer is very rewarding though, and not something you see in a ton of games.
<br>
<br>If that wasn&apos;t enough, Muse Games, the devs, are currently developing an adventure mode, placing the battles we currently have in a living post-apocalyptic world where factions fight among themselves for scarce resources.
<br>
<br>The devs are super committed to this game and all their players. Not many games actually have the devs playing in the weekly scrimmage league or holding free matches against them, where if the enemy wins, they get free hats. You often see a blue name in chat answering questions about the game and trying to help out as many folks as they can. Every single email I&apos;ve ever sent them has been answered within the same day, by a human, with very helpful advice. They are amazing.
<br>
<br>In summary, buy the game. It&apos;s amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3435632">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s music and aesthetic is phenomenal, really setting the mood for hectic airship fights. There are limitless number of strategies and tactics you can use and it leads to some very interesting decision making with friends. My crew and I spent hours just testing out ships in practice mode to see what we&apos;d use for each situtation. The three classes have important roles that feel like you&apos;re making a difference in the tide of the battle.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, this game is a strategic &quot;airship on airship&quot; gem, and with adventure mode coming out in 2014, my hopes are even higher, not to mention all the upcoming updates that are planned by Muse Games.
<br>

The game is built in such a way that it is impossible to &quot;lone wolf&apos; the game. Cooperation with your teammates is vital, something mainstream games often fail to achieve.

The graphics are nice too but I kinda have an outdated processor so I can imagine it&apos;s better than what I see =P. You can customize just about anything on the character and this game is blessed with having low prices. I recommend this =3</span>

You simple running around whacking on the ship-part that needs to be repaired, rebuild, buffed or extinguished. This gets so boring, so fast. The tactics as an engineer is nihil. One engineer repairs one part of the ship the other whacks on the other parts.

People yell at you for repairing things, for not repairing things, for buffing things, for not buffing things.  I&apos;ve had strings of profanity thrown at me for daring to buff a gun that someone was using.  Not at all the welcome a person on their 1st or 2nd match needs.
<br>
<br>Appearance wise, the game is nice enough and has some scenic moments.  The graphics clip often and the sound can skip when too much is going on.
<br>
<br>In short the game is not release worthy and not welcoming to new players.  Keep away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3305113">Expand</a></span>

I sent an email to the developers about it (who care about their customers and respond to everyone) but they were unable to help me. They wanted me to do a bunch of stuff in order to see what the problem could be. I have never actually played the game and it has caused me at least an hour of trouble. I don&apos;t have ANY time for that, and I never want to set foot on a game made by these people ever again. A game needs to work-  and this game won&apos;t. Unacceptable.

<br>-epic battles with up to 32 players divided across 8 airships (4v4).
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Indie game (low budget feel), with some rough edges.
<br>-How much fun you have depends very much on who you play with - you will meet some totally incompetent players on the same ship as you, who can ruin the fun. Example: 12 year olds who take captain role and don&apos;t know how to fly and disconnect the first moment the ship inevitably starts to lose.
<br>-If you like to be able to &quot;go it alone&quot; without relying on others, this game is not for you. Teamwork or die.
<br>-The tutorials for beginners could be better. You will have to learn a lot of things the hard way.
<br>-Dated graphics (but it still &quot;looks and feels good&quot;).
<br>-Small player base - only about 200 concurrent gamers in the evening.
<br>-Games often take a long time to start (waiting in lobby for other players to ready up).
<br>
<br>A friend recommended this. I had modest expectations and the game has exceeded them.
<br>I used to only play RedOrchestra2 online, but I liked this game enough that I have added it to my regular online gaming diet.
<br>
<br>This is a severely underrated game that deserves a much bigger player base. Its great to play with your friends, otherwise its still decent, but not as good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5281260">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So without further a&apos; do, here&apos;s Guns Of Icarus Online: the review.
<br>
<br>The game might look simple on the outside but trust me, it gets messy. In the game you and your fellow mates and the opposition are fighting about fifty-thousand yards of soil and by &quot;fighting&quot; everyone builds their own airships and tries to fight each other in the air.
<br>
<br>In all honesty though, you and three other people are the crew of a single ship in the team you are currently playing in. You are either the captain (steering the ship), the gunner (best at shootin&apos; folks), or the engineer (keeps the boat afloat)
<br>
<br>The hardest one by far is the engineer, as this fine sir/ma&apos;m you&apos;re toying aaround with your tools trying to repair all the parts of the ship that have taken too much damage form enemy fire, stormy clouds/sandstorms, or just the captain being a complete idiot and steering the ship into random mountains.
<br>
<br>As the gunner you do one thing: SPAM BUHHLETZ!!!1!!. Or you know, stop shooting (and druling) eventually to repair some stuff.
<br>
<br>And as the captain you liternally do one thing: Steer the blimp-pirate-ship-battle-thing...... and yell as loudly as possible at your crew because they aren&apos;t doing sh- GODAMMIT PETE KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ENEMY FOR ONCE!!!.
<br>
<br>.....Anyway here&apos;s a summary:
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>1) Soundtrack is immersive and badass.
<br>2) Mechanics are very different from a lot of other shooters
<br>3) Coordination is required for a guaranteed victory (this game is heavy on teamwork)
<br>4) Game is smooth as butter, very responsive and controls great.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>1) Graphical glitches and lag can ruin your experience.
<br>2) Hard to &quot;get good&quot; at
<br>3) Useless cosmetics that can wipe your Steam wallet clean if you aren&apos;t &quot;sane&quot;
<br>
<br>In other words, this game suprised me with a handful of mechanics that made this game a must-buy in my opinion. The only thing preventing this game form getting a 9/10 is the fact that this has a lot of cosmetics involved, which is something i would like games to leave alone and focus on being a good game on itself to gain money instead of having tons of panties and whatnot.
<br>
<br>This game gets the score: &quot;I can dig it&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4897835">Expand</a></span>

But why, when 271 people give this game an 80% plus that it&apos;s weighed down by the SEVEN critics that give a 60%. Anyway complaining out of the way, this game is AMAZING. I have been playing for well over a year and see no indications of stopping. Let me point out again that the critic reviews are from 2012-13 when the game first came out, this game has improved IMMENSLEY. First of all with a tight-knight community, contact with the devs is easy and updates are meaningful and frequent (except that one &quot;balance changes&quot; ones but whatever the devs are good) anyway the play flow is nice, lots of different ship loadouts to try and experiment with. So much must be tried, it took me well over a few months to become comfortable with the ships and play styles. You must go more in depth to the game to discover what it has in store for players, a whole opinion cannot be based on a 1 month critic trial. (I&apos;m kinda mad at the system if you can&apos;t tell XD) but reall 15 dollars is nothing for a game that I play literally every day. I love this game to death and I think it gets a bad rap for being and underdog. I highly encourage anyone to pick up the game and see for themselves, maybe I can even encourage critics to &quot;re-evaluate&quot; and check out what has changed. You know you&apos;ve found a special game when the devs play every Tuesday and Thursday to get feedback and hang out with their community. A very special game that I recommend strongly to anyone who is willing to invest some hours in a very captivating and fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guns-of-icarus-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=6328192">Expand</a></span>
