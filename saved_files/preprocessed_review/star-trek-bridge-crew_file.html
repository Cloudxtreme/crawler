<br>
<br>Yet I find myself coming back time and time again, somehow despite the above the actual gameplay feels compelling, the experience of being on the bridge so convincing and the interaction with, what is easily the best community I&apos;ve encountered in an online game, so entertaining and rewarding. Even when playing on your own there is something special about this game. Sure it&apos;s not the perfect spaceship game, nor is it the perfect Star Trek game. But when you add the sheer awesomeness of being transported onto the Bridge of a Starship thanks to the power of VR it becomes one of the most enjoyable games I&apos;ve played in a very long time.
<br>
<br>We&apos;re at the start of the journey here, with luck the game will expand well beyond what&apos;s there today, but even if it doesn&apos;t this is an unmissable experience. A real indication of how amazing VR is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-bridge-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=7345983">Expand</a></span>

This is what makes VR so exciting...it creates completely new gaming experiences never imagined before. Must buy if you have a PSVR and if not another reason to buy one.</span>

<br>Bridge Crew is a really great example of what VR is capable of. It is, however, also a game that is only really fun if you play it with your friends. That&apos;s the reason why I can &quot;only&quot; give a decent score of 7. A mentioned, with Star Trek loving friends, it&apos;s a 10/10. Alone, depending on how much you love Star Trek, and based on the rather small amount of content and the really dumb &quot;AI crew&quot;, it&apos;s somewhere around 5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-bridge-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=7365908">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is the first game I have ever had where I didn&apos;t want to call Ubisoft (and uPlay) offensive names. It is a genuine fun game and is what VR was made for. This game is like a proof of concept of what can be done. Love it.</span>
