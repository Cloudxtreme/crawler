<br>
<br>This game will probably forever stay a niche title but does what it wants to do very well. You get thrown into a town without any backstory and get to make your own story depending on your decisions. There is 10 endings while 2 of them are &quot;hidden&quot;, including a true ending which is not easy to achieve without a guide. There is a branching story with dozens of missions and over 150 side quests. You can pick from about 86 different styles which consist of about 20 moves each, while some styles have a few moves in common with others. There is also the option to create your own style, lead a dojo, do various minigames and make your own weapons. There is of course katanas but also: spears, pistols, unarmed combat which includes metal claws and dual wielding katanas. The controls are easy to learn but hard to  master. One of the key points is learning when you have to block, dodge or activate the spring harvest mode which makes you attack a lot faster for a short period of times. There is various minigames like poker and japanese gambling as well as being tortured if you commit to many crimes and let yourself be caught by the law. Graphics are nothing spectacular but it looks quite ok for a 2011 ps3 port. So far the game is getting regular updates which fixed bugs and improved the controls. You can pick this up really cheap so if you enjoy swordfighting chances are you would enjoy this. If you are looking for another cod or borderlands you will probably be disappointed, also this game can be really hard and grindy so be aware that if you let your guard down even unnamed mobs can cut you down in 1 strike on easy, while a well equipped player character might survive a few blows on hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/way-of-the-samurai-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=5399547">Expand</a></span>
