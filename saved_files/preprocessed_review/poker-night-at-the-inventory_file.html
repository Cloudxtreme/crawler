Overall, its a good deal for this price, but as i said, for the loot and humor, not for the poker.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/poker-night-at-the-inventory/user-reviews?user_review_id=1706234">Expand</a></span>

The reasons are numerous: the conversation is humerous, the AI is challenging (and will learn your strategies if you play the same way over and over again), and the graphics are entertaining in themselves (you&apos;ll see a strange incorporation of 2-bit characters with the visually pleasing graphics akin to Team Fortress 2; a strange combination that somehow is blended very well).
<br>
<br>For $5, this challenging poker experience with the promise of TF2 items - should you earn them - is well worth the low cost.  The impressive AI, which is divided according to each character&apos;s personality and which can learn the player&apos;s strategies, makes this a poker game worth the price in itself.  That is to say that if you like poker, then this game is worth the buy, but don&apos;t buy it just for the promise of items (because they are not necessarily easy to get) or just because of the commentary, because it will eventually start looping though that will take about 5 hrs to really happen a lot.
<br>
<br>With all this said, there are a few things you should be aware of.  First off, there is only one type of card game that I have found - Texas Hold &apos;em.  (There are unlocks as you play through the game, but so far all I&apos;ve found is that they merely change textures, such as giving you TF2 labeled playing cards.)  Another thing is that there are only so many characters in this game, so it probably won&apos;t be long before you tire of them: though they are funny for at least awhile and you can turn off converstations afterwards.  Lastly, you will quickly tire of the music... which is basically one or two tracks played over and over and over again... but if you turn the music off and turn Pandora on you should be fine.
<br>
<br>With all of this said, it certainly stands as a good game worth $5 that is a nice break away from just shooting things up.  It would be a 9.5 from me, but since I can&apos;t give it that, I round to 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/poker-night-at-the-inventory/user-reviews?user_review_id=1678524">Expand</a></span>

Telltale have done a magnificent job in combining multiple video game personalities into a casual environment, and can play a good round of poker too! Despite the high production values, I do have a few irks with the game, particularly the dialogue used. After playing for about 3+ hours, you will probably find that each of the character&apos;s general lines tends to repeat - a LOT, especially for Max. (&quot;Can you believe these cards actually smell like detritus?&quot;) It can get particularly annoying at times, especially when you have an item buy-in round occur frequently. Also, sometimes the characters may use lines that are out of context, sometimes addressing others when they aren&apos;t actually there, which can make things feel a little weird. Dialogue between the characters can be pretty funny at times, most notable lines being from the Heavy and Tycho, though you may have to be fans of Strong Bad&apos;s Game..., Sam &amp; Max, TF2 and Penny Arcade to get some of the humor.<br>In addition to the whole poker thing, there&apos;s... nothing, which isn&apos;t really a problem since it is a poker game after all. However there are the aforementioned TF2 items (which are actually just skinned versions of the default items) and unlockable deck and table skins for the game (but for some reason I prefer to stick with the default Inventory deck and table).<br>Otherwise, it&apos;s a quite enjoyable game, well worth the $5, except maybe for the sometimes overly repetitive dialogue. Recommended, though play in short bursts so you don&apos;t get sick of the dialogue too quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/poker-night-at-the-inventory/user-reviews?user_review_id=1447875">Expand</a></span>

Poker is a classic game and this is one way of playing it without taking it to the level of genuine gambling. I heartily recommend Poker Night at the Inventory.</span>

Some of the lines are funny, but they get repetitive very quickly. Only really worth purchasing for the TF2 loot, but you have to suffer through a bunch of bad poker games and stale jokes to get them.</span>

There&apos;s great chemistry between the unlikely cast of characters. It&apos;s definitely worth the low price of admission, and It might have even taught me Texas Hold&apos;Em well enough that I could play it for real.

It stabs it to death, destroys its innards, dumps it into a landfill, and dumps recycled aluminum all over it. To put it slightly less gruesomely, I love this game.
<br>
<br>Graphcs: 9 out of 10.
<br>The graphics are some of the best I&apos;ve ever scene out of Telltale Games. The lighting is very &apos;30s nightclub, and the effects and textures are very high quality. The animation on the models are very smooth. Most lip-syncing is very top-notch but some lip movements are of in comparison to the dialogue. The game is not without its graphical glitches, though. I&apos;ve seen cards floating over the Heavy&apos;s head, chips moving to the middle by themselves, among others. They are funny, so it&apos;s nothing to worry about, unless you worry about that sort of thing.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 9 out of 10.
<br>This game is a point-and-click simulated poker game. The controls are very simple using buttons and a slide to bet, raise, call, check, and fold. If you don&apos;t know anything about that stuff, look it up.
<br>
<br>Controls: 9 out of 10.
<br>The mouse pointer and buttons work perfectly. There&apos;s not much else to say.
<br>
<br>Audio: 10 out of 10.
<br>The game&apos;s audio is the pearl in this clam. The cast includes William Kasten as Max, Gary Schwartz as the Heavy, Matt Chapman as Strong Bad, Roger Jackson as the Host, and Tycho Brahe&apos;s first ever and hopefully permenant voice actor, Andrew &quot;Kid Beyond&quot; Chaikin. All characters have a boatload of dialogue and can interact with each other in rib-hurtingly comical ways. Conversations between characterscan be interuppted, though, so anticipate a few bugs. But for the most part, the system works well. The dialogue is funny and will keep you laughing for hours. The music consists of jazz remixes of music from Sam &amp; Max, Homestar Runner, and Team Fortress 2 media. The remixes are catchy and top-notch. Overall, you should buy this game just to hear these guys talk to each other.
<br>
<br>One last thing I should mention, this game is only $5! All the quality you get is well worth more than $5, but this MSRP makes this game irresistable for any poker enthusiast or comedy lover. Get it now!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/poker-night-at-the-inventory/user-reviews?user_review_id=2498857">Expand</a></span>

(Okay you can stop reading now)

<br>If you are also interested in the actual game itself then feel free to read on.
<br>
<br>Poker Night consists of You, Max, Strong Bad, Tyco, and the TF2 Heavy sitting at a table playing Texas Hold&apos;em poker. There are some rather pointless cosmetics unlocks (tables and in-game card decks) and of course the all so tasty TF2 items (which I&apos;ll get to later).
<br>
<br>From a game standpoint the graphics and sound work are good. Production value is right up there too as we get dramatic camera angles and sound bites during the tense moments. And of course lots of banter from the AI players that keep things interesting for a bit.
<br>
<br>But, invariably with a game like this the lines are limited. After and hour or two the AI will have to start repeating the same quips over and over which will become more of an annoyance than a positive. You can turn down the chatter setting to the lowest, but it won&apos;t matter two hours tops and you&apos;ve heard almost everything. There is no way to mute them so be prepared to have to constantly speed click through their conversations for the rest of your play time.
<br>
<br>Progression wise the game tracks how many hands you&apos;ve played and won; how many all-ins successfully won-lost, number of players you have knocked out, and of course your overall winnings. Nothing special. Why they don&apos;t track second, third, or fourth place finishes or reward you for it is beyond me... instead its an all or nothing affair that more often than not will result in you tracking your progress by your ever increasing negative bank account debt. Hooray?!
<br>
<br>But, the true real reason I give this game a 7 is the TF2 items. Its the reason most people buy this game and its what gives the game its re-playability as its the only goal worth achieving. Unfortunately, Tell Tale made it annoying as fk to unlock them. Maybe once in every 8 tournaments one of the AI players will throw in their item and the only way you can win it is by knocking that specific player out. Its pure coincidental luck for this to happen rather than any form of skill. You have to have better cards than that player, have more money than him, then get him to go all in. At any point another AI can knock the guy out and the item goes away. A more sensible fair skill-based solution to unlocking these items would have given the winner of that tournament the prize, but Tell Tale wanted to be annoying a-holes apparently.
<br>
<br>Anyways, if you want these items you&apos;ll basically have to constantly restart the matches until an AI throws in the item. Then don&apos;t bother playing for real... just wait, hope you have more money than him, then go all in whenever he does no matter how crappy your cards are and pray for luck. Its really stupid.
<br>
<br>As for unlocking the items legit? Good luck. I&apos;ve been playing legit for over 8 hours now and haven&apos;t unlocked a single TF2 item. Getting so annoying I&apos;m either going to start up the constant restart ALT+F4 bull**** or try and see if The Achievement Manager works. Sure hope they changed the TF2 unlocks in Poker Night 2 cause this system is pointlessly dumb</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/poker-night-at-the-inventory/user-reviews?user_review_id=3903737">Expand</a></span>

This is where Poker Night at the Inventory jumps in.
<br>
<br>While I generally don&#x2019;t tend to spend any money on games like Poker Night at the Inventory, the fact that it has four different character from different games certainly did the trick for me. In the game itself, you get to play Texas Hold &#x2018;Em Poker with Max from Sam and Max, Strongbad from homestarrunner, Heavy Weapons Guy from Team Fortress 2 and Tycho from Penny Arcade  each of these characters are completely the opposites from each other which leads to various and hilarious conversations during the games. However, once you end up playing against one character because the rest is busted out  the conversations tends to dry out as every few rounds the same will be said over and over again. A downside is that you cannot create your own character which could have brought slightly more diversion in the game as they could have added a few characters which you could choose from and gave them their own voices and lines.
<br>
<br>The game-play is what you should expect from a typical card game, you get to see the cards in your hand and when it&#x2019;s your turn, the buttons will appear for you. In the meantime the characters are all jabbing at each other or telling stories. However, the longer you play, the more known you will become at the way the character plays and you will be able to read from their faces wether or not they have good cards or are simply bluffing. One thing you should know is that there is no multiplayer option in Poker Night at the Inventory, nor is there an option to invite your friends. While I do understand that there are multiple players who prefer to play alone, I&#x2019;d rather play some fun games with friends from time to time as well. Another downside of the game is that there is no option of changing a few rules or even playing some of the games that are inside the Inventory. A few mini-games could have been added to change the scene from time to time but you&#x2019;re stuck with playing Texas Hold &#x2018;Em Poker.
<br>
<br>As for the graphics, they are certainly not bad for a game that purely focuses on the card game itself and the conversations being held. However, Tycho seems to be out-of-place as he is more cartoonized than the other characters. The building and the room itself are decent enough as well and when a character is busted out from the game, you can see them running around in the room or playing other games  which certainly gives some depth to the room you&#x2019;re in. Even if you will be paying more attention to the cards being dealt.

And really, that&apos;s the main concept behind the game. That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the game is &quot;bad&quot;, just not worth replaying. Telltale does provide us with some humorous commentary from the franchises involved such as Sam &amp; Max and Team Fortress, this keeps the game from wearing out quicker than it usually does. The poker itself is pretty unremarkable, but the dialogue keeps it going. As you beat your opponents and unlock items for TF2, the dialogue does start lose its humor and becomes repetitive. And once you do collect the last item, there&apos;s really no reason to play again, and it seems that was Telltale was going for in this game. Unless you play TF2 (and care about cosmetic items) or are die-hard fans of the franchises, there&apos;s no reason to purchase this game. Despite this, the game is worth the price tag of $5 for the funny commentary and items you receive as you play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/poker-night-at-the-inventory/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295828">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well I love Texas Hold&apos;em Poker and this was a decent try from Telltale Games. It&apos;s fun to cure boredom but that is mostly it, The comments from Max (Sam &amp; Max), Strong Bad, Heavy Weapons Guy (TF2) and Tycho are funny as hell, but only for the first 2 tourneys, then you have heard them all about 20 times and you find yourself right clicking constantly to skip the chatter, Even setting the Chat settings lower doesn&apos;t seem to help.
<br>
<br>Also the game mechanics and AI poker skills aren&apos;t really steady , One game an AI will play super tight and the next tourney that same AI plays every hand and goes all in with cards like 5,8 Off suite before the flop...
<br>
<br>What I am getting at is that it&apos;s a fun game for when your internet is down and you are bored but don&apos;t buy it expecting it to be the WOSP.
<br>
