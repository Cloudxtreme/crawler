I&apos;m keener on the trading side of things and not the &quot;pirate battle&quot; stuff which I get sick of pretty quick.  I find the map a little hard to see; supposedly there are things marked on it (pieces of treasure maps) but I&apos;m having a hard time seeing them.  Overall it&apos;s a solid trading game.</span>

<br>
<br>I yet again made the mistake of playing this game and finding it dull/boring/repetitive after 3/4 hours
<br>this will be the last patrician/port royale/rise of venice game for me...

<br>
<br>conclusion:  PLAY: if you like repetitive tasks  games    DON&apos;T PLAY:  if you are getting bored after doing 2/3 hours the same stuff and don&apos;t feel like you accomplished something</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3603344">Expand</a></span>

It does this well... I experienced only one bug, though it was a critical bug which ruined my campaign play (there was a mission where the goal spawn never spawned). Otherwise, it&apos;s well-polished. With RoV, the sub-genre&apos;s been given a fresh coat of paint (though... identical games didn&apos;t come out more than a couple years ago, so this isn&apos;t particularly needed). It suffers the same problem as similar games, where there&apos;s quickly nothing interesting to do once you&apos;ve figured out the trade mechanics. You cart product from an area which produces the product (or where you produce the product) to somewhere where they don&apos;t produce it, and take the profit.... over and over. I frankly think EVE Online has effectively rendered this subgenre obsolete  or it would, if it weren&apos;t subscription-based. You can cart goods around and arb all you want in EVE, and it&apos;s plenty more deep and interesting when the buyers and sellers are real people, instead of waiting for consistent, predictable goods consumption  having trading being just a small part of a much more grand picture helps a lot in maintaining engagement, too. Ship combat in RoV is quite clunky, and for whatever reason, I consistently had trouble getting the ship I was controlling to board enemy ships when I was right up alongside the enemy vessel, so I eventually just stopped manual ship combat and switched to automatic battles. This also isn&apos;t uncommon for the subgenre. Overall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s shockingly unambitious, very forgettable, and merely a facelift for people who may not have already played almost-identical games. I mean  it&apos;s not a &quot;bad&quot; game  it&apos;s just a knock-off of something I&apos;ve already played. If you have played almost-identical games, well... Why pay to play what amounts to practically the same game twice?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3613807">Expand</a></span>

<br>First off I have to say this...the game is not broken. The low review score by IncGamers is based on reviewing the pre-release version of the game, not the &quot;actual&quot; game released to the general public on the 27th. I have not run into a single bug that was mentioned, and have to believe the reviewer is plainly not a fan of this type of game....
<br>
<br>....since...
<br>
<br>This game knows exactly who it is meant for... those who enjoy building trade empires, manipulating economies, &quot;indirectly&quot; influencing city development, managing trade routes, and building supply chains for production, during a period (in this case, Renaissance in the Mediterranean), with a little bit of political intrigue.
<br>
<br>Though this game does offer a little action with sea battles, this is definitely secondary (...though if you want, you can play the game this way without trading at all, pirating other trade conveys and capturing their ships and goods which you can then either sell or add to your fleets...). This game is about trading...plan and simple...and if you enjoy this and other trade/management/supply chain sims, then you will definitely enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3606114">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s as good as if not better than Port Royale and better IMO than PR2 and 3.
<br>The plot/politics side is greatly enhanced from the previous games and trading has been smoothed (but not nerfed) The need to keep a pen and paper handy just to see if a route is profitable or not is no longer required.
<br>That was always annoying. There you are, in front of a &#xA3;1500 PC, using a calculator to work out whether buying bricks from Barbados and selling them at St Kitts was worth it or not. It didn&apos;t really add to the game.
<br>
<br>Well that&apos;s all fixed now. The GFX are good, the combat is optional (good  as I have no interest in it) the gmae is a solid  deep trading and strategy game.
<br>
<br>Some of the reviews  pro and player  seem a little annoyed that it isn&apos;t a pirates and swashbuckling game and review it as if it SHOULD have been.
<br>
<br>Guess they don&apos;t understand the real pleasure of a deep logistics and trading strategy game and maybe next time the pro game review sites are handed a game like this to review and the editor is working out who to give it to  then some of those who have reviewed this should just own up and say &quot;You know what  I just don&apos;t &apos;get&apos; this sort of game  maybe give the review to someone who does&quot;
<br>
<br>Would they give the next CoD or Battlefield game to someone like me to review  someone who can&apos;t stand FPS&apos;s? I don&apos;t think so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801271">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Regarding the UI the most obvious problem is that a lot of the information about your company is scattered throughout different screens.
<br>
<br>Problem with the stewards is that you can&apos;t tell him to buy from a specific ware a certain amount if the price is below x. You can just tell him to buy all wares that are below price tag x. You can&apos;t even limit the amount of wares he buys. This last one goes for you ship captains as well.
<br>
<br>Ship battles are chaotic and no fun at all to play by yourself. However the player can always choose to handle ship battles automatically by the AI.
<br>
<br>Other than that a word on mod-ability: I do not understand why this developer is making it people so darn difficult to mod anything. Every file in the archives is encrypted. This is in no way community friendly and by my mind not really contemporary. For this alone I deduct one scoring point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3604968">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I do admit that I like the whole idea of being a Venetian trader much more than the earlier games premises but beyond that I can&apos;t really say that this is any more than just an average trading simulator.
<br>
<br>The user interface unfortunately feels very dated to me, it feels very similar to the old Sierra/impressions city building games with the way that they have a bar over on the right that is of securing your view of the game world. And the ship battle user interface is probably worse than the standard interface is used on the rest of the game. It feels very much like it was just tacked on to have something in their for the game&apos;s release.
<br>
<br>The sound is just so so. And it suffers terribly from voice over stuttering that apparently is not just my game as watching YouTube videos of this game you can just see how many people actually have this voice over stuttering in their game. About the only thing to do with the sound that is decent would be the music, I found the music to be very relaxing and it fits very well with the game but that&apos;s not nearly enough for me to score the game any higher than a 5 out of 10
<br>
<br>The game world is just okay to look at it&apos;s nothing really to write home about the ships a rather bland and the actual landscape is also rather bland however the water is quite pretty.
<br>
<br>As a trading simulation game is basically does that, trading, and it does it over and over and over and over and over again, basically you&apos;re going to be doing trading throughout the entire game which consists of little more than either moving or producing a product in one area to another area in the game that does not have that product, if doing that does not sound like an exciting thing to do for you then you probably don&apos;t want to skip this game.
<br>
<br>Final thoughts: if you can pick up this title for under $20.00 and enjoy trading simulation games such as the Patrician series of games then you might as well go ahead and pick it up so that you can experience the new area (Venice), however I would not suggest picking it up at full price of $39.99 if you&apos;ve played the previous games as it&apos;s really just little more than the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3619455">Expand</a></span>

<br>The trade is fun, creation of trade routes is fairly easy and intelligent. Maybe I was just bad at Patrician 3 but I found trying to maintain a production line was torturous and literally caused me a few sleepless nights as my brain refused to shut down after a 5+ solid hours of fun each day. Rise of Venice takes most of that stress from you with a solid system that allow you to delegate managing how many resources are needed by your business assuming your trades go off unhindered. Very handy.
<br>
<br>The genuine disappointment with this game is the campaign. I&apos;ve just given up on it after for the 4th (ish) time I&apos;ve been given a quest along the lines of &quot;assemble a super strong fleet and arm it to the teeth by yesterday as I have something much stronger than you to kill by this afternoon&quot;. Then when you inevitably fail you&apos;re punted back to your latest save to try and work a miracle recovery.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t add anything to the campaign except an eye-roll and a groan knowing that I may actually be physically unable to progress.
<br>
<br>Also the game often fails to register your completion of goals within missions. I had a mission to sell 80 things of wine from Syracuse to Venice. I did just that and saved, figuring I could wait out the clock. Wrong, the trigger failed and then I failed the mission, getting punted back to my save with 2 days to accomplish a 6-day objective. Fail. I was quite fortunate as when I went back to Syracuse and bought 80 things of wine the trigger only THEN registered.
<br>
<br>A potentially great game torn down by an awful campaign. Sure most of the joy to be had is probably sandbox, but for the fairly time starved like myself I personally look primarily to the campaign for the game experience.
<br>
<br>Could be great, but is instead adequate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-venice/user-reviews?user_review_id=3901398">Expand</a></span>

Paying attention to detail is important because at certain times of the day, you will notice when to buy and sell goods to earn profit.
<br>
<br>While Rise of Venice is a simulation game, there is plenty of missions and trading to be done in areas such as Rome, Athens, Alexandria for example. Your objective is to build a reputation is any of the different places. When you progress through the game and raise your rank, more items and convoys are available to trade such as boats and goods from different places.
<br>
<br>What else does Rise of Venice have to offer?
<br>
<br>An interaction with other friends or players in Multiplayer with up to 4 people.
<br>
<br>Pros and Cons
<br>
<br>Some of the things throughout the game I liked include the great atmosphere, what I mean by that is, it&apos;s not always dark and rainy... which usually sets a mood in the game. If you like Strategy and Simulation games, Rise of Venice is very addicting because of the mission variety and the ability to rank up and the endless amounts of playtime you can have with friends.
<br>
<br>The things I noticed about Rise of Venice that could be easily fixed include, more instructions to the new gamer who is picking up a simulation game for the first time. The learning curve is quite steep for this. Although you can change the speed of the game to progress faster, the time it takes to rank up can be confusing because it takes a long time. Finally the most important issue was some of the missions are extremely difficult and can cause a huge loss in resources because it is not clear on what the objective is.
<br>
<br>Overall, I really enjoy this game and with a little time and effort, I think Kalypso Media did an excellent job with this game and will provide many hours of entertainment.
<br>- My personal score for this game would be a 9/10
