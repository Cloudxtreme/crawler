                                        <span> I really enjoyed this game.Excellent graphics and lots of blood.Some encounters I found pretty hard,like when theres loads of guys shooting at you and then a guy comes up with a bulletproof sheild and hits you with a sword (weird).The biggest problem is its way too short and theres some reference to hadens past that you never find out about.Still its a good game for the price its at.</span>

As far as the gameplay is concerned, its pretty solid, combat and movement is smooth, and weapons and enemy are well balanced with each other. Graphically it fairly good looking, even on consoles. To sum it up, the story is crap, but the game itself is fun enough that i played it twice, and I just bought it on steam cause its $2.50 right now.  If you&apos;re a working person who has to budget the time you have to play games, then pass on this one. If you have ample time for gaming, then this is certainly worth playing through, if the price is right of course.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=2072667">Expand</a></span>

The combat is very uninspired and tedious but at the same time unique because of the glaive and various powers and upgrades.  The graphics are great in some places but at the same time clunky and dated, even for 2009.  The game shows it tries to have style and originality but can&apos;t seem to grasp it.  If it weren&apos;t for the fact it even tried to be stylish then this game wouldn&apos;t get a bove a 4/10 from me.  I only recommend this game if you play Warframe and want to see a bit more into the lore, as well as the company that made it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=6572975">Expand</a></span>

It reminds me of the Tom Clancy Splinter Cell and recent Rainbow Six game series. It also runs on older machines at 2.0 ghz amd above with little or no trouble except in distance graphics. The artwork is top-notch, so if you like half descent artwork, here you go. Missing? The excitement level and it is over the shoulder with a rigid aspect of moving the character that could use some work. Kill boss and minions and move on. But overall in my opinion it is a very good sci-fi fps with a nice storyline and I recommend. A pleasant surprise for the price.

<br>
<br>It is certainly a game for mature audiences what with the violent content and copious amounts of blood and gore. This game isn&apos;t a game for kids in any way, shape or form... the puzzles are quite difficult and it doesn&apos;t hold your hand through any of it save for the initial &quot;this is what a puzzle looks like&quot; in the first act. Also, the game is satisfyingly difficult giving you the chance to really challenge yourself. There are some spots where the difficulty seems just a bit too much but again, this game will not hold your hand and &quot;tell you a story&quot; with a few gameplay events here and there... so, if you&apos;re looking for a game where you can lose yourself in the story and not be bothered with too much difficulty, then this game may not be for you.
<br>
<br>It is also paced well... with just the right amount of slow points to give you a chance to catch your breath.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a perfect game... it has it&apos;s &quot;Derp&quot; moments... However, try and understand the game&apos;s history and how it came to development and you&apos;ll understand why this game wasn&apos;t as good as it could have been.
<br>
<br>All in all, a hidden gem for gamers looking for a game that will give them a tough challenge, immersive environment and rewarding gameplay. Hardcore gamers will love this game... casual gamers might find it a bit too intense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=3440659">Expand</a></span>

Like when you sprint you can&apos;t turn? WTF? I can cut some sharp corners when I&apos;m in a hurry, so that makes the Uber badass guy in the game kind of a gimp. Also it has no jump feature. When has that EVER been a good idea in an FPS game? As cool as it looks, the Glave weapon is underpowered so it takes repeated throws--even repeated POWERED throws to take down baddies--whereas a burst from any of the guns will do it quicker. So you end up using the Glave mostly to look cool, not because it&apos;s a good weapon. If they&apos;d had any clue, they&apos;d have made the Glave steering mechanism real time (like the missiles in H-L 2), so it didn&apos;t slow the game to a crawl whenever you used it. And they should have made the guns short range only, forcing you to use the Glave for long range shots. Add JUMPING and subtract the retarded sprinting limitations and THAT woulda been a rockin&apos; game. In fact I really want to play a game like that and I hope someone makes it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=423198">Expand</a></span>

I had to use numerous workarounds to get the game to display correctly on my 16:9 screen. Begins as a rather dull linear cover shooter and unfortunately only picks up too late in the game. Once all powers have been unlocked and a few things develop Dark Sector becomes very enjoyable, though it is frustrating at times; controls are rigid and clunky and the game does little to stand out from the crowd, but it&apos;s a decent enough 3PS with some great visual design (except for Hayden Tenno&apos;s character model, what happened there?) and neat mechanics that were no doubt more impressive at the time (like the Glaive, limb dismemberment, etc.) Probably of optimum interest to Warframe fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=3291979">Expand</a></span>

<br>Story and characters first of all are instantly forgetable and setting itself is uninteresting. Graphics are pretty average aswell for for its time, as game&apos;s title implies its dark looking game with almost no color. On PC it runs really well with no issues in sight, but graphics options are super limited. At times game can have cool spooky atmosphere. Also game wont save your custom key bindings after qutting to Windows, so youll have get used to default controls,
<br>
<br>Gameplay is fairly average if not ok. Wasnt the fan of movement system, sprinting especialy felt painful. Cover system works fine, but at times it can get in the way since cover and sprinting use same key, making you enter cover when you dont need it leaving you wide open for enemy attacks. Game also isnt telling you what to do, where to go, how to effectively beat the bosses, nothing, meaning it doesnt hold your hand, which for some more hardcore players will be a nice thing, but will leave casual players annoyed and frustrated, so bad that theyll possibly want to stop playing the game for good. The glave which will be your main weapon and tool is a cool gimmick and works very well and controls nicely. One small yet cool thing i liked was that you can only use picked up weapons from enemies for a short period of time before they self destruct. All of the boss fights were not very well designed imo, they felt too standard without giving me any thrills and some them can take too much time before you undersatnd how to take them down, theyre also pretty easy if you dont play like noob. Game also doesnt have difficulty settings, the standard setting can be pretty challenging at times when they throw lots of enemies at you some if which are pretty OP,, there will also be lots of cheap deaths that you wont see coming, but overall if you have xp with third person shooter action games youll do fine in Dark Sector.
<br>
<br>This game is purely for action heads, if you look for a good story above all else, dont bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-sector/user-reviews?user_review_id=6789194">Expand</a></span>
