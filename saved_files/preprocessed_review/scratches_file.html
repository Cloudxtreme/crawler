While it may not add much to the point-and-click adventure scene, this really ought not count against it; in a time when point-and-clicks are really made purely for the sake of classicism more than innovation, this game does a great job of capturing the spirit of the genre. This set aside, the game offers a story which keeps the player guessing through the end, and provides a good dose of suspense and an occasional jump to go with it. The visuals are stunning, as well as the sound layers; both do a good job of attaining a solid feeling of immersion, very similar to reading a good suspense novel. All in all, this game may not look like much from the outset, but it has a lot to offer to the right player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/scratches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3576448">Expand</a></span>

I was seriously creeped out after the first night. When a game makes you terrified to go into the living room, you know it&apos;s good.  Excellent puzzles and unwinding story. Great music too!</span>

I would&apos;ve easily given this game a 10/10 if it weren&apos;t for it&apos;s disgustingly specific puzzles and the fact that you can&apos;t walk freely. As other people have said, you WILL need a walkthrough for this, unless you&apos;re either the developer of the game himself, or some kind of mastermind. The puzzles have extremely specific solutions that about 99.99% of people can&apos;t figure out, but even with a walkthrough this game is totally worth it! Now if you could walk around freely this would be so much better, I get that walking step by step may have made the game easier to make, and slowed it down so you don&apos;t rush through it, but seriously, if you could walk around it would feel so much more like you were in the character&apos;s shoes instead of watching a panoramic slideshow. The game (while using a walkthrough) is amazing, has perfect timed discoveries to keep you entertained and addicted and wanting to know more, has awesome voice acting, and can scare the hell out of you at some points. And who doesn&apos;t like a good scare? It took me about 6 hours to complete it with a walkthrough. Without one, you just have to go through countless trial and error for tens of hours and at that point it takes a lot away from the overall effect the game will have on you, if you don&apos;t just trash it and never play it again. Use a walkthrough, and immerse yourself in an atmospheric and mysterious world and discover the murder of Mrs. Blackwood. Do yourself a favor and buy this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/scratches/user-reviews?user_review_id=2887320">Expand</a></span>

<br>What bothered me was that there&apos;s no tutorial at the beginning (for example, I had no idea how to access the inventory), the items in your bag are not labeled, so you don&apos;t know exactly what they are and you really do have a lot of clicking to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/scratches/user-reviews?user_review_id=2908846">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, this point-and-click adventure game is for people that have more than average patience; those who don&#x2019;t mind taking time searching, clicking, exploring, reading, studying clues, solving brain-scratching puzzles, and figuring out the mind-bending actions to advance the story line. Many fans of the game admit using an online guide to complete certain game sections &#x2013; while still enjoying the beautiful haunting suspenseful atmosphere and the creepy engrossing story while having frightful fun in trying to solve a good horror mystery.
<br>
<br>This game is not for those who do not have a great deal of patience, get frustrated in taking time trying to figure out how to manipulate things to progress a story, find difficulty immersing themselves in a subtle slow suspenseful environment, and/or have trouble putting themselves in a character&apos;s shoes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/scratches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3948587">Expand</a></span>

The only drawback is it is a little low-tech, even for a 2006 game.  If you aren&apos;t worried about that, and enjoy horror games, check this one out.</span>

And then it struck me: this game isn&apos;t scarey without the soundtrack! Freaking crazy music makes this game fairly interesting. It also has a farily confusing story plot, that, if you figure out, is rather quite good.</span>

If you&apos;re going to make me click 300 times to accomplish a goal, at least give me some cool cutscene. There were only 2 of those by the way...intro and ending. This should have been a book rather than a game.</span>

The supposedly &apos;huge&apos; Victorian mansion really isn&apos;t so huge, and the graphics are sub-par, especially for computer games. All the voice actors sound like Californians pretending to be British or Brits too concerned with using real British colloquialisms on Americans.  The mood of the game is good and dark, though not really creepy, not nearly so as Fatal Frame 2, for instance. There is very little reward for solving puzzles and half the time you spend wandering aimlessly or talking on the phone just to advance the story. The ending is anticlimactic. Go after the Shivers series if you want a good, creepy 1st person puzzle game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/scratches/user-reviews?user_review_id=62426">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Technical issues withstanding, this game is not only slowly paced, but completely uneventful. I am a huge horror fan, but I came into this expecting some sort of actual horror game, instead it&apos;s really just a writer walking around being freaked out.
<br>
<br>In the end, the game writers left it up to you to draw your own conclusion if there was actually anything paranormal or if it was all just in your character&apos;s head, which frankly, is lazy writing no matter how you try to defend it.
<br>
<br>Contrived, slow, stupid, poor writing, bad pacing, outdated. This game isn&apos;t worth any sort of time investment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/scratches/user-reviews?user_review_id=5403810">Expand</a></span>
