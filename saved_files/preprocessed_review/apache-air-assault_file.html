I like the single player and haven&apos;t tried multiplayer at all, because I want to be able to play good before that. The graphics are very decent and it&apos;s great fun blowing up targets and chasing enemies on the ground while shooting at them with your machine gun/cannon. I use a ST290 joystick on a system with Win XP sp3, a HD4670 graphics card, 2gb ram, P4 extreme 3.4ghz (Old System), but a goodie!
<br>If you like helicopter combat sims then you Will Enjoy this game. It does have a certain amount of controlled realism to flying the Apache. The more real you make it, the harder it will be. This game does have a good re-play action. I&apos;m just glad there are still some of these games around instead of all the mindless games that you jump into and already know all about and can play through in a couple of hours.
<br>Just get it! It&apos;s a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apache-air-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=1833568">Expand</a></span>

I like flight sims, but don&apos;t have the time to learn how to fly, neither the money to buy expensive hardware like any extreme HOTAS joystick and TrackIR. In this game the average joe can enjoy the without passing more than an hour just to learn how to take off like in many other flight sims.
<br>So, if you are not a hardcore simulation fan, but like the premise, this is for you. A lot of action and sick music! Otherwise STAY AWAY, cause the auto rechargeable hellfires and rockets (did I forget to mention this? lol) may cause you nausea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/apache-air-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=2794401">Expand</a></span>
