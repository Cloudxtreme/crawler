The cannon spread is random and the trajectory is loosely based on the direction you are tunring your ship, so it is very easy for little cannons to chew your ship to ribbons while you line up the perfect shot. If you do merchant missions over and over again, the game could be a good time-waster.

If you did I feel for you, I hope you got it cheap. Worst naval game ever. Its slow to play, having to sail off the map after finishing each level, the AI usually just runs away from you meaning you have to chase it around the map = wasted time. Aiming sucks. No way to see where shots are going beforehand, I could aim ahead and land shots, but the blast is random anyways and even when right next to a target (I mean so close you could board the other vessel if that was included in the game) at least one of the shots misses. Hitting stationary land targets from a stationary ship is broken. Period. Random. Boring (randomness makles it take a LONG time). Can be lethal, since land cannon have good accuracy since you usually have to sit still to shoot them. When you die, the game resets back to the main screen (including loading screen), meaning you have to reload your game entirely. Also, no autosave except immediately after you start a new game. Horrible voice acting and horrible written script. Annoying music, which still comes on at certain screens even after being disabled. Cannot unmap keys, suicide function is redundant because of afformentioned loading idiocy and time waste factor. LENS FLARE MOAR LENS FLARE!!!! Seriously the game is too bright. Sand looks like melted glass. Ocean has more white than blue (Geforce GTX 275, so thats running on max) Broken upgrade system. Bad controls, nothing in HUD to indicate tiller direction, makes lining up broadsides incredibly frustrating. &quot;Fastest ship in the game&quot; has a hard time catching up to fat merchantmen. I gave up when it told me to dock at some guys harbour and I spent 5 minutes trying every possible way to dock. Didn&apos;t work, I alt+F4&apos;d and deleted it from my HDD. I&apos;m glad i only paid 9 dollars for this glorified shitpile. I wish I had pirated it instead (Yar)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/buccaneer-the-pursuit-of-infamy/user-reviews?user_review_id=743665">Expand</a></span>
