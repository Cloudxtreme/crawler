I like the drop system, reminds me of diablo . Even ran into rakanishu..diablo fans know who that is. the hand drawn textures are nice and quality providing a more engrossing experience.. you feel at first as if you are playing a cartoon, ala zelda the windwaker..until somebody starts plugging you from a distance. This game is a good game, the mechanic works great, its solid, its the grind though not so hard of a grind to lvl up. looking at the base or core of the game i see there are many directions they could have taken. why they decided on this exact end model of the game suggest t me they seek to set them selves apart with origionality..yes these mechanics have always been in games..but when was the last time you have seen them. esapecially executed properly. i dig it..good game for multiple players 4 player co-op is fun. i would not however recomend this for a single player experience. i gave it a rating of 8.. but i want to give it out of a 100 score so..its an 88/100 and a nice game containing throwback drop system for the old school grinder gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=743363">Expand</a></span>

Borderlands has all the best elements from the FPS genre as well as the great ones from the RPG side. However there is only 1 major downpoint for me and that was the length, me and 2 other friends completed it in 3 nights, roughly 25 hours worth, and that was litteraly every quest you could do. Kind of a shame, but other than that there is nothing wrong with the game.

There is a very weak storyline but I think that it&apos;s overshadowed by the good concept and a utopian-like setting and interesting missions. Some would criticise the missions to be a bit too repetitive but each one has its own challenges and therefore proves to be different to the others. It&apos;s definitely worth buying for the PC, though if you&apos;re in Australia you might have to get some friends together for multiplayer action since the closest multiplayer peers are in China, which provides for very laggy gameplay</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=741182">Expand</a></span>

The grinding is fun, the weapon randomisation, and enemy variety, however, are lacking, and playing online is a pain (and people use hacked weapons profusely.

The intro was great and a pretty neat way of introducing you to the game. However it all fell apart as soon as I stepped off the bus (stepping off the bus gives you your first control of the player in the beginning of the game.) The field of view is way too close/narrow, and makes you feel very dizzy and disorientated. I looked in the settings where I may change the FOV setting, but there was none. The settings looked very limited and this is when the red flags started to go up for me. The game itself feels like every other shooter. Graphics are sub-par for a PC release for end of 2009, but still rather good and the art style is neat. The sound effects are pretty good, and I love how they introduce the characters. There has been quite a bit of thought into the characters and their personalities which makes the world a very interesting one to explore. The questing system is odd with it&apos;s big betters for your quest description and you need to use page up and page down to scroll through the quest description if it doesn&apos;t all fit on the screen, which is most quests. This is obviously due to a sloppy, non-thought-out port from a console version. Overall it is these type of things that are an insult to the PC gaming world. We don&apos;t need or want a 96pt font and pageup/pagedown quest interface. It may be a small thing, but adding mouse scroll function goes along way. The sound selection is original and done quite well, however I found it annoying because it would come on at odd times during a fight so I ended up turning it down to 30% of its normal volume. Overall, it seems like it has potential in the console, but when PC users has more in depth feeling games with better graphics and interfaces, it&apos;s going to be a hard sell. 7/10 because it&apos;s a great game, but for PC it didn&apos;t really impress me with the lack of settings/options, and overall feel of the interface and game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=738427">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a blast to play with friends but a bit lacking in single player, but I think this applies to just about every game. For a game which attempts to merge to completely different genres, it does an impressive job, though it&apos;s more of an Action FPS RPG than a traditional FPS RPG, if that makes any sense. Bosses are killed simply because they are there and characters have about as much importance as any of the NPCs in Diablo II. However, I was fine with this as the main draw of this game is simply getting out there and blasting enemies with a wide array of sweet weapons. I&apos;m not fond of the quest grind system and would have liked a different approach, but that&apos;s more because of the nightmares of WoW it brought back to me. Either way, it&apos;s definitely worth a purchase, and I hope to see a sequel soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1692692">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s exactly what this game makes me feel around every corner. For the first few hours, you will be fighting nothing but bandits and skags (dogs) and the only difference is one dog would run at you while the other would jump at you, then breathe fire at you. The enemies take too much damage, even for an RPG, It would make more sense for a pistol to kill in one clip if its equally leveled with the bandit than it taking like 7 clips. The elemental guns are okay idea, not properly implemented. Some normal bandits will carry them, and when you are fighting a group of them then suddenly one pulls you a fire gun, then you start taking super high damage...it can get a little cheap when you die. Which brings me to my next problem: When you die in borderlands you will go into this mode where you are on your knees and have to kill another enemy to get your &quot;second wind&quot; When down, you cannot aim down the sites. That sounds great on paper, but now when I&apos;m taking too many hits I just almost kill an enemy so when I go down I can get right back up with half health.  The 100,000+ guns are just re textures of the same 20-35 guns, with the occasional effect added on to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=3166238">Expand</a></span>

As a single-player game, it&apos;s reasonably entertaining, if repetitive, during the first run-through, but the game truly shines in co-op mode. Points taken off for some major design flaws (revolvers are better for sniping than sniper rifles...huh?; the special abilities of two classes are extremely useful, while the other two are mostly useless; repetitive quests and enemies; etc.), but the slick art direction, tight FPS gameplay, ridiculous diversity of loot, and the murderous mayhem of playing co-op push this title up to a respectable score.

The inventive look, feel, combination of diablo and halo, the style, the humor. Even while playing the game for extended lengths I felt so incredibly comfortable mindlessly ticking off quests and collecting loot. It&apos;s a very simple and primal game. Looking back on borderlands leaves less of an impression than actually playing it however. The game has a kind of emptiness to it. A void that leaves no impression. For me emotions leave the strongest memories (I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just me?) and the generic nature of borderlands story and quests makes the game feel a lot like high powered junk food. You enjoy it while you are munching on the fat and sugar - you feel kind of depressed and regretful after. My time in borderlands was fun - however fun itself is not exactly &apos;meaningful&apos; in the same way discovering a talking dog in skyrim was, or experiencing a betrayal in the witcher 2, or choosing between destroying a colony or saving it in mass effect. If borderlands had more meaningful quests and a story - it might have left a mark. A fondness. However I can&apos;t give a game a 9/10 or a 8/10 if it simply fills my time, nomatter how mindlessly entertaining that filling was. I need something more. I hope borderlands 2 finds more of a compromise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=2159484">Expand</a></span>

The numerous guns they boasted are only there because of a randomized stat generator, every mission is a gather this, kill this, find this mission, and while the level up system looked promising, it ended up bland and unoriginal. It has some character in the comical way characters react and speak, but they are all cardboard cutouts; not reacting when you shoot them, not responding to events around them, and only having 1-2 lines before repeating what they said. I played through about level 30 before becoming absolutely bored of the grind-ish feel to the game so I tried some multiplayer. While I expected greatness, it ended up feeling the exact same, except, with another human present. Maybe if you had four very good friends playing and you all made jokes and fooled around it would be fun, but that isn&apos;t really relevant to the game. You can do that with any game. While it looked promising, it failed to deliver the FPS/RPG I had been waiting for due to oversimplification of the RPG elements and a general grindfest feel to the FPS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=743124">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d say it&apos;s a combination of S.T.A.L.K.E.R and Fallut 3. But it perfects those games&apos; ideas so you get one great game. It&apos;s got the open-world gameplay like Fallout 3, but expands it so there are enemies at literally every nook and cranny, unlike Fallout 3 where you wander around for miles on end with no sight of anybody(pretty creepy). This game also has the quest system of STALKER and Fallout 3, where you can take any mission any time, anywhere. What makes this game great for casual players is that you can pretty much just jump in because missions are straightforward with no complexity, which is of course good and bad. The good is that you won&apos;t get confused with what to do, and the bad is that the storyline is not very in depth. The only reason I give this a 9 and not a 10 is because of the somewhat frail srotyline. Other than that, i&apos;d say the graphics are very unique, something you don&apos;t see often(or at all), gameplay is pretty addicting because the enemies pretty much get stronger as you level up meaning there will not be a moment where your enemies are no match for you.I&apos;&apos;d say this game is glitchless as far as I see, but that might not be true for someone else. I have to say my FRS is really good on this game(around 40-50), and it does not crash on my computer. I run this game from steam with a nvidia GTX275 and a 2.4 duo CPU(it&apos;s overcloaked, the real CPU is 3.08 duo) and 6GB of memory. I said this so in case anybody is wondering what systems will support Borderlands well(these 3 parts are probably enough info I don&apos;t think I need to tell you my motherboard or power supply etc.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=742951">Expand</a></span>

I convinced 3 other friends to get this game and we have been having the most fun we&apos;ve had gaming in quite awhile. I got this game knowing nothing about it, I&apos;ve never investigated this game prior to playing it, someone simply said &quot;hey, play borderlands!&quot; so I did. I love a game that introduces completely new game play aspects even in late game. The first grenade mod I got (Explosive MIRV), I threw it at the ground to see what exactly it did. A cluster grenade?! Why don&apos;t other games have cluster grenades!! It&apos;s great that a game finally understands you can make a cooler weapon by not just making it more powerful, but making it shoot differently. My level 45 Siren has a super fast SMG that can unload the full 80 rounds in just under 3 seconds, and in the next slot a fairly accurate explosive SMG with 4.5x zoom! However, the entire game was not all full of joy. It upset me that character skills were all passive but the action skill - which makes sense for a console game (sigh...). I picked the Siren because she looked like a caster. Elemental weapons are kind of like spells... But I would appreciate a skill where my bullets could do a chain-lightning effects. Playing as the siren, most abilities don&apos;t exactly make sense. Damaging enemies while stealthed, not so useful... Dazing enemies isn&apos;t effective in a &quot;hack and slash&quot; type of game. The melee wasn&apos;t satisfying. It was sad that there were no melee weapons but the bladed pistols, which had an absurdly slow attack speed. I was also upset that there was only one vehicle - but the small amount of customization was still nice to have. I hope that the next in the series will be more PC-based. I would love to have a Skag or Sythid as a pet, or add a plow to my vehicle to reduce damage taken from explosive enemies... I hope there are more random weapons with special effects like T.K.&apos;s Wave. - a shotgun which shoots blue bullets in a wave-like effect (Fun, but not practical - which is fine!). I still plan to do a few more playthroughs with this game to get the full experience, but I have very high hopes for Borderlands 2. I just need to keep my fingers crossed for the next few years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=738500">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t even bother to read or appreciate the npcs thereafter anymore because there isn&apos;t any character development in it. the kind of graphics used only works for Team Fortress 2, after a while it actually looks quite childish to me and i&apos;m somewhat annoyed that the graphical scaling doesn&apos;t allow for higher settings to utilize my hardware. All that is fine, but biggest sign that it&apos;s a console game isn&apos;t the somewhat substandard graphics, it&apos;s the shitty implementation of controls and multiplayer! I actually had to press the &quot;Page Up/Down&quot; button to scroll through text in the game, and the damned multiplayer doesn&apos;t work by default, i actually had to go google for solutions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=743601">Expand</a></span>

Online playability makes it so fun to play as the class you selected. Level your toons with a group of three others, and have fun kicking @$$ with others online. Share loot and make friends as you blast, slash, spray, and pummel you way through BorderLands. If you haven&apos;t picked this game up for the fear of the game sucking cause of the graphics. Than your a noob and your missing out on the best FPS-RPG in the history of gaming!!! If you don&apos;t believe me. Then go to a friends or family members house that has the game and play it up. Don&apos;t be the only kid on the block that doesn&apos;t have this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=743572">Expand</a></span>

I suppose I gotta do Borderlands since its sequel is coming up soon.  Now, Borderlands.  This is a fantastic game until about level 25.  There are many things this game did right to start off with.  You immediately pick up its visual style.  The cell-shaded look they go for here is awesome, it looks like you&apos;re playing a graphic novel of sorts.  Secondly, they thrust you into this foreign world without much plot to go on except some hints about a treasure buried somewhere there.  It&apos;s all very intriguing, and I loved it.  It goes downhill from there unfortunately.  The starting zone is great, but once you move on to some of the later areas, for some reason they just didn&apos;t click for me.  Some of the later level areas especially got really drab and monotonous, and getting around was a chore, since you get the World of Warcraft wading-through-mountains-of-trash-mobs syndrome.  Here&apos;s where I&apos;m gonna get really spoilerish, not that it matters since this is a 3-year-old game anyways.  The final boss completely disappoints.  They set up the entire game getting you to anticipate this Vault they keep talking about with its treasures and such.  You beat the final boss and you don&apos;t get anything.  You never open the vault, you don&apos;t don anything with it.  You don&apos;t even get a cool weapon for beating the final boss. It just ends.  All you can do is go back and start the game over to try and hit level cap on a second playthrough.  And they didn&apos;t even incorporate that into the story well.  They hinted a couple time throughout the story about a bit of time travel and an enormous wink when your bus driver at the beginning says &quot;I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be doing this all over again really soon.&quot;  But instead of incorporating that restart into the story, it&apos;s just kinda there.  So I guess if you like a cool graphical style and some cool FPS/RPG hybrid stuff, then this game is pretty good.  The DLC added some interesting adventure as well, but for me, I really liked all that stuff, but in the end it just wasn&apos;t enough to get this above a &quot;good&quot; rating.  It is definitely still worth trying if you haven&apos;t played it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=2152490">Expand</a></span>

I can respect that. It is, at the core, a traditional and simplified Action-RPG game. The change to first-person bring some new twists, but a bit more issues than benefits.<br>Firstly, long-walks in the desert are quite boring, but required. The game, due to the immense amount of guns and details, opted to reuse areas repeatedly, putting more missions in areas you previously completed. This wouldn&apos;t be so bad if travel between areas wasn&apos;t so long and boring. Dealing with the long clicky-walks in Diablo 2 isn&apos;t so bad when you&apos;re young and have time to waste, but this gets a bit old.<br>Speaking of tiresome, the entire scripted tutorial intro system gets old IMMEDIATELY. These videos and sequences cannot be skipped, and thus you are punished by wasting several minutes doing basics and standing around waiting for the game to begin. Sequences can be good to add story, but ASK the player if they want to sit and watch them again on the next playthrough.<br>Now, onto this &apos;RPG&apos;. Most of the role-playing is playing a specific class. This game was clearly intended for co-op, and as such the single-player is a bit weak. However, they decided to throw in a load of story dialog and pop-up dialogs for missions, and as such the first playthrough can feel very overwhelming. Trust me, you aren&apos;t playing this for the story. Just let it pass. The leveling system is mostly in building gun expertise, but allows some stat improvements. However, classes have 1 ability. Not &apos;pick one from X number&apos;, ONE SINGLE ability. You can adjust the effects by getting items and skill points, but it&apos;s always the same skill. Leveling is slightly controlled by reducing XP gains from killing weaker enemies and killing them in easy ways (vehicles). Grinding becomes less effective, and thus pushes you to go forwards in the game, but enemies continue to spawn in every location forever. Even if you stay near their spawn points, given a few minutes, they will come back. It&apos;s ridiculous killing a spawn camp 3 times in a single mission, especially when they aren&apos;t worth much points but they still attack and annoy you. And then they don&apos;t reward ammo as much when they are easier, again punishing you for not rushing through areas and completing missions faster than enemies can respawn.<br>What you DO get in this game is guns, gore, and addictive loot like most ARPGs. There are many areas to be improved, but the game is good fun with friends. Duels work better than other ARPGs, but Tank seems to be the best. Due to the lack of gun variety and skill options, most classes play similar, and you really don&apos;t have much reason to play the game multiple times. If you want RPG, go with Fallout. If you want loot, TQ, Grim Dawn, and even Hellgate London are good options. If you want a game to share with friends and combine all this, honestly look now to Borderlands 2 and be patient. I hope it fixes the issues of the first game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730735">Expand</a></span>

I really don&apos;t find the entertainment value in this game. Perhaps I am crazy, or it&apos;s an issue with today&apos;s common gamer. This game is simply boring. There&apos;s nothing fun about it. That&apos;s a very bold statement, but I stand by it. The game treats you like you&apos;re a child with ADHD; there are flashy graphics, constant drops of items and loot, and oh so silly jokes that would keep only those who find shows like Family Guy entertained. The game is an insult to my and, I would hope, most other gamer&apos;s intelligence. Yes, there is a lot of loot. And I found myself changing weapons and all my gear so quickly it&apos;d make my head spin. The time I finally got a weapon I enjoyed using, another one would drop which was objectively better. This would happen throughout the game and it would happen multiple times in one hour. This leaves the whole looting system lose it&apos;s charm. While some would call it a rewarding system, I would argue it&apos;s the exact opposite. While it does make you feel good to upgrade a weapon, it happens so often that it just becomes a pointless mechanic. The game&apos;s humor is that on a 13 year old&apos;s who first started using curse words in front of his friends. The jokes are just dumb. Literally, just dumb. The multiplayer is just that, multiple people playing the same boring, dull, repetitive, and half-witted game. I am glad I got the game for free, but it&apos;s unfortunate I cannot get a refund. What a joke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=2655564">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll go over the good first. The combat is entertaining and a touch different than other shooters. You get to tweak your character with different abilities to make unique builds which change how your character plays. The game randomly generates weapons so everything that drops is unique and a possible great find, it keeps you looking for loot.  These things make it fun to play and the graphics are done in an art style like animation cells which I really like, it looks superb. The bad things bring it down however. The game scales terribly. As you do quests and gain exp. you will level too fast and quickly become too powerful, tearing through groups of enemies far too easily. A second play through with tougher enemies is possible, but not fun. You will start much higher level than foes and there is no challenge. The game is lacking several graphics controls on the options menu, which is stupid because the devs put the coding for the controls in the files, they just didn&apos;t make buttons. You will have to edit the .ini file yourself to turn on things like v-sync and get a widescreen point of view. Very lazy on the devs part there. Instructions for doing this are easy to find and it&apos;s not hard to do, but I shouldn&apos;t have to. So, overall Borderlands is a fun game that ends up being far too easy to play and has some basic setup options missing, but obtainable with manual editing on the users part.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697828">Expand</a></span>

I have found random things in boxes and crates that stack on your shields that you can repeatedly drop and pick up to gain hp and shields. I didn&apos;t know this but now i just noticed my hp is around 1000000. These things add money and are random finds. I loved everything about this except for that. Overall, this is an ok game.</span>

Played for hours at a time; both single player, and with friends I have on Steam.  Im partial to Lilith, but all the charectors are fun.  Its basically a very creative, fast paced, shoot em up game.  There are multiple episodes, and each takes a respectable amount of time to finish.  There are a billion weapons of every kind(or it seemed so to me lol).  There are tons of quests, and the map is pretty much wide open so you can run around doing what you want, when you want.  The charector progression, and multiple skill trees are fun, and you get better at using a particular weapon type the more you use the weapon type.  I loved thinning out the mobs by popping head shots with a elemental sniper rifle from afar, and then going in, and cleaning up with an machine gun or automatic hand gun.  Getting close to mobs using Liliths Pheonix skill is a riot too, especially in zombie land.  Im a little more methodical than other players though.  Some people Ive played with like to just wade in with a shot gun, or rocket launcher.  There&apos;s also vehicle battles, and a thunderdome style arena where you have a ton of mobs thrown at you at once, under many different conditions, such as low gravity, faster speeds, or using specific weapon types for more, or less damage.  Borderlands is simply one of those games just about anyone will love-trust me!  The few people who gave it bad reviews...well, theres always gonna be a couple of people in every crowd who have to say the sky is red if you say its blue lol!  Anyway, good luck!

This game is way up there in my list of favorites.  It&apos;s easy to learn and extremely fun.  I agree with some reviewers that it doesn&apos;t make sense to find a pistol that has better zoom than many sniper rifles in the game, but that&apos;s what I love about the game.  The randomization of weapons is awesome and when you think you have the best guns you&apos;re gonna find, there is a drop which is even better (though at higher character levels, you&apos;re probably going to have your gun preferences like me).  It&apos;s more of a FPS and less of a RPG, pretty much an ARPG.  Diablo was my favorite game ever (many sleepless evenings) and I can&apos;t say this game measures up to that time and excitement level, but it&apos;s really addictive and took me a while to finally stop playing it (months).  Right now it&apos;s on sale at Steam and this is when I got it before.  Well worth the original price let alone the sale price.  Automatic buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1823642">Expand</a></span>

Shooting the same bandits over and over and over no matter where u are or what level u are gets old.   And the &apos;story&apos; is an obvious last minute bolt-on for a mediocre repetitive shooter.  The npcs have absolutely no character -- they dont even every move!  They coudnt even manage to get the &apos;guide&apos; into the game - -she&apos;s just an overlay!  The only reason i rated this above 5 is that i bought it for $20.  Thats about all it was worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604754">Expand</a></span>

Can&apos;t really think of any real cons. The base campaign plus DLCs is about 60h long, but achievements and walkthrough 2 (hardmode) will keep you busy even longer. Definetly the best RPG-FPS to date.</span>

Though the game can obviously improve on things, this game is pioneering its way for a new genre in the gaming industry that makes it look really promising. All the elements and new ideas are brand new and something to appreciate and enjoy. There is nothing cooler then blasting enemies with your friends for awesome loot and let me tell you.. the weapons and gear are NEVER seem to be the same. Every single item is always slightly different. Though the few bugs and short comings are apparent you cannot deny this game&apos;s innovation. 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1859585">Expand</a></span>

Compatibility issues? Really?  Borderlands was an interesting, albeit slow paced experience, from what I&apos;ve played. Then, shortly after updating cpu drivers(as one should regularly), TADAAAA! &quot;Borderlands has stopped Working&quot; Now, this is not an issue of files installed incorrectly due to a pirated copy, so all you white knights and internet police officers calm down. It&apos;s that the game surprisingly enough can only run at all using dx9, or setting affinity to one singular core with updated drivers. This is a very prominent problem among Steam users as well, who have not seen any response at all from Gearbox on the issue. Besides the obvious problems of the game not working though, the gameplay was painstaking. GO HERE. COLLECT THAT. SHOOT FOUR F*CKING PEOPLE. Mission Completed! And the setting. Grey grey grey grey gray brown grey light brown grey yellow gray grey rust gray grey grey. The graphics? For a game made quite some time ago it lags, even with sub-par graphics that it has on low or high alike. Sure, the cartoony feel to it is appealing for some, but aesthetically, it does not work. And customization of characters is limited. And 3 hours of gameplay gets you nowhere. NO. no no no no no. Go buy S.T.A.L.K.E.R., or Fallout 3. Just stay far, far, farrrrr away from this poorly made rpg regurgitation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781967">Expand</a></span>

It could be really boring if you play alone but this is a Co-op experience. With the awesome guns, the catch-a-ride, it&apos;s unique graphics it is a must play Loot-filled adventure.</span>

It was offered in a bundle with other games, much more entertaining games but still I decided to try it out. The first hour of the game is quite fun, you shoot at stuff, collect guns and ammo, do a few missions and progress through the campaign all the while ignoring the terribly annoying storyline (and characters). Once you get used to this game and actually get some decent gear you start noticing all the bugs and glitches, most notably the hit boxes. The one critical, essential, necessary game mechanic a shoot-em-up game must get flawlessly is the hit registration. You shoot people in the head point blank with a sniper rifle and it misses, you shoot em in the chest point blank and it misses. You goddamn purposefully shoot beside them and it hits... The storyline, characters and cutscenes are dreadfully annoying and also unskippable, therefore you&apos;re not playing this game for the plot. The game mechanics are riddled with bugs which render the game almost unplayable, therefore you&apos;re not playing this game for its gameplay. This game has terrible graphics, graphics that at first sight reminded me of a f2p game called Drift City(for those familiar), therefore you&apos;re not playing this game for the awe factor. A single question remains. Why are you playing this game?<br><br>I give it a 3 out of 10 because 1. the game actually was capable of installing itself on my PC. 2. The splash screen pops up when you click the game&apos;s icon. 3. The .exe file actually works and the game launches. Otherwise it&apos;s worthless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1643964">Expand</a></span>

There are also a number of bugs including dynamic shadows being incorrectly implemented so you have to turn it off. This is a bad port from console to pc, and you can tell they did not put much effort into the pc version.</span>

It is far too easy (to make it playable for someone playing on console with a gamepad I guess) I ran straight through the entire game and was like &quot;...what ...this is it?&quot; The story sucks - it completely fails to draw you in, repetitive missions. Also that its full of cheaters that run around with haxed huge inventories swiping all the loot if you host and allow people to join your game, again due to it being a poor console port, what was this &quot;optimizing for PC&quot; about again? I am sick of good games being ruined because every developer wants to milk money out of the console market and see PC as a secondary platform just for extra cash, and although I really enjoyed this game for a little while, I don&apos;t think It was worth the money I forked out for it, and I will think twice before buying from Gearbox again. But as I said it&apos;s not something new, a lot of developers are following this trend now, and the true good pc titles seem to be more and more rare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=743173">Expand</a></span>

The menu handling on PCs is, to put it politely, braindead. It all makes sense instantly the moment you realize that it was originally meant for consoles.
<br>
<br>And the game remains consistent at this.
<br>
<br>The loading times between levels is, in one word, stunning. Usually enough time to get a new can of soda, just like you&apos;d expect from a console game that needs to load the next level from its DVD. But ...  on a PC?
<br>
<br>Now, consoles do not have firewalls or other pesky things like this. Hence, Borderlands&apos; multiplayer option refuses to work if you happen to consider security something that you might want on your PC. Only if you turn off every semblance of protection, forward a metric ton of ports and let everything and anything connect freely to your machine, you might be allowed to hope that maybe you could possibly be rewarded with a working multiplayer session.
<br>
<br>Ok, I take that &apos;working&apos; back. It might connect. For how long, well, let&apos;s say it will be a surprise for you.
<br>
<br>When you finally get to play, it&apos;s FUN! For about 10 minutes. Then you notice that, well, you&apos;re actually doing the same crap over and over and over and over... and while that was fun for Diablo a decade ago, it kinda got old by now.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not even fun as a shooter. This from someone who loves multiplayer shooters and adores the graphics of TF2 (one of the reasons why I bought BL, the graphics sure resemble those of TF2). It just is plainly and simply no fun. And it&apos;s not even that the enemies are &quot;only NPCs&quot;, I love Left4Dead with a similar &quot;us 4 against 100 enemies, we&apos;re soooo unfair!&quot; feel to it. The Borderlands NPCs are just simply terrible. Either they are brain dead zombies (no pun intended) that look at you blankly while you take potshots. Or they have superhuman radar that makes &quot;sneaking&quot; up to them completely pointless since they seem to know just where you are on the map, all the time, whether they can see you or not. Essentially, that reduces the &quot;shooter&quot; element to &quot;fire your gun in the general direction of the enemy, absorb the return fire (no need to duck or anything, it won&apos;t change a bit), then go and collect the trinkets. Rinse, repeat.
<br>
<br>Tactics? GROUP tactics?
<br>
<br>C&apos;mon, it&apos;s so obviously a console shooter, you&apos;re expecting WAY too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468439">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s worth buying, especially since it goes on sale every month on Steam, but prepare to be more disappointed than you have been with any game you have ever played. Also, some glitches here and there, a couple of story holes, and the fact that shotguns are just random damage generators irked me a little throughout the game, but not too horribly so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1993024">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a combination of RPG and good &apos;ol fashion first person shooter(FPS). The only really new thing is the art style that borderlands utilizes, it&apos;s very unique and gives a nice look and feel to the game.<br><br>This game wasn&apos;t originally made for the PC-market, but it was ported. However it&apos;s a fairly decent port, some of the controls are objectionable, there are a couple of instances where you have to use your arrow keys to navigate through menus, something PC-gamers aren&apos;t very fond off. But in general it&apos;s no problems at all.<br><br>The biggest problem with the fact that the game is ported, have to do with the game&apos;s difficulty.<br>A direct effect of putting a console FPS game on a PC is that the game becomes ridiculously easy.<br>The fact that the AI is incredibly dumb isn&apos;t making this less of a problem. The bots will continuously try to shoot you through objects, such as houses and metal walls. Some bosses I was able to take down by simply standing still, the final boss for instance.<br><br>The class system is not very unique, not new in any way, shape or form. It saddens me that such potential got lost here. It doesn&apos;t really feel as if the classes make any particular difference whatsoever. Now one might argue that the ability to specialise(see spec), can counter weight this but in truth it doesn&apos;t. The classes is just a mare smoke and mirrors, there&apos;s nothing really special about the classes, maybe except for the soldier.<br><br>The creeps look virtually identical throughout the entire game. You never get to see anything new.<br>The same goes for weapons, there are pretty much 7 different kinds of weapons to chose from in the entirety of the game. The only thing being different is the stats, and sometimes the scope. That is artificial diversity as far as I&apos;m concerned.<br>The missions are also very similar, there are a few kinds of mission types(kill X of Y, collect X many Y etc.), but nothing above that. This makes for an extremely repetitive game, with almost no re-playability.<br><br>On the other hand, there&apos;s a lot of good things with the game too. The story line is meagre but still bearable. The huge amount of randomly generated weapons makes looting a whole lot of fun.<br>And to top it off, the networking worked superbly, no fuss at all.<br><br>My conclusion is that this game is worthwhile playing if you got 2-3 friendly to play with and if you like repetitive games, with virtually no story attached to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1435502">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s essentially just a diablo game without even good story telling.  the NPCs you interact with are mostly wooden and dull without any story behind or interesting personality. The game is also suffered from way too many fetch and simple killing quests which are pointless and tedious, and gives no immersion in the game world. The aspects of the game that I find fairly good are solid shooting mechanics and four distinct classes which gives you some fun time and replay values. The game provides tons of looting but I find it rewards the player so quick that you really can not feel any accomplishment. Comparing to Mass effect 2 and Deus Ex which perfectly integrate RPG story-telling and gameplay into a shooter based game, Borderlands just feels too un-inspired and bland. I seriously can not recommend this game to anyone, since it&apos;s just pure a waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=1814945">Expand</a></span>

The co-op multilayer is kinda &quot;cheating&quot; to me, you can just use weak level to join higher level player, you only just wait the experience level from the higher level. I love the combination of FPS and RPG, but I think it not that enjoy to play.</span>

The one week delay to optimize the PC version turned out to be a big sack of lies. Nothing was optimized for PC. This game is a console port. 90% of the in game menus are NOT mouse supported. For example, if you get into an online game, you can&apos;t kick some from clicking their name, you have to use arrow keys and select them. The online backbone of the game is even more crappier. Of all online gaming infrastructures Gearbox decided to use Gamespy... I pretty sure a lot of FPS gamers moved away from Gamespy back in 1998. So in the end if you want a Online CO-OP game. Do Not Buy this game, it&apos;s not a co-op game if you have a hard time connecting to other players. Probably better off purchasing Left 4 Dead 2. Gearbox Software is only good at bring PC ports to consoles, NOT the other way around. Save your money, this game is not worth it. Gearbox only released this game on PC to make some quick cash. They haven&apos;t even acknowledge on there official forums that there are a lot of problems. Sure they&apos;re could be fixing it, but easing your customers minds goes a long way. Once again DO NOT BUY! Unless you are only going to play single player mostly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=738148">Expand</a></span>

Most of your skill ups are used in passive abilities, and therefore i find it to be too much of a FPS game with one special ability per class, that a real RPG.</span>

This game ends once you complete the game, its quests are very repetitive and are all &quot;Grind&quot; quests. Even though you can replay the game in a harder mode, i just don&apos;t see any fun in it at all as you would only be Re-Grinding the boring quests you have already done before. However if this game had a big multiplayer setup like on Counter-Strike or Left 4 Dead it would definitely get a straight 10/10 because it would pretty much eliminate all of the problems which are current. So only buy this game if you have 3 more friends you would want to play with, it is not worth the money to play it for a few days on your own, complete it and then never look at it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands/user-reviews?user_review_id=738396">Expand</a></span>

The only problem i have with the game is the rpg elements, a lot of the skills are kindof wierd, such as liliths phasewalk, I feel like they could have done a lot better job developing the skills for the characters.
