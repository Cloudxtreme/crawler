Even with the extreme lack of depth in the game, killing hundreds or even thousands of enemies is a good premise, but poses a problem when the core combat of the game isn&apos;t enjoyable or satisfying at all. I don&apos;t want to sound repugnant or anything, but when you shoot somebody in a game you want feedback, explosions, you want the enemy to fire back a few feet, and blood shooting everywhere. You want a sense of actually hitting something. In Serious Sam II there is none of that. When you shoot somebody it feels like you are just taking away his health and when his health hits zero he&apos;ll die. Vechicle segments are simple and would be much more satisfying if they were treated the same way. One of SS2&apos;s strongest features are it&apos;s graphics. It may not be a F.E.A.R or Quake 4, but alot of outside environments are massive (though not as massive as the original&apos;s levels) and extremely colourful. Thank god there are no dark corridors in this game. Serious Sam II is a one trick dog, and when that one trick is pretty lame in the first place a game like this can&apos;t succeed. This is a below average title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385219">Expand</a></span>

<br>While the level and weapon design may be unique from other shooters the overall feel of the game is unpolished at best. There are obvious breaks in the map design where you can see places you aren&apos;t supposed to, the cut scenes look terrible and have obvious consistency issues (part of the map doesn&apos;t look the same as it did while you were playing) they are boring and just something you want to skip in general. Most of the combat is really easy and  there are places where you can literally just stand still and hold fire and you&apos;ll win, none of the &quot;run and gun&quot; that made the previous title great is really necessary...
<br>The game tries to break up some of this monotony with vehicle &quot;mini-games.&quot; I call them that because the vehicles are overpowered and usually instantkill death machines that win you the game instantly... but try to run through the same scene without the vehicle and you&apos;ll be put up against an unwinnable battle, so it leaves you little choice in the matter. Overall if they had at least tried to stick to some of what made The First/Second Encounter good they might have made a good title, but in the end it feel flat on it&apos;s face.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3153870">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d watched youtube videos of gameplay and my first impression was that it looked silly, stupid and easy, and wasn&apos;t worth my time. But then there was a steam sale and I picked it up for 3.5 bucks and thought: what the hell, I wouldn&apos;t be a true fan unless I&apos;d played every game. The result startled me. I found this game really fun, and very true to the Serious Sam formula with a few additions. The game looks great, almost as good as HD, but what it lacked in the minor graphics department it made up in design and color. There&apos;s twice the variety of enemies in SS2 vs other titles, and also many more locations which keeps things interesting and fresh.  The difficulty is what you&apos;d expect from a Serious Sam game, however it is a touch easier, so I recommend bumping up the difficulty one more notch than what you are used to. There&apos;s a life system, which i assume is left over from consoles, but ignore it and use the traditional quick save and quick load feature that the PC version has. The jokes are very hit and miss. Some are laughable, and some don&apos;t even make sense. Yes the game is very silly if you watch the cutscenes, and a lot of the enemies have silly designs like clowns, footballers and witches, but these are very easy to look past if you want to, or you could embrace and enjoy the silliness, but you quickly forget it anyway when being attacked by 50 units at once. The levels are shorter, approx 25mins per level as opposed to the hour long grinds of the originals, but there&apos;s also a lot more of them and in total the single player campaign is a few hours longer than originals. The levels are also smaller, with less space to run, and there&apos;s a lack of those iconic vast battlefields, however this is balanced by your character running slower than in the original games. Wrapping things up, Serious Sam 2 is an underrated and unappreciated classic that is very much worthy of the franchise and should be played by all those that loves things Serious Sam. It&apos;s louder, it&apos;s more colorful, it&apos;s sillier, but it still packs plenty of punch and kicks your ass.

New or modified weapons are not good balanced. Enemies are not interesting. Level design and re-spawning enemies are not ok. After few levels, I was bored and I&apos;ve had no motivation to continue. It&apos;s not bad game, but it&apos;s not working for me. All those details from Serious Sam: First encounter are worse. And those worse details destroyed excellent game. Now it&apos;s just average FPS game.

<br>I already mentioned in my TSE review that Serious Sam is all about developing your own tactics against different types of enemies, then the game throws at you those enemies in really different ways testing your tactics and skill, different enemies in different numbers mixed in different ways with each other, placed in different ways on different maps, and if you don&apos;t take it in a more tactical way the games might get too chaotic at times, but if you&apos;re in the mood that can also be a good thing, just running around killing everyone, that feels great if you are in the mood for that. Also, one of the best soundtracks, and I listen to lots of soundtracks!
<br>
<br>But heres where the problems with Serious Sam II start: The difficulty isn&apos;t as balanced as it was in the previous games, at some points the waves of enemies seem way too long and the action becomes more tedious, but the worst part is that shooting enemies and blowing **** up doesn&apos;t feel as satisfying as it does in the other games.
<br>Some guns feel weak, the explosions also lame, enemies sink into the ground as soon as they die, blood is replaced by some weird smoke that disappears soon and its not ever red for many enemies, somehow I still enjoy this game but it can&apos;t compare to the feeling the other Serious Sam games, both older and newer ones, can give you.
<br>The level design is also not that great, sometimes too linear and sometimes feel empty, people who like exploration would enjoy the other games more. And the worst part is probably the least important part,the silliness. Both the look of the game, the jokes and the story went too far with this silly cartoony style.  I love how much more colorful the game is compared to half the games in the franchise, but making it cartoony is probably part of why the shooting isn&apos;t as fun, the story is garbage and the jokes are sometimes too childish.
<br>Theres smaller problems, like one short platforming part later in the game or the point where they throw lots of zombies with shotguns at you followed by Kamikazes in a tiny room earlier, but Ill just end this with saying, this game has lots of problems and definitely cannot in any way compare to The Second Encounter, so there are better alternatives.
<br>
<br>So why do I still love this game? I&apos;m not sure. Maybe its a little bias, since thats one of the first games I&apos;ve completed, my first shooter and first Serious Sam game, maybe because it has more bosses and variation then the other games and a bunch of cool ideas, even if half of that is **** maybe because the soundtrack is still really awesome, or just because its still, with all its flaws, a Serious Sam game at its core, and while being the most flawed of them, it is still a really fun Serious Sam game and it wants you to have fun with it.
<br>You can have fun with it, if you&apos;re in the right mood and don&apos;t have any high expectations from it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3982983">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Well really a great Sci-fi game. As a Serious Sam fan I like this game. This game has just changed the gameplay of Serious Sam . Also gives a great look. The story is fine but doesn&apos;t give a serious story telling. But overall as a Serious Sam fan I love this game.</span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s too mindless. Even though I liked the 2nd Encounter, Serious Sam 2 just didn&apos;t appeal to me All the game is, is shoot stuff get a cutscene, get to another planet with friendly aliens which differ slightly, maybe by colour but all sound the same as the aliens that were on the other planet and are all small and bipedal. Fight some boss, get medallion repeat until you get all 6 pieces. It&apos;s very repetitive and feels mindless and pointless. With jokes and humour that falls flat and only those 10 and under would be amused by.
<br>
<br>This is like the kids version of Serious Sam with cartoony over bright graphics and enemies such as clowns and witches that look like they came straight from a cartoon and clowns have the exact same cackle as the witches and instead of the major mechanoids there are now T-Mechs which have dinosaur heads and tails and Rhino Cybertoys which look like giant wind up toy rhinos instead of Sirian werebulls which just shows new enemies are made with a kiddie like theme. And while I don&apos;t mind, kiddie or cartoony type games, I feel it does not suit this game and prefer the darker, grittier feel of The Serious Sam Encounters.
<br>
<br>This is the worst Serious Sam. It&apos;s a rather average game bordering on bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/serious-sam-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5318327">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:

<br>Goofy story
<br>
<br>Badass weapons
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>Bland at times
<br>
<br>To hard at times
<br>
<br>KHAN
<br>
<br>Overall this game was...okay,You shouldn&apos;t pay more than 9.99Usd for it.
