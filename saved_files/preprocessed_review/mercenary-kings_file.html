They reuse the same objectives, art assets, maps, and enemies A LOT throughout almost 70 missions. It gets boring about 5 hours into the game of repeating the same things over and over. It doesn&apos;t help that all the maps look very similar and enemies all have the same spawning points with extremely boring mechanics. The enemies feel like something out of super mario, where they wall back and forth, pop up and down, etc. Now imagine playing super mario with a machine gun that shoots heat sinking missiles and bullets that go through walls. You get an idea of how easy this game is?
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t recommend this game if you&apos;re looking for an action packed game like Metal Slug, this game is far from it. Of course it&apos;s still in beta, but I don&apos;t see things changing much besides bug fixes.
<br>
<br>I forgot to mention, at $15 this game feels a bit overpriced, and they are apparently going to selling it for $20. I feel for what I&apos;ve played, this game should be no more than $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mercenary-kings/user-reviews?user_review_id=3398144">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>the best way i could describe mercenary kings is a combination of gunstar heroes, contra, megaman, and monster hunter- some parts are more successful than others.
<br>
<br>the megaman aspect comes into play from battling bosses with learnable patterns. you&apos;re going to want to learn them at some point, because the bosses drop materials for crafting new weapons, armor, and items like monster hunter.
<br>
<br>it&apos;s a slightly slower paced side scrolling shooter with a cool mechanic reminiscent of gunstar heroes (or borderlands, for the younger crowd)- the guns you can make can have several different bullet types, from bouncing cannonballs and shotgun blasts to homing missiles, and you can add a few different elemental effects on top of it. the game is a little more forgiving than contra- you respawn in the nearest medic bay, have a few lives, and can come into the mission with healing items to revive or heal.
<br>
<br>on the downside, you may get sucked in to farming the same levels over and over to get the materials needed for your next upgrade, and this can get tedious (again, think monster hunter, though nowhere near as bad). that being said, this game really shines if you can play multiplayer with someone else in the room/a friend over chat, as you can break the monotony helping each other doing different missions or splitting up in the same mission to clear it faster. if you don&apos;t have someone you know to play with, it will dampen your enjoyment of the game a bit, which is not reflected in my score.
<br>
<br>all things considered, i had a blast reconnecting with my much younger brother (14 year age difference) and chalked up about 30 hours of playtime. there&apos;s still plenty of room for improvement, but i feel i more than got my money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mercenary-kings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4118334">Expand</a></span>

It also get even worse in some menus, basically I need to press X to talk to the character, select the menu item with enter, then press Q for confirmation. What the hell devs?
<br>Also, the reload mechanic is annoying (guess what? Another totally different key for reloading, used just for that), the combat is underwhelming, farming the same level over and over for materials is boring and customization is kinda pointless.

Plays like a mashup of Borderlands, Contra, and River City Ransom, and doesn&apos;t do any of them effectively as a result.  A cool experience if you&apos;re looking for something to co-op with a friend, especially 2 - 4 players as that&apos;s rare these days, but outside of that this is another painfully average indie-styled retro game.</span>

Enemy movements are bad (they just patrols area, not spawn by thousand as you progress like Metal Slug), controls are not responsive and the overall gameplay is just too slow.

Some of the gameplay of what exactly you&apos;re supposed to be doing seemed to be lost on me too.... maybe I got fed up and clicked through some important tip in the barrage of text bubbles? It is free on the PS Plus service at the moment so I cannot really complain but it certainly isn&apos;t a 9 out of 10 as some reviewers are trying to suggest.

I must say, this is by far the longest side scroller/ platformer I&apos;ve ever played, no exaggeration. Not necessarily a bad thing though. It shows that a great deal of work went into the game, especially in the animations. There&apos;s clearly an NES Megaman-style influence in both the music and the &quot;8-bit&quot; aesthetic, but with Metal Slug-style characters and Borderlands-style weaponry. There&apos;s a very wide array of customization on weapons, plenty of missions to play, and a wide variety of foes to fight. My only complaint is a minor one - you&apos;ll find yourself playing through some of the same levels multiple times, albeit with different objectives. Overall though, if you&apos;re itching for a game with retro-style pixel animations but with more modern variety, you won&apos;t be disappointed by this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mercenary-kings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4168579">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Good pixel art and a half-decent soundtrack are the only appeal here.  Gameplay is slow.  Maps are large and boring, and you&apos;ll replay them over and over for &quot;new&quot; missions.  Upgrade system is awful, having a loot-drop system akin to Borderlands would&apos;ve been 100% more enjoyable than farming endlessly for mats for measly upgrades.  Not much else to say about this, it&apos;s just a bad game.</span>

It has a cool concept, very reminiscent of the old platformers and SNK&apos;s war-themed games. But the PC version is so plagued with bugs and bad support that they stained the game to an irreparable level. At first, it was the first game on Steam that I couldn&apos;t run, and this situation persisted after trying all possible fixes. So, I gave up for a time and tried some months after with a new build. Lucky me, the game worked now! Only to discover there&apos;s some kind of silly screen stutter that&apos;s very annoying and, according to forums, happens with a lot of people. Again, no fix available. The developer support is AWFUL, they basically suggest you to get rid of a lot of applications - much of them useful - that could be installed on your computer. So the bugs and crashes are not their problem, let the consumers find their way. This laughable and rage-inducing attitude made me quit trying to play this game, unfortunately. Because it was fun for some minutes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mercenary-kings/user-reviews?user_review_id=5268106">Expand</a></span>

<br>Clearly inspired by 80&apos;s action movies, and heavily influenced by the Metal Slug series game play, Mercenary Kings really infuses the best of 2D action platformers with more modern elements of RPG games, it&apos;s highlight being a rather deep crafting system. The story of the game, is rather predictable, but this is not one of the games you play for the story. Humor has been written rather well in what resembles a story, and paired with fun game play makes this a blast to experience.
<br>
<br>While the game play is fun, the controls do feel a bit tankish. Jumping and movement, in general, could be tightened up a bit, in a Rogue Legacy fashion, yet over all, this is a rather fun game. If you&apos;re looking for a good, nostalgic time through the 80&apos;s, look no further than Mercenary Kings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mercenary-kings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605701">Expand</a></span>
