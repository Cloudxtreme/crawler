You say you listened to the fan base and on some fronts yes i would say you did but on others you did not. And those area&apos;s you didn&apos;t really can make and break the game. First and foremost I am a PC gamer i started playing the franchise on PC and i always will. But i feel you are pushing us aside and not doing us justice. WE are the players that have the best hardware etc and the graphics are well as they say so yesterday. You have little to no abilities to edit the PC graphics to a point where if you have a high end system that you can get the best out of the game. everything is locked.   Max frames ( max fps )  etc. i believe this is due to the fact that now instead of building for pc first then porting to 360 etc you build it for the lesser hardware system in this case consoles then try to port it to the PC at the last minute.  Ill give it to you in the fact you did break the pc version like black ops did when they ported the game to PC. But at least we had the ability to adjust things like FOV, Max fps, Max packets ETC.  These things i can overlook but the single most important thing i cannot.<br><br>Servers. in reality you guys have none. Sure you say you do and they are there and you can join them But whats the point of a server if it is non ranked. The point of servers is to essentially provide a medium for players to where they can go and play the game with other people in a non or little lag environment. i do like the party system but it isn&apos;t a big deal honestly. day 2 there were already hackers playing the game and without servers you cannot ban them from your server. all you can do is simply report them and wait for them to get banned if they ever do. in the mean time they wreck your experience for days if not weeks on end.  With ranked servers players can join game modes ( tdm,dom,ffa) etc with subsets of rules or none at all and know that 1 they are joining a server close to them thus reducing the chance of lag  2 joining a relativity hackless environment because the server admins who run those servers just ban hackers when they see them thus neutralizing the issue and 3 they are joining a server / game mode within the game mode that they wish to play.<br><br>Instead of just porting the game from 360/ps3 to PC look at the past games and take the good build on that and take the bad remove it and build on it as well.  The lack of non ranked dedicated servers is probably one of the main reason PC players are unhappy. Next to that it is the graphics or lack of them. We as PC players Demand a higher Caliber of game standards that YOU as a company lacked to give us. Most PC players think this is just mw2.5 with less graphics and more lag issues. If you say you really listen to the people Listen to some of the core points i am posting about they are essentially what is bringing your game down.  ill review perhaps the key points<br>1) No servers or lack of Primary Ranked Servers ( such as the ones that are loved in black ops )<br>2) Lack there of graphics and graphical tweaking<br>3)Lack of a way to deal with hackers.<br>4)The feeling we are getting the metaphorical shaft when it comes to a PC game. Stop porting you games from console to PC instead design it from ground floor up with PC as the key factor then port it down to the lesser hardware systems aka CONSOLES. You will make more money in the end that way as more PC players will buy the game and if the game is as good as the rest in the good respects the Console players won&apos;t even know the difference.

No real innovation from MW2? Check.<br><br>I&apos;m not really one to care about graphics, but MW3&apos;s graphics are just laughable considering this is 2011.  Comparing MW3 graphics to BF3 graphics is like comparing speed between a 1990 Neon and a 2012 Bugatti Veyron.  BF3 gets huge props for their innovation in this department.<br><br>Audio is even worse than graphics.  As another poster pointed out, the guns literally sound like paintball or BB gun.  Again, a joke when compared with BF3 which makes huge innovations here again.<br><br>MW3 does have a much better campaign than BF3 though, and BF3&apos;s SP was disappointing considering what they could have done with all the new tech.  Not sure how long MW3&apos;s campaign is though as I haven&apos;t finished it yet.<br><br>Post-launch support from DICE has already been fantastic, and they do truly listen to the community on changes.  I remember in BFBC2 Beta, I had an issue specific to my PC relating to low CPU usage, and I got an email from a dev who personally worked with me to resolve it.  This fix was including with the final game.  I don&apos;t have a lot of experience with Activision, but from what I&apos;ve heard the only post-launch support they give is in paid DLC&apos;s.<br><br>Overall, BF3 is definitely worth $60 where MW3 is definitely not worth $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1847129">Expand</a></span>

It is also sad that they are going to charge you an extra charge for their Elite service when the rankings are already skewed due to aimbots.  If I am going to spend $60 on this game I want support that will fix these issues and punish those that it finds cheating.

The sounds are just recycled junk from old CoD all guns sounds like a toy gun. Its streak system become from worst to worstser(i know there&apos;s no such word). To make it simple. This game is a joke. Its a CoD4 DLC.. And Cod4 is much better. Save your money and buy other games.</span>

The argument now by &quot;professional reviewers&quot; is that &quot;fans&quot;of BF3 are posting negative comments . I am 35 year old consumer who buys games and am no fan of any corporate entity or product. If the games are good they get a high score, if they suck they get a low score. I think that counts for most reviewers here as we just want to keep others from spending 60 bucks on a bad product . A computer game is not like buying another product.

Despite what the &quot;recommended&quot; stats might suggest, there&apos;s no more eye candy for those with a better system- just higher framerates for those who see 60 frames per second and up.

Its another below average shooter, unlike the other amazing shooter that came out recently. And here come the fan boys to convince you that this game is well optimised, not made purely for console, offers completely different gameplay from the last 4 games and graphics have been greatly approved. With a user score of 1.4 we have a classic case of the people who know what a good game is and isnt. How.....mature! LOL. Too bad this is a bad game. Too bad, this one is the WORSE gaming product.

MP is pretty much MW2 with new maps and maybe 1-2 extra guns and 1-2 twisted perks. This game does not deserve your 60 dollars, use it to buy map packs for mw2.</span>

The campaign itself is predictable. Captain Price dies. Soap lives. Yuri dies. Price kills Makarov. Being predictable won&apos;t be so bad if it was executed well, but it was not. Cliched. Over-the-top. Like it was done with a rejected B-grade movie script. Multiplayer offers nothing different either. To boot, this game has what could contend to be one of the worst communities ever.  Nothing new.

Multiplayer is ok, but is just too much twitch shooting for me. BF3 single player might be equally ridiculous, but at least the multiplayer is solid.</span>

The third instalment has a nice little wrap up to the story, albeit a tad predictable (I honestly think the first MW&apos;s story was the better). The co-op is a little tired but the survival mode is fun enough. However, I am once again let down by the major flaw in multiplayer, something called IWNet. Living in Australia with its **** internet, client-side hosting is the worst possible thing you can do to PC users here. It turns what would be quite an excellent and engaging multiplayer experience into a highly irritating and frustrating lag-fest, where you appear to be knifing an enemy in front of you, but in reality he was 5 metres away and shot you in the face. Over and over again. Yes there are dedicated servers this time around but, insultingly, they are unranked, which completely drains the attraction of levelling your skills and unlocking new weapons and abilities. It does get plusses for the inclusion of support pointstreaks and weapon levelling which are great ideas. Long story short: disappointing.<br><br>PS: After reading some of the positive reviews from this and the other platforms, two things: anything bad to say about the game does not a 10 out of 10 make; and anyone who rages about the so called &quot;BF3 Fanboys&quot;, your reviews are as much of a fail as theirs may be. For the record, I have played BF3 and it&apos;s fine but I don&apos;t like it a heck of a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1850670">Expand</a></span>

The hit detection is still the same old Modern Warfare you&apos;d expect. Knifing the air gets a kill. Shooting bullets onto an invincible hit box gets a kill, whilst the player is way out of harms way. Hit detection is way off in general. Bullets still do not penetrate thin walls or wooden crates but can penetrate 12 inch thick titanium steel. Character control in general feels a clumsy. Weapons are awkward to work with. Maps are the typical MW maps you&apos;d expect if not worse. Unimaginative, bland, and with bad spawn points. Kills do not feel as rewarding as before and kill streaks are not as amusing. It&apos;s a great fast paced game but in general most of it feels like a rehash of MW2 with a blend of terrible Black Ops maps. Single Player: Same old cliche story suitable for people/children who need explosions and chaos to obtain an orgasm and deem it a good game or movie. I was in pain trying to finish this game, instead of enjoying it. I just wanted to get this garbage story to end and to my surprise; the expected MW ending. The AI of this game like always, using the same bad programing can cause some what of a humor. Small scaled linear pathway maps like usual. In conclusions, this game is nothing but a rehash of the old game (including Treyarch&apos;s Black Ops) with the number 3 stamped in front. Save your self $60 and keep on enjoying MW2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1838586">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an extremely shallow experience that consists of nothing but scripted sequences and corridors. It seems like there are more times you are riding in a vehicle blasting away at people in comparison to just walking around. It&apos;s more a movie than a game. Some twists are present, but the story isn&apos;t so good to begin with so the twists are inconsequential.<br><br>-Multiplayer-<br><br>The only part of this game I consider playable. On one hand, it looks like they took a cue from Battlefield 3 - all of the weapons have an experience bar to fill. On the other hand, they didn&apos;t take much of a cue from anything else, there&apos;s no innovation with respect to actual gameplay. It&apos;s all familiar things seen in all of the other games except this time it&apos;s called Modern Warfare 3. No thanks, I&apos;ll stick to BF3 and Skyrim for my gaming needs for now.<br><br>-Graphics-<br><br>Sad. They&apos;re still running the game on old technology, and the game still looks and feels like an old game. I don&apos;t want to play a game that looks like it came out in 2007 in 2011. It&apos;s sad that Activision won&apos;t shell out the cash to license a better game engine. That might actually, you know, take considerable effort on the parts of the developers that need to rehash old code to be able to release a game every single year.<br><br>- Map Design -<br><br>It&apos;s okay. The maps don&apos;t feel much improved from MW2 or it&apos;s DLC. I don&apos;t have a favorite because they all feel about the same quality-wise.<br><br>-Overall-<br><br>3/10. I would give it a 1/10, but I did enjoy a bit of multiplayer earlier. That&apos;s not to say that the score would improve with repeated playing, I&apos;m just saying that there was something enjoyable about the game. Given that this is the FOURTH time Activision has released the same exact game, I guess that says something. The graphics are bad, the multiplayer is uninteresting, and again, there aren&apos;t REALLY dedicated servers. Do not buy this if you are a PC gamer, it&apos;s not meant for you. Buy it on your XBOX if you just HAVE to stay up and current with the most current gaming trends. Other than that, if you didn&apos;t like the Call of Duty series up until now, you aren&apos;t going to start with this game. It&apos;s not innovative in any way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1843046">Expand</a></span>

All for 50 bucks), not this reskin of MW2. Aside from having the most brains-off Hollywood plot ever(the writers basically picked names for the Russian from a list Chechen terrorists and generic Russian names). It has the exact same gameplay as every other recent CoD release and they even reuse the vast majority of the guns from the last MW title, only giving the reused models slight additions and reskins. This game is in no way worth your hard-earned 80 dollars. I bought it and am extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. If you want a high quality modern fps game you should try out ArmA 2 or wait for ArmA 3, these games have been made by people who actually care about their product and will not attempt to use the brand name to recycle the same product and sell it to you for full price each year.<br><br>Disregard the reviews from gamespot and the like, they issue out numbers based on how much advertising a publisher buys on their website as well as the general hype behind the game. They might give MW3 and 85 for a score but I guarantee they had MW3 ads running along the sides of their webpages before their review was even out. It&apos;s just another example of shoddy journalism doing nothing to spur advances in gaming, judging by those reviews everyone should be happy with having the same thing year after year with no improvements. It&apos;s ridiculous. In closing: Don&apos;t buy this game,  put your money towards a title that has the dignity not to sell you backwash every year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1887569">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer map&apos;s and player count are just to small to actually be able to have any sort of a good gaming experience, because whenever you run round a corner 90% of the time you will run in to the enemy player who has just killed you on the other side of the map within 15 second&apos;s of spawning.<br><br>There is just something missing from this game and I cannot give it a better rating than 0 simply because there is nothing new at all in this game, compared to previous versions and it just feel&apos;s that it was rushed together by people who did not know what the Call Of Duty gamers wanted from the game.<br><br>If it was not for it being linked to my Steam account and therefore unable to be taken back and traded or sold I would, have done it within the 1st 4 hour&apos;s of playing this game.<br><br>I have played all the Call Of Duty games on the PC and I have played them all on the Xbox 360 as well, and I have to say other than the better draw distances on the PC version of the game&apos;s I have to say they are all the same game graphically and suffer with the same fault&apos;s etc.<br><br>This is the last Call Of Duty game I will ever buy because I will not accept a copy and paste of last year&apos;s game with a new name anymore, especially when they don&apos;t try to hide it as well.<br><br>For those who have played it and those who wish to play it, this will be abit of a spoiler.<br><br>On a certain level in the campaign game there is a section where you enter a building, and if you look around you will see that it is the same building as the one on Pipeline on Call Of Duty 4, where you could climb a ladder to get on the roof of the warehouse., and that just show&apos;s how much of a copy and paste this game actually is.<br><br>To really show how bad thing&apos;s are for the PC gamer&apos;s they were left till around 2 week&apos;s before the release date before being informed that the Dedicated Server&apos;s that were being issued with this game would be unranked and therefore to Rank up you have to use the IWNet system of Peer to Peer hosting, on gamers home internet connection&apos;s and whilst it seem&apos;s the searching for the host has improved it is still suffering from the exact same problem&apos;s that it suffered in Modern Warfare 2.<br><br>This game has also been ruined by the amount of cheater&apos;s, as well in this game already because the game utilises the Valve Anti Cheat system which just does not seem capable of catching people using the cheat&apos;s, and if on the off chance it does it can take anything up to 3 month&apos;s to ban them.<br><br>The game engine is tired and need&apos;s to be replaced, as does the developers because in my oppinion they have lost the spark that made this game great when it was first unleashed on to the world.<br><br>Maybe in the future Infinity Ward, and Treyarch as well as the other various developer&apos;s involved in the production of Call Of Duty game, will actually redesign the whole game and bring back that spark that was so special to the fan&apos;s of the series with Call Of Duty 4, but until that day I can only see thing&apos;s getting worse for them considering other games are starting to improve and take fan&apos;s of the Call Of Duty series away from them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1880859">Expand</a></span>

A social commentary, of the degradation of the human race. The reason PC gamers judge call of duty so harshly and more than console gamers is the fact that they&apos;re is just countless games on the PC that provide actual quality entertainment unlike COD.</span>

Single player campaign is a tired, used, and put away wet rehash of past WM titles. My main complaint is how short/easy (even on the hardest lvl). Finally and most disappointing MP is just plain dated; Black Ops could teach this game something in all aspects (balance, maps design, and getting the most out of the graphics engine).   It is glaringly obvious that with the departure of the core members of Infinity Ward the &quot;sledgehammer&quot; (aka EA retreads) team assembled in haste was not up the task of creating a &quot;new&quot; CoD experience. In all honestly; considering the leap from World ar War to Black Op&apos;s (let&apos;s face it Black Ops MP trumps MW2); Treyarch would have been a much better team to tap; even though Activision&apos;s payout would have been delay.   If you are looking for a $60 (low end and I truly do feel for the hardened Ed ppl) expansion then you will enjoy this game. I admit I too fell for the hype plus boredom of needing a new quality FPS fix; but came away with the feeling my score was cut to nothing.    I worry with Activision&apos;s rush to cash in on the best FPS name in the market; the series will die out. I do hope their greed, lack of innovation, and pushing out unpolished games to meet quarterly profit goals; does not infect their only remaining quality game developer Blizzard.   In closing; please do not lose heart or faith that Treyarch can somehow make a worthy game out of these dated graphic and shell of a stand alone sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1850113">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s no innovation going on, everything it offers you&apos;ve seen in other games. The child killing scene is just a sad attempt at stirring up controvery once more, because when your game offers nothing interesting you better kill some children to get the media going.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1887732">Expand</a></span>

Mw3 has none of the variety and originality that Street Sweeper has. The Graphics are about the same but have none of the genius and beauty that Street Sweeper has in droves. And while MW3 has Streets it sadly has no Sweeping mode. Fail, Epic Fail.</span>

Blops gave us back Dedi servers but the overall game itself was really lacking on the PC, with the game in an unplayable state for the first month past release and Wager matches only playable with stupid sucky matchmaking and limited to 6 people! here comes MW3, another slap to the face, do they give us Dedi servers? yes!!! but wait!!! they forgot to mention that all dedicated servers will be UNRANKED(!) and if u want to play on ranked servers and rank up and unlock stuff u&apos;ll have to resort to matchmaking ala MW2!! not enough that this game is using the same engine from CoD4, some say its &quot;improved&quot; but to me its just smokes and mirrors. this was once a beautiful series, strong on both PCs and Consoles. now its just a yearly cash-in for Activision. im sure this game will succeed in sales, there are alot of not-so-smart 12yrs old out there waiting to get there hands on it. but for me, i&apos;ll stick to other shooters</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1841443">Expand</a></span>

Just a new campaign, heavier textures and new weapons, not a new game. More than $15 for this, it&apos;s just a joke ! There is no game development and no expensive work to release this game.</span>

I got told in an article the game is not &quot;copied and pasted&quot;. Indeed its not, its trying to be COD4 with new multiplayer modes, yet it fails to even get close to the greatness of COD4. The maps are horrible, COD: Elite is a total waste of money, it feels rushed, there&apos;s a greyish tint on everything in the game, textures etc. And for the singleplayer, linear, boring, and incredibly stupid. I liked the story, but the way it concluded in the end was horrible. Stay away from this PoS. The creators has really outdone themselves in screwing people this time. Perhaps they should try to create a new franchise instead of ripping people off. Thank you IW, sledgehammer and activision for letting me down yet again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1837547">Expand</a></span>

It takes skill to mess up a game like that. Hell, even the music from the lobby is a cheap ass soundtrack from a 70thies Chuck Norris movie. Really,  Zero as score is still overestimating. Pathetic.</span>

I guarantee within a couple months there will be MW3 maps on CoD4, which will be more fun than playing it on MW3.

I was disgusted by what I was looking at...I didn&apos;t spend $60 on this reused rubbish! The single player was awful! Story was absolute crap and the characters were just flat. I was hoping the graphics was going to get an upgrade judging from the videos and screens before release but ending up being stale just like the previous CoD games. They need to take advice from DICE who have made an exceptionable engine with superb sound effects. I recommend not buying this rubbish and keep playing MW2 AS ITS THE SAME GAME! Spend your money on Skyrim or BF3 as they are bound to be effortlessly better in all aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1841015">Expand</a></span>

P2P ranked servers among other performance issues have ruined playing COD games on PC for me.  The arcade feel to the game had gotten old and nothing is changing here.  The story is short and disapointing and multiplayer is a mess with cheaters going rampant.  My last Activision game and last COD game ever won&apos;t be getting this again.  Hopefully CS:GO can revieve my love for fps games cause right now I am disapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1849054">Expand</a></span>

This is quite simply not the case. I, for one, never even played Battlefield and have enjoyed my CoDs. I&apos;m also not a troll, as my account name and one other review on this site will testify to. However, that doesn&apos;t change the fact that I still believe that MW3 fully deserves its low score after having played through most of the campaign and a number of MP matches. Now, let&apos;s get the obvious out of the way - the campaign is extremely generic, boring, mindnumbingly linear, handholds you and lets you spend half the time in predetermined cutscenes where you can&apos;t control your character at all; to summarize, negligible and entirely forgettable. This is hardly surprising, because even as a CoD fan I acknowledge that the campaigns have always been the series&apos; weakest point by far - at least the MW games, anyway (I know some people like to bash the entire series for this, but personally I enjoyed the Black Ops campaign due to the Cold War setting). The real strength of CoD has always been in its multiplayer. However, this time around the multiplayer offers no significant changes and literally no innovation from the previous iterations in the series. The changes made to the multiplayer are mostly just balance fixes to the flawed MW2 metagame that just as easily could&apos;ve been fixed with a 50mb patch to that title. The new killstreak system allows you to stack killstreaks through death, further contributing to the sheer dumbness of the multiplayer experience and detracting from any notion of self-preservation or team-oriented gameplay that was left. Personally I don&apos;t care much about graphics, so I won&apos;t go into detail about them, just say that it&apos;s a very blatant console port and leave it at that. Frankly we&apos;ve reached a point where the developers just churn out annual assembly line CoD releases that offer literally nothing new beyond being a glorified map pack / expansion to the previous iteration, yet still have the nerve to charge full retail price for it, as if this minimal effort somehow warrants a full price tag. Basically, CoD has devolved into the blatant fan-milking that was previously reserved to sports games. I was left with a disgusting taste in my mouth after realising I had contributed to making this business model of theirs a success by purchasing on day one, and I&apos;ll be trying to sell my copy of the game to someone who doesn&apos;t own it yet, to make sure that there&apos;s at least one less game sold. I&apos;m thoroughly disappointed at hte blatant disregard for their consumers and lack of desire to change their game in any meaningful way. Moreover, I&apos;m disappointed in the players for letting them get away with it. Most of all, I&apos;m disappointed in the gaming press for selling out and writing positive reviews for this game due to getting early copies when they bash other games for lack of innovation, which this game obviously suffers immensely from. Not worth the $60 price tag. Perhaps some time, once it goes on sale... Oh wait, I forgot, CoD titles always remain at full retail price until the next release in the series. Cash cow, and all that.

Like many people here I am one of the ones who feel constantly let down with the direction the series has taken. COD 1, 2, 4, and WaW are some of my most played and favorite games of all time.  MW2 and Black ops were a huge letdown to me but even they still had things that set them apart. To me it seems that Activision spent more money on advertising and marketing hype than development. (Then again what do you expect rushing to finish every game in 12-24 months) Anyhow where to start. Single player... A three hour campaign in any blockbuster title is an insult. One that could be forgiven if the multi-player was not a cut and paste of the same game we all forked 70 bucks for two years ago. The SP suffers from the same &quot;infinite enemies until you move 2 ft forward&quot; problem that plagued all of the previous games. It&apos;s incredibly linier which was to be expected. It tries to replicate Die Hard with over the top explosions and This years attempt at controversy is kind of cliche&apos;  Overall I felt the SP was a massive waste of 3 hours. As mentioned before the multiplayer is Copy-pasta from previous games. Do not expect the level design quality of IW or even treyarch in this title. It&apos;s obvious that it was done by a rookie studio. The maps feel cramped and the spawnpoints are still terrible.  If you enjoy getting noob tubed in the face on spawn. Then you will likely enjoy this game. I have thus far not mentioned the main competition BF3, but now I feel I must. While I am a PC gamer and enjoy BF3 on PC. I also play COD on my 360 with coworkers and friends. I cannot comment on the console port of BF3 as I have not played it on consoles. I do know that of the 5 of us who bought the game after work last night 4 of us plan on returning it to gamestop later today and getting the console versoin of BF3. Graphically, do not expect anything different. It&apos;s still running on a heavily modified Quake 3 engine that is seriously showing its age. I think its time for the guys to build a new engine unfortunately none of the original talent remains employed at activision. I&apos;m sorry Activision. You have milked this one to death. Please stop making these **** expansion packs and marketing them as new games. It&apos;s okay. Take a few years build a new engine we will wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1842891">Expand</a></span>

Turns out that it was just a waste of money. Activision should have just released this game as DLC for MW2, because thats basically what it is. Don&apos;t waste your money with this game.</span>

There is essentially NO difference between this and MW2.  The other thing that pisses me off is that COD4 was a grittier game that made you feel like a special ops badass.  MW2 and MW2: Operation Steal Your Money are games that completely remove that immersion factor and are essentially Unreal Tournament with real guns.  Not only that, but the killstreaks and perks are complete crap, they have been mutated and twisted from a cool semi-realistic add on into this RPG-like fantasy gimmick that somehow is MORE popular than the original system. This game is complete and utter trash and the criminals at Activision have pulled it off again.  Also, the engine they continue to use without improvements is completely outdated and is far inferior to the likes of the continually supported and updated Unreal Engine 3, the innovative and pretty (but buggy) Frostbite 2 Engine, and the gorgeous CryEngine. It&apos;s really a shame and I feel cheated that I was tricked into spending my hard-earned money on this expansion pack. That said, it&apos;s still a (kind of) fun shoot-em-up that has it&apos;s moments, and if you take it for what it is, it&apos;s not a bad game.  But still, I don&apos;t see myself playing this NEARLY as much as I would have played a real successor to MW2 (updated engine, reworked and WELL THOUGHT OUT multiplayer without stupid gimmicks, and a SP campaign with some effort put into it).  This game is most certainly being run into the ground by the thieves at Activision and I will not buy another COD game unless it&apos;s been thoroughly reworked. It&apos;s a darn shame that Activision, instead of a patient and supportive publisher, has the rights to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1840879">Expand</a></span>

It takes skill to mess up a game like that. Hell, even the music from the lobby is a cheap ass soundtrack from a 70thies Chuck Norris movie. Really, Zero as score is still overestimating. Pathetic.</span>

Great campaign presentation filled with huge set pieces that are sure to keep you going that only just make up for its modern warfare 2 look. The story picks straight from where the previous game ended and starts of promising all the way to the end. All loose ends are dealt with, theirs a few small twists and fast paced moments that make up for the dumb AI and problems you know and hate from modern warfare 2, their are still those moments where you feel like your playing follow the leader but theirs no doubt you have more control and as I stated the set pieces are undeniably impressive. That is for the single player at least.<br>The moment I hit multiplayer I was to a point horrified at how it actually looked worse than modern warfare 2. And this is running the game max settings@ 90+fps, after playing 5 out of the 15 available maps you can easily tell it has a horrible presentation. The colours are very bland and the textures are almost identical to modern warfare 2. Everything from explosions to smoke effects look the same. The animations have been ripped(literally) from modern warfare 2 (same slip on a banana peel death). The weapon sounds are the same as they were in modern warfare 2 which is no surprise but I don&apos;t need to get into that. I never really expect nice visuals from a game such as this but it still doesn&apos;t make up for its core aspects. Killstreaks are back and are unbalanced as ever, you now have strike packages that could have worked well but fail miserably due to unbalancing issues. For example the specialist pack gives you a perk for every two kills you get (your a super soldier once you hit 9 kills). The assault pack gives you things such as a Juggernaut killstreak that would take literally a whole M60 clip to kill. If you want zero recoil just throw on a suppressor. Their are so many gimmicks in this game I would need more pages than the bible to write out my essay but I think you get the point. The core COD experience that we love is still their but it simply doesn&apos;t make up for its negatives. Their are some aspects that I love that improve further on modern warfare 2s positives but once again are overtaken by all the crap in the game. It also feels very console ported and this is just another big issue I could raise. In the end a game that had potential falls short for the third second time, yes its better than black ops but if you want a true cod experience stick with modern warfare.<br>Ok.<br>6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1836481">Expand</a></span>

I am a self admitted COD fan boy i stared playing COD back with the first one. No not MW1 i mean COD1. I finished the campaign in three hours on the max difficulty and only died twice.  If they had waited 5 years to make this game and had major improvements. For example COD2 vs COD4 it would have been better but no they basically went into production the second they stopped production of MW2. People always say don&apos;t compare Halo and COD but i am willing to bet that more hours of work went into redoing the graphics on Halo CE then went into the Graphics on MW3. I am also willing to bet my game computer that i will enjoy the Halo remake more than i enjoyed this. My disappointment in this game has forced me to do the unthinkable. I will now go back to playing BF3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1840660">Expand</a></span>

This has been a much sort after feature, although there are some serious downsides, I will mention them shortly.<br><br>The Bad? Well lets dive into this shall we? First off, the graphics, engine, textures, animations, sound effects...Everything is copy &amp; paste from MW2 which in effect was C&amp;P from MW1. Essentially, I just paid &#xC2;&#xA3;40 to play MW1 all over again. Second, Dedicated servers are not ranked?! this is rediculous and frankly defeated the point of re-adding them in. All in All, an absolute waste of money, if only i could get my money back. If your looking for a game which is fresh, requires a level of skill and has much improves graphics and gameplay, Battlefield 3 is the one to go for. Ignore the fans saying its down to preference, they are both Modern First Person Shooters, Battlefield is definately the better option in this case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1837891">Expand</a></span>

The game, being a 2011 game does not looks good, at all, compared to other games like Battlefield 3, RAGE or the upcoming Skyrim. The gameplay, the shooting mechanics are nearly the same as in Modern Warfare 2. The campaign is pretty interesting, it connects the first MW with the second, and expands the story. It has interesting twists, and it motivates you to play through the single player campaign, especially if you have played thorugh MW1 and MW2. The enemy AI isn&apos;t the best, there are a lot of times when their act is just stupid. They don&apos;t care about their lives, they just run through your allies and want to kill you. As I have said, not every and each time, but it happens a lot. The multiplayer is nothing, it is an expanded MW2 multiplayer, with some new maps, new perks, new weapons, kill confirming and with a database sort of thing named CoD Elite, which basically collects information about your play style, your achievements etc etc.... The SP part of the game is interesting, but I hope that I won&apos;t see a new Call of Duty game based on the same engine as Modern Warfare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1837207">Expand</a></span>

Absolutely. They just made bunch of new maps for a multiplayer, wrote **** scenario(and if MW2 scenario was good MW3 scenario is much worse. Even worse than Black Ops) and released it as a new game. Graphics is absolutely the same. NOTHING HAS CHANGED ABSOLUTLEY. Ofcourse Activision had paid a lot of money to get high scores in the reviews but MW3 doesn&apos;t deserve 9.0 it deserves 7.0 at best and as a simple map pack it doesn&apos;t worth 50$. Don&apos;t spend your money on it unless you are one of these blind CoD fans. + bugs lags and freezes @ PC version that holds any other moder FPS at 60 fps.

Almost all of them rated battlefield 3 with 10 and MW3 0. Do you honestly think any BF3 fanboys actually purchased and played MW3? Probably not. And there are fanboys on both sides, and all of them are just as stupid and ignorant.<br><br>That being said, I&apos;m honestly having fun with this game. The controls feel tighter than MW2 did, the maps have more flanking routes, the textures look better (Not nearly close to BF3 though, I might add), and the guns feel more balanced. Saying this is simply a 60$ map pack is nothing short of ignorant, because the last time I checked, map packs didn&apos;t add new perks, guns, killstreaks, and gamemodes. Though, I&apos;m not saying this isn&apos;t VERY similar to MW2. But is that really a bad thing? Not really. It worked well in the past, and it works well now. If it ain&apos;t broke, why fix it?<br><br>Now, I&apos;m not a CoD fanboy. I&apos;ve played my share of BC2 and enjoyed it, so I picked up BF3 a few days after launch and have enjoyed it. But comparing the two games is retarded, because they&apos;re both very different. Do you ever hear people comparing halo and call of duty? No? Well, that&apos;s because it makes no sense. Just **** listen to yourselves, you&apos;re bashing a game that you haven&apos;t even played, which makes no sense. If you have played it enough to know you honestly didn&apos;t enjoy it, that&apos;s fine, as least you&apos;re not one of the ignorant fanboys. I really do like this game, but I also like battlefield 3. And I&apos;m going to be playing both, because both are fun. In their own SEPARATE ways. (BF3 for graphics and realism, MW3 for fast-paced exciting gameplay)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1860170">Expand</a></span>

That being said, it is still frusturating to see them using the same engine with the same outdated graphics over and over. But, as a wise man once said, &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it.&quot; Or something like that. There is a reason this is the most popular shooting game in history. There is a reason that 90% of the reviewers who gave this game a score of zero are probably online right now trying to get the next unlock for their weapons. It is a quick, simple, fun to play game that will bring me hours of enjoyment over the next year. So here it is:
<br>7/10
<br>-1 for crap singleplayer mode THAT WE ALL KNEW WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
<br>-1 for seriously outdated game engine. (Mark my words they will have a new engine next year)
<br>-1 for no ranked dedicated servers on the PC. (Lobbies? Intermissions? WTF that&apos;s lame.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1859295">Expand</a></span>
