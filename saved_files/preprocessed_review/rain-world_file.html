<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>
<br>-using the creatures as weapons and tools to interact with the environment(as flashlights, stun grenades,grappling hooks...)That&apos;s a very clever and unique version of a &quot;power up/item system&quot;
<br>
<br>-Every creature behaves different, has really its own personality and needs to be approached with a different strategy.Some are peaceful, some are predators and some are inbetween.And its not always clear on the first view which creature is what.
<br>
<br>-When two or more creatures hunt you at the same time , the game really gets intense.Often one creature begins to hunt you and then suddenly one or two more drop down and join the hunt onto you or begin hunting each other.That makes for a intense experience.And it really does immerse you into believing you are in an &quot;alien&quot; ecosystem.
<br>
<br>-The games does not handhold you like many other games nowadays do. The tips of the worm companion are cryptic enough that you really have to/ are allowed to explore and figure out things on your own instead of getting told everything by the game.
<br>
<br>Visuals and Atmosphere:
<br>
<br>-The atmosphere in this game is so dense.There are many triple A games with a way more complex graphic engine which have not half of the atmosphere of this game.
<br>
<br>-The dynamic lighting and water effects in this game are so good.Never saw them so good in any other 2d game.Especially the shadows of the clouds moving in the background.Awesome!
<br>
<br>-Best physicaly based animations i have ever seen in a 2D Game
<br>
<br>-The creatures feel so alien like and strange which is totaly awesome especially with the procedural generated animations, great creature design
<br>
<br>-The postapocalyptic setting with the overgrown industrial ruins inhabited by those strange creatures and every area has its own look and ecosystem with different creatures creates such a moody feeling.
<br>
<br>What I don&apos;t like about the game:
<br>
<br>The timelimit:
<br>-The timelimit through the &quot;deadly rain is coming every x minutes and you have to go into hibernation to survive&quot; does totally not work together with the exploration nature of the game.The hibernation places are very unevenly spaced. There are some areas and routes where the hibernation places are very close together and some where you have to walk almost half a level in distance to find one. There is nothing more annoying to find a new area and really want to explore this new area with all the new creatures in it,but have no time left. and then you come to a parting of the way into two different directions and you go into direction one,but the desperately needed hibernation place would have been into direction two and then you die and have to walk half through the level again just to get through the newly found ecosystem .
<br>
<br>The controls and spawning system of the creatures:
<br>
<br>-Some of the controls feel clunky and way to cumbersome to use.
<br>
<br>+Why do i have to press down for charging up the leap jump when pressing down is also used to crawl down pipes and sticks.There is often the situation that a downward leading pipe or pole is directly placed beside a spot where you want to leap jump from.So you try to charge up for a leap jump but slugcat instead tries to crawl down the pipe.
<br>+slugcat controls like a slow moveing truck and you const. fall of of sticks and ledges accidentally  or crawl accidentally into enemy spawning pipes because the game misinterpret your movement constantly
<br>+Some leapjumps or reaching slippery poles you have to perform with an movement accuracy which is very hard to achieve with clunky controls like this.Even compared to  difficult games like the contra/probotector or battletoads games for snes and megadrive.Those games  are all harder/more difficult then rainworld but none of them felt so frustrating controlwise.
<br>+enemys spawning directly behind you or camping at the end of the next pipe.
<br>. If you get chased by a creature and have to deal with things like clunky controls,level geometry placed in a way that it messes up the movement options and enemy&apos;s spawning in pipes or camp direct at the exit of pipes at the same time... It can get very annoying.
<br>
<br>The unreliability of certain gameplaymechanics:
<br>
<br>--somethimes you jump down a cliff and you live and sometimes you jump down a cliff and you die and there is no way of telling which cliff you can jump down savely.
<br>-Throwing objects can also be a real mess. Especially if you have one item in each hand,the game has a very convoluted rock&#x2013;paper&#x2013;scissors like ruleset on which item is been thrown by slugcat first when you press the throw button! Why cant the game give the player two keys , one for left hand throw and one for right hand throw?
<br>-Also many of the &quot;using the plants and animals as tools and weapons(flashlight,stun grenade,grappeling hook...)&quot; mechanics do not work in practice in game in a reliable and reproducable way.Often its a 50/50 chance of them not doing what they are supposed to do even if you handle them correctly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rain-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=7175197">Expand</a></span>

You just need to learn. And that&apos;s all what this game is : learning, patiently. Each time you die, you learn something, and won&apos;t die as easily the next time.
<br>
<br>And I love how it looks. Every screen is unique, with a lot of tiny details that makes it feel like a real place, a dreadful one though. The slugcat animations are a joy to look at, and everything moves smoothly, there&apos;s a real feeling that everything you see is alive.
<br>
<br>This is a demanding game, and not for everyone, but for what it is, it is somehow perfect. A true little gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rain-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=7388108">Expand</a></span>
