<br>
<br>Jack Keane 2: The Fire Within is the sequel to the original, though I did not play the original so I&apos;m evaluating it on it&apos;s face.  The game is a 3D action adventure/point-and-click puzzle game.  You play the titular role and combine forces with several companions  most notable of which is the adventurous, blue-eyed femme Amanda.  The plot of the story revolves around Jack&apos;s quest to find a) a lost treasure that he learns about from a dying shaman, and b) a path through his own subconscious to becoming a better man who can commit  to anything.
<br>
<br>Throughout the game, you are confronted by puzzles.  While most are interesting yet easy to work out, there are a few times where it takes you a minute to find all the oddly-placed pieces you need.  There is also a fast and rudimentary card-based combat mechanic where you have to counter enemy attacks with the proper defense and then counter-attack with your own moves.
<br>
<br>Most important are the setting and characters, who are rich and entertaining.
<br>
<br>Pros include nice graphics, very funny quips, a nice mix of action and puzzle solving, the use of WASD to move (as opposed to click-to-move), and the ability to alter companion opinions using dialog.
<br>
<br>Cons include three bugs that required restart or reload, poor inflection in the voice acting, trouble jumping because of camera skew, and a ridiculous dialog tree that will end the game if you accept money from a bad guy for an object you&apos;re going to lose anyway.
<br>
<br>While the game at launch is plagued by bugs (so you might want to play after the first patch) and I stand firmly resolute in my condemnation of using flashbulbs to frighten bats, finishing this game is one of my top priorities.  The characters are fascinating, the humor is infectious, and the graphics are sweet.

There is a highlight option for these items, but I like the hotspot mechanics of other games more. There are the 3-5 seconds before an item is picked up or a character is talked to, so took me 10 hours for the first run and 3 hours on the second speed run. Crashed a few times, mostly when I skipped a cutscene. The puzzles are relatively easy, I got stuck usually by not noticing an item.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jack-keane-2-the-fire-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670424">Expand</a></span>
