It&apos;s a top-down fmup (think shmup but extremely brutal) with a pretty heavy tactical element to it that keeps you thinking about how to approach every situation more and more efficiently each time you die--and you&apos;ll die an awful lot.  Any enemy can kill you or knock you out in one hit, so you&apos;ll be trying one idea, failing, and then refining that idea a few times until you have that glorious satisfaction of overcoming all the odds against you.  The level design is pretty complex and the enemies are varied enough that the trial-and-error gameplay doesn&apos;t become stale.  There is almost always a genuine challenge (apart from two absolutely ridiculous boss battles and a pretty cheap stealth segment), making the &quot;trial&quot; in &quot;trial-and-error&quot; something really, really compelling.  The AI isn&apos;t great at picking up on signs that you&apos;re in their midst, but if it was, the game would probably be absolutely impossible.  The campaign follows a narrative that isn&apos;t very strong, but it&apos;s definitely something interesting.  It complements the stressful gameplay with some really weird hallucinations that actually make you wonder what the hell is actually going on, and then, even though it&apos;s not very complex, it ties up loose ends in a pretty fascinating way.  The graphics, despite the really ugly face drawings, are stylish and give off an extremely eighties vibe, though there are no options to turn off some features like screen sway, which will probably end up hurting the game&apos;s accessibility.  The real aesthetic star is the soundtrack, though.  For 2012, it&apos;s one of the absolute best game soundtracks, right up there with Vessel.  Because of its extreme challenge, Hotline Miami is probably not a game for most people, but it&apos;s extremely good at what it does, and despite a few caveats it&apos;s one of the best games this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2706282">Expand</a></span>

A commendable and highly artistic rendation and critique of violence in popular media and an immense retro throwback make this game an instant cult hit. Granted, it&apos;s not for everyone but if you like vintage, tongue in cheeck humor and the 80&apos;s... go play it!</span>

<br>
<br>Only one complaint. It crashes, a lot. I&apos;m on Windows 8 and certain levels crash almost every time. Seems like when too much is going on, the game will crash. This has made it very hard for me to get through the game.</span>

<br>
<br>Seemingly a gore fest for a story actually is creative and unique story. Something truly amazing!
<br>
<br>The soundtrack... Oh my. Best Soundtrack of the Decade. Addicting and you will replay certain levels and parts just to hear the song.
<br>
<br>Difficulty, quite brutal, but it only adds to the gameplay. It&apos;s also a plus because you will get to hear the amazing soundtrack... so its a win-win!
<br>
<br>Really though, amazing game. Literally an almost perfect game! The only thing it needs is just a change of pace with a puzzle type section or something to just switch it up more. MUST HAVE GAME!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=4303454">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay is fast paced and quite brutal but it requires you to be strategic or you&apos;ll quickly become overwhelmed. You can&apos;t zerg through this game, (nearly) everything kills you in a single hit. It isn&apos;t a very long game but what it offers is top notch (aside from that damn stealth level).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2706251">Expand</a></span>

Think super meat boy in top-down shmup with awesome 80s disco soundtrack and some weird tripping story interludes. A game that rewards you for perfectly timing smashing through a door, jumping on someone&apos;s face, bashing it in, taking their baseball bat, throwing it into the next room at a mobster&apos;s head, taking his gun, then shooting his friend in the room that is rushing at you with a crowbar. Then he wakes up from his daze and you pop him in the head, then all hell breaks loose as every single enemy on the map proceeds to enter the room you are in, and you only have 4 bullets remaining in this auto shotgun... so you hold back behind a corner of the doorway as they rush in &quot;CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK&quot; goes your mouse, and &quot;BAM BAM BAM BAM&quot; goes your shotgun... there&apos;s bloody mess EVERYWHERE but there&apos;s one guy left and he&apos;s running in with an assault rifle.... so instead you right click... and your autoshotgun goes flying across the room in your single last chance of faith in the game.... knocks the bodyguard out and then you storm him and jump on his face and keep bashing away until he stops moving and the last breathe of air escapes his now-limp corpse. Then a voice yells &quot;GO BACK TO THE CAR!&quot; while the smooth 80s disco beat continues to kick in. Oh how sexy you feel. If that sounds like your kind of game.

The gameplay is kind of niche: you will have to play the same level many times often until you finish it. So, the game involves memorization. The repeated play has some issues, because there&apos;s some levels that have &quot;new&quot; game mechanics that are sometimes not obvious to figure out, resulting in a lot of play throughs up to this one point until you figure it out (I think they should have offered gameplay tips at these obstacles). Some combat bugs, such as doors getting in the way of bullets oddly, which can become very frustrating, and the hit detection sometimes being odd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3231488">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The audio is sensational. The various weapons and sound effects are crisp and as for the musical score? It&apos;s available as a standalone purchase if that&apos;s any indication of the quality ;)
<br>
<br>The graphical style is a tip-of-the-hat to yesteryear gaming - there&apos;s even a pixelated NES hooked up in the protagonist&apos;s, bedroom. When you consider this game was developed by a team of two men and the finished product we have is a refresh of an old game concept put on a &apos;maybe pile,&apos; any commenters that suggest this game is merely a &apos;hipster&apos; money grab have made their opinion null and void.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise, I couldn&apos;t help but be reminded of True Lies for the SNES, but the unforgiving enemies and one-hit (for the most part) kills have a Smash TV vibe to them. But this game is unique. You can approach a stage a number of ways, by perhaps either stealthily knifing everyone as their back is turned, or trying to funnel enemies through a choke point with 6 shotgun rounds at the ready. In later levels you&apos;ll need every trick in the book to make through alive.
<br>
<br>In summary, if you like a challenge and some good old fashioned violence, buy this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3921948">Expand</a></span>

<br>PROS:

<br>+The story is interesting, and makes you think more than you would expect an arcade style game to make you.
<br>+The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard!
<br>+It is so satisfying for even the most simple of kills - not to mention how amazing it feels when you finally beat a level.
<br>+It is very difficult, which normally annoys me a tad-bit, but this game adds re-playability through it&apos;s extreme difficulty.
<br>+The simple graphics make it easy to continue through the game; what I mean is the kills make you cringe in the 2D style - imagine if it was 3D and realistic! Yuck!
<br>CONS:

I&apos;d even dare to say it feels far more immersive than nowadays boring and unchallenging AAA titles. If you have any real knowledge about video games and good taste, then you&apos;ll enjoy this game. The artistry and music are also awesome. It definitely is a must buy.</span>

                                        <span>Gameplay is fun... for about 30 minutes. At that point it starts to become incredibly repetitive. I was glad that it was over after 3-4 hours, as the gameplay couldn&apos;t even support that much. It&apos;s also as eye-straining as it is ugly.  It may be that way by design, but that doesn&apos;t make it any more appealing.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: There are plenty of great indie games out there. This isn&apos;t one of them.</span>

I admit gameplay was repetitive but it was still fun throughout.  Besides aren&apos;t all games repetitive?   While Hotline Miami wasn&apos;t groundbreaking, you can still call me a fan.  Can&apos;t wait for the sequel.</span>

The game is incredibly unsettling, between the genocide, the creepy music, the graphics that look like a terrible VHS recording, the terrible sense of increasing loneliness and desperation, and the sense that maybe all of it isn&apos;t real, even by the game&apos;s standards.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is tough. The action is frantic, since one shot kills you and enemies move quickly, yet requires a lot of planning as you decide how to take on heavily-guarded buildings. The harder battles are ridiculously difficult. The sound is creepy and very fitting. The graphics are simple 2D, but the aesthetic is also unsettling. The controls are tough to get used to, but ultimately work most of the time. The story&apos;s somewhat minimal, but the story that is there is very interesting.
<br>
<br>I think this game is worth the $10 purchase, and if this looks interesting to you, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be disappointed. If you enjoy it, there&apos;s a lot of replayability here too. Definitely get it if it&apos;s on sale. The soundtrack is very good, but it&apos;s not exactly feel-good music. Either way, consider picking up the soundtrack too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3221763">Expand</a></span>

There are different masks to be worn which give you certain advantages and unlockable weapons to use which generate randomly. The replay isn&apos;t fueled so much by that though, its more just the release of stress you get from bashing in a whole bunch of  sprited heads (they are bad guys though and they deserve such treatment).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2717000">Expand</a></span>

It presents a disconcerting, neon-glowing underworld through which the player is propelled by addictive, ultra-violent game mechanics. These actions, and their motivations, are turned on the player by posing them as questions - both outright, and implicitly, when the violence reaches its stomach-turning peaks. Hotline Miami presents one of the strongest explorations of video game violence and player motivations ever put to binary. It is also an important game. It brings to a mass audience what indie games are capable of:  tackling issues that mainstream games **** around to avoid offending the press and the public, as well as eschewing the linear criteria of what&apos;s considered &quot;quality&quot; presentation in games. The game would be no better with more advanced graphics - in fact, the themes would be diluted by a greater focus on realism. The neon lights coupled with streaking blood and bright pink gore act like a scribbled highlighter on a page. The iconography of the character art works towards setting the player up: each enemy is faceless, their silhouettes only changing to convey what type of threat they are. They are set up to be classified as problems to be solved. This is what makes the questions posed to the player so powerful.
<br>
<br>The game is fun. But it&apos;s a strange kind of fun. I would implore you to try it with an open mind, without trying to frame it or categorize it at first. Like a great art-house film, it feels very &quot;complete&quot; in what it sets out to do, which goes above and beyond trivial issues such as &quot;I don&apos;t like 2d art&quot; or &quot;why is there no health bar&quot;. Those who fail to open up to new experience miss out on a lot in life, this game being no exception...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728321">Expand</a></span>

The story and gameplay fit together perfectly, and the small amount of randomization keeps things fresh as you constantly pound the restart button after getting your brains splattered across the floor. The plot is intelligent, vague, and overwhelmingly surreal to the point of simultaneous satisfaction and confusion. In the end you&apos;ll be left with your thoughts, and you&apos;ll probably have questions. But, after a little brain power, you&apos;ll think you have the plot figured out when all of the sudden you realize that you already knew the plot. You WERE the plot. If that sounds weird, it&apos;s because this game is weird, as well. While the game has some flaws, they can be overlooked for the most part, and you&apos;ll find yourself almost oblivious to the problems during gameplay. For now, I&apos;ll give the game an 8. Mostly due to technical problems that the developers are already working on, and because of the severe lack of options. If the game had been in development just a bit longer I think it could have been a perfect 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2718208">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Hotline Miami is a retro top down nintendo-style game with 80s pink neon feel and thumping hot soundtrack. Violently fun and different from most other games around. It&apos;s got a lot of funny tongue in cheek humor that some reviewers don&apos;t get.  Absolutely worth the price for the experience.</span>

The graphics are of Commodore 64 quality -- and this isn&apos;t an exaggeration -- so I can&apos;t really say anything good about them. But the game&apos;s greatest weaknesses are its repetitiveness and linearity. The levels are all different and progressively more difficult, but only in the way that levels in Sokoban change: ultimately, they are the same thing, but just organized differently. Which is ok. It works. But it isn&apos;t spectacular. Some people love the instant death without penalty (one shot kills you, but you just restart the level), but I find that it ruins the tactical aspect of the game. Instead of planning out your moves and playing it intelligently, you&apos;ll find that it&apos;s a lot easier just to do trial and error. One of the first things the game tells you is, &quot;don&apos;t be afraid to die,&quot; and pretty early into the game, you really won&apos;t be and that detracts a bit from the mood. But for all its flaws, my overall impression is positive. The game does what it&apos;s supposed to do: it entertains. Just buy it when it&apos;s on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2923253">Expand</a></span>

The story and setting is bizarre and grotesque and its casual use of extreme violence really sets the mood in place. The gameplay works great in its simplicity and it is as rewarding as it is challenging to succeed in the perfect way. The game has some minor flaws. Checkpoints placed before cutscenes is one of them. Its biggest flaw if you can call it a flaw is that the game isn&apos;t very long.  Most will probably beat the game in about 5 hours or less. But if you take into account the very low cost of this game that is hardly a real problem. And i would wholeheartedly recommend everyone to pick this one up since the game offers some really quality gameplay for a cheap price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2871555">Expand</a></span>

The score based, fast-paced arcade style action set to a pulsing background and thumping music produce an experience that&apos;s really unique. The game play is very trial and error; it takes several runs through a level to learn what works, yet alone what yields a high score. There&apos;s a very fulfilled and  rewarding feeling gained when a section is cleared, however, the same game play factors that produce the aforementioned satisfaction also produce frustration.  The controls are finicky, there&apos;s a very thin line between sliding around the level racking up a score and bopping from corner to corner until someone ends your misery. If I had a nickel for every time that I was shot down by an enemy off screen, I would have enough money to pay for this game twice. It&apos;s worth noting that this fun arcadey-romp has a story, which is interesting enough to keep your attention and make all of your actions feel a little more bad-ass. Bottom line: With Hotline Miami, you get your cake and eat it too, except your cake has no icing. A great experience with A LOT of room for improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2860194">Expand</a></span>

These games were acclaimed by their compelling story or beautiful imagery. The problem is this game doesn&apos;t have any beautiful images or an interesting story. You just have to do one thing: KILL. That&apos;s right! Remember GTA and GTA II, well, this is exactly the same. Hotline Miami is a fun game, but it&apos;s not as original as it claims to be. The gameplay is simple. Kill everything that moves quickly before it kills you. You can grab guns and knives and you can throw some weapons too. Each head will reward us with sort of XP Points and at the end of the level we will see our efficiency. Cool, right? Now, the story. You are a man who dreams about other men with masks talking to each other about you. You wake up, you get a phone call about the &quot;job&quot; you have to do, and once you do the &quot;job&quot; you go to a bar and drink. It gets repetitive. Really repetitive. But this games is all about fun. Hotline Miami is a little bit of GTA mixed with the &quot;Do it fast&quot; theme of Bloody Trapland. The game, though, still is fun to play. Trying to improve our record will have us replaying levels many times, and even though it doesn&apos;t have a long duration, we have lots of level. Prepare to die...a lot! Hotline Miami&apos;s difficulty is insane. You must be fast, and good, and tactical. You have to look well before getting into trouble. Hotline Miami has those 2D RPG graphics that got lost in the past, but that look so stylish it&apos;s impossible not to fall in love with them again. It&apos;s also cheerfully violent. The fun, the style and gameplay of the game is what makes it worth it, enough for a good 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2871218">Expand</a></span>

<br>Idea  Story: I found the whole idea not so unique, but there are some new elements. The story line is nice and it&apos;s gets better after a while.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Graphics: The perspective and the graphics remind me of GTA, the one published back in 1997 and even that one had better graphics. We live in 2013, I don&apos;t see any point, why developers can&apos;t make proper 2013 graphics.
<br>Music: Boring music after some point, especially if you get stuck in one level.
<br>Gameplay: I found the gameplay weird and it doesn&apos;t really suits me. Weird movement and bad weapons design.
<br>AI: AI is totally random and it&apos;s really bad. Enemies can see their foes bodies and they don&apos;t react, but they can hear me killing someone with a knife 2 rooms away.
<br>
<br>The game itself has some unique ideas, have some potential. Well if it had some 2013 graphics this would be far more better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185550">Expand</a></span>

This is just one of those great games, the kind that aren&apos;t very long but makes you love every second you have with it. Don&apos;t let the retro graphics fool you, the game play is fast paced murder disco cocaine party! You may try to be all tactical on your fist run, but then you&apos;ll die a few times and just say, fuk this and charge in, which ends up working way better. Now its a punishing game where you die A LOT but the game restarts the floor for you before you have time to say OH COQ. I see way to many people trying to compare it to instead of just enjoying it for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3606067">Expand</a></span>

The music, art and game play all combine and what it produces is spectacular. The story is very deep, and may require several breakthroughs to fully understand.

The game&apos;s replay-ability, story, and fantastic gameplay are wonderful to experience, but the reason Hotline Miami deserves a ten instead of a nine is the music.  The soundtrack alone gets a ten.</span>

Maybe it has some plot, but it always follows the same template you are in your house, you pick up the phone, blah blah blah, you go to your car, loading, you arrive and kill everyone, you take something &quot;important&quot;, you go back to the car, you buy something in the shop, you go back to your house, answer the call, blah blah blah, repeat. A lot of unnecessary violence isn`t fun either. The AI is completely unpredictable sometimes you shoot and nothing happens, second time everyone is running at you. Quick summation A LOT OF killing, next &quot;retro&quot; style, unsatisfying gameplay. Enemies can kill you, being &quot;outside&quot; the screen, so you can`t see them at all. And I`m not complaining because of the difficulty. SMB is harder, but more in a challenging way. One more thing  the game is bugged some way and music doesn`t play (all other sounds do).  This is irritating turned off after 20 minutes. Don`t buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3468804">Expand</a></span>

You get bored of rooms and rooms of bad guys which you have to kill by positioning yourself well and mashing space or whatever. The story is pretty dull too in my opinion. A pretty disappointing game after what I expected seeing those reviews and ratings.</span>

Never has looking through a mentally broken man&apos;s masked hazed vision been so rewarding, Story is among the best. The combined artistry from one developer murks whole multimillion dollar corporations efforts. This 1 man swedish developer is a beast &amp; deserves to become a millionaire.  Buy this game now! I hope it comes out on PSN &amp; XBox live.

One well placed bullet or lucky swing by an enemy is enough to kill you but respawning is simply a matter of pressing a button and then you&apos;re set to try and clear out the floor again. The visuals are eye-bleedingly retro neon and the soundtrack is pretty good. The mask system allows you to choose what minor perks your character will have, though why anyone would use anything other than the mask that makes gunshots silent is beyond me. The one tip I would suggest is make liberal use of the auto target feature as it will point you in the direction of offscreen enemies and clue you in to their locations to avoid any nasty surprises.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2897192">Expand</a></span>

Reminiscent in game play of the great Gauntlet and Alien Breed games of yesterdays, Hotline as been given some modern hyper stylings as blood and scenery gets chewed up as you make your away around the game. Action is quick and unrelenting as one misstep against the outnumbered enemies equals instadeath. I loved the graphics and music. 80&apos;s 8-bit text bounces and waves around the screen, while neon sprites and corridors make me wish I was colour blind. On occasion the game will throw some Super Nintendo Mode-7 spins and fades intentionally trying to give it that retro look. To keep things from being too samey,characters appear to have multiple animations, which made me feel that each kill was unique (pan of boiling water is one of my favorites so far). Audio and music is strong and suits 100% this title. In the mix are over 35 weapons and 25 unlockable animal masks, which each gives a slight game play change (greater punch reach, more ammo etc.). Guilty of being simple and fun.
<br>
<br>THE BAD: Very little of Hotline Miami can be described as &apos;bad&apos;. The gameplay itself can take a little getting used to as melee weapons have a certain range and gun aiming takes some practice but this is all part of the charm. Although being reckless is recommended and gives you a bigger score, I keep finding myself planning my movement around the level. Often I&apos;ll stop and see what the enemy is carrying before I burst in with a pipe (only to be welcomed in a hail of machine gun fire). Thankfully the restarts are quick and allow you to get back into the action. Due to the graphical style on occasion I&apos;ll be caught out by an AI character sat down and blended into the background but this all part of the charm and learning curve. | I would have liked to have seen larger levels, more variety of enemy and a multiplayer co-op element would have sealed the deal and scored a 9+ from me. Rumors of a sequel are already floating around, so fingers crossed for more of the same with some extras.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873506">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You pick up the weapon on the ground, and use it to kill the next guy. Then you repeat those 2 steps ad infinitum. Theres not even much of a puzzle to it. You just have to click faster than the enemy.</span>

This is besides the point of the horrible semi moving screen that makes anyone who thinks this game is skill based sadly mistaken.  The point is this game just doesn&apos;t click on any levels.  It isn&apos;t a fun top down, it isn&apos;t a fun shooter and it makes little sense at all.  Overall I have honestly played better quality flash game.  I understand the concept of retro but polish your retro up.  This game just fails on so many levels it makes me want to cry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3305763">Expand</a></span>

<br>The in-game brutality is matched only by how brutally the game treats the player.  If that sort of gaming masochism is your thing, then have at it.
<br>
<br>For reference sake, I think Super Meat Boys is hard too.  But this is harder a LOT harder.  I enjoyed SMB up to a point.

<br>Best summed up with this quote: &quot;And when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you&quot;</span>

The gameplay requires some learning. This means you&apos;ll die. A lot, which will be perfectly fine more often than not thanks to the bite-sized levels. It also means that if you manage to adapt and learn, you&apos;ll get better. Even though It will remain tricky and unforgiving (and therefore challenging and engaging) due to the way the aiming system works, you will gradually become able to pull off bold and risky moves, and you&apos;ll be rewarded for it with a sense of achievement. It&apos;s the ultimate reward a game can give you, it&apos;s something various systems out there try to replicate in a somewhat callous way with badges made of pixels, and it is something that comes naturally to this particular game.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic as well. I really don&apos;t know anything about music so I&apos;ll shut up (after saying just this): I think that not only it is good in its own right, but that it also perfectly fits and maybe even extends the most excellent experience that is Hotline Miami. I knocked a point because I&apos;m left-handed: The use of the shift key is a big no-no of awkwardness for me, and there currently is no way around this. A patch is on the way, but I really think it should have been in the release.
<br>
<br>In the end, if you&apos;re a gaming rat that gets into nerd rage fits at the sight of anything that is not the formatted Skinner box he has been taught to like, don&apos;t buy this.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, if you are more of an open-minded type of gaming rat, this little gem of a game will reward you amply for your time and your attention.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2717341">Expand</a></span>

Art is good and music... Music is awesome. I don&apos;t even listen that kind of music normally and still I can&apos;t help but grin when one of those great tracks starts.  There&apos;s lots of dark humor and, as you progress,  things start to turn more and more twisted. Even though this game is extremely violent, in subtle ways, this game is actually against mindless violence. Who would have thought that this kind of little game could make such impact. I recommend this to everyone, who wants to have a tough challenge while listening very good music. I think even those, who demand AAA -class graphics will enjoy this game.

I&apos;d say it&apos;s got a lot of things going for it, and I&apos;m somewhat baffled by some of the more negative reviews I have read on here from other users.  It is a top down shooter controlled by the keyboard for movement and the mouse for aiming.  I can understand how the controls may give some people a hrd time, but I felt them clicking within about an hour of play.  In my experience so far, it is incredibly easy to control, and I now find myself flying through levels at speeds that would have terrified me when I first started playing.  The game is fast, brutal, and completely unforgiving.  I have heard it compared to Trials HD on XBL, and that comparison is completely warranted.  They are fundamentally different games, but they have that same rapid-fail, rapid-restart system that encourages experimentation and switching up yourstrategies to try to find the most painless, combo-streaking way to tear through the army of enemies littering the level.  The use of violence, especially given the old-school graphics, is surprisingly over-the-top and visceral, and even manages to be unsettling to a certain degree, especially when, at the end of each level, you have to march back out to your car through a sea of mutilated bodies and blood covering the building.  I have beaten the game through 3 times at this point, and I can&apos;t wait to get off of work to go back and blast my way through it again.  It&apos;s simple, it&apos;s challenging, it&apos;s very unique (I can&apos;t think of any game to compare the actual minute-to-minute gameplay to) and I LOVE IT.  It may not be for absolutely everyone, but it has won me over in a big way.  If you&apos;re the kind of gamer who likes a challenge, and is up for mastering a new type of game you may not have extensive experience with already, this game is for you, and it&apos;s badass.  My only real complaint in this flood of praise is that the game is kind of short, and with the simplicity of the basic mechanics, i&apos;m a little disappointed that they couldn&apos;t throw in a few more level than what is there.  But for 10 bucks, I definitely found it to be worth my money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723533">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t dig the vibe after watching the trailer then I would say save your money. The game starts out fairly challenging but once you figure out the little details to the gameplay then it becomes moderately easy. The game is about tactically clearing rooms and doing it over and over again till you get it right. Sometimes you will wait and take things step by step, other times you will know exactly what to do and go in swinging/shooting. Again, if you watch the trailer and don&apos;t like the graphics or hate the music don&apos;t get the game. Also if you don&apos;t like challenging games then don&apos;t get this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789620">Expand</a></span>

It does just that though, then just stops. After half an hour I felt I had saw everything Hotline Miami had to show. Which is really a shame.
<br>
<br>I would recommend it, as what it does provide is quite enjoyable and unique. Shame it doesn&apos;t delve deeper.</span>

<br>
<br>The controls are easy to get and the game mechanics will soon lead you to a sequence of combos, and the game will reward you for your boldness and suicidal tactics. The masks you can choose can make a difference, so this game ain&apos;t no trial-and-error as some guys say. Some levels I would go all John Rambo on one moment, and in the other, I would catch a knife and give the enemies a Michael Myers slash-fest.
<br>
<br>The stealth level is a tad frustrating, but not THAT much. If you make good use of your &apos;look ahead&apos; action, it will help you a lot.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend this to everyone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805281">Expand</a></span>

While the game is simple in it&apos;s execution and style, it delivers with it&apos;s sheer madness and fun of solving the best way to beat a level. It is re-playable as well once you learn the intricacies of the game and how hard or how easy it is to do things a certain way. I found myself at one point trying to use only melee weapons. It&apos;s a bit harder but very satisfying. Plus as you progress you unlock different weapons an masks. Different masks can tailor the experience for your play style. One makes executions swift, another lets dogs ignore you, a fast walk mask. There are many and I still have more to unlock. The varied weapons you have and how unforgiving mistakes are make this game a true gem. It&apos;s nice when a game can infuriate you one minute then give you sheer delight the next. It truly is an experience. If you are looking to kill some time, this is a great way to do it. This is very much worth the asking price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2747546">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I respect this game for being retro not just for the sake of being retro. The retro graphics suit the overall feel of the 1980&apos;s setting and the amazing soundtrack (also retro) hits the sweet spot. At first I thought there was no real story to the game, but as I pressed harder, I got a hold of what the developers were trying to achieve and jumped down the bunny hole in no time flat. I don&apos;t want to spoil anything for you, so I&apos;ll let you figure out what&apos;s going on. I can tell you one thing: once you finish a chapter, the music cuts out as you&apos;re forced to walk back to your car through hordes of dead bodies. You really start to ponder your character&apos;s motives and his reasons for answering all of these random calls, even after he throws up out of sheer disgust at what he did during the first chapter. By far the most interesting aspect of the game though is the gameplay. You have to use everything you can find to your advantage, especially since both you and your enemies have a one-hit kill lifespan. The stealth isn&apos;t great, but you do have to time your moves and predict when enemies will rush out (and I mean RUSH OUT) or shoot you. Like you can do to your enemies, your enemies can kill you in the blink of an eye. You. Will. Die. Countless. Times. You can take out other baddies with guns at ease, but since guns are so loud, they attract the attention of people surrounding you. You&apos;d want to use melee weapons as much as you can, but only they can get you so far. Enough of me rambling, here&apos;s my bottom line: If retro fast-paced action strategy games with a compelling and fantastically thought-out plot and narration suit you, then this game comes highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806481">Expand</a></span>

Yes, you&apos;re not buying a graphical pushing game, there are plenty of flash games with &apos;better&apos; graphics, but this was the style they wanted and it fits the music and whole theme...It won&apos;t win awards, but as has been said playing a game for it&apos;s graphics is like watching porn for the plot.
<br>
<br>It can be tough, but I guarantee 75% of the deaths you suffer will be your fault...and you&apos;ll learn from them. You&apos;ll plan your run, then panic lob a shotgun at someone and sprint round a corner into a dog or forget the glass for the 100th time. You could probably complete all the levels in an afternoon but if you can pick it up for around $5 that&apos;s cheaper then a lot of evenings entertainment. And you will be entertained.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good game, and the &apos;plot&apos; that is there and unfolds is just enough and just little enough to make you question things...you&apos;ll WANT to play more, to finish that level  to see the next one....and the soundtrack to it is perfectly matched.
<br>
<br>Only a few gripes  it&apos;s a little short, and to some extent limited replay value. I doubt I&apos;d replay it for a while but I can see myself coming back in a year or 2. Some of the boss fights are just a little annoying, the biker has been mentioned by others, but really you&apos;ll get it in the end just the dialog every-time was needless
<br>
<br>I&apos;d say it&apos;s more 8.5 but having to go one way or the other on the simple fact that it&apos;s a fun solid cheap game with a well played story and a great soundtrack it more then deserves the 9</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3257519">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a top down tactical action game with emphasis on quick, well thought out moves and precise timing. The game does encourage a trial-and-error style of play, however, as death results in you simply restarting the floor you are on, instead of a mission failed screen or a repeat of the entire chapter. If you enjoy brutal, fast paced action, then you should definitely check this one out.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the 80&apos;s or retro gaming, you may be able to appreciate this game&apos;s art style as well. Thumping bass beats coupled with a &quot;modern&quot; take on the pixellated graphics of yore make for a very unique experience. The dark atmosphere of the game world and its characters emphasize a focus on the killing and the wonderful, sadistic rush you get from destroying a floor full of people with a crowbar.
<br>
<br>Hotline Miami isn&apos;t for everyone, that much is true. Not everyone will like the style of gameplay or its art style. However, don&apos;t let other people  influence you right away. Hotline Miami is definitely something you need to judge for yourself.  You may be surprised about how much fun you have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3279072">Expand</a></span>

At its best, it feels really good; At it&apos; worst it&apos;s a gamer&apos;s worst nightmare. I&apos;m still fighting the controls despite many hours of gameplay. Notable issues are line of sight (you&apos;ll die from enemies you can&apos;t even see more times than you&apos;d like, awkward character rotation (especially noticeable with a melee weapon) means you&apos;ll miss your swings like you&apos;re some kind of drunk brawler (missing a swing = death 99% of the time). I keep dying because I don&apos;t feel comfortable with the controls. I long for a gamepad, and that&apos;s really not a good thing when I&apos;m playing on my computer. It really feels like one of those twin-stick shooters on XBLA. It could certainly work great with a mouse, but in this case it&apos;s barely functional, never mind reliable or enjoyable in the midst of the action (also, your cross-hair isn&apos;t visible enough, which adds insult to injury). The game is also quite full of other really weird oversights (or were they design decisions? I honestly can&apos;t tell). For instance: if you occupy the same space as an enemy, that enemy can&apos;t hit you (melee or gun), neither can you hit him. That alone could be fine, but when combined with the awkward controls and the lack of enemy friendly fire it&apos;s quite a **** pain. Also, the doors keep getting in the way, opening and closing wildly when touched with anything (bullets included), sending enemies in a concussion (i.e. not killing them), but blocking your precious bullets. Also, it&apos;s quite a shock when an enemy rises from a pool of blood because he was knocked unconscious by the door and not killed by your bullets, and then he kills you (of course). There&apos;s also the most horrible boss in recent history [*spoiler?*] : the one with the motorcycle helmet. He&apos;s fully invincible (of course you don&apos;t know that until he kills you 3 times as you&apos;re standing in disgust) until he trows his **** knife, at which point you can bash him; also, he rotates around you, sort of not attacking you outright even though&apos;s he&apos;s faster than you and he&apos;s **** invincible. It feels so wrong with how the rest of the game plays, I felt cheated. [*/spoiler*] Oh and then there&apos;s that &quot;stealth&quot; section, which I don&apos;t even feel like describing. However, the game does build up quite an atmosphere. The story is engaging, the music is pretty damn awesome and the graphics work fine, despite inducing confusion in pitched battles (the screen kind of moves about, scorepoints clutter the screen, blood everywhere, flashes of light -oh, you&apos;re dead aren&apos;t you, I bet you didn&apos;t even notice. I sure haven&apos;t.) So in the end, pros: cool atmosphere, aesthetics are poignant and engaging. cons: the controls don&apos;t do the game justice, some horrible bosses and a god-awful stealth sequence. Still a decent game, though I&apos;m confused by the incredibly high scores.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2716386">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, I have to admit I was really enjoying the first few levels. I was dying pretty often at first, but that&apos;s part of the learning experience and there is no penalty or 3 lives per game business.
<br>
<br>What I didn&apos;t like is the difficulty spike around level 5. It goes from only a couple enemies having weapons to EVERY enemy have fully automatic guns along with rabid dogs darting at you.
<br>So basically it plays like this... If a gun toting enemy sees you YOU ARE DEAD!
<br>
<br>It quickly becomes a game of &quot;Don&apos;t throw the  (with apologies to Q&#x2022;bert) controller at the TV!
<br>It&apos;s a bit like being sniped by someone you can&apos;t see over and over again.
<br>
<br>Very frustrating IMO and I grew up playing, and in most cases, beating some of the harder classics such as Ninja Gaiden 1-3, Ghosts &apos;N Goblins, &amp; Battletoads.
<br>
<br>Had they oven the player a fraction of a second to see and respond to an enemy it would have helped. O even a lesser difficulty option, but no, it plays like its on Maniac mode all the time.
<br>
<br>Perhaps the developer can add a slightly easier difficulty via an update. I&apos;ve seen this happen before. I would definitely jump back in and play if they evened up the odds a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=3664894">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t then i&apos;ll sum it up to this, if you love this game your a blind, dumb hipster that love broken games. There to funny to read, but anyway......
<br>
<br>Hotline Miami is one of those different games to come out in the indie section. To be honest, When I first saw the game I didn&apos;t think it belonged there until I got a peak at the gameplay. When it went up on sale not to long ago I thought I would give it a try and right away loved the game. At the begining of the game your greeted by a homeless looking guy who teaches you the basics then you meet the masked three (that&apos;s what I call them anyway.) I&apos;m not going to talk about story and ruin it for ya so lets talk game play.
<br>
<br>Since the game is a over the top shooter it doesn&apos;t look like something you could be stealthy at, but that&apos;s where your wrong. Depending on what you like in weapon wise and what your mask does you could go silent or all out but the trick of this game is to plan your attack instead of going right at it, a simple thing that many game developers tend to push to the side to help out newer gamer&apos;s. As long as you think before you act you can get threw this game pretty well but remember, just like your enemies can be killed by one hit, you can die with one hit as well so trial and error is needed when you first start playing just to get use to it. The more you kill the more points you collect and you can make more points by how bold you get, how many chained kill you collect and even how you take them out and with allot of different weapons to choose from you wont get tired trying something different like switching your shotgun for a base ball bat or sword.
<br>
<br>I myself haven&apos;t beaten the game just yet but from what I have played I am very pleased with this game, but to be honest I like to see more for this game and if not this one then I hope to see allot more for Hotline Miami 2 (yes they are already developing a second game). From what I can tell, after you beat the story there isn&apos;t much else for you to do except play the sorry again and get high scores on all the levels. What this game could use is a user friendly level maker along with some sort of server system to share these levels to other players, but that&apos;s just a personal idea since I don&apos;t want to just drop this game after defeating it. Besides that, I really dig the music in this game. It kind of gave me a 80&apos;s movie soundtrack feel to it and goes well with the entire gameplay feel.
<br>
<br>In the end, I&apos;m giving it a 8.5 (even tho I can only give it a 8 here) for trying something new and winning.
<br>
<br>P.S. Notice I never talked about graphics beyond &apos;over top shooter&apos;? That&apos;s because graphic&apos;s is never something you should worry about. you don&apos;t need good graphic for a good game, the game could look like crap and still be awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2924856">Expand</a></span>

The game is very well planned, mechanics unique, and the game itself is completely unique. Soundtrack is great and fits perfectly, and this incredible playability. As for the story at the beginning of it at all does not feel - I just perform some tasks masked guests. At one point, after a certain event, but I will not say what because I do not want to do spoilers, the game turns upside down and the story would normally dent in the seat or chair, depending on where we sit. Many may not like the pixel visuals, but to me it just did not bother and I think the graphics are very well matched. I would recommend to anyone, especially to players who like to play an independent and tactical game, because these species are undoubtedly the work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789650">Expand</a></span>

You have this pumping modern soundtrack with 80&apos;s visual design and modern gameplay. It&apos;s hard like old games, but not unfair like old, bad games. It&apos;s easy to pick up and each floor is like a checkpoint.
<br>The simple but disturbing Dayid Lynch-esque backstory is really the icing on the cake.</span>

<br>Incredible as it may seem, it has a complex narrative. At first, there is no way to have an idea of what is going on, what you are doing and why, but gradually the pieces will fall into place, but not in a simple linear fashion.
<br>The environment of the 80&apos;s Miami is very beautiful and colorful and fits well with that era. And expect to see blood everywhere, yours and your enemies&apos;.
<br>The music is incredible and also reflects well the atmosphere of the time besides the climate of the situations you face.
<br>
<br>But the great jewel of the game is it&apos;s the gameplay.
<br>You can kill your enemies in countless different ways and with different types of weapons.
<br>In addition, you gain masks that give you special abilities that can be used to strengthen their playing style.
<br>The response of the controls is very fast, like the action, half a second of hesitation and you&apos;re dead.
<br>The game is not easy, and you will probably have to repeat some the missions several times, but it recognizes that, therefore the respawn is imediate.
<br>
<br>For it&apos;s tipification, the game would have everything to be a frustrating experience, but quite on the contrary by all the factors cited here Hotline Miami becomes a very relaxing experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami/user-reviews?user_review_id=2968992">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.
