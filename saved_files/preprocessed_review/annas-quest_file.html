<br>Where adventure games often fail for me is with the puzzles. Either they are too easy or they are tough but nonsensical. Fortunately, Anna&apos;s Quest also gets the puzzles right. The first chapter was a bit easy and I thought the puzzles would be too easy. But they gradually got tougher, but they always remained fair. I can&apos;t think of a puzzle that was unfair.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/annas-quest/user-reviews?user_review_id=6099990">Expand</a></span>
