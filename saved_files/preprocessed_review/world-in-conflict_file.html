Here you get the chance to put to test since the very first second you play it all the mighty power of 3 factions, USA, NATO and USSR. The very instance you start the game you are put directly into the battlefield that quite frankly is our own backyard. Yes all the maps you&apos;re gonna fight into are all areas from our own cities, our own towns and neighborhoods. The visuals are fantastic. Massive has elaborated the graphics at such a great detail that you might even see the rebelious graphitis on the walls of some neighborhood building, to the flying newspapers in the hollow space left in a deserted town. The units you fight with are detailed to the maximum way possible known today, very high rendering gives us a really great view to play in. Then again it doesn&apos;t stop here, if you have a cutting-edge graphics card then you can pop the game up to DirectX 10 rendering, giving you visuals you won&apos;t ever forget. From ground deformation, cloud shadows, high-processed physics, volumetric light, HDR...and the list does not stop. The campain is limited to 2 factions. You can play only as USA or/and Nato vs. the invading USSR. It takes place on year 1989...yeah right when the Cold War was supposed to end...but the russians didn&apos;t think of so...You have to defend you own backyard, and repel the russian invasion from Europe. Unfortunately, they are releasing it only with 2 factions available on SP, due to not post pone the date, but you can really easily play the USSR faction on the MP. And to mention it the multiplayer is a bomb, and there have been several ways to show it. First the fortunate one to play the Alpha Test and as an Alpha Tester it did a very good impression on me. Second Massive released a Beta Test but Closed MP, only a few keys were released and they did a lot of changes in there from the Alpha but it was a great adventure playing it. Massive then having the reports releases the Wide Open MP Beta that was a fully integrated MP where most of the players (by the ending date i counted 216000) had a great time with the game, then demo comes with the final touches and a SP mission. On MP you can create clans with your friends and match other clans to earn points and reputation worldwide, or you can be the solitare wolf and kick***. Massgate grants the good players with ranks and medals, and they already have a ladderboard going on since demo. Personally, the fun i had and will have with this game, is immense...so i&apos;d get it at any cost. In short terms like the leader of massgate told to all of us expecting this great game: World in Conflict The Most Intense Strategy Game Ever Crated...and I STAND BY IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=401803">Expand</a></span>

That said, World In Conflict had one of the best single-player experiences I&apos;ve ever had (including Deus Ex, Half-Life 1 &amp; 2, and Starcraft). The writing is superb, and the tension leading up to the end is palpable, making the campaign one of the best (albeit shortest) I&apos;ve ever played. Now, the majority of the game&apos;s value lies in Multiplayer. Having been through both closed and open betas, I&apos;ve seen firsthand the evolution of this game from a multiplayer standpoint. Those who say the sides are similar tend to forget how mirrored each modern army is to the next; tanks, APCs, infantry are all integral parts...Massive wasn&apos;t going to include Arbiters or Mammoth Tanks just to satiate the fanboys, and not to mention how that would completely wreck the atmosphere of 1989 American and European vistas. Instead, the burden of the balance falls to the players of multiplayer. Your dominance directly falls to how well you play as your role and how well you play as a team. Because this is such a new experience, (no other RTS has weighted so much of the success upon proper cooperation) a majority of casual RTS gamers are overwhelmed by the new coordination that is required of them. While I don&apos;t mean for this to be a psycoanalytical study of other users posts, when people get beat, they tend to complain. That said, if you approach WiC Multi with a rambo-like attitude, you will get destroyed. It&apos;s as simple as that. On a side note, those that are complaining that this is a failed RTS say so out of ignorance. Massive never meant for this to be an RTS. They&apos;ve said from the beginning of the development it is oriented around combat and coordination and not base building or resource gathering. Do not come to this game expecting an RTS and then proceed to sully its name by stating things that are simply not true.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=409026">Expand</a></span>

This game has as much to do with RTS as it does FPS, I mean the controls are FPS and the style of running and gunning doing away with building in favor of team based destroy fests is what this game does best. What I love the most is the fact that unlike COH I can get on and play for an hour or 10 mins and not in the middle of battle upseting all present. I love COH but there are times when I want to think les about what building and unit to purchase and more about tactical movement and strategy on a more personal scale. Besides nothing beats having all the enamies camping a hill thinking themselfs invulnerable then droping the tactical nuke or 3 wide artilery berages.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=403504">Expand</a></span>

Good ranking system by massgate similar to BF2142. Customizable decals on units. Awesome zooming ability, you can zoom straight in and see individual units fighting/talking or zoom out to see more of the map. One of the best RTS games I&apos;ve played.</span>

As one player prepares to move to a location he will request an artillery strike from another player to clear the target and when capturing the target he should have anti Air support to secure the location. all sounds straight forward, but that may not be good enough, how about using that attack as a diversion and drawing the enemy away from the real target you wanted.

It is, when compared to other strategy games (or starcraft, which is more build order and spam), is revolutionary. And this is why some people have it and others (like me) love it. It is by all acounts the most realistic in terms of obtaining units, although the actual combat is not (CoH does it much better). Countering the hate further, I will try to explain some of the things, like no resources and balanced units. 1) Balanced units: this is modern, and although everyone would think it funny and almost right that all the Russians have are AK-47s and Dragonovs (not a sniper btw), this is not true. Their military is almost up to our level at this point. Plus, it is fiction, duh. 2) No resource gathering/no bases: for god sakes, no war was EVER fought with tanks being built on the front lines and mindlessly rushing them straight into the wall of guns that is a defense. Altough the airdropping of an A1M1 (Abrams for the laymen) is a bit sketchy (they do weigh 60 tons), it is better than front-line assembly. 3) &quot;mindless point and click&quot;: this is from the perspective of the commanding officer, not an omnipotent, omniceint eye-in-the-sky. Just because you cant &quot;see&quot; the the units fighting per se doesnt mean that they arent, i.e. the devs thought that soldiers actually have brains and could fight on their own. Not a game for the micro-managers except for some of the abilities the units have. And the point-click complainers obviously only played the demo on easy. The tactical abilities are there exactly for those nub campers on the hill, and are actually somewhat hard to use on a smart opponent. All in all, a very good attempt at reinventing the RTS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=741529">Expand</a></span>

People who claim this game does not require thought or strategy are totally in a state of tunnel vision about what an RTS is. World in conflict is a real time strategy game who ever says otherwise is an idiot, RTS games don&apos;t need base building or resource mining and what not, that&apos;s just added. At its heart and RTS is a game that requires the ability to manage multiple units effectively the person who&apos;s is the best at that wins (as compared to a shooter where you manage yourself), resources add a different level but don&apos;t change the base concept. This game requires immense skill and teamwork when played multiplayer and the learning curve is a bit steep but anyone who wants to play a game that requires a brain as well and dexterity should try it out since if you don&apos;t like multiplayer the single player and skirmish mode (which exists I don&apos;t know what people are talking about) are well worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=1386667">Expand</a></span>

Remove the graphics from this game and you have nothing more than a generic strategy game with very bad controls, even C&amp;C 3 is better than WIC and that&apos;s not saying much. Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this stinker. Try the demo first as the press reviews are based purely on graphics and not game-play.</span>

Because the addon &quot;Soviet Assault&quot; only adds 6 single-player missions, i&apos;m writing my review only for the original game. // Even after 2 years, the graphics on highest settings in DX10 are absolutely fantastic, and the sound and voice acting are probably 10/10. Wether you&apos;re just looking at landscapes or towns, from villages to big cities, in all kinds of settings from deserts over green forests to winter sceneries, or you are looking at tense battles with explosions, fire, gas clouds, planes dropping bombs or support crates and fire flares to avoid AA missiles - the game is absolutely breathtaking to look at. // Doing the tutorial, you get totally hyped out, the details are insane - the free camera lets you overview the entire battle, or zoom in so close that you even can hear tank crews doing small talk while waiting for orders. The whole single player campaign (especially with the added Soviet Assault missions in between) is worth every single minute, and took me about 2-3 days to finish. Both plot and gameplay are much better than anything ive seen so far. If this was about the single player only, i would probably give it a 9 or even 10/10. // However, the single player at times feels like it is preparing you for the ultimate multiplayer part of the game, most missions teach you particular roles of every unit like emergency repairs, or how to use Helicopters etc. . And that&apos;s where the fun suddenly ends. The gameplay in multiplayer has hardly anything to do with the singleplayer. No matter where you place your ground troops, there will be anti-tank / napalm / nukes dropped on your units if you stand in place for longer than 10 seconds. Anti-Air batteries will be wiped out even by Helicopters, Tanks shot to pieces by basically everything, teamplay is so critical that it&apos;s nearly impossible to get into the game. The only way i could be high on scores so far was to simply build repair vehicles and some AA, and repair everything in sight - which isn&apos;t very satisfying in the long run. The community just seems to hate newcomers, just take a look at the forums how people keep writing how much they hate newbies. Example: You join a game, support role is recommended. You buy heavy artillery and anti-air and you will be &quot;kicked due to a vote&quot; in about 1 minute - instead of giving you advice that they don&apos;t want/need artillery in their team, i only found out later while browsing forums that using any artillery units is &quot;forbidden&quot; even in public play. Also there are only about 10-20 servers around with people on it and playable latency (playing from europe, no mods). // On the technical side, single-player works like a charm without any crashes or FPS issues on a quad 2.83Ghz, ATI 4870 and 4GB RAM. In multiplayer, the game sometimes halfway locks up - it just stops doing anything, although windows says the application was still working fine. Customer support both by UBI and on the Massgate forums have been the worst i&apos;ve seen so far. // I think this game is already past its time multiplayer-wise, although it&apos;s very much worth 30</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=83828">Expand</a></span>

It can be fun but, the factions are un exciting and you will be using the same units over and over again. This is not a true RTS!

I played the game through the first four missions and I wasn&apos;t impressed. Everything felt straight forward and simple, not at all like a good strategy game should be, deep and rewarding. The missions themselves felt rushed, as in; making me move onto the next primary objectives before fully achieving my secondary ones. The strange thing about this game was... When I was playing it all I could think of was &apos;this is no way as good as Company of Heroes&apos;. Much better use of resources. In World in Conflict they provide the resources for you, and units are replenished if or when they are destroyed. The problem is, you can find yourself with no units, or limited units whilst you wait for your reinforcements to arrive. There are so many problems with this game. I&apos;ll stick with Company of Heroes, a far better, better designed, implemented game. Yes, it needs patching, but Company of Heroes out does World in Conflict in every way. Please note: I did not play the multiplayer game of World in Conflict, which I believe this particular game was made for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=403546">Expand</a></span>

The factions are boring and even worse 99% symetrical across the board. If you are going to make a game as simple and mind numbing pointless as WIC, the developers could have atleast made three unique factions, but oh well. To truly see if this sticks for you, download the demo, play on low detail settings. If you&apos;re not board within 20 minutes, maybe wic is the game for you.

Commands like &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;hold fire&quot;. This is probably the worst RTS I&apos;ve ever played, just because it plays like an arcade game. Yes, I know, &quot;it&apos;s an RTT&quot;. That&apos;s a great cliche and all, except for the problem that there is no such genre as that, and it&apos;s being used as a copout excuse to mask the fact that Massive failed to design a decent RTS instead of having to say, simply, &quot;Sorry, we failed to design a decent RTS.&quot; The fact that Gamespot has given this game a 9.5 just means I&apos;ll never read Gamespot again. It&apos;s that terrible. This game was fuelled by hype, and 100% of the revenue it brings in is due to that hype. Not due to a quality game. Whatever Gamespot employee thinks this game is worth even a 5.0 should be shot. This is the &quot;ET: The Extra Terrestrial&quot; of the modern era. I can&apos;t even imagine how much worse the Xbox version must be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=406843">Expand</a></span>

This is not an RTS -- its some FPS/RTS hybrid that does mediocre on both fronts. I could be biased here, but I felt the game was far less about strategy then it was about properly using your tactical aids and unit special abilities. This gives it a very arcade-ish feel.

I didn&apos;t like it for a number of reasons. First off the controls are just wacky and they bother me a lot. Obviously this is not a huge problem as this is completely personal. Second: There is no building a base which, in my opinion, really adds fun to an RTS game. Instead you are just get units via air drop. Third: There was very little decision making or strategic situations which I think is absolutely essential to any RTS as RTS means Real Time Strategy. Forth: There is not resource gathering either which is another strategic aspect pretty much required for a good RTS game. Like the requirement to defend your base and supply lines. Fifth: There is no skirmish mode that you can just play against the AI. It is only multiplayer which can be fun but sometimes its more enjoyable to play against the computer. There is one campaign and almost identical playable factions that include the skins as well as the damage, speed, and armor values. As well as the fact that the units are VERY limited in the sense that there are few units, let alone unique ones. I guess I have been spoiled by Westwood&apos;s Command and Conquer series where I had to think and do something. This is a pretty negative stand point but I am picky with RTS games. The game has good graphics how ever but it is not the best thing to buy it because of that. Basically if you are looking for another RTS game that could be fun, this could be for you but definetly not (in my opinion) a well thought out and brilliant game. It lacks in most areas that I believe are necessities for a game of this genre and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=406389">Expand</a></span>

Surely, the animations are great, the graphics are amazing, there are special effects and it&apos;s generally visible that the project was done on a high budget.

While it did not really meet my lofty expectations, I thought it was good enough for a playthrough. The graphics are excellent, with amazing model detailing. Great battles abound! The gameplay is more fun than some people say it is. Yes, all you do is call in your units and they appear after a short period and then boom you can deploy them. Yes, you&apos;ll often call on the same units after playing this for a while. No more base building. No more resource gathering. Just pure combat essentially  not too much strategy involved since everything is given straight to you and the only real strategic element is in choosing how you use up your unit quota based on which units you deploy. Obviously, this semi-RTS isn&apos;t for everyone, but I thought it was worth it to play it.

<br>Why is this not a 9? I wish that it was bigger; would have been a lot more fun with more units/increased unit cap and even bigger environments.

However it lacks one thing, any for of strategy. Unfortunatly no matter how hard I try to like this game the single-player is dire, I find it&apos;s dull repetative gameplay a serious letdown which hopefully will be improved by a patch (more hope than expectation though). One thing that has to be said though is that the multiplayer, if done with friends and not complete strangers, is awesome. However when it comes to just diving into a random match with people over the internet then it&apos;s more a case of carnage as everyone zips about doing their own thing rather than collaberating as a team. In conclusion only purchase if you know 7 other people who are also going to buy it and will help you make the most out of the game. Otherwise you&apos;re going to be severely disappointed by what some people will see as the biggest anti-climax of gaming this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=401884">Expand</a></span>

The storyline is pretty good, but some gameplay issues make it annoying to handle units. Tactical aid is overpowering, but with all the enemy AI units running around, you do kind of need it, although the use of it can best be called a &quot;BS maneuver&quot;, in which you can be an inch away from a killing blow only to have all your troops blown away by a couple artillery rounds. I do like it, but it could have been a lot better. Multiplayer is repetitive, unit control gets annoying, its nothing you haven&apos;t seen before.

Excellent graphics and effects, the game controls are pretty good too. This would be a fantastic game for people who just want to have fun, and aren&apos;t looking for a realistic tour of duty. Example: The gun on your Bradley is has trouble destroying light soviet jeeps with it&apos;s 25mm chain gun. Such a heavy gun should be able to rip light vehicles apart. You will have fun with this game whether you&apos;re looking for realism or not, but serious strategy gamers will have to take into account some shortcommings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=401871">Expand</a></span>

It illustrates only the simplest tactical aspects modern warfare. (See a tank? Click the big red button to shoot a TOW missile. Did you hit it? Well done. Have a cookie). These short-comings aside, the game is highly polished, and the environment and plot do well to portray the situational urgency of a Soviet invasion of US territory. This game will appeal to those who entertain the notion of being battlefield commanders, but lack the true insight and temperament to stomach even marginally more realistic games. Those wishing to purchase the game for the multiplayer challenge should be warned that it is aimed squarely at the Counterstrike/FPS market, and will likely attract such a &quot;community&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=401893">Expand</a></span>

I like the range of view of this game, but allowing a company to tell where a tank is just because it fired at them doesn&apos;t seem quite realistic. The AI was definitely a step down from Company of Heroes, considering how infantry will remain standing even within heavy crossfire, and will only go prone after being hit once or twice, then awaiting death just lying there in the middle of the streets. Are American troops really that obedient? At least in CoH they try to find cover, while this game they would refuse it even if they are RIGHT BESIDE A FOREST. The tanks have amazing agility and accuracy, and Anti-Tank Infantry has lots of RPG&apos;s, and infinite ammo. Causing major imbalances within the game as you can simply win by pumping AT-troops. Either way, this game is much too easy. No need to build or anything, just DESTROY. When it is possible to destroy an entire building with nothing but bullets, what else is impossible?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=402029">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s very well balanced between the opposing forces so no one has an advantage over the other. Team work and tactics are key to winning! Single player game is also very very fun.</span>

So if you want to play a game where your goal is to build bases and gather resources, then you&apos;ve found the right opposite. This is all about fast action paced tactical warfare in a team of 5+ where each player is totally dependent of their team mates in order to succeed. because of this, the online experience can be a bit rough for new players and I have to agree that in the beginning I had some real hard times. But once I learned the system this game is a real diamond. It&apos;s more addictive than anything else I have ever played, the graphics are insane , the balance(concerning units and unit types) is perfect and the gameplay is just amazing. So, if you want a fast paced RTT action game where the key to success lies in your teams ability to cooperate, then this is the game for you. If you want a base building and resource gathering RTS where you alone can rule the match, then go find yourself another game, because you will piss on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=407614">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you are a PC gamer and appreciate great games, this game is a must in your collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4200982">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a strategy game player, so i know my way around RTS, and WIC is the the  most action-packed, and fun-filled game i have ever played. The first thing i look for in a game is game-play. How is the UI, balance, tactics, and other areas that affect how a game is played. WIC is undoubtedly a 10/10 on this point. I love the team-based aspect of the game. As well the lack of macro (base-building and unit recruiting) is an important decision that adds to the fast-paced fun of the game. The story-line is epic; USA vs. USSR (How could i not be with such a topic). With it&apos;s legendary graphics (Which can still hold their own today) and superb voice acting they come together to form a powerful story-line. In fact, I actually felt attached to the characters in the game, which is something that the majority of other games have failed to do so for me (Although i only play strategy game, so perhaps that has something to do with it). The epic story-line frames the single player adding depth and complexity to the game. The single player isn&apos;t particularly difficult, but it is engaging and entertaining to play. The multiplayer of this game is where it delivers. Being able to jump into games that have already begun is a huge breakthrough and one of the major bonuses of the game. As mentioned above, the team-based aspect of the game is one of the major advantages of the game. It eliminates Rambo players and even the best player in the world can&apos;t win you a game. Meticulously balanced classes and variety of units and off-map support add to the depth, merit, and competitiveness of the multiplayer. The unfathomable hours i spent on this game are a testament to it&apos;s immense value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=1770413">Expand</a></span>

It has one of the most innovative tactical aid systems I&apos;ve ever seen in any video game featuring a real tactical aid systems. Visuals are really great, especially when using a kick-ass tactical aid like carpet bombing or better yet, a nuke! The tactics are well implemented, the ranges of weaponry are pretty realistic or in anyway, perfectly scaled to fit the map, and the map is freaking huge even for a genre that should include big-size maps like RTS or RTT. And the combat is off the hook! It&apos;s always intense and full of action at any given minute, heck, second. And this game also emphasizes the TEAMWORK, which is the first time I&apos;ve ever experienced and it&apos;s well done. Also, this game has almost zero bug which is one of the many great things this title has to offer. The only downside I could find is that out of the campaign, there really is no skirmish section to enjoy the mechanics even more. Too bad there&apos;s no further project for the sequel which is really bad cause this game set a really shining example to all RTT and even RTS games out there. I&apos;m gonna give a 9 to this excellent display of RTT, minus 1 point cause there&apos;s no SP skirmish mode but all in all, this is a must buy for RTT and even RTS fans out there. It&apos;s just excellent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4236204">Expand</a></span>

<br>Story:
<br>World in Conflict takes place during cold war era but in alternate reality. Negotiations fail and World War 3 starts. NATO soldiers including Americans invade Soviet Union. While Americans are fighting Russians in Europe, Russian ships invade America disguised as Cargo ships. Due to surprise attack and lack of enough forces to defend borders, Russians successfully invade City of Seattle.
<br>
<br>You play as Lieutenant Parker, tasked by Captain Banon to help civilians escape and leave the city to regroup in early hours of the game. As time goes by you meet some very interesting characters with great personalities. Unlike most other war games, here characters aren&apos;t one dimensional. Instead they have their own good and bad sides. The game shows good and bad people on both sides ,and how both nations are lead by brave soldiers who are not willing to fight each other but they are forced to do so due to politics.
<br>
<br>Design:
<br>World in Conflict is an Action RTS. The Single Player Campaign can easily last over 10 hours and contains 14 missions. There are 6 extra missions in Complete Edition where you play as Russian. Both Russian and American missions are part of the same campaign and after every few American missions, you switch sides and see everything through the perspective of Russian army.
<br>
<br>Missions are beautifully crafted. There is always some sort of twist in every mission that makes it different than the last one. In some missions, you are only given control of a small group that is used for hit and run tactics. Objectives in the game are based on story of the game and everything works perfectly. Nothing feels tacked on or forced.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer supports 16 players and can be played via LAN or Internet. Three types of maps are featured: domination maps, where players must control command points to win the game, assault maps, where one team defends a series of command points which the other teams assaults, and tug of war maps, where teams must fight to capture a series of command points on the front line, whereupon the line shifts towards a new set of points closer to the losing team. It&apos;s basically NATO vs Soviet Union and everything is well balanced.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>There is no base building and instead of controlling the entire battlefield, you control small squad and play your part in the war while things go boom around you when other soldiers are fighting each other.  You are given Command Points. These points act as resources. Different units cast different Command Points.
<br>
<br>After deploying units, there is a brief cool down period. When someone in your squad dies, his points are slowly added back to your inventory which means you can call that or another type of unit again once enough points are restored. This forces you to carefully plan your strategy before sending your troops to be killed. You move camera with WASD keys and order or select troops with Mouse. You can also assign them to different groups for quick selection (Ctrl + Number Key).
<br>
<br>World in Conflict offers a lot of freedom. You can order you rifle squad to enter a building and attack from there or you can order them sit inside a vehicle for faster travel before ordering them to leave the vehicle and engage in combat.  You can call for Air Support as long as you have enough points to call them or you are not in the middle of cool down. To get more points for reinforcements and Air Support you&apos;ll have to complete different primary and secondary objectives that reward you with more points and in some cases, unlock new units and new kind of Air Support.
<br>
<br>Presentation:
<br>World in Conflict looks great till this day. The game has a lot of cutscenes and scripted moments, that are used to tell the story or explain objectives. Gameplay animations and cutscenes are done by motion capturing which makes everything feel more real. Acting in this game is really really good and almost everything is destructible.
<br>
<br>You can zoom in and see troops running around, shouting at each other while fighting enemies. Everything looks great even when you take a closer look. When tanks fire, the sound effects and smoke effects that you experience are top of the line. Vehicles have real physics as well. And when you are not engaged in the battle, you can even hear small conversations between soldiers. These small things really immerse you, and make you feel like you are part of an Action movie.
<br>
<br>Voice Acting in the game is top notch and narration is done by Hollywood Actor, Alec Baldwin. You can hear him telling the story while the game loads a new level in the background. Meanwhile, you look at series of different pictures that show location of current objectives. Just like everything else, soundtracks in the game are beautiful and memorable. Sound effects could use a bit more punch in some scenes but other than that everything in this game is beautifully crafted.
<br>
<br>Verdict:
<br>World in Conflict is a Masterpiece and one of the greatest games ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-in-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=5460138">Expand</a></span>
