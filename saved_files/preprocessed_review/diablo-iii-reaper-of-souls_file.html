                                        <span>Unfortunately I cannot recommend buying Diablo 3 : Reaper of Souls. Expansion adds very little to the game or endgame - its mainly just rifts and bounties. Legendary drop rates are abysmal and set item drops are almost nonexistent. Blizzard doesn&apos;t want its players to have fun, they want us to grind for months for a single upgrade. Game could have been great but sadly its unrewarding and shallow.</span>

Instead of putting the game back on path their brilliant idea was to add 1 weak character and limit trading. I purchased D3 specifically for the trading aspect of the game, it was what I enjoyed in the originals.</span>

The only notable additions this expansion brings are only the Crusader (which is kind of uninspired) and the new act, the rest of the content is very lackluster.
<br>
<br>The new Adventure Mode fails to provide a new alternative to the gameplay, because it is the ONLY game mode worth playing. Once you unlock Adventure Mode there&apos;s no point in playing Story Mode anymore, as all the new game mechanics are only available in Adventure Mode. It would be better if they had introduced new mechanics to both modes so players have more choices when it comes to playing the game.
<br>
<br>Mystic/Enchanting is a feature that was supposed to be in the original D3, but was apparently &quot;scrapped&quot; and then conveniently packaged into the expansion as a &quot;new&quot; feature. This makes one question the business ethics of Activision-Blizzard, what more content has been cut in order to be sold together with the future expansions as &quot;new&quot; features?
<br>
<br>Gambling (Blood shards) is a mechanic already found in D2 but was then somehow missing in the original D3, only to appear in this expansion as another &quot;new&quot; feature. Aside from that, it is currently considered a waste of time and effort to &quot;gamble&quot;, as the chances of getting legendaries  from gambling are extremely low, even after the latest hotfix.
<br>
<br>Speaking of legendaries, the new legendaries (not the re-revamped vanilla legendaries. Yes, RE-revamped.) are only a handful, and most of them are still as boring as the old ones, with boring stats and mods, no small part due to the still-broken itemization. Getting the ones you really want will now be an even arduous task, as you can no longer freely trade with others thanks to the Bind-on-Account system.
<br>
<br>Bounties and Rifts are new gameplay mechanics found in Adventure Mode, nothing remarkable about them. Bounties only provide you with specific target to kill for an reward and rifts only serve as a minor distraction from the mindless and monotonous grinding.
<br>
<br>However, if you insist on buying this game, I would recommend waiting for the price to drop before getting it. This game is NOT worth $40, do not continue to line Acti-Blizz&apos;s pockets by paying so much for so little.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4097506">Expand</a></span>

Already when playing through this expansion, even though the setting and graphics are kind of different, you find yourself not attacking the monsters and just walking past them because it&apos;s tiresome and just not that fun anymore. For this price tag I expect much more content, honestly unless you feel like you have to buy this, wait for the price to drop or give this one a miss! Last time I paid good money for a short expansion like this was for Half Life: Blue Shift, which was good but too short as well and the reviews made a point of that! It baffles me that RoS gets such good reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4087808">Expand</a></span>

In 2012 my cousin bought the game despite i told him not to do so (he was 14 y old at the time) and we were so frustrated by the errors and the game mechanics that I created an account  here and made a &quot;review&quot; (it was an inmature ranting that we posted in a childish yet funny brainstorm, which was the most fun he could get from that night). So, in an attempt to squeeze the fun from the original title, my now almost 16 years old cousin bought this &quot;expansion&quot; and invited me to test it just like last time. The result was obviously better than the original title, but not by far: the new class was interesting in concept, and at first it looked pretty awesome, but we couldnt get a hold of that feeling completely, as the skill system is awful, and we cannot customize him. Note that you could release the assasin from d2 itself, but you wouldnt get an awesome &quot;charachter&quot; feeling when you have no choice over the development of said &quot;charachter&quot;. It&apos;s not an ARPG its an AG. The lvl cap raise was something standard in Blizzard, and the loot offered in the previous patch, &quot;the loot 2.0&quot; wasnt even a feature of this &quot;expansion&quot;, except for the new items it brings, which is standard in &quot;expansions&quot;. So it only remains the new arc, which is not that bad at least not as far as we got (we got bored after an hour or so), but in my opinion it could be something out of a DLC rather than an &quot;expansion&quot;. So, you can get this for WHAT? 40 bucks?. Insane. You can get 10 lvls more, some more loot to grind, an average plotted but very long side quest, some runes and skills, and a new class, which seems pretty awesome, but suffers from the horrible game mechanichs making it completely boring after an hour of gameplay. That, my friends is a 10 bucks DLC for me, not an &quot;expansion&quot;. Blizzard should have looked at their first works. Those were some expansions, and at that time, expansions didnt have to include much more content beacuse of the games being shorter, yet they included far enough. So, the night ended on frustration again, and with my cousin being almost 16 years old, I couldnt get him to write a childish rant like last time, so this time we had not fun, and I am writing this rant alone and somewhat sad. Im also thinking about playing some Diablo 2 just for the nostalgia feeling, but I know if I do, I&apos;ll stay playing, because it is a fantastic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4086460">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Blizzard has demolished their goodwill.  If you think them &quot;fixing&quot; the game is enough to make things right, they only did so because they squeezed all the blood they could out of the auction house turnip.  This fix was the only way to maintain long-term profitability, and they withheld it until now.  The console version was awesome.  Regardless of what their awesome developers do, it&apos;s clear that ridiculously excessive corporate greed is baked into the company culture, and until now it&apos;s prevented the PC version from being on par with ancient consoles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4098077">Expand</a></span>

<br>After playing D3 under the new patch for a couple of hours, I realized that the same, fundamental problems persist: Mainly that the itemization is WoWified, and lacks the complexity and awesomeness that D2:LoD possessed. Basically, just get the highest DPS on any main hand weapon, and then fill your other slots with Main Stat + Health. Game play is still a predetermined mess: Monster fires at you from across the screen, you move to dodge, but alas, the hit was determined before the first animated bullet was fired.
<br>
<br>Total mess.
<br>
<br>Also: I love that the hundreds of 10s and 9s read like the same script, and are posted by people who have never posted before. I smell Blizzard&apos;s PR team at work here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4096295">Expand</a></span>

<br>Little bit too expensive considering how little content this expansion adds. Storyline seems to be little bit far fetched. If this would have been free DLC score would have been little bit better.
<br>At this moment Diablo 3 franchise is just another &quot;money cow&quot; for blizzard and quality suffers. Smooth launch is just frankly stupid argument to praise games when expansion or should i say DLC does not add anything new to genre.

<br>Most of us, undedicated blizzard fans, will be playing this for 20 hours most. It is clearly a money grab and I advice everyone not to buy for this price. It is a rip-off with so many other options arounds. DO NOT BUY unless you feel the need to get frustrated. Wait for a more sensible price..

Get something with a real play value for your money like Banished, Jazzpunk or even Path of Exile if you need the real Action RPG feeling.</span>

You pay 40 dollars for something most companies would call a DLC and charge 5 dollars for. This is just waste of money. There is still no itemization or character customization</span>

Expect to be grinding for literaly thousands of hours if you want good gear - and if you don&apos;t care about gear then there really is no reason what so ever to play Diablo 3 with or without RoS. The story is boring and predictable, the graphics are pre-2010... basically a lower then average ARPG with an insanely high price tag and nothing more.

To which are added the 50 already spent. Total: 80&#x20AC; to play, after two years, a decent version of the game! Never again Blizzard!!!</span>

<br>
<br>Everyone uses the same skills. All the items look the same. Content in the game is extremely repetitive.

                                        <span>Average ARPG at best. This is DLC disguised an expansion. It&apos;s a cash grab. That&apos;s pretty much all it is. Luckily I can review this having played at a friends and therefore saved &#xA3;32.99.
<br>
<br>Oh and people giving it extra points due to a &quot;smooth launch&quot; are ridiculous. Smooth launches should be standard practice.
<br>
<br>Oh how standards and expectations have slipped.</span>

Loot 2.0 is from the old game for those who seem to think its from the expansion. And the story line makes completely no sense at all, it completely breaks the whole game history/universe(if you know the universe)
<br>
<br>All in all im giving it a fair zero reasoning&apos;s are:
<br>New Act +1
<br>New character +1
<br>Adventure mode +1
<br>
<br>Loot the same as original just made lvl70(even same names used!) -1
<br>No graphical boosts at all -1
<br>Same completely stupid AI -1
<br>Story line now completely destroyed -1
<br>Zero replay-ability -1
<br>Calling it an expansion when its a DLC -1
<br>Price -1
<br>Cinematic are next to nothing at all -1
<br>
<br>5 being an average or starter score,  8 bad points, 3 good points equals a score of 0 unless my math is wrong.
<br>
<br>See 3 movies at the cinemas you will get far more enjoyment and 3 times more bang for buck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4089422">Expand</a></span>

<br>But still I feel like I have to at least voice my opinion on this. Okay let&apos;s go ahead:
<br>
<br>Good about RoS is, that they finally introduced a mode were you don&apos;t have to experience the sad excuse of a storyline. Even if you don&apos;t know the Diablo lore you probably think the story is annoying, obvious and feels like reading a really bad comic book. As a Diablo fan you will recognize many inconsistencies with previous games/books and the story is an insult and disgrace.
<br>
<br>The new adventure mode allows you do go whereever you want - great, but can someone please tell who the f*ck seriously thought that not being able to switch acts is good? I mean how BAD, just how goddamn bad of a designer do you have to be.
<br>
<br>Now on to the problems that STILL persists:
<br>
<br>The loot is one-dimensional, some people actually think that &quot;loot 2.0&quot; fixed it, but they will come back complaining when they hit the next upgrade wall. Again, the real problem is that loot is one-dimensional. More is always better, there are no interesting choices what piece of gear to use. This doesn&apos;t change just because the legendary items now have some gimmicky proc effects.
<br>
<br>As the itemization, the skill system also has 0 depth. Zero. You chose 6 skills and 6 runes and now 4 passive skills. Wow. Such choice. There is NO way to customize your build besides gear - which doesn&apos;t have the necessery depth to make up for this horrible excuse of a skill system. The reason point based skillsystems ARE more interesting is because having the same skills does not equal having the same playstyle. Think of a necromancer (there still isn&apos;t a summoning class in D3 - lol) that has an attack spell/support and his minions. Although people chose the exact same skills, in a point based system they can have a different focus - thus CUSTOMIZING a given build to their playstyle.
<br>
<br>Skill damage is dependend on you weapon damage and main attribute. This is one of the most r*etarded things ever designed, whoever did this - please leave the industry for good. I mean seriously, I don&apos;t know how but they managed to make the attributes even more shallow and boring than Diablo 2 - where at least you had to decide max block yes/no etc.
<br>
<br>Blizzard, why have you forsaken us? I refuse to believe that catering to a wider, more casual audience means you have to leave the fans of the prequels in the rain. You could have made a real Diablo 3 and the casual people would have still played through it one or two times and would have had a blast and the Diablo2 vets would have had a true successor for the next 10 years.
<br>
<br>All in all 4/10 - below average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4079213">Expand</a></span>

<br>* Itemization is still problematic. Yes, you can more easily find loot suited for your character due to &quot;smarter&quot; drops. Yet, since there are no customizable stats, you still want the same old stats on each and every item. Vit, main stat, crit chance... It made the looting boring as hell before and it still does. No change here. It&apos;s still just an up the numbers game with very little thought required. I tried out Loot 2.0 extensively before the expansion hit and although they did rework the legendaries, they still do not provide build opportunities. Either they now have some sort of silly and barely significant proc effect or just add to the numbers. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part, switching legendaries is not drastically going to alter your playstyle.
<br>* Still very little character customization. The mystic artisan now offers transmogrification, which is a plus, but the real character customization should be in your choice of skills. More skills are viable now,  but play out the same. The paragon system is also a lame, tacked-on quick fix for an actual stat allocation scheme. It&apos;s like admitting you were wrong not to include it, yet nevertheless not fixing it either.
<br>* Dps is still completely derived of your weapon damage which is retarded, since it can make you run around with weapons that your class should never be using and make you look moronic.
<br>
<br>This is all due to inital game design and will most likely never be fixed. Otherwise, they would have done it by now.
<br>Lastly, and this may be personal, but the price is way too high for an expansion, especially one of which half it&apos;s content should&apos;ve been patched in free (adventure mode). Sorry, but 40 euros for a 3 hour act and one new class ? That&apos;s just a blatant rip off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4102621">Expand</a></span>

Games like Torchlight 2, by some of the *people* who made Diablo 2, is an intelligent refinement of the old skill system, whereas DIII just plain scraps it and caters to the people who don&apos;t like having to make meaningful choices.
<br>
<br>The patch priming DIII for the RoS, Loot 2.0, also introduces one-to-one level scaling, which goes further to remove the RP from the ARPG by all but demolishing the feeling of progress - before hitting the level cap, anyway.  You only begin to scale away from your foes when you tack on &quot;Paragon Level&quot; bonuses, and this system was a bit of nonsense that was thrown together ad hoc after DIII when it became clear to them that people were hitting 60 and the game had no replay value, so they had to tack on some extra grind instead.
<br>
<br>Loot 2.0&apos;s only nice change, in my opinion, is that Legendary items are actually good and have unique effects, though it&apos;s astounding that they didn&apos;t on release.  Other than that, Loot 2.0 came with a ton of buffs that, frankly, look like a bribe for easily-distracted people to come back than a fine tuning of a big-budget game that&apos;s been out for years.
<br>
<br>The whole premise of adventure mode is that - in Kevin Martens, Lead Content Designer&apos;s own words - it can be &quot;onerous&quot; to play through the campaign more than once.  Yes, the DIII campaign, acts I-IV, actually is that bad, I agree.  No, you don&apos;t get $40 for helping the player unlock a way out of that.

<br>The other thing about Adventure Mode is that, with replayability of vanilla DIII being effectively zero after you have one of each class, the only reason anyone would play more is if some novel random stuff happens occasionally.  I&apos;m willing to speculate that they&apos;re at least considering using Adventure Mode as a gateway for tons of DLCs as they go forward - now that the RMAH microtransaction ship has sunk, but not before taking the good faith of millions of former fans with it.  Now that they can&apos;t get a cut, they account-bind anything you&apos;d want to trade anyway.  They&apos;re taking their ball and going home.
<br>
<br>But anyway, the engine is smooth enough (when the servers and your ISP are working well, anyway).  If it weren&apos;t online-only, this game would be a 6, and a reasonable bargain bin pickup.  It works ok as just another AAA ball of shiny stuff with horrible plot tied to a stick they use to beat you in the face.  It just isn&apos;t in any way, shape, or form what a Diablo II fan would have wanted from Diablo III.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, if you liked Diablo III already, and you just wanted your dude to get buffs, that totally happened.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Just rush through Act V on Normal and unlock Adventure Mode while you still can.  I&apos;m guessing all kinds of madness will ensue in the coming months in the name of &quot;pvp balance&quot;, but that&apos;s not going to be my problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4078986">Expand</a></span>

Bad story, bad voice acting, bad graphics, bad map design, cinematic looks good but story in it is bad (Dragon Ball Z), bad gameplay. This game is made for children. Do not buy if you are older than 12.</span>

<br>Also, its just a 4 hours added act. I mean, come on. It could be REALLY a fee added content to improve or &quot;redeem&quot; the fail D3 was. I have seen fan-made mods with more content. But, in fact, Blizzard wants charge you 40$/&#x20AC;, that means, 10$/&#x20AC; per hour of gameplay, not fixing the original game big fails, like awful drop, extreme grindfest mechanics wich push u to repeat same act once and again, no point on raiding bosses....
<br>
<br>As said, a little extra more of the same, at the prize of 10$/&#x20AC; per hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4080921">Expand</a></span>

Still has untapped potential that will never be realized, and still....everyone praising the game will abandon ship in a few weeks.</span>

<br>They copied a ton of things from Path of Exile (enchanting items, rifts, legendary potions), but that&apos;s good, because Path of Exile has smarter developers and better game mechanics. Reaper of Souls is however much more polished and overall feels a bit better to play. The money they put into developing the game has to show somewhere.
<br>
<br>Talking about money, the addon was also way too expensive at launch (40$), but now that it&apos;s down by 50% it&apos;s a good buy. Blizzard are still greedy **** but at least they improved the game, even though the ideas weren&apos;t their own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4091383">Expand</a></span>

Every legendary are bind on account, if you die you can jump right back into action, magnet potion for kids who doesn&apos;t like to loot and you are forced to loot white item to scrap them with the same sized inventory. This game is sooo boring, they did not even upgrade  pvp. This game is made for pre teenager and it is now a grind fest to get nothing at the end because everything you do or find is bind on account and they didn&apos;t fix any mess in d3. They insulted all of us by saying only 2% didn&apos;t like Diablo3 I&apos;m sorry but 70% didn&apos;t like it at all and they need to admit they are incapable to listen what people really want. Removing AH is the only thing this expansion has to offer and 4 hours of gameplay for 40$. ZERO ZERO ZERO is my score on a scale of 100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4079831">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Starting off: THIS IS NOT DIABLO 2, IT WILL NEVER BE DIABLO 2. 100% of the negative reviews are by people who are holding a grudge and would never have been happy regardless of what the game was.
<br>
<br>After the debacle that was the D3 release, I feel its important to give Blizzard proper credit for a painless and seamless expansion release. No lag, no disconnects, no waiting in lines, no logging off, no problems...zero.
<br>
<br>The introduction of loot 2.0 revitalized the game, and better rewards play, without feeling too easy. Finding groups of people to play with is simple, fun and let&apos;s the player set an appropriate difficulty without being the impossible wall that was old D3 Inferno. Adventure mode adds a new element of randomness that solves the issue of having to run the same stuff over and over again (Baal runs anyone?)
<br>
<br>The removal of the RMAH feels like they removed a cinder block off everyone&apos;s shoulders and was long overdue. Most items / gems / crafting mats are now account bound though, preventing from trading or selling. But you can trade legendary drops with group members for up to 2 hours (similar to WoW LFR)
<br>
<br>To address the &quot;lack of character building&quot;. The introduction of the new legendarily items allows for players to create unique and entirely new builds / play-styles based solely upon the gear you have (Deal more damage while moving, increase pet damage) . Pretty much any skill set you end up choosing can be successful, which allows for greater freedom and the ability to try everything without feeling locked into a &quot;Best build&quot;.
<br>
<br>Act V is about the length of Act II depending on difficulty and player skill (A little under 3 hours on Inferno I in a group of four). Overall the environments seem new and fresh, along with the numerous new enemy types with cool abilities they added.
<br>The price is the standard 30 dollar expansion, this hasn&apos;t changed for years yet people still somehow find a way to complain about the price.
<br>
<br>Overall some decent improvements, Blizzard has already announced the introduction of ladders in the next major content patch, and down the line we should look forward to hopefully more positive additions. If you hated D3 and are still angry at Blizzard, chances are you&apos;ll feel the same way about ROS.
<br>
<br>TL;DR I&apos;d give the game a solid 8 / 10, worth picking up for a fun monster smashing experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4079860">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The skills and loot system have received minor overhauls, and they added some decent end game content. The Crusader is a great class to play, and quite similar to the Paladin from D2. The mystic is also a really nice addition.
<br>
<br>PVP is still terrible, there are no ladders, runes/runewords, charms, quick weapon swapping, you still can&apos;t teleport or leap properly, the story is still less than mediocre, the narratives are still dull/clich&#xE9;d/corny at best, only 4 players max in a game rather than 8, the graphics are still subpar with oversaturated colours, and finally, there&apos;s still no playable Necromancer (seriously, I miss my necro so bad...)
<br>
<br>Time will tell if they manage to get the game up to par, but I think there&apos;s still a TON of work to be done with it...which is sad, considering D2:LoD was released in 2001.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, I&apos;m having way more fun playing D3 now compared to pre-2.0.1, so I look forward to the future improvements and expansions. You&apos;ve still got work to do, Blizzard.. but you&apos;re on the right path.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4081014">Expand</a></span>

A game that could&apos;ve went down in history as the most anticipated and gratifying ARpg, went down as one of the biggest flops in gaming history.  But after the release of the Loot 2.0 and the expansion, the game is now what diablo 3 is all about. Epic loot and this crusader......hooooooooooly s***.  I played for an hour last night and DUUUUUDE, this hero does some cataclysmic damage.  Sweeping his weapon, obliterating everything in his path.  When i say obliterating i MEAN OBLITERATING, sending demons flying off the screen.  I&apos;m not trying to sugarcoat this expansion.  Just play the new class for 10 minutes and you&apos;ll be satisfied.  Send your champion to act 5 and you&apos;ll be satisfied.  Retrieve a new legendary from loot 2.0 and you&apos;ll be satisfied.  If you haven&apos;t played the game since 2.0 or have yet to play reaper of souls and are still complaining about vanilla diablo and it&apos;s broken promises, get the expansion and put yourself at ease.  These guys did a bangup job.  Sure there are still things that need to be changed in my opinion like the BOA legendaries, but they&apos;ve been listening to our gripes and complaints and they&apos;ve done a complete overhaul on the game.  Don&apos;t give up on diablo 3.  Give this expansion a shot.  It&apos;s welllllll, WELL worth your time and hard earned cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4079355">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played the expansion as soon as it was available last night. I had NO problems whatsoever to enjoy the new content and from my experience servers were very stable (EU).
<br>*Content:
<br>I was also hesitant at first that you &quot;only get a new act and class&quot; to play for a full priced expansion. However, I was positively surprised that the content of Act V is as big as Acts I-III combined. There are A LOT of dungeons - the randomization is a big part of this expansion. I also have to mention that the new soundtrack and overall feel are just amazing! Sitting in the dark, fighting through hordes of monsters accompanied by this amazing dark soundtrack...I just love it.
<br>*The Crusader:
<br>A very nice new addition to the character pool of Diablo 3. He is a lot of fun to play and adds new diversity to the game. In addition with Loot 2.0 you do not get bored leveling this hero in the Diablo 3 base game.
<br>*New Game Modes:
<br>Enough to keep most people occupied for a long time while providing an additional layer of diversity to the game.
<br>I only have to criticize that there is not really an end game for &quot;hardcore&quot; fans yet. Keep in mind that Blizzard has a great reputation in supporting their games for a long time. Take patch 2.0 as an indicator the dedicated support of the dev team. As a fan of the series since Diablo 2 I can finally say that the game is what it should have been during the launch of the base game. If you like the base game do not hesitate to buy the expansion or even give it another try. If you think it is overpriced, wait a few weeks or months until the retail price drops and have fun with the patch 2.0 content :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4079358">Expand</a></span>

When the original Diablo 3 released, I was quite disappointed. The graphics were great, sure, and the game interest sustained for a long time. Eventually, however, I became frustrated with good gear that never dropped, constant reliance on an inflated auction house, limited difficultly levels and a campaign that became achingly repetitive quickly.
<br>
<br>Reaper of Souls fixes virtually every issue I had with the original and has me hooked and raring to go for many, many hours.
<br>
<br>1) Loot 2.0
<br>
<br>There are now dynamic drops with neat affixes and class appropriate stats. I get a new legendary every few hours and I feel like I am being rewarded for my time
<br>
<br>2) Adventure mode and rifts
<br>
<br>You can jump around acts and also do randomized dungeons, breaking all previous monotony
<br>
<br>3) Crusader class
<br>
<br>A beast new hero to play with many interesting abilities and a great look. Every time I swing my 2H flail I am happy I bought the game
<br>
<br>4) New artisan - the mystic
<br>
<br>You can reroll stats on your gear, even legendaries, to your heart&apos;s content
<br>
<br>5) Upgrading graphics
<br>
<br>There was a rebuild on the game and it looks better than ever
<br>
<br>6) GUI optimization
<br>
<br>The latest NVIDIA driver release, coupled with network optimization, means that even with four heroes on stage, unlimited mobs, and at 2560x1440 resolution, I can get a steady 60 fps all the time
<br>
<br>7) New Act V
<br>
<br>It is a bit short in terms of content for my taste, but, it looks great and there is so much to do. I am sure more content is on the way, but, honestly, I much prefer to just jump around in adventure mode!
<br>
<br>8) Clans
<br>
<br>I now have a group of all my good friends, we can see each other&apos;s games and group up quickly and enjoyably
<br>
<br>Things Blizzard didn&apos;t change or add: There were some ability tweaks, but there is not an open-ended system like in some other ARPGs like Path of Exile. If you like that, you will be disappointed. Personally, I am more simple-minded and find the choice in Diablo fine, but I understand the complaints. Also, the overall content hasn&apos;t changed much, although optimization has. With the new inferno levels though, and the new paragon system and points you earn (unlimited!!) for all your toons, I no longer feel constrained to not try new toons and jump around.
<br>
<br>Final Verdict: It&apos;s a brave new world in Diablo with no auction house, smart loot and finally clans to play with friends. I am having so much fun with my crusader. Many will have a bone to pick with Diablo 3, and, honestly, I don&apos;t blame them. That being said, I got probably 500-600 hours of gameplay out of the original Diablo 3, which at $60 came out to $0.10 an hour. If you just don&apos;t like Diablo 3 and can&apos;t find a way to enjoy or praise it no matter what Blizzard does, you will vote this game down.
<br>
<br>For everybody else, I STRONGLY suggest you come back and give things a try. No game is perfect, but I, objectively, believe this is a game I can now rate as a 10, versus the 6 or 7 I would have given the original Diablo. Hope to see you in game and good job Blizzard!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4080591">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, the removal of the auction house and the integration of loot 2.0 was a surprising and welcoming change. A few months after RoS had come out, I game the game another chance. Now, after quite a few updates, seasons, and more updates I can say this is a perfect casual ARPG. Perfect, 10/10. Why? Well..
<br>
<br>1. [Variety] From the unique effects of many legendaries and sets, to the endless combination of builds the game offers an extreme amount of replayabilityl especially with the introduction of the LoN set which gives bonus power for each legendary equipped. The LoN set allows any build of the player&apos;s creation to be significantly powerful. This set alone fixes build diversity, for the casual players. If you are compeitive there will always be a small subset of builds that perform best. But the majority of the player base is not competitive, so for the majority the diversity and variety is perfect.
<br>- [longevity] Seasons were added to keep the game fresh, and ancient items makes it even harder to perfect gear, but all the more satisfying. You will never have perfect gear and although your search for a late game upgrade may be in vain, the possibility of finding the perfect piece of gear will make the hunt feel good, always.
<br>-[hardcore mode] despite blizzard&apos;s tendency to give in to whining fans (WoW) Blizzard has kept hardcore mode true and has not ressurected any player&apos;s hardcore character no matter the reason (even famous streamers who suck up to them). Hardcore offers an entirely different experiences, with identical variety and even more rewarding feelings if you live to feel them. If you want to truly value your character, and truly experience risk, this game mode can provide endless entertainment, especially with friends. Being able to lose items makes them infinitely more precious.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Diablo 3 RoS is a game that can be played forever and that can be played effectively in every possible way (thanks to LoN set). Diablo 3 was not in this condition, not even close. I truly believe the expansion has perfected the game. If you are a competitive player, you will most likely have gripes with many aspects of the game, but for people who want to just slay some demons and have fun, this is the perfect game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=6398522">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Reaper of Souls solved many of the origina D3 problems, and dispite I bought, played and enjoyed it, I won&apos;t take away the bad taste D3 left two years before. An initial 60&#x20AC; and a 40&#x20AC; expansion is way over-priced, so if your whiling to buy it, don spend more than 35&#x20AC; for both.
<br>
<br>Seriously, you&apos;ll enjoy the game, but it doesn&apos;t cost that much.</span>

<br>
<br>Secondly the game has become that of a single play style. Grind what is called rifts. Rift when you login, Rift the entire time you are logged in, and then start doing it again when you come back. That is all the game is now. The devs have successfully destroyed all reason to go out into the world of Sanctuary and explore it. Where in the vanilla game you would wander around and grind levels and look for loot or even devise your own runs it is not the case now.
<br>
<br>Next is that Set gear is the only gear. Before RoS came out you would often see people wearing rare items even and able to play in max difficulty with quality rolled ones. Now rares and legendaries are both junk. You have Ancient quality legendaries which are a must for any item slot you have a legendary in and all of your body armor has to be your Class Set gear and ancient quality not just normal set.
<br>
<br>What I am saying through all this is the game is pretty much ruined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=6297636">Expand</a></span>

It is a competent ARPG game with some questionable systems put in place. My favorite part is when my single player game loses connection and I get to start at the beginning of whatever quest I was on. Loot 2.0 is understandable in the context of the horrific mess that Diablo 3 was although it leaves the game lacking when compared to the ARPG games. The king dethroned itself and with ROS Blizzard has tried to correct their wrongs but arguably the  largest detractor from people having fun with it has been left intact. Always online DRM is a self defeating concept that keeps otherwise paying customers far away. I really wanted to like this expansion as Blizzard really did try hard, but after playing it for 20+ hours I am left with regret that I funded this always on shenanigan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4203631">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a Diablo fan since the release of the original Diablo. I&apos;ve been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. I bought this game based on the opinions of fellow friends that seemed to have good taste in gaming. Many people praised it&apos;s incredible gameplay, awesome multiplayer action that would extend for days beyond it&apos;s release.
<br>
<br>When I first started, the plot seemed exactly what I wanted. The hero is almost immediately involved, checking out the damage done by the meteor that hit the hall. As the cutscene continued, the dialogue kept losing credibility, lots of gaps were made in the unholy plot and the writing was definitely written for a 5th grade audience. These were things I kind of expected. I read a few of the books after playing diablo 2 and they were good when I was a teenager. But this plot? Jesus, don&apos;t get me started. I actually spent a good while laughing at the crummy dialogue.
<br>
<br>Let me tell you this plot is pretty basic and extremely lackluster compared to the previous two. I beat the game, not once was I hooked or compelled by the story. I don&apos;t know how they managed to write such a mediocre plot within YEARS of development. This game is f*cking atrocious in far more aspects than just story, however.
<br>
<br>Lets list the problems with the gameplay. First, the skill tree doesn&apos;t really require you to know what synergy is. It&apos;s practically non-existent. When I first started playing, the visuals were pretty astonishing, but that&apos;s not saying much. It looks like WoW that takes place in a graveyard/hell/whatever halloween-related **** setting. It wasn&apos;t even mildly horrific. So, then you go on to complete somewhat mundane quests, following the path that blizzard set out for you. The plot line is linear, but even MORE linear than the second! You literally have a check list of things they want you to do and procedurally go through them mindlessly. Normally, I can dig it. It&apos;s just the story left such a **** taste in my mouth that I got bored by the third act! I decided to push further, just to beat the game to give a holistic response to this game.
<br>
<br>Also.. The BUTCHER? In DIABLO 3? A reused character? Laughable. At least the bosses in D2 were unique and interesting (not to mention, characterized to the setting..)
<br>
<br>Items... Let&apos;s look at how uncharacterized the items are. Everything boils down to Damage, toughness, healing. This is the naive approach. However, it does delve deeper than that. What&apos;s with the ridiculous stat increases? It&apos;s unnecessary and makes it slightly harder to estimate. Loot is pointless. There&apos;s no dynamic character building because your character gets all the f*cking skills. What&apos;s the point? I hardly want to perfect ONE character, much less several different characters that have unique attributes (BECAUSE YOU CAN&apos;T).
<br>
<br>No chatrooms. Awesome. One of the most memorable things about Diablo/Starcraft is gone. How did this sound like a good idea? Just make it an option for people who want it.
<br>
<br>No making games with actual NAMES to join. Another non-intuitive thing blizzard made by REMOVING features. When is removing features a feasible options to improve a game? It&apos;s almost comical.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know if I covered everything about this game that I dislike. I think I threw in a few redeeming qualities but it wasn&apos;t much.
<br>
<br>Bottom line is, I don&apos;t give two sh*ts whether or not your servers work the first time I log in or not if the gameplay is horrid. The fact people are rating this game on that is absolutely absurd to me.
<br>
<br>Also, Blizzard fanboys are blinded to crappy games. Not my problem anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4501714">Expand</a></span>

Cue the announcement of the expansion with the promise of better loot and story, and that snagged my interest. A few friends decided to get back in, and gifted me the expansion. I waited for patch 2.1 so I could give a fair review.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+A little better loot
<br>+Ever so slightly better dialogue
<br>+More content with a darker feel
<br>+Better music
<br>+DHs are now a viable class
<br>+Crusader is fun to play
<br>+Point system to buff your toon
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Most legendary items are still trash
<br>-No character balance.
<br>-1 viable/good build per class, with the exception of the Crusader and possibly WD which has 2
<br>-Trading restricted to party members for ~2 hours. Bind on Account after that.
<br>-Rifts, but especially bounties, are grind fests
<br>-Gambling with Kadala and low shard capacity with increased prices is the antithesis of fun
<br>-PVP is still lacking
<br>-Lacking social and clan features
<br>
<br>Sadly, little has changed from the vanilla. The story and dialogue is still terrible and directly lifted from a self-insert, Mary Sue/Gary Stu-rampant fanfic written by an especially grammatically challenged 10-year-old (apologies to all the decent 10-year-old writers out there). Equally terrible is the class balance which is non-existent, and you&apos;re limited to fire DH, Wand of Woh wiz, pet WD, shotgun Crusader and occasionally the barb to feel like you&apos;re progressing (which is, by the way, RNG stacked on top of RNG). Monks have been totally screwed in this regard, and have been for a while so I&apos;m told.
<br>
<br>The itemization is atrocious, and the worst I&apos;ve ever encountered. Any item that isn&apos;t trash is instantly best in slot--but good luck trying to find it, let alone get lucky enough to re-roll a stat that&apos;s good enough without spending all your money and gems. Main stat, CC, CD, and IAS (with socket+ emerald) are still mandatory, but now the expac (DLC?) adds bonus elemental damage, which fire is almost always superior. Sure, they added a few legendary gems, but nearly everyone has the same build in the end. It&apos;s mind-boggling to have this complaint go on for 2+ years with hundreds of great suggestions for build diversity that get ignored!
<br>
<br>Perhaps worse, there&apos;s extremely limited trading, PVP, and poorly functional clan features. Yes, the AH was bad, but why not implement tier-based trading? I&apos;d love to trade with more than three friends at a time, but can&apos;t. I want to do PVP but no one goes there because the M5/M6 DH is ridiculously unfair that no melee class can compete. Rift it Forward kind of helped with sociability, but was removed. The clan features...you&apos;ll probably have to see it to believe or understand it, but let&apos;s just say the chatting/messaging interface is clunky/poorly organized and you need other programs like Skype to make it sociable.
<br>
<br>The development team is disorganized and apparently has no idea how to listen to customers, so it churned out this disaster of a game. Most of the people on my friends list quit months ago or shortly after the patch hit. Unless they can fix/improve the game greatly, I won&apos;t be buying the next expac/DLC</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4628484">Expand</a></span>

So please bear with me. I put over 1000 hours into the game and I have a few level 70 chars with good gears.
<br>
<br>First of all, I am not into the storylines so I will not rate the stories, its the same old thing pretty much and since I am a hardcore RTSer, I don&apos;t care about the stories.
<br>
<br>Next, The game play is nothing new, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s better than D2. They had some good idea of the combo moves but in the end, everything was back to spamming or hitting 2 buttons all the time. BORING and HURT your fingers and keyboard.
<br>
<br>Next, the balance is non-existence. You got Witch doctor owning everything before the 2.1 and now Demon hunter just owning everything. Monk has been a joke and I was main a monk most of the time so I was pretty disappointed. I feel that I was playing a game designed by 5 years old. At a point, monk was so bad that people say the followers are better than monks. Since then blizzard tries to bring it back to the level of other classes, like buffing some of the set bonus dmg to 5000%.. but still not doing enough. What a joke.
<br>
<br>Next, gear farming is frustrating, its all about luck. If you are lucky, you might not be able to get the drop .. thanks to the amazing no-trade environment. Once a time I had 4 of the same chest set pieces but I can not trade them for other part of the set. So if you cant get the drop, bad luck man. whats the logic behind that?
<br>
<br>Not to mention, gear/build diversity does not exist in this game. Blizzard said the new skill system is amazing and all, it&apos;s all lies. There is one build for each class for the end game and everyone is wearing the same gears. Pretty much everything they said was a lie in this game. No gear diversity. no build diversity. no pvp. no balance. no trading. no fun. gg
<br>
<br>I really regret that i wasted 2 years of precise time into the game. I used to play every game they produced but I will not do that any more. Diablo is dead and so is blizzard in that regard. avoid wasting your time and do something useful for your time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4560035">Expand</a></span>

I know there&apos;s some 10/10 reviews for this but maybe we&apos;re playing different games. I don&apos;t know where to even begin with this disgusting disaster of a sequel. This game simply spits on everything that made Diablo what it is today.
<br>
<br>This game is done and there&apos;s no amount of patching that will fix it.
<br>
<br>The Story - The story is an absolute freaking joke. You&apos;re forced through long cut scenes, bad voice acting and a story that a child can predict. The story needs to be re-written.
<br>
<br>Patches - How on Earth does it take the D3 team so long to implement the patches that they do? Is there just one guy working on the developmental side of this game or something?
<br>
<br>Acts - Acts 1-4 in my opinion are just absolutely dreadful. I can&apos;t stand Act 2 with a burning passion, I&apos;m meh when it comes to Act 1, I hate the spider queen part of Act 3 where you&apos;re running up and down spirals forever and Act 4 was way too short.
<br>
<br>Itemization - Piss poorly implemented. There&apos;s a severe lack of itemization options which means people are just doing the exact same thing over and over hoping for best in slot gear. There&apos;s no other options.. you have your BiS and that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>After Leveling - Uhh.. you do rifts? When it comes to figuring out what to do, you can either do rifts or bounties. Bounties get incredibly old after a short amount of time doing them (there&apos;s not many of them) and rifts are about the most exciting feature they have in this game. They&apos;re portals that take you to random events where random monsters spawn.
<br>
<br>DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
<br>
<br>Just save your money. The story, the acts, the itemization, the bland skill trees are absolutely horrible. When they first previewed this game years ago, the game had so much promise and hope. It looked absolutely amazing. The PvP system looked great, the crafting system looked solid but then they cut most of it out so they could rush a product out for quick sales.
<br>
<br>What has happened to this company? What happened to the company that would make sure something was 100% polished before launching it instead of just cutting features to rush a quick product out?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849779">Expand</a></span>
