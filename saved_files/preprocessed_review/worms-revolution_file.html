<br>
<br>cons:
<br>
<br>1. the AI is as dumb as its ever been. its chock loaded full of crack shot aiming ability able to make any impossible shot using the 10 or fewer weapons it knows how to use. i think the only new weapon the AI knows how to use is the blow torch but it sucks at doing that.
<br>2. the narrator in campaign....is just bad. he tries way too hard. the only narrating this series has done successfully is the Me-Me voice over in worms 4 mayhem.
<br>3. campaign mode.....is bad because of the aforementioned reasons of AI and narrator. it doesnt help you are always outnumbered by the AIs uncanny ability to hit impossible shots is amazing.
<br>4. the wind meter indicator appears to have been dumbed down. it used in past games be a MPH meter but now its a 0-3 bars. i guess MPH was too complicated for casuals?
<br>5. cant have more than 1 team
<br>6. instead of a few hundred soundbanks like past games i think there were 20 maybe 30
<br>7. customization of worm clothing remains inferior to worms 4 mayhem.
<br>8. frame rate and lag....holy hell. its a shame team 17 has only produced one frame rate less game in the worms series in the past 12 years....that being worms armageddon.
<br>9. the music is a horrible step backwards. songs are literally 5 second midi loops.
<br>10. several weapons have gotten worse. the homing missile just does not work now. the rope cannot seem to even equal the rope in armageddon.
<br>11. the AI again....will take awhile to do a move....to sometimes only end up skipping its turn yet the AI will sit there for 30 seconds only to skip its turn. other times it just gets stuck. this is what happens when  you use the same AI algorithm since worms 1 in the 90s. literally the AI hasnt changed except its now more glitchy and perhaps worse. i think they gave it better crackshot ability which isnt an improvement is cheesy difficulty
<br>12.  too much more to list. though i will add the game has savedata issues and crashed in the first 10 minutes cause the narrator got stuck on a loop.
<br>
<br>pros:
<br>its worms
<br>its not expensive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285661">Expand</a></span>

THE GOOD: There are some really nice additions to the gameplay: dynamic water, physics, worm classes and some new weapons. The single player campaign is also very lengthy, having a deathmatch branch and a puzzle branch, each one with more than 30 missions. The online multiplayer is where the real fun is, obviously. There are three modes: Deathmatch (all vs. all or in teams), Forts (team 1 vs. team 2, each one in its own fort), and Classic (No worm classes, no dynamic water, no physics... for the worm series purists). THE BAD: The level editor is atrocious. It&apos;s completely worthless and it doesn&apos;t really let you do anything good. The game has some bugs. For some people, the game doesn&apos;t even start. For others, worms suddenly become invisible. There have been other minor bugs reported, as well, but mentioning all of them here is impossible. There&apos;s a lot of content lacking from Armaggedon. Why? No one knows. There&apos;s really no logical explanation as to why they would cut content out from older games in a newer game. The performance is also quite bad. The game feels laggy and sluggish. Finally, there&apos;s only 4 landscape themes, and eventhough there&apos;s gonna be 3 more coming in form of DLCs in the next months, it still is a bit boring. OVERALL: This game is overall really solid and fun. The worms spirit is intact and if you like the series, you&apos;ll have a blast with this, AS LONG AS you don&apos;t run into any bugs and can run the game okay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2689200">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1) Worms should put control, responsiveness, and gameplay at the forefront. What this means is ninja ropes that are powerful, predictable movement on terrain, predictable shooting past terrain. Half the time your turn fails, it is because of something not working, such as your ninja  rope hitting an invisible pixel or just deactivating for no reason. In worms iteration 700, this is just shameful. The ninja rope is pitiful compared to Armageddon. 2) You can no longer use weapons while on ninja ropes and jetpacks. Why would they nerf this? So, you can&apos;t jet in, drop dynamite, fly away with low fuel, nor with ninja ropes. Those are the cunning stunts that made worms fun. This makes the game feel casual and the player underpowered. If there are, say, 4 worms on a plateau, you have to get there, drop dynamite and then run away. No where to run? Fine, wait to die. Why team17?
<br>
<br>3) There is a 5 sec wait time before AI plays every time, not including their thinking time. I imagine this time is for human players to prepare for their turn. Why for AI though? It is thorough frustrating and adds time to, and staggers a game. There are many more small details like these. In essence this feels lazy to me. Ok, so Matt Berry is fantastic, the graphics are ok, the physics engine is **** And gameplay was not focused on, or maybe it was intentionally nerfed for a more casual player. How can you get a more casual worms player? I don&apos;t know, but they&apos;ve managed to make it feel like something unpolished. Gameplay is much worse than Arg, responsiveness and control are worse than Worms 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2695789">Expand</a></span>

Specially at the beginning, when your aim is bad, it&apos;s so funny! Me and my friends had a short period, where each turn, everyone was just suiciding :D Multiplayer is nice, but unfortunately the server is not full with people all the time. I love the graphics of this game, the worms models and animations and the maps. The things that I think should have been improved are the number of worms (still 4 worms is the maximum) and the sounds (could have been made more differentiable). Also if your planning to buy this game, you should consider buying the DLCs as well, as they add very important (imo) stuff, as weapons + maps (mars one is my fav.) and of course single player missions. All in all, great game, and def. will play this one instead of armageddon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2695088">Expand</a></span>

After a disastrous Reloaded, we now get Revolution which is a shy step forward but, overall, a needless entry in the long line of  Worms games that don&apos;t live up to their 10 years old predecessors. So what&apos;s wrong with Revolution? Well, once you get over the shiny new graphics, it gets down to pretty much everything! Before I start listing, let&apos;s get one thing straight: this game DOES NOT feature a brand new game engine as developers want you to believe! Instead, it&apos;s just heavily modified Reloaded. With that said, let&apos;s get down to business... Once again, you can have only 4 worms per team and the customization is rather obscure (terrain editor, for one, is BY FAR inferior to the one in Armageddon/WP). Once you&apos;re through with the boring (and occasionally confusing) menus and start the game, you&apos;ll get overwhelmed by unresponsive and laggy controls and a frame-rate to match. Although some weapon physics are improved over Reloaded, there are certain essential items which appear unruly and glitchy. Ninja rope is nowhere near as useful as it was in Armageddon/WP and, most of the time, it just deactivates for no reason. This, along with a nerfed jet pack, makes traveling the distance a true mission: impossible - a feat faithfully carried over from Reloaded. There are some innovations such as troops customization (you can have a fat worm, slow but strong, a little guy, fast but weak, a brainiac...) but it doesn&apos;t matter since these come in a form of a modern gaming plague that some people refer to as DLC. However, since it&apos;s pretty clear that a real worms fan won&apos;t even dignify this game with a second look, the DLC might as well be non-existent (hee, hee, hee). To make a long story short, this is a game for those under the age of 9 and the ones who can&apos;t play proper worms (and by &apos;proper&apos; I mean the &apos;bonus&apos; content which is Worms: Armageddon, by all means superior version to this pathetic latest installment). Of course, 10s are awarded by the ones who are paid to do so and imbeciles, whose opinion is ,therefore, irrelevant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696636">Expand</a></span>

Online multiplayer mode: no-one is ever on-line. This game is dead. DO NOT BUY! Remember, no refunds.</span>

<br>
<br>Contrary to what other people have written here you CAN drop weapons from jetpacks and ninja ropes. Maybe they&apos;ve patched it in. You CAN also create separate teams for separate players. But the game still lacks all the fun from previous installments. It&apos;s slow and sluggish, feels like everything is moving in some semi slow-motion. It&apos;s harder to aim properly in this one compared to previous games. Ninja rope and jet packs feel very weird and hard to control properly.
<br>
<br>The implementation of water feels very unnecessary. I though you could drown opponents worms with water gun or water bombs. And you can immerse them in water if they are in a hole, but it barely hurts them at all. They can easily get out from there, or stay in the water fighting like nothing happened only loosing 5 health per turn. If you want to drown the worms you have to throw them into the water on the sides or bottom.
<br>
<br>This feels like a very unpolished game. The core gameplay is crippled, and no fancy hairstyles and moustaches in the world can save this from being plain boring. If you like Worms, buy the previous versions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881044">Expand</a></span>

I feel people are being too harsh for what it is; and inexpensive game you can play with friends.

Later I purchased it in 2004. And oh. I was so happy. The graphics are plain 2D That is how this game is meant to be. The Game was smooth. Fast and Fun. Then came Worms 3D (or reloaded I am not sure which came first so ill talk about 3d) The game was well.. A disaster.. There was no proper way to hit the worms because they tried to make it all so good with the 3d effect came the price of accuracy.. Hated it.. Then Worms reloaded was decent but Since worms world party.. All the series really went downhill.. Then came this ( Just talking about the ones I purchased) This.. Was the worst way to spend my money.. Having an AMD 8850M 2gb DDR5 Processor which plays Battlefield 4 in High with 40 FPS. This game says memory problem.. Well that fixed in the update.. Anyway.. the game play I felt was glitch y.. The announcer or the narrator was trying to be funny.. The worms look weird now. And unnecessary background of rats and all.. The camping cannot be done without the training. The training was so terribly boring that I actually slept off on my table while doing the third mission.. the Puzzle challenge is what 5 year old kids games have as challenge. I liked the types of new worms.. BUt they completely ruined the game.. The weapons have been terribly changed for their damage. And the maps are unnecessarily mixed up all together. I understand that obstacles make good challenge for the map.. But it is too much. I recommend everyone to try out Worms world party. yes the one from 2001. You will be amazed..!
<br>This is really like how 2006 company of heroes had a better gameplay than 2013 Company of heroes 2.
<br>
<br>definitely not worth the money.
<br>p.s whoever have flicking issues change the Graphic resolution slightly and run as administrator.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/worms-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=4859299">Expand</a></span>

Also, these jocular worms are gradually crawling towards and penetrating through a laugh-free zone. Worms Clan Wars is a little better than this, but it still is not as good.</span>

Single player is easy since the bots are dumb as dirt, but players are more challenging. Again, you NEED friends or else you don&apos;t get the full experience. Other than that the game is very fun.</span>
