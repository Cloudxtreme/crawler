The SP is action-packed but short, with only 5 hrs of gameplay. You are in the War in Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban forces in actual operations that took place in 2001-2005. You are a Tier 1 Operator, a unique brand of soldiers who are sent into the most intense action. You&apos;ll go from stealthy sniping missions, to full out warfare and cave raids. The game delivers its best in its multiplayer. In this MP, you actually require a bit of skill to do well. You can&apos;t just run in and start shooting everything like in CoD. You&apos;ll be dead soon and will hate the game for it. The MP runs of an exp-based system where earning points awards you with new upgrades to your weapon such as sights and barrels and types of ammunition. There are a few maps out right now, but more will be out soon. Graphics and visuals can go from dull and average to absolutely stunning and attractive, depending on the mission. Audio is amazing. Voice acting is spot on, and music delivers a punch. Overall, this is a successful solid reboot of the series. If you need a break from the arcade style of recent first-person shooters, then go out and get yourself a copy of Medal of Honor (2010) for a more realistic take on gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389359">Expand</a></span>

Although tbh it is weak single player is short and not very difficult, and multiplayer is all right but it&apos;s like a weak Bad Company/COD4. But it feels more like being in a real war, than the others, only Arma capturess what it is like to be a soldier better.

The game is about realism. I hope Medal of Honor 2 (2012) will better and fixed the problems that we dont like. Thanks Danger Close &amp; EA.</span>

In the singleplayer, the enemies are extremely dumb, and the game has too many &apos;Target that enemy position with your laser designator Dante!&apos; and &apos;Target that enemy position with your laser designator Rabbit!&apos; moments. I&apos;m sure thats realistic in war nowadays, but if the game was meant to be realistic I guess pistols wouldn&apos;t have unlimited ammo and there would be no invisible walls.
<br>Multiplayer is fun... for a day. After you play through every map twice it simply ends up being a case of &apos;Oh its this map. Now, lets see, I go to this position, enemies will come through here...&apos; etc. It doesn&apos;t bring anything new to the table but DICE did a good job with the levelling up, which makes the multiplayer slightly compelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1703789">Expand</a></span>

<br>

<br>Overall though.. Hiighly recommended change from the norm. The first game i&apos;ve played right through in one sitting in a long time, and its kickstarted my PC gaming again I think, I&apos;d forgotten just how much better the PC is to the consoles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942678">Expand</a></span>

I felt that cold, every bump in that road... There was FAR more realism in this than anything CoD I have played.

First, the previews made it sound awesome, then initial reviews were terrible, then once people got over the price-shock, reviews started to improve. I picked this game up for $5, and didn&apos;t expect much, but I genuinely enjoyed it. The graphics are not the best (definitely not horrible though), and there were a few missions that absolutely pissed me off (one of the stealth missions), but once I decided to screw it and just kill everyone, it stopped being annoying. The campaign was fairly short (decent length for a shooter), but it was well done. This is definitely a story-driven FPS, and it pulls it off well. The ending was actually quite touching, and I absolutely loved how they dedicated the game to all the unsung heroes laying their lives on the line every day. Now that it&apos;s no longer $60, I recommend picking up a copy if you like shooters. I enjoyed it. Never tried multiplayer, but I hate the latest blend of kill-streak competitive multiplayer shooters anyway, so meh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2452902">Expand</a></span>

This game is entirely based on a Real Military Operation. The characters names are real, this is not a crappy game contredicting shooter originality (War) Games. It&apos;s been a very awesome campaign. The developpers are actually  going for Realism, since the first MOH. This game will keep being true stories forever. This is their goal. The action is bad? No. The action is Real. Call of duty is not real. Tired of hearing little stupid kids that doesn&apos;t know what is real war commenting that kind of thing. I am in the army and wait till you shoot a real guy in real life. Stop being stupid. Let&apos;s get back to the game content now, very good story (Real story). The gun sound are realistic for the most part. The music is beautiful (Heroes Abroad) Atleast. I think this is a great game, and cannot wait to play Medal of Honor: Warfighter. This game gets a 7/10 from me because of the realism, the emotion you get when playing the game, and also the campaign. Multiplayer has been terribad though. But this game wasn&apos;t goaled to be a good Multiplayer game. Go play Battlefield if it is what you want.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2199856">Expand</a></span>

If the devs really wanted to honor the troops so much, they really should have tried harder on this game, because all I see is lazy work.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just ridiculous little things like stationary models clipping through other objects. Example: a corpse was in a chair and its hands were clipping through the back of the chair. Plus, there are a ton of glitches, some of which made me reset my checkpoint because the game stopped working. I don&apos;t understand how such a short, linear game can be so unpolished and buggy. It just shows so much laziness.
<br>
<br>One of my biggest pet peeves is invisible walls, and they are everywhere in this game. I don&apos;t get why giving the player a little freedom scares these devs. If they wanted to make a movie they should have just done that instead of forcing me into their carefully scripted, planned out sequences. Games are about choice.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t complain about the length, though, because any longer and this game would have overstayed its welcome. I&apos;m glad it was short so I didn&apos;t have to trudge through any more of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3163499">Expand</a></span>

It suffers from some scripting issues, but nothing that will delude the experience on the first play through. The story is easier to follow and isn&apos;t as irrational as say MW2, so that was refreshing. About an average length of 6 hours.<br>The multi-player on the other hand is a bit rough around the edges. It&apos;s clear they have a solid idea, but the maps and weapons have a lot of balance issues that ultimately takes away from the experience. It needs a bit more refinement and customer feedback before being on the same level as a Call of Duty or  Battlefield game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1692726">Expand</a></span>

<br>They werent kidding.
<br>Graphics - Different
<br>Reloads - Different
<br>Animations - Different
<br>Sound effects - Different
<br>
<br>Even they way people move is different, the only trait multiplayer and singleplayer share is that its an FPS.
<br>Ranking on multiplayer is fairly average, you dont have an overall level. Instead you have 3 classes which can rank up to 15 levels, which essentially 45 levels.
<br>Very disapointing.
<br>But despite the many errors i still got many hours of fun fromthis game, its easily worth the $98 retail, i just hope that danger close do the multiplayer, should there be a sequel.

I cannot compare it to MW2 since I only played that for 10 seconds. However the MoH MP is really good fun. It&apos;s chaos, fast and merciless. The cramped maps just make it hard to camp for too long. Basically when you spawn you are 10 seconds away from firing your first shot unlike a long BC2 run back to the action. Be warned it is merciless. You&apos;ll spawn and run round a corner straight into a hail of bullets so you&apos;ll try it again and the same thing happens. At which point you decide to get that ****** so you go another way round and if you are lucky shoot him in the back of the head. Happy you have avenged yourself you then get shot in the back of the head by someone else or enjoy a RPG in the chops. Time to avenge and so it goes on and on. And that&apos;s MoH MP.<br><br>I love it. The maps look great. The Kabul streets map is just beautiful and severe fun being able to run in and out all of the buildings, climbs to the roofs or creep down the alleys behind the buildings. The team assualt maps (team deathmatch) are square so you can always get behind the enemy as they can to you so it&apos;s chaos and fast pased as the spawns move around the map.<br><br>The objective maps are a thing of beauty. There are 5 objectives per map you have to take in linear oder. Once you do an objective the map opens to the next stage and so it goes on until you take all 5 objectives. The key is its liners and its awesome. No running round behind these maps. You have to go straight up the middle. So this creates a bloodbath for the assualting team (on a forlorn hope charge) and a dig in for the defending team. But if the assualitng team reach the objective (blow up &apos;X&apos; etc) then onwards they go to the next objective. It&apos;s just brilliant fun. The action is crazy fast paced.<br><br>And then there&apos;s the gun sounds. Absolutely awesome in surround sound. The dying is amazing. If you have the earphones on and you get strafed the animation is realistic and the sounds of hitting the is just horrifying. Many many times I&apos;ve jumped and thought damn that&apos;s harsh that&apos;s almost real.<br><br>So I&apos;ve always been a MoH fan but you cannot really compare to the past WW2 version. I don&apos;t play CoD MP so cannot help you there. So I&apos;ll just end and say this is a merciless badass 100 mile an hour MP shooter.<br><br>And yep I&apos;ve pre-ordered Black-ops also. At this moment I think the two can co-exists. I&apos;m more interested in Black ops for the co-op.<br><br>So that&apos;s my view. But what do I know....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1399606">Expand</a></span>

Good enemy AI, good friendly AI, extreme adrenaline pumping excitement. Much better than Black Ops and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The problem is it&apos;s way too short. At 5 hours, this game literally leaves you craving for more. Still, well worth the price of admission.</span>

I found MoH to do what MW2 failed to do: provide a realistic simulation of being in combat without the sheer over-the-top feeling that left me frustrated with MW2. I can definitely understand how some of the game might not be that accessible to folks who don&apos;t have experience with the language, customs, tactics, etc... of the military; But I really appreciated that they got how Soldiers talk to each other correct, the on going struggle for air and UAV assets during a fight, and the interplay -- or lack there of --  between conventional forces and operators. Additionally, it was really interesting to see how they took real operations and built them into the game play...it almost felt like a first person documentary (with lots of liberties for story, weapon types and uniforms) of the first phases of the Afghan war. Read up a bit on Objective Rhino, Operation Anaconda, and the Abbas Ghar ridge line, then replay the Single Player (Paying special attention to knocking out the Shepherd) On top of that, the sounds and atmospherics where spot on, and the tactical interaction between the two AFO teams and within the teams themselves were well done. Somethings that could be better though: Some of the weapons felt a little off, especially in their physics. And I thought the AI kinda sucked at times...waves and waves of dudes just kept reappearing until you hop over a specific boulder, then nothing. Seriously, when three AQ fighters get shot in the head, the response is not for the remaining two to run straight down hill at your fighting position. Plus, the AI never really maneuvered at all, just went to their wrote positions and hung out. It did seem, however, that in most cases suppressive fire actually suppressed the enemy...keep shooting at their position and their heads would stay down. I think the story could have been broadened and explained a little better, especially in giving some context to all the missions. It seems like the developers just assumed the player would get how finding Tariq in the first mission led to seizing Bagram and then the infill of 1st Bat and the 10th Mountain, and why MED birds coming from Kandahar instead of BAF is a big deal, etc...<br><br>And as a shout out to whoever the operators were that helped build this, I definitely appreciated the running theme of &apos;Hey brass, how about you let the guys on the ground make the decisions...&apos; well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1725522">Expand</a></span>

The story took me a good 8 hours to complete, on Hard difficulty (anything lower is just for content tourists, if you ask me), and it was indeed impressive.
<br>
<br>Graphics-wise it certainly doesn&apos;t shine, but neither does it fail. Pretty decent looking, still, considering it&apos;s using th ancient Unreal 3.
<br>
<br>The sounds are by far the best I&apos;ve heard in a game&apos;s singleplayer (Bad Company 2&apos;s multiplayer is superior, especially with the almighty War Tapes option turned on)
<br>
<br>Multiplayer might be the bigger let-down, given that balance is a bit squeaky in some places, but DICE is already on the job, providing patches. This new auto-updater used in BFBC2 and MoH really is good.
<br>
<br>Lag isn&apos;t such a big problem as in Bad Company 2, despite running on the same Frostbite 1.5 game engine. Maybe it&apos;s the lack of massive destruction, maybe it&apos;s having only 24 players instead of 32, or maybe the netcode really did improve, but we can&apos;t say for sure.
<br>
<br>Anyway, the controls are pretty straight forward, and the gameplay, while at a first glance may look similar to Bad Company 2, is not a copy of BFBC2. I learned that the hard way.
<br>
<br>The story-driven game mode &quot;Combat mission&quot;, while very similar to Bad Company 2&apos;s &quot;Rush&quot; is a real neat time-waster. Though if you prefer something less team-oriented and more action packed you might want to try &quot;Team Assault&quot; - straight forward TDM.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot to say, but to keep it short : many reviews are either biased anti-EA or biased pro-CoD, otherwise, I couldn&apos;t see how this would get such low scores. It&apos;s an incredibly addictive game despite looking shallow at first glance.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for the flash of CoD, this might not be for you, but I strongly recommend this to people looking for a slightly different experience, both in the singleplayer component, as online.
<br>
<br>With 1.7 million units sold in the first week, and the ongoing support, I can&apos;t see how this is a failed game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1393563">Expand</a></span>

But if you like war shooters you have to play this.<br>The campaign is very good, has very intense moments, and its varied. I bought this game ONLY for the campaign. And its good. I Love war shooter games<br>The sound is excellent. I played with headphones and the effects and music are top notch.<br>The graphics are not that good, it uses Unreal 3 engine for SP portion and Frostbite for MP. On SP, it looks very good on some parts but overall the looks are mediocre and it requires a lot of horsepower where other games do not (Crysis plays better on my pc...). Textures are bland, enemies move weird, cant shoot ANYTHING except enemies, particles are crap and for a PC it has a lot of tearing.<br>The gameplay is very good on most parts. But the game has bugs. Its ridden with bugs, some gamebreaking bugs are terrible and needs fixing as soon as possible (search for Hellfire bug).<br>I did not play MP portion though.<br>Recommend it for SP only and only for fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1396490">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Medal of Honor&apos;s strongest point is easily the single player. World-class graphics, sound that you feel in your gut, compelling dialog, well orchestrated story, and epic attention to detail. Your weapon remembers the round still in the chamber between reloading! The ending was a real mind blower, and the atmosphere was rivaled only by games like STALKER and Metro. When the credits rolled, I just had a sense of wholeness. Now I&apos;m convinced The Catalyst is about Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>My single problem was the &quot;press any key to skip&quot;, which served as my only reminder of reality when I had to reload the section after accidentally right clicking out of tense instinct. It&apos;s that compelling.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer didn&apos;t deliver DICE&apos;s legendary game play standards, but it did give me an opportunity to appreciate yet another of the campaigns hidden qualities. My first experience as the Taliban in killing an American soldier left me with a sick feeling in my stomach. Any game that makes you feel bad about killing needs to be played by every gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2087004">Expand</a></span>

If you are a person that likes to jump on a brainless game and dual wield akimbo shotguns while lunging 3 feet to knife someone this would not be the game for you.  First off this game is pretty slow paced.  A lot of it is revolves around teamwork and positioning.  You die fairly quick and most of the time one sniper shot to the torso will kill you.  So it is important not to jump out of cover and sprint to the enemies base by yourself and attack.
<br>People that cry about this game not being as &quot;good&quot; as Modern Warfare 2 or Bad Company 2 are the kind of people that like to do insanely unrealistic things.  The story is really fun to play.  People complain about its shortness, but CoD MW2 story is was just as short.  I would recommend this game if you aren&apos;t a 12 year old running around with a 50 cal. sniper rifle screaming &quot;NO SCOPE!!!!@#!&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1395408">Expand</a></span>

Anyways. SP was amazing, I know alot of you are saying omg it so beiege and bland. Trust me, I have been to afghanistan before, its honestly an amazinng representation. ALot of brown, not alot of greenery unless your near a major river so on. I wont go into the MP as I generally suck at it and hold a bias opinion. The weapon ballistics are pretty good, though at times its a little easy to kill the AI there are an even number of times im liuke WTF where did he come from? So I feel even on normal the game can be challenging. The story was amazing, no I wasnt shooting down nukes or defending the white house from chinese or russian or who the **** ever but it was an honest portrayel of the way **** goes down over there. No endboss was great, the ending of the game literally had me in tears. This game has so much to to found, but sadly alot of it is really only seen by the military guys who have fought in afgan. Either way, this was an amazing game with solid SP, amazing graphics, and rediculously good sound, it honestly sounded like a firefight when I cranked my sound system up.  I give the game a solid 9 for SP. Improvements I can foresee, is mainly a longer SP exp. perhaps bigger maps that allow for a little more tactical thought but on those mountains it really is completely linear, but they are not trying to be ARMA, so I think a little more openness and longer SP would greatly benefit the franchinse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1745514">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are very good and the audio is probably the best I have EVER heard. The other pro is that the weapons feel spot on. If you are bored of the CoD:MW2 perk BS and the pro camping to receive high end call ins or need a break from Bad Company 2, MoH&apos;s multiplayer is filled with very skilled players and the competition is intense. The gameplay mechanics and attention to moderate realism really make Medal of Honor stand out in the multiplayer arena as the game will force many to adopt authentic battlefield tactics but not break the game enough that you wouldn&apos;t be able to play as a highly aggressive one man army. This game is very fun and addictive and I wouldn&apos;t let the biased critics deter you if you are in the market for a new shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390199">Expand</a></span>

The story line was good but the campaign was way too short!!!Just as i became addicted it ended. It could just needed more but didnt reach its full potential. Good try though but if M.O.H wants to come close to C.O.D.M.W.2 they need to pull up their socks</span>

They really show how far the frostbite engine has been developed, there were some real time cut scenes, like when the helicopter was attacked for instance, that were litteraly mind blowing. I would bet my life it was cg. great game, way too short. They could have done sooo much more! For instance, the frostbite engine is perfect for introducing all kinds of vehicals into the gameplay, all you ever control is a atv and it&apos;s just driving down a coridor... this could have been a 10 title easily, I&apos;d be willing to bet they rushed them to make a holiday launch and they cut a lot of gameplay out. VERY eager to play the next instalment. Honestly, I LOVE call of duty, but battlefield and MOH series really give me a lot more. We&apos;re on the verger of photo-realistic games, iot&apos;s a thing of beauty. This game simply pushes us that muich closer, kinda how crisis pushed the bar up, this does the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1445160">Expand</a></span>

Sound in of weapons, explosion in the environment  makes you feel right there.  THE BAD:
<br>This game is high scripted and with my system I was getting ahead of the script and  AI would should magically appear. I even ran up on a enemy AI before the script kick in. My squad AI Said I&apos;ll get him but he was way behind me so I knifed the enemy AI before he even moved. The UGLY:
<br>The games has severe bugs. Like the first mission you use the laser guide . the laser disappears if you go left and shows back up when you go right. (Trick lean right and laser shows up on the left targeting) on the quad cycle I had a bug where my Squad AI said to follow him and when I press F to get on it glitch and I was left hovering above the quad cycle and I can&apos;t move had to restart whole mission because if I restart level I begin hovering above the quad cycle. Spoiler alert I think. at the end where you go to rescue the seals the last door in the cave it. I kick the door and it jumps right to the end credits. now if that&apos;s the end then the game is short  about 6 hours for me. for $59 it&apos;s a rip off.  Even BF2BC2 single player lasted longer.  Until Dice fixes the bugs I would hold off buying this game Steam PC version until a patch comes out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390311">Expand</a></span>

Game is very action packed if you compare it to crappy bfbc 2 and is very near to Modern Warfare 2. Single player is good: short campaign and dynamic. Story is normal action film/game story but scripted scenes are well done. Multi player as all ways is the better side of this game; good maps and weapon customization with score-chain awards, its realistic too unlike BFBC 2 (you need to fire 3 bullets with SVU sniper to enemy when he/she dies). Well the best DICE game ever that ive played ever.

The graphics on this game are awesome, mechanics were a little off but they released a patch and they have corrected most of the errors on the multiplayer, but the biggest seller is they are working to make it a continuously better gaming experience, by implementing user feedback and beta player feedback.

The game is a bit too easy for my liking, but didn&apos;t have those &quot;getting kill because I  was told to hurry up and advance/retreat  moments&quot; nearly as much as MW. Only glitch i had was mission glitched and had to restart to complete. The multiplayer seems like another generic shooter with aspects of bad company 2 and  MW in it, which is to bad i believe it could have done better.I hope they patch the game to fix any bugs and not give up on it. I am also hoping to see a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389264">Expand</a></span>

I finished the campaign in less than 4 hours on Hard. That is unacceptable. That includes playing a round on Tier 1 Mode and setting up my keys. I bought it for the SP. I am more than disappointed. The GamePlay is stifling; linear, predictable, you are led like a dog on a leash, and there are more hordes of Taliban in MoH than zombies in L4D. At least L4D has an AI Director that prevents 40 zombies from coming out of the same hut you just walked past. If you are buying it for the MP, fine, but if you own BC2, keep your money. You are limited in your upgrades, you have only three classes, and the weapon selection is so minute compared to MW2 and BC2 is not worth money.  If you are expecting a large cache of weapons, attachments, and other options, you will be disappointed. MP can be fun, but the maps are more of a corridor than a map. Enfilading fire is the only and best tactic for defense since the OpFor are forced to column into the next objective. There is little or no opportunity to flank in most of the MP modes. In summary if you like carnival shooting galleries with an American flag and &quot;Remember the Troops&quot; hanging on the wall then this the game will envoke the same amount of patriotism and give you the same satisfaction as shooting a BB gun at ducks.  If you think you are going to have an one-of-kind, authentic, and compelling gaming experience, keep waiting and save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390079">Expand</a></span>

For starters, the graphics are great in both the SP and the MP and each has its ups and downs regarding graphics (ex. SP has more realistic glare while MP has more realistic smoke effects). One thing I will say is that when going from SP to MP I noticed that the guns in SP look far more realistic and polished than in MP, but MP I generally found to have better character models though not by much. One thing to look out for is there are texture loading problems in the SP (when you jump into a new game the textures take about ten seconds to load entirely even though you are already playing) not to mention the beards everyone was waiting for don&apos;t look as good in the game and are probably the area of biggest complaint for me regarding models. On top of that, there are a few collision issues in SP (one is almost unavoidable). However, the animations are incredible (very few flaws) and the game, overall, just looks fantastic which increases the immersion in an already great environment.<br><br>When it comes to sound, the game is also different between SP and MP and, again, each has its own strengths. Do not think that the guns sound bad in either nor do the environmental affects such as the sound of your feet, just one is a little better than the other. The soundtrack is where this game really shines and a few of the tracks (particularly at the end) are practically tear-driving they fit in so well with what these men and women go through. And if you&apos;re a Linkin Park fan, you&apos;ll be glad to know they make a couple appearances in the soundtrack. When it comes to the SP, this game takes a little getting used to. Everything is so different from the MP that even if you participated in the beta, you&apos;ll run into some issues with getting a feel for what seems like a clunky and either unresponsive or too responsive game at first, but stick with it. After the second level you should easily have gotten used to the feel and by the fourth it will just feel natural. There are some framerate issues throughout the SP that are more rampant in the first two levels than the rest of the game (though, towards the end, I noticed quite a few framerate issues as the intensity picked up). However, I will say this is not for people who want a purely action-packed experienced with an equally intense plot. The plot is more realistic and more like a documentary going from soldier to soldier and showing them working together, but there isn&apos;t much of a plot aside from trying to get established in Afghanistan (the only real &quot;intense&quot; moment of the plot is towards the end). The game also has moments in which confrontation is discouraged completely and you&apos;ll also find the action levels are generally slower with a few breaks on occasion to try to grasp the situation. It does feel more realistic though. It also should be noted that the SP is not tough at all (took me about 5 hours on Hard the first time through the game--though there were a couple areas where I had some definitely struggles getting past). If it isn&apos;t enough of a challenge, there is a Tier 1 Mode which is a competitive online mode tracking how good people are at the SP missions. Overall, the SP feels great and definitely captures the respect for the soldier that I was looking most forward to, as well as providing a more realistic approach to war than a lot of games are doing.<br><br>Now, when you go to MP, the game is almost completely different. A different engine, no prone, no lean, and a completely different arsenal of weapons that look different from their SP counterparts when they are the same. The game is fast paced and team-based, though there is no VOIP which is a drawback, but TS should be able to compensate for this (did with my friends). There are bugs and glitches and the lag and hit detection can be problematic depending on the server as well as the occasional hacker (though they are few and far between depending on your server). The spawn system can also be problematic and spawn killing is REALLY easy in a couple maps, though a good team will prevent the other team from spawn killing. The pace is sort of a mix between CoD4 and BC2 so, just like so much, this game seems to be a mix between the two. Camping can be a problem, but the Skill system discourages it (though some completely ignore the Skill system) not to mention no camping spot is perfect. Scorechains are also a good deviation from killstreaks and are not overpowered or TOO problematic. In the end, I found the MP to be a good pace with some definite enjoyment as you rank up through the, albeit simplistic and small, unlock tree. So, get MoH or don&apos;t? Personally, I think the $60 was worth it, but if you&apos;re looking for a CoD or BC2 clone, you&apos;ll be disappointed. Overall, just take into consideration what has been said and make your own decision.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389558">Expand</a></span>

Go play your precious game that took the genre back YEARS to Quake III deathmatch/arena.  This game, Medal of Honor, is a game of team play, brains, and skill.  CoD MW/MW2 focuses on twitch play, kill streaks, and ME ME ME--which is why so many of you noobs love it.  My hope is that the players that do actually like this MoH and especially combat mission will get hooked on the team style of play.  RTCW: ET, Far Cry (flag capture), and ET:QW were the best team focused games up to this point.  ET:QW is stil the epitomy of team effort for all maps involved, but the assault the airfield map in MoH captures that same feeling, and has better graphics, more realistic fight dynamics, and lets face it, half a million more players.
<br>
<br>The game installed/loaded flawlessly, looks beautiful, plays realistically (seems even moreso than AA3--sorry US Army), and is the most fun I have had in months playing a game.  Point system is there for those of you that need that in your life, rank system and unlocks aren&apos;t brutal and unforgiving (I&apos;m still not a fan of any rank system, but this is best I&apos;ve seen yet).  Scenery is spot on.  For those reviewers that said &quot;it is all beige&quot;....WTF do you think Afghanistan looks like?  And multiplayer maps are anything but.  I can&apos;t wait until new maps that include forest/jungle come out to really shut people up.  I must give another plug for the assault/defend the airfield map.  That is the best multiplayer experience I have had, and I am not even in a clan and wasn&apos;t on TS or vent with anyone.  I was in TAW Far Cry division for three years and it had its moments, but that map in public multiplayer was thrilling.  When the Bradley had me pinned behind a concrete barrier I nearly cringed in RL.  And another time in the hangar I was using pallets for cover and they shattered when a nade hit too close.  Totally unexpected and awesome!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390841">Expand</a></span>

The single player campaign while extremely short is paced well and offers a decent amount of variety. The squad AI does a great job of making you feel like they are contributing in a meaningful way to the battle. Often they&apos;ll offer up verbal clues as to where you can find enemies which defiantly helps with the immersion making you actually feel like you&apos;re a part of a top notch special forces team. Visually the game does a good job offering up a decent amount of variety from snowy mountain ranges to dust parched wastelands and devastated urban environments.<br>The problem with the game is the lack-luster multiplayer component. Unfortunately there just isn&apos;t enough variety and ends up coming across as quite plain. In the end its hard for me to justify the purchase of the game because of the short single player experience and the vanilla multiplayer offering.<br>While a fun time it mostly feels like an appetizer when you should be getting an entree for the 60$ admission fee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1425719">Expand</a></span>

It would almost seem as though everyone who hates the game are just whining about it not being a Modern Warfare 2 clone. Allow me to directly address the major complaints of those who don&apos;t like the game. First off, people complain that the story isn&apos;t as good as that of Modern Warfare 2 or Bad Company 2. The average soldier (or even the average special ops. operator) doesn&apos;t break into a Russian sub pen and launch nuclear missiles at Washington D.C. or save the United States from a Russian invasion by destroying an EMP device on a transport plane in mid-air. Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2 are about ridiculous, over the top action. That&apos;s fine, but Medal of Honor is trying to put you in the boots of actual soldiers. Real soldiers don&apos;t save the world like you see in other games. They get their missions and carry them out to the best of their ability. That being said, the Medal of Honor campaign is captivating and fun in my opinion, and the missions flow together very well. People complain about it containing scripted events, but so did Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2, and I think MoH actually blends more seamlessly between gameplay and cutscenes/scripted events than either of the other games did. Critics also need to stop complaining about length. Portal was 3-4 hours long, and it still won Game of the Year in 2007 from dozens of reviewers. Focus on quality, not quantity. I&apos;m sick of games padding themselves out with stupid story elements. I still haven&apos;t finished Bioshock because I got sick of all the random fetch quests it set you out on. Lots of critics also complain that the AI sucks and whine about how they will just sit behind a wall and shoot at you, instead of run around and reposition like in BC2 and MW2. This complaint is the stupidest I&apos;ve seen so far. Why on earth would you run out from cover while being shot at? It&apos;s always bothered me that AI in other games does this. Sure, it gives the player easier shots, but it makes no sense. People (and therefore any AI trying to simulate them) like to not be shot, and the best way to do so is to take cover and return fire. The AI in Medal of Honor does just this, and it&apos;s nice to see some AI that has any sense of self-preservation. Closing comments: I really thought the peek system was awesome. Not only do you get to lean left and right from behind cover like in other games, but you can also pop your head up and down. This becomes extremely useful to reload or take cover, then pop back up and return fire. Critics complain about graphics and other random things. I thought the graphics were just fine. I honestly don&apos;t know what those people are complaining about. Reviewers need to stop comparing this to Bad Company 2 and Modern Warfare 2. It&apos;s not trying to be just like them; this is a different kind of game. If you&apos;re looking for a more realistic modern warfare game instead of the over-the-top James Bond-style action, check out Medal of Honor. It&apos;s a great buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389299">Expand</a></span>

This game is unpolished, unfinished, unbalanced, and extremely disappointing. If you can look past the dated graphics, the rubbish multiplayer, the annoying show stopping bugs, then you might find something. Definitely not worth the price.</span>

Are Dice writing another game alongside MoH?  This is a dull, on rails, low brow corridor shooter that desperately wants to be CoD and sadly achieves that because the CoD series is exactly that.  The trouble with these two &quot;benchmark&quot; series is that on the PC at least, they have very little if any competition and are therefore not subject to the rigours FPS&apos;s on our platform used to experience.  For me at least, MoH and CoD are simple, no brainer cash cows for greedy corporations that don&apos;t even try to encourage innovation.<br><br>MoH starts badly and just never really gets your pulse racing. Its predictable and uttery faithful to the mainstream/arcade recipe of corridor shooters.  Want a &quot;realistic&quot; sim of modern anti-terrorost warfare? Buy Arma2 Operation Arrowhead.  Want to play CoD modern warfare AGAIN?  Waste your money on MoH.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1395742">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer game gets 10/10 for me. I tried the beta demo and was hooked- EA knew what they were doing! However, the single player is **** awful. I played 30 minutes of it and got bored. Its extremely linear and simple. Tactics aren&apos;t needed. You run to a place, see 5 Al Quada members scramble to cover- you can kill 3 of them while they&apos;re running around- and you pick of their heads in another 2 seconds. Rinse. Repeat.  Its like a sub-par Playstation 2 shooter, or Time Crisis 2 (without the fun). There&apos;s no puzzles, no strategy, no novelty, it really feels like a weak shooter from 2002. For some odd reason the graphics are not as good as the multiplayer. SP graphics are a little bland. Single player feels like it only exists to give context to the multiplayer maps. SP is basically all the multiplayer maps chained together with some more streets in between and some cutscenes (the only part of SP I liked were the cutscenes).<br><br>The multiplayer is an entirely different game. Everything about it rocks. The sound design, the graphics, the gameplay... This game is mostly about finding cover and good vantage points, killing enemies and waiting for a chance to advance. Cover fire from teamates is very valuable- and the game rewards it. Each kill gets you XP points, you get extra for headshots, savior kills, revenge kills, destroying vehicles, coordinating attacks and a few other things. XP gained with each class unlocks new weapons and weapon tweaks for that class only. You aren&apos;t allowed to choose what upgrade you can get like Battlefield games, but that doesn&apos;t bother me.<br><br>I&apos;ve only played COD for 2 minutes- I quit after a 7-year-old screamed **** at me (that sums up what I think of COD and Halo). However, I&apos;ve always been a fan of Battlefield (2 and 2142, but I&apos;ve never played Modern Warfare). MOH seems to improve on the class systems of the BF games- nobody is stuck being a medic (the health system is exactly like Gears of War- when you get hit you start seeing red and blood spatter on the edge of the screen. get to cover and you heal in 5 seconds or so, but it doesn&apos;t take much to kill someone). Also, nobody is forced to sit around and play commander. Scorechains give access to mortar/missile strikes and radar sweeps. I think this is how COD works too (maybe?). And permanent ammo boxes are spread around the map (for some game types).<br><br>Its hard to think of any problems with MP. There have been some servers where you get stuck on a terrible team, and there is no team balance, but this is easily remedied (ragequit). I&apos;ve only gotten about a 1/5 of the way up the weapon unlock thing, but it seems like I&apos;ll probably have everything unlocked after maybe only 20 hours of gameplay (roughly estimating). I remember unlocking weapons in BF2 or 2142 was  a huge deal since it only came once in such a long time. Then again, with MOH unlocking everything is within everyone&apos;s grasp and not just for those who play 10 hours a day.<br><br>Overall, I have to give this game a 7. A great multiplayer game alone is worth $40-45, but this game cost $60, and at 60 I expect at least a good single player experience. Rated separately, the MP is 10/10, the SP 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1392054">Expand</a></span>

The game play is extremely forced and controlled outside of the users ability to improvise.  If this game was aiming for realism as I seem to understand everyone keeps suggesting, they failed miserably.  In real life, the world is open and all of the world is usable, not just what&apos;s scripted and confined to alleviate the need to actually write a good product.   Plot is almost none existent.<br><br>Multiplayer... where to start.  Every time you die, you must reselect your class and select to spawn.  Seriously?  Can&apos;t let the person just respawn and enable a key to allow the user to change things when the user wants to change?  You have to make them choose every time?  lame...<br>Team balancing... does not exist.  If for some reason people leave on one side, the game never rebalances them.  Spawn killing, galore.  In some maps, never expect to move more than 2 feet from your spawn.  Stat padding, this game specifically rewards persons who stat pad.  What I mean is, if I can get more points than the other, then I can keep you pushed down in the ground.  Literally, see spawn killing.  Nothing like spawning into a mortar, rocket, or missile strike over and over and over again, which the person ordering the attacks gets rewarded with even more points for the kills, to repeat similar actions again and again.  There is absolutely no voice chat in this game.  if you want to talk to people, find a server with vent maybe?  Dunno, since there&apos;s almost no information about any servers you might join.  No way to see your ping or anything else like that.  Currently the server browser capability seems to be broken, so you can&apos;t look for games.  Friends do not map back to steam.  You have to add them individually on your own, and both sides have to do it.<br><br>Two different launchers for the product.  Seriously?  You&apos;ll have to reconfigure your settings for each version of the game (single player and multi).  There is no leaning in multiplayer as there is in single player.  Don&apos;t bind keys to cycle your weapons up or down, as the cycles does not loop; so once you&apos;ve cycled down all the way, you have to cycle up all the way to get to the other end of its spectrum.<br><br>Overall this game is very lacking in design and ingenuity.  If there is a plot, its so shallow that not even a baby could drown in it.  Buyers regret will probably sink in about 10 minutes into playing this game.<br><br>Avoid this game if at all possible.  Do not waste your time nor money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389847">Expand</a></span>

Every map is a camping fest around single choke point. Objective games are a joke compared to CoD series. Sounds are muted. Graphics is too shiny. Controls clunky. Movement awkward and choppy. Fail all around. How could they release this is beyond me...</span>

They are far from making the game fun. Difficulty in seeing people, combined with no killcam whatsoever promotes HEAVY camping. Why run around when you can sit with a sniper rifle or scoped assault rifle with almost no recoil. You run around a corner and drop dead without any idea where the shot came from.<br><br>Some multiplayer maps actually started opposing groups across open areas, which is beyond ridiculous.<br><br>Smaller issues stack up, like displaying awarded medals at the end of the game. The descriptions fly by so fast, you can&apos;t keep up with what you actually did. If you look for a particular type of multiplayer game and are assigned a server, that server could start you on a completely different type on the next match, with no obvious way to leave without &quot;forfeiting the match&quot;.<br><br>One map (I forgot the name) has ended up 75% of the time pinning the team that starts in a particular corner just being herded in there and spawn camping. Dropping mortars, etc on the spawn with only two routes out that are easily campable.<br><br>The controls for the campaign are different then the multiplayer due to not being able to perform certain actions. NO PRONE IN MULTIPLAYER?! WTF?!<br><br>It&apos;s just a **** game, there&apos;s not much more to it. Yeah it&apos;s more realistic, and that was cool, but that&apos;s all it tried to bring to the table. A wood box that can blow up, or some wood boards that I can destroy do not make a game.<br><br>Since I bought this game, I have averaged about an hour a day trying to get into it (I really did want to like the game) and have probably ended up spending twice that playing my older games like Modern Warfare 2, etc.<br><br>Oh and the audio was pretty damn good. The voice acting in the background added a cool authenticity to the scenery. Unfortunately, I could barely hear it over me screaming about how terrible the game actually is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1392120">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dice prove that Counterstrike can be cloned.
<br>
<br>Danger Close&apos;s singleplayer has great ideas ie: use of fire suppression and support actions. But their rare. Game puts more emphisis on the player occupying an exact, though unspecified grid on the map, to cue any action. Leaving a on the rails feeling to the whole scenario. Add to this channeled map design, and it really is on the rails(not to mention the game taking control of the player at times).
<br>
<br>Medal of Honor as a franchise deserved a more competent studio.
<br>
<br>Dice&apos;s multiplayer content, as I said before is a counterstrike clone. Suggesting that nothing except visual enhancement has happend in the genre, since the release of CS.
<br>
<br>Singleplayer and multiplayer are actually 2 separate titles neither resembling the other in sound gameplay and only slightly in visual.
<br>
<br>This tittle deserves a score of 4. Two points to each studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1395100">Expand</a></span>

The most professional element of this game was the advertising campaign that convinced so many of us that it was worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390364">Expand</a></span>

The game suffers from a weak enemy AI which makes the game incredibly easy. Overall the campaign is enjoyable, though short. The multiplayer is repetitive. The maps are good, some are better than others, while some are chaotic depending on what type of game you are playing. Problems with it is its design concept. The multiplayer is nothing like battlefield more like CoD style but with less depth in classes which makes game even less enjoyable in multiplayer session. Overall, The game felt rushed, and design idea is poorly executed. I recommend to get the game below $10 if you do want to play the SP campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981501">Expand</a></span>

Single Player (as multiplayer was for some reason made separately): A boring, excessively linear campaign with no interesting or engaging story whatsoever. The physics are terrible, and the graphics are atrocious. They wouldn&apos;t look out of place in one of the old conflict games. The enemy AI acts as though it hasn&apos;t been finished. Too many times I&apos;ve seen enemy fighters casually strolling around and dying up to ten seconds after I kill them. Finally, its very short, lasting me only three and a half hours. Multiplayer: I&apos;ve played this for more than eighty hours to unlock everything and get a good feel for it. My conclusion is that I wasted eighty+ hours of my life. I&apos;ll start with dev support, of which there doesn&apos;t appear to have ever been. Maps are full to the brim of rocks no taller than ankle high that you have to jump over. I&apos;ve lost count of the amount of times I&apos;ve died because i suddenly get stuck on them. There are also issues like gaps in walls (which obviously haven&apos;t been placed properly) which you can be shot through without being able to see your attacker. Any active devs would have patched these issues. Again, physics are awful. I&apos;ve played with friends to test this, and headshots do not work. I had a friend crouch, and I shot him point blank in the head with an M16. I got a hit marker, no kill. It took a further four headshots to kill him. This repeats for every other weapon. I only ever achieved headshots when shooting just above the chest on the neck, which forgive me if I&apos;m wrong, isn&apos;t the location of one&apos;s head. Getting kills online is just as random. Many a time I&apos;ve melee&apos;d a player, seen blood spurt from there sprite, then had them turn around and shoot me. Realism mode is a joke, and not a funny one. Even here, kills require half a clip and grenades have to be touching a player when they explode to kill. Only yesterday I found a player hiding behind a box in the corner of two walls. As i was too far away to risk breaking cover for a melee kill, i loaded up my noob tube and fired at him from around 10 feet away. Direct hit, no kill. I reloaded, closed to four feet away and fired again. Direct hit, no kill. Friendly fire is quite the opposite. Hitting a mentally challenged teammate who runs in front of you kills in as little as two shots. There is a clear difference in team and enemy health where team damage is concerned. There aren&apos;t many weapons in multiplayer, especially concerning handguns, and the ones present fire exactly the same as each other. Shotguns aren&apos;t used by anyone, as they cannot kill even at close range. Battle rifles can&apos;t kill at any range, especially the G10. Snipers are a constant issue in most maps, although when using the sniper rifle myself, I can&apos;t see why. It requires the neck-headshot for a kill, with all other shots even to the heart resulting in a lonely hit marker. Some people just spend so much time camping they get used to it, especially in Helmand Valley (worst map). The maps have been designed quite well, excepting Helmand valley, with very few spots being completely hidden. The airfield map is a favourite, though for some reason is declining on the hugely laggy community servers. They aren&apos;t designed with spawn points in mind though, as blatant spawn killing is easy and frequent on all maps. The tower at the end of the airfield actually looks over the final enemy spawn point. Cheating is also quite an issue. I&apos;ve personally watched three aimbot users randomly turning around super-fast and getting neck-headshots. I personally keep a list of rude, abusive or cheating players, and it is dominated by MoH players. Every time I play with any of them their K/D&apos;s are sky high and killing them just doesn&apos;t work. Obviously many would say. &apos;get over it, you&apos;re probably wrong&apos;, which may be true, but four of those people i wrote down have since been banned after being caught cheating on certain servers. Finally, walls. Again. Bullets penetrate every wall in the game without losing power. Rocks (?!) have the same problem. There is no such thing as cover in this game. Pre-order weapons aren&apos;t available even now, even as DLC. Obviously this means most players are denied some cool weapons to break up the monotony of the same boring weapons over and over, and the devs miss an obvious source of income. Conclusion: The devs got bored. That has to be it. This reminds me of Breach in that it has excellent potential, but has been abandoned in a vanilla state with soooooo many issues. I wish I could get my 80 hours refunded. And as for the common argument of those who post 10&apos;s (?!), the game is about as realistic as Magicka. It is nothing like the situation in Afghanistan, has no realistic physics and no convincing story or graphics. Please present a viable argument. Oh, and watch out for 1RCN servers. Half the guys flashing their tag have hacked or ignore hackers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2484360">Expand</a></span>

What?? I give &quot;1&quot; instead of &quot;0&quot; becouse of the work the developers invested into the game. I&apos;m very disappointed about this game becouse it got 75 metascore.. i know they must have given out a lot of games for free to the developers becouse of this &quot;big name&quot; can&apos;t get too bad reviews after all. But to say the thruth I&apos;m happy I didn&apos;t buy it just saw it at a friend how terrible it is. I bought COD MW2 at the 1st day it came out.. the multiplayer is terrible at that game, but still I&apos;m happy I bought that game since the single player is awsome and I re-play the game like a good movie.. but this game :( It&apos;s even too boring for the 1st play, the multiplayer is a cheap experience and it doesn&apos;t even look cool :( People out there!! If you don&apos;t want to waste your money, you just don&apos;t play with it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1403281">Expand</a></span>

The Multiplayer is really terrible again we have killstreak who actually kill the game getting killed by a random rocket from the sky is not funny the maps are small and there is like 15 weapons... dont buy this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1398450">Expand</a></span>
