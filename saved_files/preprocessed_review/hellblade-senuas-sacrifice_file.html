The puzzles, if you can call them that, mostly just involve running around trying to match patterns against the world you&apos;re in, over and over and over and over.  You spend more time in this game trying to find these irritating shapes than doing anything else.  That or changing the world by running through portals to open paths or doors.  Abandoned after 5 hours of the same thing.  Save yourself the money and just watch a walkthrough on youtube if you want to see the story.

<br>
<br>The pros:
<br>Really good looking places to visit, good graphics, and a story that never existed before.
<br>
<br>The cons: too much talking, repetition of enemies, repetition of puzzles, really one dimensional way of fighting.

Regardless of what I personally think of it, it&#x2019;s going to be remembered, and I can see it getting quite the cult following too. Team Ninja&#x2019;s design philosophy of making a &#x201C;AAA Indie&#x201D; game is an admirable one, and something I&#x2019;d love to see them do again, with other developers following suit. The unique way in which the game was developed absolutely shows through when you experience it for yourself.
<br>
<br>Story-wise, it&#x2019;s a sympathetic, interesting portrayal of mental illness on a scale that has never been attempted in a game before to my knowledge. It&#x2019;s done really really well, and I feel like writing more about that, but I don&#x2019;t want to spoil anything. The game is incredibly atmospheric, creepy and unsettling, but it&#x2019;s not a horror game as such. It tentatively dips its feet into psychological horror the further you get in, as the atmosphere gets more ominous and the challenges more dangerous, but it avoids most of the horror tropes we&apos;re used to in games, and doesn&apos;t have any jump scares. The intention seems to be less on frightening the player and more on setting the mood and tone, and giving you an insight into Senua&#x2019;s mind.
<br>
<br>Probably the most impressive thing this game has to offer is the way it uses sound. I simply can&apos;t remember a time when I played a game that was so focused on sound. The voices in Senua&apos;s (and your) head are important not just for the story, but also for the way that the game is played. Sometimes they encourage you, sometimes discourage you, sometimes they help and sometimes they don&apos;t. You&apos;ll need to listen as they give you clues (or lead you astray), and during combat they&#x2019;ll do the same, warning you when an enemy is behind you, telling you to move and attack at the right moments... Or they may be more pessimistic, and simply whisper about your imminent death. You&apos;ll sometimes need to follow a sound during exploration, or listen carefully for the sound of an enemy you can&#x2019;t see, but need to avoid. They obviously devoted a lot of time to the sound in this game, and it really shows. This game MUST be played with headphones, both for atmosphere and for gameplay purposes.
<br>
<br>As far as gameplay goes, I think this game could be most aptly described as an Action Puzzle game. Apart from a few maze puzzles, the rest of the puzzles are about matching shapes on the screen to the environment around you. Most of the time if you&apos;re observant and have a little patience, they aren&apos;t difficult to figure out. But occasionally they can become more ambiguous, and it can be annoying when you&apos;re *positive* that those two crooked trees create an &quot;M&apos; shape, but the game disagrees. It really would have benefited with some more traditional puzzle solving as well, just to mix things up and throw some more variety in there. Because unfortunately I got tired of this concept when I was around half-way through, and that&apos;s quite a big problem for a game with such a large focus on them.
<br>
<br>Sadly, I have mixed feelings about the combat too. The combat is a side-order to the puzzles, and exists primarily to break up the exploring and puzzle solving, and to keep the world feeling dangerous and engaging. That doesn&apos;t mean you can avoid it though, or breeze through it. Sometimes it can be intense, especially the boss fights - but when it doesn&apos;t go your way it can be infuriating. The reason for this is because although it&apos;s very &quot;cinematic&quot;, it&apos;s not very dynamic. When you boil it down, it&apos;s fairly simplistic, stiff, and repetitive. The camera is firmly stuck on a low FOV directly behind Senua at all times (except when it clips through the environment and focuses on a f*cking wall), which creates an effective claustrophobic feel, but doesn&apos;t lend itself well to gameplay. You can only really focus on one enemy at a time, and your moves are quite limited. It feels pretty clunky, especially when you&apos;re surrounded. This was likely intentional, as a way to make the player feel vulnerable, but there are ways to do that without making them feel restricted... I can&apos;t deny that it fits the game&#x2019;s style and is certainly engaging, but in the end it&#x2019;s just not very enjoyable when you&#x2019;re fighting more than 1 or 2 enemies. Similar to your limited moveset, the enemy variety is very limited too, which doesn&#x2019;t help matters; because you really feel like you&#x2019;re just going through the same motions over and over again.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere, the story, the art style and the sound are all totally on point. But both the puzzles and the combat leave something to be desired, and that&apos;s the whole &quot;game&quot; part of the game. So that&#x2019;s unfortunate. I&#x2019;d really love a sequel where they improved on these things, and despite my annoyances, I really hope this one sells well. You can tell it was made with care, with a lot of thought and a lot of heart, and though I do have mixed feelings, I&apos;m glad I had this experience.
<br>
<br>Bad name though. I still don&apos;t know what a &quot;Hellblade&quot; is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7464430">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story is meaningful and thrilling; soundtrack, visuals and gameplay are atmospheric, captivating and enthralling; Actor play is ideal (gorgeous actress playing Senua is not even a &quot;professional&quot; actress, she&apos;s actually a team member doing some video editing stuff).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not just a great game, it&apos;s a life experience that i would advise anyone to go through without a shadow of a doubt.
<br>
<br>Please buy it, put on your headphones and submerge yourself in to the depth of dark psychotic journey filled with despair and courage.

Senua&apos;s Sacrifice brings two things to the table: atmosphere and a fairly original approach to storytelling. The melancholic environments and breathtaking sound design all complement your experience of being inside the head of a psychologically disturbed woman who is the game&apos;s protagonist.
<br>
<br>However, the experience is the only thing that&apos;s good in the game, and there&apos;s not much quality gameplay to speak of. Honestly, with a game titled &quot;Hellblade&quot; and coming from creators of DmC and Heavenly Sword, I expected a fast paced action game in that vein. Sadly, the combat in this game mostly reminds me of that found in Dreamfall: The Longest Journey or Ryse: Son of Rome. Put simply, once you&apos;ve played through the first combat encounter, you&apos;ve seen all that the game has to offer in that regard. You&apos;re free to button-mash your way through the enemies, adopting specific tactics for special enemy types, and that&apos;s it. No flashy combos, no upgrades, no varied weapons or fighting styles, just your longsword, dodges, parries and such a lack of any sense of impact that hitting an enemy feels no different from slashing the air. The same goes for puzzles, which all come down to lining up runes and patterns. These do nothing to make you think creatively and I found them to just be detracting from the flow and the immersion.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, the game would have fared much better if it adopted a more narrative approach and either scrapped combat altogether or made it sparser and riskier, thus putting greater accent on the game&apos;s permadeath mechanic which, frankly, may as well not even be in the current game given how easy it is. Is this a bad game? No, but it is far from good either. If you want a good one-time experience such as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, or just want to feast your eyes on the graphics and the latest motion capture technology, then this game is for you. On the other hand, if you want challenging combat or captivating puzzles, you will only be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7464944">Expand</a></span>

Not at all what I expect from Ninja Theory, not at all. More than that however, the puzzles ruin the pace of the game for me, but perhaps it&apos;s just me. This is a matter of my expectations, more than the game itself, but I really think that it&apos;s not a game for me and I feel a bit misled. A linear puzzle game with elements of fighting is how I&apos;d describe it. Or &quot;that game with a really stupid title&quot; (for a second there I was sure it&apos;s a sequel to &quot;I am Setsuna&quot;, based on the title alone). Overall - meh... seen worse, seem better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7457575">Expand</a></span>

The point of the game is an experience and submersion into the mind of someone dealing with psychosis. It gives an intense sense of trying to understand someone dealing with this affliction and has been heavily researched by the developers Ninja Theory. I grew a much greater sense of appreciation for this game after watching their short documentary on developing it and the accompanying research that was put into it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEfUajzJv5U). Judging this game for combat focus is almost like doing the same for a visual novel, or like judging the walking dead point and click adventure for lack of combat. Combat is a good way to detract slightly from puzzles to not make the experience too monotone and linearity is executed incredibly well to really show the adventure/path that Senua is taking on her vision quest. I can not recommend this game highly enough. It is also a new and great focus that the developers took to give awareness of mental illness to the player and I respect them for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7458444">Expand</a></span>

<br>Truly a game unlike any other before. It manages to plunge you deep inside your character&apos;s mind in a thoroughly thought out way. The immersion is so great my body had chills all over half the time.
<br>
<br>The graphics are astounding. I kept rotating the camera to look at Senua&apos;s face, to watch her ultra realistic face and expressions fueled by the amazing performance by the voice and motion actress behind it.
<br>
<br>The combat is not very complex, but it&apos;s gritty and feels very real. In fact, the game brought Senua&apos;s emotions so close to me that I actually felt her anger at times and slashing monsters became even more satisfying.
<br>
<br>The lengths that the devs have gone to to accurately convey mental illness and allow the player to experience it so realistically is applaudable. At times I felt I was going insane along with Senua as I heard those voices whispering in both of my ears like they were with me in the room, while painfully sifting through the emotional roller coaster of the unstable reality her mind is put through.
<br>
<br>On the bad side, most puzzles were easy to figure out but required lots of running around and backtracking to get them done. Also there&apos;s one area that causes framerates to significantly drop even if the rest of the game plays smoothly, and even lowering settings doesn&apos;t make a difference.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7466694">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sorry but as someone who has dealt with those issues and still does the game didn&apos;t remotely resonate with me, the whole idea of it is clear they want to use the mental illness angle to sell the game alone rather then selling the game on the game itself, it is the same reason they call it an &quot;independent AAA game&quot; which is an oxymoron.... it is just a boring game with mechanics u&apos;ve seen over and over already, repetetive easy and pointless, it might LOOK nice.... but it being a game isn&apos;t really necessary it feels like the gaming aspect was an after thought when realising it should probably just be a movie or something... and not really a great one at that either. It looks beautiful is the best thing I can say about it but everything else the gameplay and attempt at using mental illness as a selling point is kind of ridiculous &quot;we spent alot of time with mental health professionals&quot; good for you it doesn&apos;t mean you understand mental illness you didn&apos;t study it you just asked for the basics and then ran off to make a game.
<br>
<br>Honestly I don&apos;t mind that I seem to be the odd one out here as everyone has already fallen for the idea that this game is about and will do alot for mental illness when it isn&apos;t remotely true and only someone that hasn&apos;t dealt with it would think otherwise. But im rating it based on 2 things, graphics and gameplay, so 10 for graphics 0 for gameplay and mechanics, the mental health issue isn&apos;t even worth rating it on because in reality it is none existent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7479179">Expand</a></span>

<br>Interesting enough story, looks nice enough, but very little gameplay worth mentioning. Combat is a snoozefest once you learn a set of actions to take for each different kind of enemy. The puzzles, if you can call them that, mostly just involve running around trying to match patterns against the world you&apos;re in, over and over and over and over. You spend more time in this game trying to find these irritating shapes than doing anything else. That or changing the world by running through portals to open paths or doors. Abandoned after 5 hours of the same thing. Save yourself the money and just watch a walkthrough on youtube if you want to see the story. Its not worth it for the gameplay</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7637368">Expand</a></span>

The fights and puzzles is a downside for this game, as it is very repetitive and boring. Downsides apart, i do recommend the game for it&apos;s beauty.</span>

<br>It is cancerous because you do not know what the actual **** is going on but catharsis comes as you get close to the end of game. It is such a dark story revolving around grimy environment; however how she endures and manages her darkness is quiet beautiful. Puzzles and combats are not the greatest and much easier than it seems but it is only 7 hours of playtime so game ends before you get sick of it. Some complain that it has no tutorial but if there is tutorial this game will be extremely boring....
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, even if I enjoyed the game, I can see why some people hate this game.... If you are fast paced action adrenaline rushing Michael Bay explosion type of guy, do not play this game. It will rot you out. I like to listen and read the lore of the games I play but dam some parts I really wanted to skip.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7458152">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re the type who&apos;s just in it for the combat, pass.  Combat is crisp and responsive, but overall it really doesn&apos;t feel like combat is the central focus of the game.

<br>What shocked me most is watching the featurette after playing. They described how sufferers of psychosis can often feel paranoid, disoriented, and at times even nauseous. I thought back to playing the game, and recalled the longer I played in a session the more I felt these feelings creeping up on me.  I recalled times arguing in my own head with the voices, insisting they&apos;re wrong to convince myself to do the right thing and progress forward. I recall trying to piece together what parts of the story were &quot;real&quot; and which weren&apos;t, but how can you really be sure? The studio put a lot of work into ensuring the experience was as authentic and genuine as possible, and it really does show.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7479364">Expand</a></span>

The level of detail and work that they have put into getting this right is simply unmatched and I honestly feel I have learned about something that I would never have touched in any other medium.

But omg, it really make me feel or imagine what Senua its feeling. It&#xB4;s a cinematic game to be share with others. The combats are easy if you find the patterns. You will not regret the decision to buy it.</span>

The pace is definately slower than I expected it to be as Ninja Theory, creators of the outstanding Heavenly Sword, is known for giving fans fast paced action games. Exploration and puzzle solving takes a lot bigger role than I previously thought, but I did not mind as some of my favorite franchises like Uncharted or Tomb Raider have plenty of those as well. But the reason why this game is so great is because it is still different than the upper mentioned games, as a matter of fact it is very different from any game I ever played. Our hero, Senua, is mentally ill and that plays a vital role in the story and also how she sees the world. And it is a frightening and disturbing world, filled with violently killed dead bodies, scary wooden statues and there are these constant noises/voices in Senua&apos;s head that makes just walking in the woods crazy as well. The setting is superb, it is based on Celtic and Norse mythology and it is very unique. There is also NO HUD at all on the screen, which is awesome! No mini map, no crosshair, nothing, it is just you and the environment. I love it!
<br>When the action heats up, combat is as good as it gets. The over the shoulder camera works excellent and Senua is a master with the sword and also have some devastating kicks in her arsenal. The fighting scenes are my favorite parts of the game, it is superb.
<br>The voice acting is also stellar, and the graphics are gorgeous. If you wanna just hack and slash this is not your game, but if you like exploring, a great story and some fun action, then you will enjoy this for sure. A must play for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7455712">Expand</a></span>

But everyone has a pantheon in their minds of the triumphs in game design: the names that spring to mind immediately when a friend has been out of the loop and asks you for recommendations on games. Hellblade joins my list immediately.
<br>
<br>There are snags: weird instances of poor level design, chiefly. But overall, the game radically overshoots in areas that I merely expected to be good. The graphics are an obvious point, but sound is phenomenal (and headphones are essential, or you&apos;ll miss out on the 3d binaural effects which cannot be replicated by any other speakers). The swordplay is remarkably well done. I thought it would be serviceable, an interlude between the exploration and the story beats, but it&apos;s genuinely great; I can only think of one game that genuinely does this better.
<br>
<br>The acting is beyond any performance I&apos;ve seen in a game yet. It&apos;s part and parcel of the careful research into psychosis. The use of this theme was one with which I expected to have problems - in the history of games, Alan Wake is about as good as it gets for the incorporation of mental illness into a hero&apos;s story. The performance of Melina Jeurgens and the actors who play Senua&apos;s voices comprise a huge step forward in acting standards in games, and the description of Senua&apos;s experience is truthful and respectful.
<br>
<br>Yes, it&apos;s only a 7-9-hour game. It blows my mind, however, that people would happily snap up an average but longer game in preference to one that pushes the limits of what a game can communicate. I&apos;d rather have the game that beams beauty from beginning to end and sets a new standard for tomorrow&apos;s games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7465946">Expand</a></span>

This game is a slap in the face of the giant greedy publishers, for the sake of the game industry i hope this game is a success.</span>

<br>If you like games with deep story, amazing graphics, interesting puzzles and having the opportunity to play something different than Call Of Duty, Assassin&apos;s Creed or FarCry then give it a try. It&apos;s not a hardcore game, you will beat it easy but as I said it&apos;s not about the fights or the smashing buttons is about the story and the settings they put in front of you.
<br>
<br>For me, best game so far this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7460794">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would have liked the option to completely remove antialiasing filters, as I prefer jaggies to slight blur (which gives me eyestrain headaches), but it&apos;s prbably not too bad on a smaller screen.
<br>The movement speed of Senua feels slow initially after other games, but you get used to it and it suits the game, although it made traversing some of the larger terrain puzzles feel tedious early on.
<br>I left the difficulty on auto, and found the fights challenging and exciting, but not too punishing. Pretty well perfect for me. I only died half a dozen times all up, but there were a lot of close calls! some of those fights are intense!
<br>This game is just an amazing journey to experience.

<br>
<br>In short, this hell of an atrocious PC port. As exclusive mouse and keyboard player I found this game unplayable due to how mouse support been handled.
<br>
<br>So here are the following issues that make game unplayable:
<br>
<br>- camera angle and FOV cause serious motion sickness - could not manage to fix this by tweaking config files. The game has also fish-eye effect even at default FOV, when you move camera, view distorts (like looking thru magnifying glass) and that makes me nauseous.
<br>- you can&apos;t fully eliminate motion blur and blur (get&apos;s slightly better when lowering post-processing setting in graphics menu), which is annoyingly overdone.
<br>- mouse has no settings whatsoever in game&apos;s menus. It has some weird input lag, doesn&apos;t react to fast movements, the sensitivity is way off, doesn&apos;t react to DPI changes on mouse itself. It&apos;s definitely not a raw input - they use some consolish shenanigans fit for controllers. Tried to fix it in config files, got slightly better but still unplayable.
<br>
<br>Summing up, this is one of the worst PC ports I&apos;ve touched in years. It&apos;s on the level of Darks Souls 1 with mouse and keyboard or even worse.
<br>
<br>I strongly advice not to buy this game if your are mouse &amp; keyboard gamer. Even with controller I don&apos;t think FOV, motion blur and blur will make it very pleasant experience (unless you hook it to huge tv and play from several meters away).
<br>
<br>As I said, can&apos;t judge the game itself (gameplay, story, etc) because technical issues make it unplayable for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7466209">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fans of heavily intense action or fans of  loot are advised that this game &quot;could&quot; not be for them.
<br>This is NOT an RPG in which you have to find tons of  equipment scavenging through huge maps to explore, this is NOT a pure hack &apos;n slash game, is an &quot;adventure game&quot; in which you journey along Senua, the main character, guiding her trip which is composed of environmental puzzles to solve in order to progress in your journey, enemies to fight, with an (for me) intuitive, immediate, intense, balanced, responsive, visceral and very satisfying combat system, flavored with truly amazing animations.
<br>
<br>Aside from a single pattern in the puzzles the game presents, which is recurring often, and maybe another one you can face in few instances, the game always presents you different approaches you need to take in every situation, this means that in one part you could need to find your path in one way, in the following one you&apos;ll need to look for something else, puzzles involves mazes, even if not overly complex ones, to some extent there is a bit of stealth, there&apos;s a bit of time travel, there are intriguing boss fights,, it&apos;s a good mix of various intriguing game mechanics.
<br>
<br>As Senua, the main character is a female Celtic warrior suffering of psychosis, you&apos;ll not have a HUD guiding your journey, instead is present a mix of visual/acoustic hints in the form mainly of voices in her head, which sometimes can tell you the truth, some other those will plainly lie at you, or hallucinations which can usually prove themselves very helpful in guiding your insight, the game often tries to trick your mind in every way possible, that&apos;s a fascinating way to replace a nowaday outdated HUD system, which is possible due to its perfect integration with the main character mental status
<br>.
<br>From a graphical and acoustic standpoint the game is simply astonishing, it&apos;s highly advisable in this case to follow the game hint to play it with a pair of headphones for the best experience.
<br>
<br>There are collectibles in the game under the form of lorestones which will tell you pieces of Norse mythology, useless to say that collecting all of them &quot;may&quot; grant you some kind of a reward.
<br>
<br>All in all I found it to be an extremely balanced adventure game with the ability to awe you AND give you the chills in many situations.
<br>
<br>For what it is, in my opinion it well deserves a 10 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468076">Expand</a></span>

<br>It would be far better if you have fought just two or three of them but with a twist or a challenge.
<br>With poorly responsive character you ending up going again and again and again and again through the same fight sequences over and over again cause game returns you to last save before the fight.
<br>Stop it, it&apos;s dull, mind numbing and boring...
<br>The combat in this game is redundant in first place... It&apos;s a tacked on feature to please the &quot;average&quot; (CoD or Dark Souls) gamer but it does a very poor job on it.
<br>
<br>If you want a challenge and a combat experience then go somewhere else.
<br>If you want a reach and interesting story yet you patient enough to suffer through forced combat scenarios then by all mean try this game.
<br>
<br>Why 8/10?  Forced, unnecessary and boring combat and some performance issues. Otherwise brilliant game.
<br>
<br>PS: Ninja Theory...  Please, don&apos;t listen to all those idiots asking for arena mode.
<br>Do another amazing game for less brain dead people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7472964">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics: 9.5/10
<br>========
<br>This game is breathtaking at some points. Especially on PC (I played on GTX 1070). I don&apos;t really need to say much, you can see for yourself on Youtube
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 9/10
<br>==========
<br>
<br>The fighting is elegant, satisfying, and snappy. It gives the impression that it&apos;s too simplistic, but due to the fact that there is no tutorial, you will keep discovering new moves as you go.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are hit and miss, some of them are extremely satisfying, and some are just meh!
<br>
<br>Story: 8.5/10
<br>=========
<br>The story is very interesting and at some points will keep you on the edge of your seat. But the ending is not well explained and could take you a bit to understand it.
<br>
<br>Sound and Music: 10/10
<br>================
<br>
<br>Simply amazing. Voice acting , music, sound effects, etc... are top notch. Again, you can have a listen for yourself on youtube as well.
<br>
<br>I realize that the aggregate score should not be 10/10, but because this game was made by 16 people and on a limited budget, I think we should all support it, so they could pave the way to more high quality indie titles, like this one.

<br>The theme is hard, but well managed. The combat system is impressive and immersive, even if not original, it takes you in another world, where you try to survive against your body &amp; your mind.
<br>I strongly recommand this game, except if you are a sensitive person and/or fear darkness.</span>

The developers succeeded at creating a highly atmospheric and immersive game with absolutely beautiful graphics. The game was released without any bugs, it runs absolutely smoothly without any frame drops. All of this is something that AAA titles more and more often fail to deliver on. This game is an excellent example that sometimes less is more, smaller, detailed areas can be much better than large open world, empty, soulless, artificial areas with frame drops. The game is also not packed full of useless &apos;features&apos; and gimmicky stuff. The combat is basic, but fun, competent and not depending on luck or button mashing.
<br>This story is beautifully told and if someone is interested in norse lore this game is a must have anyways. Many AAA titles these fail at telling a story. This nice, little game does it excellently.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7490260">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But it doesn&apos;t stop there. Their main character was purposely made to be incredibly ugly, like it&apos;s extremely hard to not look away when you see her face, it&apos;s disgustingly ugly and it&apos;s just like with Mass Effect Andromeda, apparently it is politically correct now to make your characters butt-ugly. She doesn&apos;t even look like a female, at all. Also, I&apos;m training to be a psychologist, and I can safely say the game&apos;s interpretation of mental illness is naive at BEST. A person with psychosis would not die as a result of their hallucinations like Setsuna does frequently. Their would be no plague crawling up their arm. You can&apos;t try to mimic a real life mental illness and make it fit along with your fantasy mythology, it just doesn&apos;t work. You will regret buying this game. You would probably even regret pirating it too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7469682">Expand</a></span>

It makes a huge impression. The setting, story, cutscenes, sound, art design... Very impressive. Graphics quality is almost on point, texture quality is a bit lacking at times and some postprocessing effects tend to be overdone, but on the other hand, how this game looks and what it does in some moments and areas... unlike anything I have seen in years of playing games. It has a bit of a bad start, but after first boss the game is getting really good. Gameplay is very diversified, there are lot of aspects, logical, action, combat, even some thriller/horror parts. It is also fully independent, DRM free, half of price of &quot;AAA&quot; games that aren&apos;t even playable in first months and are usually &quot;synthetic&quot; and have no emotional or intellectual value. I consider this game a huge success. Hate and rants from reasonless or soulless people are even making it more so. Not even mentioning people who don&apos;t understand that there different genres of games. I wasn&apos;t even aware of this game and it came out of nowhere for me, and I am SO glad that it did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7468959">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m a sucker for everything Viking/Nordic, but even I can&apos;t stomach this tripe. The fact that it&apos;s getting such high scores across the lolmedia is the icing on the cake. What a joke.
<br>
<br>The graphics are pretty garbage - screen is smeared by every filter under the sun, 10x over, to mask substandard asset quality. The camera/fov is smushed too close to the character. She looks like Spoony. It&apos;s that bad. Tumblr approved and Neogaf GOTY 2017.

Even for a Walking Sim it is slow paced, I mean wading waist deep in treacle slow.

If you&apos;re looking for a Lara Croft type exploring /levelling up/crafting/inventory led adventure, you&apos;re gonna be disappointed; If you&apos;re looking for a DmC/Bayonetta comic book Hack&apos;n&apos;slash, you&apos;re gonna be disappointed, if you&apos;re looking for a Witness/Obduction/Myst puzzler you are gonna be disappointed.
<br>If however you are looking for one of the most affecting original titles for a long long time, then Hellblade is a stone cold classic and a work of genius that redraws the line between walking sim and adventure gaming.
<br>I have nothing but admiration for the developers in putting out such a game dealing with Mental Health, although this &quot;worthy&quot; tag may well be a Red Flag to a lot of Gamers who like their gaming to be light frothy and inconsequential.  Right from the opening sequence the game makes no bones about it taking you to some dark dark places.
<br>Great soundscape, great graphics and a truly emotional experience.
<br>Highly recommended</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7464677">Expand</a></span>

I cannot remember ever feeling so on edge while playing a game, but still finding myself enjoying the experience. The developer&apos;s handling of the sensitive subject that is mental illness and the actress who portrayed Senua as such a powerful yet deeply fragile character deserve the utmost praise.</span>

<br>
<br>This game could have more things to do than just line up ravens, walk the path, look at things, etc.. They could have little things to fight instead of the same creatures over and over again and the puzzles could be a little more challenging and on topic such as maybe digging a grave and putting the bones back in the certain headstone, something other than just looking at things. BUT like I said, the atmosphere more than makes up for it and Im only an hour in. Im not bashing this game by any means, just a tad bit linear at times so far.
<br>
<br>Also, the fighting is super easy. The villains could be a little harder to beat maybe? But who knows, maybe it gets harder as it goes? Im sure it does.
<br>
<br>I give it an 8-9 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7469211">Expand</a></span>

Music was epic, especially at the end .. spend almost 4 hours at the end battle. Game lacks some basics options, like mouse sensitivity option, especially when running around and solving puzzles, its was no problem when fighting. Really loved the game.</span>

                                        <span>It was a game full of surprises, twists and i mean mind twists and turns. Great Psychological thriller game. Enjoyed playing it. One thing i didn&apos;t like about this game is that it was made a bit draggy maybe because of the short story, apart from that it was good whether it is graphics or whatever, it was nice.
<br>Voices, mind games, everything was amazing.</span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a gamer for over 30 years and what I like has definitely changed over the years. What I look for in a game really changed after playing The Last of Us. A game that tells a great story, gets you emotionally involved in the game and has you actually care about a factional character. I wouldn&apos;t have thought that was possible. Ninja Theory did a great job of doing exactly that for me. Yes it&apos;s a slower pace and you have to work more to understand the story(pay attention to the lorestone and the voices) but if you do it&apos;s a great story. It&apos;s a very difficult subject but they pull it off very nicely.
<br>
<br>The combat is simple but it was satisfying for me. Because of the permadeath or threat of it made for some very intense combat. Combine that with the visual and audio excellence it made for a very satisfying game for me, especially for 30 bucks!
<br>
<br>I understand why this game will not appeal to some but it makes no sense to hate it especially just because people like me love it. For example I find most other games boring, especially most shooters but I would never give any red reviews but because it didn&apos;t appeal to me.
<br>
<br>In the end if you don&apos;t mind a slower pace, care about story and character development with combat being just part of the game not a majority, give this game a try. I hope you get as much enjoyment out of it as I have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7518581">Expand</a></span>

<br>A dark action adventure game that focuses primarily on storytelling. The graphics are bleeding edge compared to most other AAA games as of recent, which is a pleasant surprise.
<br>
<br>Lots of work was put into making sure the textures and models were clear and realistic enough that they could even be passed off as being taken straight out of a movie. The high production value is also not something you see everyday in a video game.
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>Hellblade talks about an exile who lost the man she loved and is having difficulty coping with that reality. Broken and suffering from psychosis, she embarks on a lonesome journey to &quot;defy the darkness&quot; in an effort to bring him back from death.
<br>
<br>Her visions get increasingly worse as she heads deeper into &quot;Hel&quot;, defying the voices in her head who constantly tell her to give up on her love and to move on. In a way, the story plays out similarly to the stories of the first few God of War games.
<br>
<br>The story can be somewhat confusing at times due to the use of Norse mythology, but if you take the overall plot of Senua&apos;s suffering at face value, it becomes understandable. The goal of the game is to immerse the player into the world of demons that Senua travels through.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>This game is primarily an adventure game with added fighting scenes and puzzles. Puzzles are a primary factor of this game and they act as trials required to progress the story. Some of the puzzles are difficult while some are straightforward.
<br>
<br>Permanent death exists in this game if you die too much, but you are explicitly warned about it in the very beginning. If you fear the permadeath aspect, lower the difficulty in the settings. I personally haven&apos;t found it to be a big deal though, since the game is pretty generous with dying and I think each new area you reach &quot;resets&quot; your lives.
<br>
<br>The combat appears simplistic due to the limited actions available and the predictable enemies, but it doesn&apos;t mean you can blindly fight and expect to win. You most certainly cannot just &quot;mash&quot; the attack button. Not knowing when to dodge or block an attack can cost you a life. Don&apos;t expect it to be a walk in the park as the enemies usually gang up on you in groups and come at you in waves.
<br>
<br>Difficulty by default is set to &quot;Auto&quot;. This means that if you die too much early on, the game will scale down its difficulty immediately. This is likely where all of the other reviewers got their notion of &quot;easy&quot; from: They&apos;ve died too much. If you want to have the full experience, manually set the difficulty higher yourself.
<br>
<br>Hellblade is a largely linear game. Weapons and items don&apos;t exist in the game, nor are there any side quests or even people for that matter. You&apos;ll be doing a lot of walking and listening to the story unfold in her mind. The game does not have an &quot;NG+&quot; after it is over; you simply play through it once and then your save file is erased for you to start over, if you so desire.
<br>
<br>SUMMARY
<br>Not much can be said about this game without spoiling it. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience a unique story about psychosis. You won&apos;t regret spending the time to play this game, but don&apos;t set your expectations too high since the combat is not the main factor of the game.
<br>
<br>The game is somewhat short. You should be able to get around 7-10 hours out of the game, assuming you don&apos;t die too much or get stuck on the puzzles for too long.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving this game a very generous 9/10 for being a one-of-a-kind experience. No other game will ever mirror this one with its high quality cinematic execution and focus on mental illness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/user-reviews?user_review_id=7577922">Expand</a></span>
