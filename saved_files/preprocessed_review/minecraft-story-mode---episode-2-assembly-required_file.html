<br>
<br>On a second note, the technical aspect is the worse of all product Telltale released yet. I&apos;ve seen subtitles not matching the speech, the lipsync is seriously desync, and the language is now taken of the Windows locale instead of the game config.

<br>I was proven wrong. Somehow.
<br>
<br>This one has all the same problems as the last one (Bad graphics, Terrible voice acting and music, and the choices affect nothing.) This game carries over all it&apos;s flaws, and adds new ones.
<br>*Sigh* I have to talk about this though, because I hope telltale sees this and stops making this game.
<br>
<br>This biggest problem about THIS one is IT WAS VERY RUSHED!! It took TWO WEEKS to get out. No telltale game can be made in that time.
<br>
<br>I beat the episode in less than 80 minutes, a good 40 minutes shorter than the first one, and the choices STILL don&apos;t have a difference.
<br>I picked up Ellegard instead of Soaryn. When I came back, Axle got Soaryn anyway. I bet that is true for the other way around because this game says THE PLOT is THISWAY and NOPE NO CHANGING IT MUAAHHAHAA.
<br>
<br>Opinions:
<br>+Stays true to minecraft
<br>+Hey, they got rid of the crafting scenes
<br>*The quicktime events are still here
<br>*I picked up Ellegard
<br>*I never died
<br>*How did Ivor get a command block?
<br>- Bad graphics
<br>- The voice actors should be fired
<br>- Bad and repetitive music
<br>- Choices have no effect to the story
<br>- Gabrille means Wither effect, not Wither sickness
<br>- YOU CANNOT CRAFT A COMMAND BLOCK (minecraft 2.0 confirmed?)
<br>- Ivor uses a speed 100 potion at the end, which is not obtainable in survival mode.
<br>- Minecarts cannot travel 150 blocks per second.
<br>- I stole a repeater
<br>- Boring af combat
<br>- This game exists
<br>- Telltale thought this was a good idea.
<br>- I&apos;d rather beat sonic boom than play both episodes for a livestream.
<br>- Introduces more one sided characters (the two who fight a lot)
<br>- Petra still isn&apos;t here
<br>- The game is garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-2-assembly-required/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661872">Expand</a></span>

The first half hour of the game can get different depending on your choice in the last episode, the ending is epic, but the episode terminates only the first hour of the game, and then Teltale let us down a bit. Because of this, I lowered the rating ...</span>

I suppose the options made more of a difference this time so there is more to explore but still. at least the plot progression was good.</span>

<br>The episode continues off where it left off, where you&apos;re trying to find the members of The Order of the Stone.  If you went with Axel, you went and found Magnus the Rouge.  If you went with Olivia, you met Ellegaard the Engineer. Now you venture to find Soren the Architect, and it&apos;s just.. ugh.  The episode is EXTREMELY short, I beat it in less than an hour, and most Telltale game episodes need to be longer to get a better understanding as to what is going on in the game.  The episode had some cool moments, like Petra/Gabriel getting infected by the Wither, a bitter rivalry between Magnus and Ellegaard, and some of the characters in Boom Town and the Redstone Kingdom are pretty cool.  This episode had some pretty interesting moments, but it stumbled in terms of progress.

<br>Episode 2 of Minecraft story mode was quite good in introducing the Order of the Stone, but other than that... There&apos;s not too much. While in my Episode 1 review I did say that the other episodes were good and this episode is good, but it&apos;s not the best...
<br>Firstly, you must find one of the order members. Either Ellegaard or Magnus. It all depends on who you go with (Olivia or Axel) unfortunately, you can only go to one of these places. Either Redstonia or Boom Town. (I recommend Boom Town ^^)
<br>And... That&apos;s it. All in all, very short and lackluster but as i said before, it introduces the order of the stone (Which are some interesting characters) and the story is just getting juicy ^^</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-2-assembly-required/user-reviews?user_review_id=5952664">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This Minecraft SM Episode is very good and one of the best Minecraft Story Mode Episode. M: SM is like in The Walking Dead, but The Walking Dead is much better. I think Minecraft is **** but Minecraft: Story Mode is good game, first Episode is **** but second, third and other is much better and very good and interesting and storyline in Episode 2 is very amazing. Very good</span>
