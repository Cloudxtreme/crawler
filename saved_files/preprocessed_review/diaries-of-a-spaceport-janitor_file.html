In a recent update they released BASIC unity options (why isn&apos;t this game early access)
<br>
<br>I got a good way into the game. Everything in the stalls is still way too expensive for me to use but I&apos;m not sure if I will ever get to use those items because I ran into a game breaking bug that deleted all my inventory items.
<br>
<br>Everything about this game feels unstable. That helps, but because of it I don&apos;t want to get another 5 hours in and just lose all my progress again. 5 more hours of this same gameplay loop doesn&apos;t sound that interesting to me. There&apos;s not as much to customize about your character or environment as there are in Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. Even though you can change your gender on a whim all it becomes is just another resource with some goofy flavor text that goes along with it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s in Unity so maybe mods could save this game or maybe it will get better with future updates. But as the game is upon release I can&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diaries-of-a-spaceport-janitor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6710655">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re looking for an experience where you can just jump into a creative world and live in it - this is it. The city is odd and dense, the inhabitants create a sense of business, and the skull floating your shoulder becomes a constant reminder that it takes effort to escape the ordinary.
<br>
<br>There are very little graphical &quot;bugs&quot;, screen bending is a condition that requires curing, and the flickering on posters is a part of the game&apos;s atmosphere. The stalls are expensive because they&apos;re catered not to you - an ordinary janitor - but to the great and brave adventurers who you would one day hope to be.
<br>
<br>Your first step to adventure begins in the city&apos;s sewers, part of a large interconnected network of ancient dungeons, where you find your skull friend. After that, the game becomes a cure to rid yourself of the skull - while also managing the daily necessities of work and life.
<br>
<br>Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is by no means for everyone. For some, it&apos;s a nice place to escape to. Some enjoy the experience. Others find meaning in the strange gender-bending, trash-hording, sewer-crawling aspects of the game. For me, it&apos;s something new, and it&apos;s brave in what it does. You can get lost in this game. Whether you try to rid of the skull that haunts you, or simply life your life in hopes of making a more decent living, is all up to you. It&apos;s a bit analogous to reality in that way. Whenever I find myself playing this game, I can&apos;t help but feel a bit inspired.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diaries-of-a-spaceport-janitor/user-reviews?user_review_id=7030956">Expand</a></span>
