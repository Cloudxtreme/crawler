<br>
<br>The game could have beem a bit more challenging in my opinion, however, as the different puzzles (with a few exceptions) rarely took more than a few minutes to solve. Even some of the later ones seemed a bit rushed and too easy to solve, but again, it could just be me. There were also some audio logs which were barely audible (subtitles don&apos;t show up for the logs either for some reason) and some odd spelling/grammatical mistakes in the texts here and there, but that&apos;s just nitpicking.
<br>
<br>Great game overall, be sure to check it out if you want some brain exercise coupled with an interesting story!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-turing-test/user-reviews?user_review_id=6719092">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In this case, you are controlling a woman called Ava Turing, who is being commanded by TOM, the AI of the mission, to go down to the surface, reacquire communications with the crew (which is rebelling against him), and to eventually help him to stop the crew from escaping Europa with an organism they found there which potentially threatens life on Earth.
<br>
<br>The core story here is actually fairly decent &#x2013; the premise of the tests being set up to prove you are human (as they are designed to keep out TOM, the AI, but not Ava, the human), as TOM is not programmed to be creative (in fact, he is specifically programmed not to be, making him inflexible and rigid &#x2013; exactly what the mission needs in its AI). As you go through the tests, TOM and Ava talk about the Turing Test, the Chinese Room, and various other ideas about free will and whether or not AIs are really &#x201C;intelligent&#x201D;. TOM himself seems to argue both sides when convenient; he claims he is nothing more than a calculator, but clearly has feelings and emotions and gets angry when treated like nothing more than a machine.
<br>
<br>There&#x2019;s a twist about halfway through the story; I had thought it was going to be either that the whole thing was a simulation (i.e. none of it was real, it was all a test of the AI to determine how it would respond to a situation like this) or that it was going to just repeat the Bioshock plot twist straight up. Instead it went for something a bit new, which I liked, as while I&#x2019;ve thought about that particular twist before, I&#x2019;ve never seen a game actually do it.
<br>
<br>Sadly, while the twist ultimately unlocks the last gameplay element, the gameplay element of looking through cameras and controlling robots and triggering switches through them is something that Watch Dogs did several years ago. And given that the other puzzle mechanics of the game are standing on switches, putting heavy things on switches, and grabbing and manipulating balls of light from a distance to put into power slots to power things&#x2026; it ain&#x2019;t exactly the most innovative game ever.
<br>
<br>Indeed, the actual puzzle gameplay is just not very good. The rooms are thankfully very short, each relying on a particular bit of lateral thinking, and are mostly quite simple puzzles, with only a few really being all that long. This is mostly a good thing, but it ultimately makes the game feel a bit shallow &#x2013; I never got any great sense of achievement or reward for solving the puzzles, and most of them were very easy. There were 77 puzzles in all in the game, and overall it took me about 6 hours to 100% it.
<br>
<br>And I have to say, even on top of that, I wasn&#x2019;t overly fond of the characters, either. TOM at least has some personality, but Ava is pretty bland, and by the end of it, I never really identified a single major character trait from her. The other characters &#x2013; who you get to hear the audio logs of &#x2013; are not particularly interesting either, with only the captain feeling like he has more than one note to his personality. And even TOM doesn&#x2019;t always feel like he is written all that consistently &#x2013; he argues with the crew about how he is really a person, and argues with Ava about how he isn&#x2019;t. While him being two-faced and untrustworthy is a big part of the plot, it would have been nice for him to more directly acknowledge his own hypocrisy &#x2013; instead, not even the characters arguing with him do so.
<br>
<br>The result was that this game didn&#x2019;t really touch me. It had a couple interesting ideas in its story and playing with its medium as a game, but as a game, it felt dull, uninspired, and unoriginal, without any memorable gameplay or setpieces. While it tries to be philosophical, it is nowhere near the level of something like The Talos Principle, and while the sterile testing environment (and some of the elements, like the switches and light bridges) are reminiscent of Portal, it is lacking in the character of those games as well.
<br>
<br>Ultimately the game as a whole just ends up being rather flat. It never really did anything particularly interesting with itself, the story isn&#x2019;t good enough to be worth playing through the game for, and the characters aren&#x2019;t memorable. Is it terrible? No. But it doesn&#x2019;t excel in any way.
<br>
<br>You&#x2019;ve got better things to do with your time and money than play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-turing-test/user-reviews?user_review_id=7314608">Expand</a></span>

Si vede subito che &#xE9; ispirato al capolavoro di Valve, e fa bene! Il gameplay &#xE9; &quot;a stanze&quot; , con un crescendo di difficolt&#xE1; e di possibilit&#xE1; di gioco. L&apos; ambientazione &#xE9; quella di una stazione spaziale molto lontana, abbandonata, nella quale non riusciamo a trovare il personale e non capiamo il perch&#xE9; sia scomparso. Il gioco si presenta molto bene, addirittura con una scena fuori all&apos;aperto e qualche sporadica finestra che ci fa scrutare fuori (adoro questi dettagli). Ritengo che il gioco sia molto equilibrato, ben narrato e in generale molto ben fatto. L&apos;aspetto tecnico &#xE9; eccezionale, con un Unreal Engine 4 sfruttato benissimo. Le musiche sono azzeccate e le voci narranti sono piacevoli da sentire. Anche la storia ha un suo perch&#xE9;. &#xC9; un gioco abbastanza &quot;semplice&quot; come struttura ma talmente ben messo assieme che lo consiglio caldamente a tutti coloro che hanno amato Portal (1 e 2). Una perla, nel suo genere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-turing-test/user-reviews?user_review_id=7447315">Expand</a></span>

The way the story and philosophical elements are introduced is done in a very blunt and contrived manner, with little subtlety and nuance. When we get snippets of dialogue between Ava and Tom, this is supposed to highlight an engaging debate about the capabilities and limitations of AI and humans, yet the arguments posited from both sides are weak and unconvincing. I also should mention that the setup of the story is pretty weak as well. The whole notion that an extremophile organism with DNA repair capacity somehow definitively translates to immortality for all life-forms is simply laughable and ridiculous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-turing-test/user-reviews?user_review_id=7517838">Expand</a></span>

<br>Except that, the puzzles weren&apos;t that hard and u could finish the game in few hours, so im not sure if its worth the full price, maybe if its on a sale.</span>
