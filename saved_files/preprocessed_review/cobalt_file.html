<br>Story: 8/10. A solid plot with plenty of humour. Not a masterpiece, but the story is conveyed excellently through the campaign style. Story mode is not the primary focus of Cobalt, but it is a lengthy, challenging and rewarding campaign. The lore behind the game is intriguing and leaks through into some of the arcade mode maps, which I think is a really nice touch.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9/10. It&apos;s not beautiful pixel art and it&apos;s no Mona Lisa, but playing some of the custom maps completely convinced me that this game can look really amazing.
<br>
<br>Sound: 9/10. The music is catchy and memorable and the sound fx perfectly match what is happening in-game, slowing down when the time dilation kicks in. I can&apos;t think of anything I would change here.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Beyond 10. In an age of games where the gameplay is often left to one side, Cobalt turns around and says &quot;here&apos;s what it means to be a gameplay focused game.&quot; The entire game is physical and feels very natural after a while at the controls. There are really endless possibilities to what can be done inside the Cobalt engine, which is why I&apos;m incredibly excited to see that there are already modding possibilities. Never before have I played a game that creates so many awesome moments. Doing a backflip over a missile whilst shooting your gun at a grenade so it bounces off a wall and into another player is just tame to me now. This is the game that will make you squeal, will make you sweat and will make you feel like the most awesome person in the universe.
<br>
<br>Cobalt sets the bar for gameplay now. Forget Mario, forget Smash Bros, forget every other game under the sun. I will never be able to look at another game again the same way. If you think this is just another arena brawler like Duck Game and Towerfall then think again. I can&apos;t play those kind of games anymore without thinking &quot;man, I&apos;d rather just be playing Cobalt.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cobalt/user-reviews?user_review_id=6063933">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Gameplay: The most interesting part is that you deflect bullets when rolling but it&apos;s not all that useful. Levels don&apos;t have a real flow to them.
<br>-Graphics: art style is generic but not bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cobalt/user-reviews?user_review_id=6520260">Expand</a></span>
