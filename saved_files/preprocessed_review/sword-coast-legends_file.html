<br>
<br>Limited classes, No skill checks, Bad AI,, no crafting and I could go on and on.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s so unfortunate it&apos;s so far removed from DnD and is catered for a gamer that does not like to be challenged in a game. Thankfully some DEVS are still bringing out games which do. Divinity Original Sin, Pillars of eternity for example are vastly better games.
<br>
<br>True this game has the ability to have a DM. But it&apos;s so limited that I&apos;d really prefer to not have it at all.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d suggest going elsewhere for a solid cRPG or, play this with an open mind and a very limited feeling of achievement when you finish it.
<br>
<br>Shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5576667">Expand</a></span>

N-spaces bar for the DM tools is that they wanted to make it so easy an 8 year old could use it.  Having done that they have limited it so much there is no way to make an EPIC adventure as stated in one of their selling points.
<br>
<br>The game as it stands right now would be ok if you can catch it on sale for less than $30.  Maybe after a year of updates it will be something special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5574112">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Limited classes, No skill checks, Bad AI,, no crafting and I could go on and on.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s so unfortunate it&apos;s so far removed from DnD and is catered for a gamer that does not like to be challenged in a game. Thankfully some DEVS are still bringing out games which do. Divinity Original Sin, Pillars of eternity for example are vastly better games.
<br>
<br>True this game has the ability to have a DM. But it&apos;s so limited that I&apos;d really prefer to not have it at all.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d suggest going elsewhere for a solid cRPG or, play this with an open mind and a very limited feeling of achievement when you finish it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5581047">Expand</a></span>

<br>I play PnP 3rd and 5th edition. I loved games like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate. The game itself is great fun - with a group of friends and a good DM. If you play with strangers or solo, maybe not so much. The current toolset is limiting at present, but with a bit of creativity on the part of the DM (and willing players) - you will find it actually is quite a good interpretation of PnP. The game gives you the option to play it in a hack-n-slash way, or with deeply involved RP - just make sure you are grouped with people that understand what you want out of the game and it will work for you.
<br>
<br>If we were to draw comparisons on games - it&apos;s like a mix between NWN and DA:O. If you liked either (or both) of those games, you may well like this. It&apos;s less &quot;fully-featured&quot; than NWN in terms of mechanics and toolset, but the similarities are there. Just beware of this going in.
<br>
<br>Graphically it is pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but it does what it does well enough. The music and sound is really good as well. Most main campaign quest dialogue is voiced, while other side-quests are not. There are no cutscenes for dialogue, the camera instead moved down nearer to the characters as speech takes place.
<br>
<br>The module creation toolset is okay. It is fairly limited at present (nowhere near the complexity of the NWN toolset, for instance). You can create/select areas based on pre-defined tilesets and place objects, creatures and the like in the area. Dungeons are randomly generated, based off several initial factors, such as difficulty, complexity, tileset, monster set etc. Once generated, you can then visit the area and further customise it to your liking, including adding bosses, quests, NPC,s and objects. The predefined quests are &quot;kill boss&quot;, &quot;kill monsters&quot; and &quot;collect materials&quot; - which you can quickly assign and customise to your liking. There is also a custom quest generator to give you greater control over the quests. You can create monsters, NPC&apos;s and characters to add to your adventures - all with lots of customisation options such as appearance, abilities and attributes. You can even create custom creature sets. Modules can be uploaded to share with others in the world - and downloaded just as easy. This gives you instant access to a wealth of community content (with ratings), ensuring there is always something new to experience and will extend your play-time dramatically.
<br>
<br>The DM (Dungeon Master) mode is another important feature to the game. Here, you get to play as a &quot;fifth character&quot; (of sorts). In this mode, you don&apos;t control a party member or contribute to the game in a &quot;normal&quot; way, instead you take control of the other players experience - by customising it as they play. This can be in the form of adding or removing monsters, placing objects, setting up quests, possessing creatures and the like. This is where the game really opens up into much more of a roleplaying game. The way in which the players interact with the challenges the DM poses are key to the game - and as any D&amp;D player will tell you, key to PnP (Pen and Paper) gaming as well. For example: you may have a locked door and a custom NPC guarding it. As the DM, you can talk to the players through this NPC - getting them to possibly roll a diplomacy check to appease the NPC. If the party fails, you could turn the NPC hostile and a fight will ensue. Another example: your party is crossing a bridge. As the DM, you can pause the game and ask the players to roll a spot check. If they fail you could spawn a hidden assassin to ambush them. The possibilities are endless - and the DM role is very important in this game. It&apos;s also quite a lot of fun to boot. DM&apos;s can be rated on three different categories (out of 5) - which players get to do at the end of a session. This means that you will hopefully know what you are in-for with a DM you do not know.
<br>
<br>The campaign has an interesting story and is generally quite enjoyable. Most of the things that are &quot;missing&quot; from module creation are present here - such as branching dialogue, skill checks and more &quot;custom&quot; areas. Companions are fully voiced, as is the main quest &quot;path&quot;. Some of the voice acting is superb. It also features a novel addition whereby you are not forced to bring along certain party members if you don&apos;t want them, but they can still interact with you or talk to NPC&apos;s as if they were there. This means you are not forced to bring a party member along just for fear of missing something - and is a nice touch. You can play the campaign co-op with up to 3 friends as well, which is great fun.
<br>
<br>The game is brimming with potential, but it boils down to how you play it, to whether you will enjoy it or not. It&apos;s not NWN 3, but it is a solid D&amp;D game that will keep you entertained for quite some time. The developers are very active and listen to suggestions - with any luck they will continue to improve the game post-release as well.

<br>Pre-purchasing the game, I have been around since Head Start 1 in which time there has been extremely little added to this game.
<br>
<br>Issues:
<br>
<br>- DM tools very limited
<br>
<br>- No Tile by Tile dungeon Creation
<br>
<br>- No DM Craftable or Placeable Weapons,
<br>
<br>- All Loot is Random
<br>
<br>- Modules created by DM tools are extrememly linear with no DM as there is no scripting
<br>
<br>- No Branching Dialouge options in DM tools
<br>
<br>- Single Player Campaign is very linear
<br>
<br>- Character Graphics are rough and Blocky
<br>
<br>On a bright note:
<br>
<br>- Background Environment is beautifully rendored
<br>
<br>- Excellent Music
<br>
<br>All in all, if you are going to purchase this, I would wait until it goes on sale.  $20 or less.  The game is alright as a SP game but no where near worth the full price.  Many people are comparing this to BG1 and BG2, but you will not find the caliber of story as is in BG1 or 2.
<br>
<br>Since there is only one avenue that we can compare the DM tools to, just realize that these tools are woefully weaker then the Aurora Toolset released with NWN/NWN2.  Easier to use, but you will never be able to make exactly what you want and with no mods and no scripting they will never fully satisfy.
<br>
<br>If you are just looking for yet another budget Single Player Game or for a toolset to create quick, simple  Dungeon Runs with Friends, then yes this may be something that entices you, but be forwarned as to the limitations this game has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5574642">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As a DM, you can&apos;t design dungeons. A dungeon master can&apos;t design a dungeon. They can auto-generate a new randomly generated dungeon, pick a tileset and a size, but that&apos;s about as much as you&apos;re going to be able to do with layout. You can place monsters and traps and an NPC, but an NPC is just a character with one chat message. It&apos;s basically a Diablo NPC. No chat options, nothing like that.
<br>
<br>If you ever wanted to play a cheap diablo clone where one of your buddies can take over as DM and throw monsters at your and possess creatures, have fun. If you wanted a D&amp;D game, stop reading and move on with your life now. This isn&apos;t neverwinter nights, this isn&apos;t D&amp;D. This is D&amp;D themed bad-diablo-clone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5575729">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game seems to have been marketed primarily for the Dungeon Master mode, which itself is heavily restricted by all sorts of rules and and pre-made scenery that you can&apos;t edit and, let&apos;s face it, how many of you can actually get a few friends around to play D&amp;D in multiplayer?
<br>
<br>If you wanted a good old style c-rpg single player experience, save your money.

<br>so, i think i know, how many feel about SCL (positive and negative side).
<br>and after this &quot;journey&quot; I REALLY recommend this game. it may have issues, but again: the devs are listening, try to accommodate requests and are expanding the game as we speak for free (and as far as i know the coming DLC will be free for all owners! but dont quote me on that - it was said in the official forums)
<br>the main quest is AWESOME and as much D&amp;D as can be. the ruleset is &quot;based on 5e&quot; - and even if some may not like &quot;based on&quot;: there is already a community project to implement 5e ruleset as close as possible. oh, and thats right: modding support from the devs!

<br>
<br>The character creation was deep enough to make me feel a connection to my character (who is an extension of my tabletop character.) The story pulled me in with great voice work and lively characters. There are plenty of laughs even early in the game. Interwoven into the story are dark characters and some tragic events as well that make you want to keep playing.
<br>
<br>While this is not pure D&amp;D on a computer, but it does one of the best jobs of making D&amp;D accessible and faithful. The DM tools are not as expansive as those in Neverwinter Nights, but they are much easier to utilize and far less intimidating. Only time will tell if this will lead to more modules and stories by new comers.
<br>
<br>Overall the game does everything I want it to do and with the promise of constant support from the designers I think it will provide many hours of gameplay for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5574547">Expand</a></span>

The campaign is interesting. Lets hope the support team will release some expansions-patches and enrich the content.</span>

                                        <span>Personally, having a blast. This game has MASSIVE potential. This will soon turn out as new D&amp;D Classic, I tell you. Didn&apos;t expect I could DM so easily. 5th Edition rules are very similar, the feel of real RPG is there. Just play with good players! And with good, roleplaying Dungeon Master - you&apos;ll be amazed.
<br>See ya in Forgotten Realms...</span>

I don&apos;t know much about D&amp;D lore so I can&apos;t speak on whether it stays true to the story or whether it compares with previous D&amp;D games but I don&apos;t think it really matters (not to me anyway).  What I do know is that it&apos;s fun to play, the story is rich and it looks great.  I am enjoying all of the quests and narrative (VO and music are excellent).  Also, I am playing on a less-than stellar non-gaming laptop.  My settings are low but it&#x2019;s certainly playable and so far I haven&apos;t encountered any &quot;bugs&quot; (or any that have been noticeable to me).
<br>
<br>I dabbled in the Dungeon creation and it was very easy to customize.  I could see this portion of the game being a lot of fun for those who want to play as a DM or just anyone who likes to create!  There are countless (but not endless, which is good imo) options to make whatever you would want out of a dungeon.  Again, I only messed around in it for a short time but within minutes I had a super awesome dungeon with horses hiding around every corner lol.
<br>
<br>I gave SCL a 10/10 because the replay value is extremely high and I am honestly enjoying every minute of it.  Plus, it&#x2019;s priced under what a 40+ hour long campaign game should be selling at, especially with the replay value.  As someone who likes to quest, find lots of trinkets and be a part of a rich story &#x2013; this game is all of that and then some!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5575387">Expand</a></span>

<br>While not directly same stats and mechanics with D&amp;D 5th Edition, it still feels more like D&amp;D than maybe any game before. And that&apos;s an accomplishment. Basically, it&apos;s about 4-5 games packed into one by a small, friendly and passionate studio - single player campaign, cooperative playing, playing as a Dungeon Master and creating Campaigns and Dungeons. Those guys breathed a lot of fresh air into the genre, and will develop SCLt as long as there are players. And there&apos;ll be LOTS of players.
<br>I recommend - give this game a try. Don&apos;t expect a fully AAA+ polished product, but a game that will be polished and expanded in every way possible for decades to come. If you&apos;re passionate about RPG, maybe D&amp;D, aren&apos;t a 100% ruleset fascist, you&apos;ll feel like home.

I hated Neverwinter because character building was so dumbed down with 4e.  Dragon Age lost it&apos;s magic for me in Inquisition because Bioware went down that same path...super dumbed down and kind of pointless.  I love 3.5 because of the choices and the ability to create something somewhat new every time.  I get that it&apos;s unique.  New devs think everyone coming into gaming is too stupid to make choices regarding their characters which seems self-defeating, but I digress.
<br>
<br>Sword Coast character creation feels like Dragon Age: Origins character creation with one significant change: every stat is capped at 20.  That&apos;s right, you&apos;ll be working for a 20/20/20/20/20/20 toon...making the entire leveling up thing feel more than a little pointless.  I enjoyed the hell out DA:O and part of it was the fact that they offered just enough choice to make the characters not feel pointless.
<br>
<br>Now if they want to base it on 5e but take some liberties for the sake of the game, perhaps the entire game would feel less blah and the next level my character takes would feel worthwhile instead of...blah.
<br>
<br>As is, it&apos;s playable, but quickly becomes blah once you start hitting that 20 stat cap wall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6328179">Expand</a></span>

<br>The tools, while user-friendly, are sadly limited and basically rely on a live DM to handle everything but he most basic interactions. At the time of this review, there are no placeable triggers, no custom exit/entry points, no custom loot, no way to include meaningful dialog. Quest exp is fixed by level and monsters scale to your party level and have vastly inflated hitpoints, which doesn&apos;t help to bring a D&amp;D feel.

Some people don&apos;t like how the rules are not strict and archaic as the board game. But honestly this is much much much better because it IS a computer game and not a board game. Best of all the story is linear, not some garbage gimmick where you have to pick choices you don&apos;t like and miss out on story you need to replay to see.

As a hardcore D&amp;D player I wish it would have stayed more true to the brand&apos;s actual rules. As a Dungeon Master I wish it would have more options and tools to make the ultimate D&amp;D sandbox game. Initially I predicted the game would fail, and it did, hard. Reviews on Steam are mixed. I even went and proved most of the positive reviews were from shill accounts in one forum thread.
<br>
<br>Right now I rate the game a 6. The story is decent enough and most of the characters are enjoyable. I hate Jarhild because she&apos;s one of those confrontational lesbians with a bad haircut and a nose ring. To make it worse she is one of the first characters introduced in the story and there is no option to permanently kill her or kick her out of your party for good even though her actual relevance to the plot is zero, zilch, nada. All she does is tell you to go meet Belamy at a bridge, which causes most of her camp to die. Then she tells you to go visit an old Guild Hall. After that she has no connection to the story whatsoever but tags along anyway and so she feels forced upon you.
<br>
<br>The DM mode right now is far too limited. However the devs have been very receptive to feedback and criticism. Unlike most game devs they won&apos;t just ban you for trolling their forum, they will listen to you and try their best to make things right. That is why I&apos;m optimistic about the future of this game. Over the next two months we will be getting a new race, a new class, a tile based level editor, loot tables, and all kinds of other goodies for Dungeon Masters to use. After the DM tools have been improved I will increase my rating to a 7 or 8 accordingly.
<br>
<br>Oh and another thing this game is really easy to hack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5658472">Expand</a></span>

<br>The negative reviews in their hostility are unfair and out of bounds, many of them complain about auto scaling, not strictly sticking to DnD Rules, not beeing like Baldur&apos;s Gate ... maybe that could be better, but in the end playing is fun enough.
<br>
<br>It has some distinct multiplayer features, like Dungeon Master and Cooperative Play. The DM editor looks capable of building some interesting online scenarios. In time, and with modding, it could be great.
<br>I would recommend this game. It&apos;s not far behind Pillars or Divinity and has some potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5637560">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What truly caught me by surprise was the nostalgic feeling I got, taking me back to my PnP days of D&amp;D 1st edition, while playing with a live DM in Sword Coast Legends.  I&apos;ve tried playing D&amp;D / Pathfinder RPGs using virtual table tops (RollD20) and those experiences just did not capture that same feel.

<br>Is Sword Coast Legends a perfect game or a perfect translation of D&amp;D 5th Edition rules, &quot;No&quot;.  But, I had no expectation that Sword Coast legends would do that and understood that something always gets lost in translation.
<br>
<br>So why the 10 out of 10, for me?  Because Sword Coast Legends exceeded my expectations, and I honestly could not see any major issues that can not be fixed or aspects of the game that can&apos;t be enhanced with future patches or content expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5760515">Expand</a></span>

Three or four years back, I changed careers and moved into human services. I work supporting individuals with disabilities in a group home setting along with managing 6 staff. So what?
<br>
<br>The point is, that if you look at dollar for dollar - I lost out big time. But the intangible benefits of doing what I do now make this perhaps the most rewarding job I&apos;ve ever had. The idea of intangible reward undergirds my review of the game.
<br>
<br>Sword Coast Legends is a solid game. It presents a slightly above average story for the player to play through and warrants a reasonable 7/10 from me in this regard. The story is somewhat pedestrian and does fall back onto the usual fantasy tropes and cliches. It&apos;s fun, has several neat story aspects and scratches the D&amp;D itch pretty well.
<br>
<br>The second aspect to the  game is the DM tool set. Here, you get to play DM and can build anything from a random encounter, to a fleshed out campaign. The DM is constrained only by creativity and willingness to work.
<br>
<br>The tools are adequate. Some things really need some work. The ability to chain conversations is lacking at this stage making dialogue a rather stilted affair. This is on the list to improve in the near future and will hopefully allow for more dynamic interaction when telling the story through NPCs. Quests are a little simplistic as well, and I found no real way to trigger quests from other quest elements. Quests let you have multiple objectives in completing them, but it&apos;s not possible to force these to be completed in any set order. After the quest is given, and before it is handed in, all stages of the quest are available to the player and can be completed in any order. There are some sub-optimal ways to get around this, but  a little polish here would bring a lot of power to DMs in telling their story. Sound-effects type placeables, and better object collision rules would also be welcome additions. Unlike, say, Neverwinter Nights, it lacks a script engine at this stage. Complex scripting is not possible at this point in the game. For me, the tools rate another solid 7. There are some great ideas here, and some hints of better things to come with tilesets and such. NSoft seem to be committed to making some of these happen in the near future. I&apos;m optimistic.
<br>
<br>The developers have clearly communicated a timetable for change. Critics seem to decry their willingness to listen to players, but my experience is that they are enormously plugged into their community and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure players can do what they would really like to be able to do. My experience with the Devs has been amazingly positive. They are open, engaged, generous, and committed to their community. There&apos;s always business stuff that limits what they can say or do or promise, but my experience here has been interacting with folks that have a genuine desire to bring what they do to a group that is vested in the product. 10/10 here.
<br>
<br>The community is, naturally, split into the haters and the lovers of the game. The haters, however, seem genuinely concerned about pointing out weaknesses rather than just being the usual naysayers. People who want to play something like this have a passion for the game. That can bring out strong feelings and a variety of expectations - from the grognard to the artist and all  the permutations in between. Those who have taken the game on board for what it is, see a toolbox to craft enduring stories for people who love to partake in them.. Sometimes our imagination exceeds the ability of the tools to present that idea, but creative re-imagining and a willingness to compromise on the details of how we tell a story without sacrificing the elements that make up that story will mean that anyone willing to put in the work can make their vision available to others. Check out what guys like IDJESTER &amp; JOCOLLOMAN are doing on Twitch and YouTube. The creative guys are really inspiring, there is a general feeling of &quot;We&apos;re all in it together - how can I help?&quot; and a willingness, for the most part, to listen sympathetically to those who see more negative than positive. Community is another 10/10 for me.
<br>
<br>Which brings me back to the point of the opening anecdote. The game technically is a solid 7. Not amazing, not awful. But intangible aspects of community, Dev respect for their community and passion for the product, and the sense that we&apos;re hobbyists not just consumers all add up to push SCL up from a technical 7, to an &apos;all things considered&apos; 9.5 for me. It&apos;s not 100% 5E D&amp;D on the PC. It is an amazing community working together to bring a solid D&amp;D experience to folks willing to be flexible in how they tell stories making the game, and reasonable in how they access mechanics playing the game. If they can bring about the changes they and the community seem committed to, this game has the potential to be a vibrant part of the D&amp;D community for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5831728">Expand</a></span>

<br>It plays like a mix between Dragon Age: Origins and Neverwinter Nights 2, where you control a party of 4 character (main + 3 companions). The story campaign is intriguing and very well written, with tactical combat and interesting companions with great voice-acting that speak with each other and with you along the way.
<br>
<br>The spell and ability system is not surprisingly a lot like Dragon Age: Origins, as several of the developers was involved in that game, so thankfully (imo) there&apos;s no clunky memorization/ limited number of spells per rest etc. But the dice rolls from D&amp;D are still there, and if you wish you can read the rolls in the combat log. How the player distributes his attribute points (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma) is important here,not only in combat, pick locks, search traps/hidden doors etc., but also in conversations throughout the game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a great thing that some of the people from the Dragon Age series looked away from the more arcade/action-oriented gameplay of Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition to go back to the tactical overview combat-style seen in Origins, as well as Neverwinter Nights 2 etc.
<br>
<br>The graphics are neat and detailed, somewhat similar to Dragon Age:Origins. The atmosphere and sound is excellent with beautiful and powerful soundtracks from the one and only Inon Zur, who made music for Icewind Dale 2, Baldurs Gate:Throne of Bhaal, the Dragon Age games, Fallout 3 and New Vegas etc. etc.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m mostly interested in the single player experience with official campaigns (now looking forward to the &quot;Rage of Demons&quot;-campaign with Drizzt Do&apos;Urden), but there&apos;s also a dungeon master mode where people can design their own dungeons for coop. Some people had very high expectations for this DM mode letting them create advanced projects, and has so far been disappointed because it&apos;s designed to be fast, simple fun. The developers have hinted that they will expand the DM-mode post release, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5593532">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story and characters are very good, the combat requieres some tactic, and the game just let you to play it. Better, than Original Sin? Of corse not. Wasteland 2: that was an 55 point game, it is not.
<br>
<br>If you liked DA:O combat system and Neverwinter Nights core questing mechanics (without constantly resting) then this is your game, and you can buy it, you will not be dissapointed. Don&apos;t let the 0.8 hour playtime negatives foul you.

<br>Not the best game on earth, but still a very-very good RPG if you want to play real RPG. Not HC DnD, but not Diablo-shooter even. Lot of people skipping it because these reviews, and will recognise it as a very good game years later, when it is in humble or something... but then will be way late for the game or the team to bring us new installation.
<br>
<br>Not to mention, how heartwarming the DnD setting and skills are in a nowadays playable game, where you dont need to know 5 editions of rulesets to play a simple game.
<br>
<br>If this game is 55 points then Batman AK is 10 and Dragon Age Inquisition is 15. Trust me. Sadly we are in a world where money and hype talks. Not every game developer can pay hundreds of millions of dollars in every game and the following hype. But still... this game easily outplays the most of nowadays console focused aRPG-s in every single aspect. If you not count Witcher 3 as that is not a party based CRPG, then this is the best RPG released in 2015.

<br>Sad to say that I sleep better at night knowing after playing in early release, that I told my friends to hold off until they address the communities concerns, especially since they(we) have been pretty clear as to what we expected.

Here you have no skills, no multiclass, no perks, no prestige class, no steal, no diplomacy, just few stat check in dialogs, 6 basic clases, ~10 infinity realtime cooldowning spells, press X to win arcade gameplay, etc.  It closer to the Diablo with active pause than to the Neverwinter.

So you know that rat? That little measly little rat? Over 100 hp when you are level 7. That goblin? Over 200 hp at level 11. Confusion? Save off the bat to not be affected, or you&apos;ll be stuck in it for the full 45-60 seconds, where if you save again you&apos;ll regain control of your character for a single round, before needing to save again. (One round being 2 secconds now.) Does it use 5e rules? I mean... kinda? In name? Ish? It has words like advantage, and disadvantage. But never in 5e have i seen +radiant damage, Cooldown reduction, % Resistance to piercing (Not the flat 50% for being resistant like in 5e), nor have i ever gotten a paladin to 40ac. Or have a 6 minute cool-down meteor swarm. Or &quot;crit range increase&quot; To the point where rolling 2-20 gives you a crit. Or where Vorpal is only 5% to instantly kill. Long story short, only get this is you want a very watered down cRPG, or a very slow aRPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5576544">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story alone is worth the price, but some of the things holding it back from a better score are lack of options in the tools.  DMs are limited with no control over loot, no branching dialog, no tile-by-tile, and the inability to have full control over monster CR levels or gameplay options like permadeath.
<br>
<br>All around, a great story and great campaign platform for DMs to run modules with long-distant d&amp;ders that cant make it to the table every week.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5576771">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First stability: 2 pts.  It&apos;s way more stable than some games I&apos;ve seen.  No major game stopping bugs.  All in all a good piece of software.
<br>
<br>Graphics and sound:  1 pt.  graphics are not top notch but they are decent.  Some clipping issues that are prevalent in many games is present but that&apos;s par for the course nowadays.  The soundtrack is good and there isn&apos;t much that really stands out as awesome.
<br>
<br>Story:  2 pts.  So far the story is very engaging.  Its dark and satisfying if you can ignore some of the beginning character personalities.  I&apos;m happy with it so far.
<br>
<br>Gameplay and features: 1 pt.  This is the elephant in the room.  The D&amp;D name is slapped on this product and it was described as a close representation of a pen and paper d&amp;d clone.  It&apos;s not.  It was decided to make the game an action oriented game and the d&amp;d ruleset doesn&apos;t work well in this way.  That being said there were modifications in the form of skill trees and cooldowns.  This causes the game to be more of a diablo clone or dragon age inquisition clone.  This doesn&apos;t mean the gameplay is bad, just not what was expected.  Those that can&apos;t get over this will be harsh toward a decent game.  The DM toolset seems amazing but its in its infancy and doesn&apos;t offer everything you could dream up in a pen and paper game.  In the end the game plays well for an action rpg.  Its not the greatest and brute force can accomplish way more than feasible.
<br>
<br>Lastly, potential: 2 pts.  I can see what this game is attempting to do.  Is it there today, no.  Could it get there?  Yes.  With additional modules, tilesets, tools, and character options added in this game could be a great addition to the d&amp;d lineup.  Will it replace pnp games? Never.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is enjoyable if you don&apos;t have expectations of an exact replica of a pnp game.  The graphics, stability, and story are good and the potential is great.  The gameplay and features and a bit off from what the marketing jargon eluded to, but it plays well for what it is.  In total I would say this is on the higher end of average with potential to be really good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5579385">Expand</a></span>

It is filled with bugs, its outdated, the graphics is rubbish and it seems most of all like a bad beta or an early access. There is very limited control everywhere in the game and the companions in the story mode is a nuisance rather than a help. The AI is bad and the path finding is equally bad. Sometimes the companions just stand there and do nothing by themself even though they are set to respond. You have hardly no way to control the companions less set a friend to share the burden of badly programmed companions. and you cant drop to have them with you either no no you are stuck on it so if you are the host then its limited fun for you while your friend can waltz around. It really seems like the developers never have tried any of the D&amp;D pc games like Baldurs, NWN, Icewind Dale, Planescape torment or Temple of elemental evil. Why is there no DM in story mode?!? There is so many problems in it that I dont know where to start or to end and what does the dev do they give us fluffy Halloween things instead even though there is no Halloween in D&amp;D&apos;s fantasy universe. Instead of being spoon-fed with your fluffy sales tricks I would appreciate a lot more that you deliver the game that I payed for!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5762487">Expand</a></span>

I appreciated any features that went in that direction however, and was excited about the possibility of even limited DM capability.
<br>There appeared to be too many bugs in the game to make it viable.  The third party log-in never allowed me to access online features (though sometimes informing me that I was logged-in so couldnt log-in again). I often got booted out of the game when trying to build modules... or even at the end of the first single-player quest (3 times this happened).   In all, it made the game unplayable.  Even at $20, it doesnt seem worthwhile to have a game that I can play one short mission (but not complete), and create simple modules (that my friends can never access).
<br>With all that angst being put out there, the game has done some neat things.   I&apos;m satisfied with the quality of the sound, graphics and music.  I understand some corners have to be cut, particularly when you allow player customization.  I think simplified combat is appropriate for the same reasons.  The character builder is good, though they neglected to have gnomes.
<br>In the end I have to rate the game poorly because of its instability, but I wish more games would go in this direction, and with the right patches they might be able to make considerable improvements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6106061">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay kind of feels like a mix between those two games I mentioned and also BG Dark Alliance and Diablo - if that makes sense.
<br>
<br>Now as far as the combat goes, I really don&#x2019;t know where some of these negative reviews are coming from. Bump the difficulty up to hard and believe me &#x2013; it&#x2019;s INTENSE. I am constantly pausing my game, figuring out if I have a potion or scroll that will help me with the battle, repositioning my troops, and hoping to high Helm that the enemy doesn&#x2019;t reach my backline.  In my opinion, the combat is very similar to style of Baldur&#x2019;s Gate (more so than Neverwinter Nights) and that is a GOOD thing.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, while I am a HUGE Forgotten Realms fan, I was never a desktop player. So frankly, I enjoy the simplicity of the cool downs and skill trees. If they literally translated everything from the desktop game, it would be a mess. So again, I think it&#x2019;s right on for this kind of game.
<br>
<br>While I have not dabbled into the multiplayer much, I can tell you the story mode is superb. Now, I LOVE the Forgotten Realms, and I can see it being more difficult getting sucked in if you&#x2019;re not a fan. However, I believe this game was designed as homage to fans and the spirit of BG and NWN &#x2013;and likely many fans are playing it. Graphics are really nice (they won&apos;t blow you away. but I am certianly diggin&apos; it). They also have such a keen knowledge of the lore of the Realms and really put it to use in the story mode. Oh and before I forget, I have actually read several reviews of people complaining about the voice acting &#x2013; REALLY? You think THIS is bad? It seems great to me. The dwarves sound exactly what you would think a dwarf would sound like, Bellamy sounds exactly what I would expect a Halfling to sound like. It&#x2019;s seriously some of the best voice acting I&#x2019;ve heard in a long time.
<br>
<br>One more thing: Helm, God of Guardians, and the BEST God in the Realms is BACK and I couldn&#x2019;t be more thrilled. Realms fans know, the D&amp;D fourth edition killed off so many things we loved about the Realms, and now everything seems is back to where it should be. So after WoTC massacred my favorite god and then brought him back, n-Space promptly threw him back into the forefront with this game where belongs as one of the most iconic figures in the Realms &#x2013; and I can&#x2019;t get enough. Though, naturally, I would prefer to see his followers behaving a little more humanitarian &#x2013; that&#x2019;s the beauty of Helm, he not one-dimensional like some of the other goodly/paladin gods out there (*cough Torm, *cough Tyr) and can also be used by antiheros and torn, complicated villains. So, again, thanks for using the lore of the Realms to make its fans very satisfied.
<br>
<br>So basically, if you like great storytelling, the Forgotten Realms, and partaking in an epic adventure you will love this game. It&#x2019;s gripping, and as I continue to delve deeper into the story, my appetite to find out what&#x2019;s going on only grows more and more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5617510">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are decent, story campaign is really great, voice acting &amp; party banter is great. This is the most fun I&apos;ve had playing a D&amp;D game in a decade or more. With DLC &amp; future updates this will become one of the best.</span>

<br>The game expands itself in the FR universe of D&amp;D and keeps a solid job on keeping you interested on the main campaign for hours on end, and the modules that some people of the community have done are full of detail and amazing original creations that also give a ton of extra hours.
<br>
<br>Has it stands right now the Module creation tools are quite limited, but not without reason. The DM tools are meant so that ANYONE can make a quick module and just LIVE RP with friends. It isn&apos;t the Aurora toolset and some people do miss that possibility the NWN toolset had, but it&apos;s easy to roleplay with a live DM just as you would do on the tabletop (which is the actual intent of the DM tools in this game). I repeat: These are not Dev tools like the aurora toolset but DM tools so understand that you are meant to use them as you&apos;d use your modules on the tabletop! You can pause the game to give lengthy explanations, add your own NPCs both friendly to fight by your side, or neutral to stick around idle and just give you quests or even hostile with spawning hordes of enemies to have your friends fight them! As for playing modules without a DM buddy, they are really well made, playable and full of detail, but need work and expanding the tools will in fact make it an even better experience!
<br>
<br>N-Space has promised many times on the forums to expand the content of the game and the tools available but as of right now, the game stands perfectly on their own!
<br>
<br>As for the campaign, I have to say it&apos;s a really solid cohesive experience that lasts about 40-60 hours depending on how much time you spend doing all the puzzles and side-quests (it has great RPG puzzles!). I played the campaign on hard and had a blast just playing through it. Some people prefer some NPCs to others and that&apos;s a good thing! The companions are so detailed that you immediatly make favourites out of them! It lacks some secondary quests, which I wouldn&apos;t mind having, being as that would expand the main campaign even further in longevity, but as it stands it&apos;s SUPER solid and excellent for cooping with friends (yeah, you can coop the whole campaign with up to 3 more friends!)
<br>
<br>I absolutely love cRPGs and this game is definetly between the BIG ones!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5582438">Expand</a></span>

Heads up, don&apos;t bother with negative reviews - those people would just troll this game anyway. Let them go.
<br>Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day and Neverwinter Nights wasn&apos;t too.

Turning off the AI only makes it worse as the skill trees are too basic and combat gets monotonous.
<br>
<br>The game is NOT optimized in any respect - it crashes and, if you fix that, then it will overheat.
<br>
<br>Compared to what I hoped it would be - this is an immense disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5588903">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-The story is fairly typical, with few choices. Everything is based on kill or not to kill, be good or be bad.
<br>-The combat system is simple and have enough skills to customize, but in the end no matter which way you choose, it comes down to stun, paralyze, sleep and repeat.
<br>-Most Skills areas are an ornament, because the system greatly benefits the enemy by enemy go.
<br>-The Difficulty is a joke, playing on the hardest level to level the game just 16 without needing a priest and you have 43,563,456 potions / scrolls unused.
<br>-The Way to equip the characters is too random and meaningless, the full lightning wizards and other characters to physical damage and begin the walk ...
<br>
<br>Who expect a new Baldurs Gate not find it here, and there are better alternatives as PoE or Divinity, but is entertaining and can improve in the future with good modules.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5642984">Expand</a></span>

With a wide variety of voice actors (or at least a wide enough range of voices and accents to make me believe no one&apos;s playing multiple characters like some immensely popular dragon character game that I needn&apos;t name), it feels like the game has actually been well planned and staffed.
<br>
<br>The graphics are on par with the Baldur&apos;s Gate and Icewind Dale, and the gameplay is very similar, with the option to run the game in real time or have it pause automatically under any number of conditions that you define so you can control your (up to) 4 characters (1 PC, 3 NPCs).
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not going to go into any details at all about the storyline, but I will say that I was very impressed and I didn&apos;t see any &quot;plot holes&quot; or anything that was forgotten about along the way of completing the main story quests.  There are --plenty-- of additional side quests to keep you busy too.
<br>
<br>The game uses the &quot;5E&quot; D&amp;D rules, though it really just feels like every MMO I&apos;ve ever played online, with skill trees and required skill levels or required character levels being acquired before new skills can be obtained.  On the topic of abilities, the &quot;search&quot;, &quot;lockpicking&quot;, and &quot;remove traps&quot; abilities seem to be heavily weighted in favor of players being successful, and in my personal playtime in the game-- I have never failed a single attempt at any of these abilities.  (These abilities are also open to all classes; no more &quot;only a rogue can find and remove traps&quot; stuff, which I am somewhat biased against.)  The &quot;sneak&quot; / &quot;hide in shadows&quot; ability seems to be fairly well implemented, and my rogue has been discovered on a handful of occasions-- enough to make me wary while sneaking, as I should be!
<br>
<br>One of the best features of the game is the ability to make adventures/modules/campaigns for friends (and the general public), with your created content being hosted at Sword Coast Legends so people can access it and play through it anytime.  Unfortunately, this is also where the game takes a downfall as the settings, monsters, loot, and more can&apos;t fully be controlled or customized to a potential DM&apos;s heart&apos;s content.  You can pick a number of monsters.  You can place them wherever you like.  You can even directly control (&quot;possess&quot;) them during combats.  You can even customize a few abilities for each monster you place.  However, you can&apos;t set up specific triggers for events, you can&apos;t force a bad guy to survive (very easily) so they can torment the party further along in the campaign.  And you are fairly limited in scenery and decorations.  Sword Coast Legends comes with a fairly decent amount of customization for traps-- aAnd what DM doesn&apos;t like a good trap? --but certain &quot;cliche&quot; and favorite traps like spiked pits, falling boulders/ceilings, and crushing walls don&apos;t exist (yet?).
<br>
<br>Sword Coast Legends has an enormous amount of potential for improvement without being a &quot;buggy piece of garbage&quot; at the same time, and this fact alone has redeemed the failings of the DM Mode aspect of the game.  I expect that-- in time --even the DM Mode will be as amazing as the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>My favorite pen-n-paper D&amp;D character of all time came from the Forgotten Realms, which is the setting for Sword Coast Legends, so I&apos;m also heavily biased in favor of the game on this regard.  It&apos;s a great setting with an enormous amount of canon lore, history, and character (not to mention actual NPC characters) that every RPG gamer should have the privilege of experiencing.
<br>
<br>If anyone were to tell me this game was anything short of amazing, I&apos;d have to say they need their head examined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5832016">Expand</a></span>

Some of the exploration and such is done well, with a lot of secrets and stuff to find, but some areas may seem a bit repetitive and encounter design is nowhere near as inspired as, say, Icewind Dale or even the original Neverwinter Nights campaign (which had, if nothing else, a high amount of variety in enemies). The longer I play, the more issues I have with it, which is kinda ironic because the game actually picks up quite a bit after the first chapter.
<br>
<br>Apart from stuff like skill trees for wizards that people already complain about a lot, there are two issues that really bother me. One is the use of a ridiculous sort of level scaling that will actually make you wish for Oblivion&apos;s system. Be prepared to fight , at level 9, ordinary rats that take more than a few hits to go down. Another issue is the use of only one slot for saving (which means if you screw up something, want to try out another option in a quest or encounter a bug (of which there are a few), you&apos;re stuck if the game is saved after that. Also note that the one save slot includes quicksaving and autosaving.
<br>
<br>Overall,  I can&apos;t recommend it. If you&apos;re a D&amp;D lore addict like I am, then I&apos;d wait until the price is seriously knocked down or rent/borrow it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5607146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story, graphic and sound are terrible. Overall the game is very poor and boring.
<br>
<br>If you want to play a good DnD game go back to the classics like Baldur&apos;s Gate, Neverwinter Nights (not Nevewinter the online game which is another horrible game) etc.
<br>
<br>This is the worst DnD game around.</span>

But, unfortunately it is a dumbed down version that seems like it was almost built to run on consoles than a PC.  Why, oh why does your inventory get thrown into a giant pile that you have to sift through and can only select one of a handful of inventory types to help sort it.  What was wrong with a click and drag inventory that you can sort yourself so you know where everything is?  Ya now, like any decent RPG or MMO has had for the past 15 years!!!  The graphics on this are pretty decent at a distance but you are so limited in the range you can zoom in on the action or zoom out from the map to get the big picture.  Another issue is the confusing quest system.  I had a very hard time trying to figure out where to go next for many quests.  Actually, I&apos;m stuck in the main campaign in ACT II because I&apos;m going where I think I&apos;m supposed to go to continue the main story after completing side quests and I&apos;m not finding the NPCs to continue.  No pathfinder or compass to point me where to go. One quest I walked all around 3 areas a few times looking for an NPC to complete the quest and never found him and have up after wasting a good hour or 2. In a nutshell, the interface and controls are kind of a mess, like they learned nothing from any of the popular games of the past few years.
<br>On a positive note.  The AI is pretty good.  Your party is pretty smart in using their abilities to stay alive once you get past the first couple levels.  Searching for traps and hidden rooms is also a blast which you rarely see done right in RPG games.  At normal setting the fights are just the right difficulty.. not too hard and not too easy.
<br>The main thing I&apos;m disappointed about is the module creator.  I was hoping for something like NW1&amp;2 where you could break down to the nitty gritty and script the hell out of the game.  I spent years doing that with Neverwinter Nights.  This version is just way too simple and vanilla for my test.  A very small selection of creatures and characters to use and you can&apos;t even create your own areas.  They are created at random for you.  Too bad.  I would have paid big bucks for a NW with updated graphics and an improved editor.
<br>Oh, one other sad note.  The combat system is nothing like D&amp;D.  There are abilities I&apos;ve never heard of.  No skill system.  You can&apos;t specialize in specific weapons with Feats like Weapon Focus etc.  Why did they throw away the core D&amp;D rules for an average run of the mill system you would see on any game today?  I was going to give this game a 5 but the more I write the more I&apos;ve decided this game has let me down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6470225">Expand</a></span>

Eventually I believe this game will be far more then it is and I look forward to some good gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5644006">Expand</a></span>

There are plenty of options for the player to create a character which looks like they want and has the stats and abilities they&apos;d like. The issue is so few of these actually seem to matter after the game starts (7.5/15).
<br>Difficulty: Difficulty is not adjustable. Control setup should be familiar and does not contribute overly to difficulty. The game does not however explain some important concepts very well, like Armour class (AC)(6/15).
<br>Lasting Appeal: multiple classes do provide some replay value. different spells or weapons can offer some as well. The value is limited though as repetition brings to the fore the repetitive nature of the conversation options which repeat conversation options. The game may be meant to be played with a mouse and keyboard, but playing with a controller improves the replay value and is easy to set-up(7/15).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6032787">Expand</a></span>

<br>There campaign is decent, I usually don&apos;t pay attention to the story but I did for this. Along with the free expansion that comes with it. There are also a handful of good mods made by the player community you can access and play together with friends. I also likes solo campaign where I got to develop AND use all the characters classes instead of having to play through multiple times.
<br>
<br>Sadly the dev company went under about a year ago but the remaining bugs are pretty minimal, none that I&apos;ve found are gamebreaking anyway. For the price you can now get it at it&apos;s worth picking up for sure if you are an group rpg fan!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6720552">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has an average gameplay, but it would have been a way better if they made it as it should have been, like Neverwinter Nights 2, still someone somewhere thought it would be a good idea to implement a new gameplay, and its not bad, but its not good.
<br>World looks good, but characters are  . . . ugly . . . you cant make a pretty character, you cant even make a descant looking character, and whatever you make, it looks like its related to every other character in the game.
<br>Game is not working all that well... but its far from unplayable.
<br>Official storylines are good, and there is the multiplayer part.
<br>
<br>The worst problem with this game for me is that it DOES NOT have a soul, nor that attention to detail, no npc in the game will comment on your race or class, its like All of my party, including myself are saying a bad things about a drow as a race to a drow npc . . . and I am playing a Drow . . . rly . . . no1 notices . . . black skinned evil elf . . .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-coast-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6524881">Expand</a></span>

In some terms it stands out over the Pillars of eternity. Only thing is it gets boring here and there, and is quite short. But for the price is a good quality. Very unfair score, its a true 7.5/10</span>
