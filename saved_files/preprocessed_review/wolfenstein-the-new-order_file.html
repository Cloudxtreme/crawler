Fast guns blazing hilarious action or stealth knife kills you get to do it all.  Dual wield mayhem is a rush.  It&apos;s a mature themed game to be sure the Nazi&apos;s are not holds barred evil and portrayed very true to life and creed.  My only gripe was having no auto pickup on guns armor and ammo.</span>

Like they implemented &quot;Iron Sights&quot; and it is so unenjoyable to use that you just do not bother.  And what is with the Shift+Control slide? Terrible controls.  I gave this game 2 stars because atleast you can cut (some) cutscenes.  It would have been 4 if it had been ALL cutscenes.   The game is dull, that is its punishment and also its crime.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4207998">Expand</a></span>

We were promised high resolution textures, they are below sub-par. We were promised an epic tale, we get an average bland story. This makes the previous installment of the series look like platinum. Gone are the upgrades, gone is the sandbox free roaming. The gun play is boring and uninspiring and the weapons try way too hard to copy from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin and F.E.A.R. 3. Many gameplay elements are almost a 1:1 copy from F.E.A.R. 3 (mainly the mech ride.) The enemies are not stylish in a Nazi way, more like the same regularly armored steel soldier we&apos;ve seen in post-apocalyptic games. The levels are painfully small and offer no exploration. The pace is like a snail, only the snail is dead and being dragged by a string. Not worth a $25 price never mind a $60 one. Also warning for German, Swiss and Austrian users, your governments have blocked the game in your region because of the use of Swastikas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4203626">Expand</a></span>

The game requires you to perform finger gymnastics to get past certain scenes which is awkward. The game feels laggy with the mouse, no matter what settings I use. Finally, I had to manually set SLI. It seems the game prefers non-SLI? WTF? ... not impressed at all.</span>

<br>
<br>The game takes place in 1946 after the Nazi&apos;s won WWII and you play agent William &apos;BJ&apos; Blazkowicz in a Allied force team taking on General Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse and his high-tech weapon and human experiment lab. The story goes much deeper as the game progresses with lots of detail and narrative development but I won&apos;t expand at the risk of spoiling such a captivating plot.
<br>
<br>The presentation is slick and the locations are very nicely designed. It captures the classic feel of the Wolfenstein games and brings itself into the modern gaming era with a polished engine and atmospheric missions. The guns are huge fun to use and the combat is fast paced and fluid.
<br>
<br>However the game is guilty in some respects of falling victim to the typical modern day shooters we see today. There are too many scripted sequences and forced gameplay scenarios which mimic that of the campaigns of Call of Duty and Battlefield. The cutscenes are plentiful too although these are intriguing rather than sometimes annoying like the frequent &apos;push-button to activate scripted events&apos;.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t massive - I estimate perhaps 10+ hours although there is plenty of replay value here. There is no multiplayer either but Wolfenstein The New Order is a smart and brilliant game in its own right.
<br>
<br>Unfamiliar fans of the series may want to hold back and wait until the price drops but if you are a fan of Wolfenstein and/or love FPS games; this is definitely worth a look today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4249612">Expand</a></span>

<br>I liked Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Doom 3 and I &apos;d hoped for a game of that caliber.....something of a classic fps... and in that I was disappointed.
<br>The problem lies within gameplay design choices that make actual gameplay repetitive and less adrenalinic compared to classic title....for example checkpoint system save only; enemy recycled through levels with some minor visual changes; no auto-pickup of ammo and armour but you&apos;ll have to press &quot;E&quot; every time; tiresome and very basic stealth section (stealth in a fps game of Id software? why? If I want tactical action I&apos;ll buy a different kind of game); exploration for unnecessary side quest; dull boss figths; weapons feels all the same; some mandory and boring driving sequence, very little interaction with background....and so on
<br>When you reach half of the game (Chapter 8 of 16) the game begin to get more interesting, with some in game sequence that give some emotive impact...but there is nothing new under the sun.
<br>Try it before purchase if you can, and buy it only when it cost 10 dollars at most like on Steam sales</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=6025222">Expand</a></span>

<br>Doesn&apos;t know if it want to be true to the seriousness of WWII or be outlandish with huge mecharobot nazi soldiers that take 1000s of bullets to kill.
<br>Lame forced puzzles, low selection of guns, high action parts of the game are immediately brought to a halt when you have to go back to base and look for useless items to cue the next cinematic.
<br>To top all of this be one of the worst PC ports i&apos;ve played even on Nvidia.
<br>Bad Vsync and no SLI support and the game looks like it was released back in 2007.

<br>
<br>I had to look on youtube to see how to beat the mini-boss just before the last boss. Plus I had to look how to get started on the last boss. That really is the only failing of W:TNO. Another boss in an earlier chapter had me shooting at it for about thirty minutes before I had to go online. I had no idea what to do. Plus a particular area lit up red in the crosshair but I discovered had nothing to do with defeating it. That&apos;s the main grumble out the way. The second aspect I didn&apos;t like was being made to search back and forth for items in the base. I like exploring the graphically well designed sets. Just not be made to whizz from room to room again and again when NPC&apos;s want something else finding.
<br>
<br>8.6/10. Sorry no higher because those bosses made me scream. However I don&apos;t quite feel I want to round it off to 9/10.
<br>
<br>People will probably hate me and mark my review down for saying this. However I don&apos;t much like WW2 concept games. W:TNO isn&apos;t in the same vein as you average WW2 shooter though. It&apos;s sci-ridden and it&apos;s excellent sci-fi. I got vaguley interested in the recent Wolfenstein because it had an occult theme. It&apos;s not on Steam though and too expensive on ebay. That is what lead me to looking at W:TNO. I am glad I did.
<br>
<br>Beyond it&apos;s excellent graphics, the sets themselves are superb. I mean they are as imaginitively realised as any I have seen. The audio is equally well handled. There is music that fits the story, set, and tension. The sound effects are top notch. At one point I kept pushing up the volume to hear the music, which was a tech tune. I fired the heavy assault rifle and gave my self a shock. It was loud but it wasn&apos;t the volume. It was how realistic it all was for a couple of seconds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4971998">Expand</a></span>

This game remid you the pressure you get when you are about to die after a hard passage, and the joy of then finding a medkit. Having the actual possibilty to choose how to deal with a situation between stealth and going full frontal in most level is quite welcome (although I don&apos;t recomment doing the latter too much on the highest difficulty level).
<br>
<br>The storyline in itself is good, and the cutscenes don&apos;t feel like nuisances even when you know what isgoing to happen and you easily feel immersed in it, although the ending could have used some work.
<br>
<br>The game in iself however is slightly short (10 hours to finish it), and unless you did the game full stealth and you want to do it again full assault (or the opposite), its replay value is quite low and the exploration is quite limited. The graphics are also slightly disappointing.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a good game, but it is not a revolution that will relaunch the classical genre of FPS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872355">Expand</a></span>

Unlike the latest Call of Duty junk(take a good game, butcher it and you&apos;ll get COD:Ghosts) this game gives player an option to go slow and stealth or go fast and furious based on one&apos;s mood. The story line is rich and long with smooth transitions between cutscenes and action. Unlike other pretenders give you a cutscene at the end of a level, this game has cutscenes throughout each level which keeps the story flowing and levels long and elaborate.
<br>
<br>Of course, the graphics are top notch, so it the sound effects and music score: a must for any game to be a contender.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4221049">Expand</a></span>

I like the characters and story, that&apos;s above average. But I love the game play, other FPS games do not have this fast response - this is where this engine really excels. I would give it a 7, because sometimes you just run around and it is easy, then you enter a room and you have to replay it 30 times because it is so difficult. But I give the engine a 9. So the final score is 8 :) Just please do not use this engine to make **** games like Evil Withing, instead make some fast paced FPS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=5030993">Expand</a></span>

This game is a well-balanced solution of all the ingredients in a rewarding shooter: combat, story, cinematics, graphics, discovery, and, again, originality.
<br>
<br>As with any self-respecting shooter, The New Order&apos;s combat is solid. The firearms are predictable and rewarding to the player. The gun inventory feels conservative in this game, but it doesn&apos;t hold the game back. Rather, the player becomes intimately familiar with the parts of his or her inventory while being reminded that you&apos;re an enemy on the run and you&apos;re making due not with your army&apos;s weapons but that of your foe. The stealth aspects of the game are a viable alternative to clearing chapters in the style of Rambo. Stealth is simple, challenging, and as rewarding as the gun combat. The perk system also helps to empower the player to choose either approach to the combat.
<br>
<br>The New Order&apos;s dystopian take on an alternative post-WWII reality, while in words does not sound original, is both new and engaging. In doing so, the player is subjected to a range of experiences that gives the story weight and meaning while carefully reminding the player that much of this was reality for so many people without being historic or bibliographic.
<br>
<br>All of the cinematics in The New Order are rendered in game. This serves the game well, as there&apos;s a nearly seamless visual transition between cinematic and live play, adding to the sense of immersion that the player will experience. The facial representations, greatly bolstered by id Tech 5, are so realistic as to become the focus of almost all cinematic action - it&apos;s natural, even!
<br>
<br>The graphics have definitely contributed to a rocky start for the New Order, there is no denying. Once, however, you&apos;ve coaxed your rig into a stable state, there are a few tweaks that are needed to reach a state where the graphics are a part of the experience and not a distraction. Namely, the engine&apos;s handling of textures are fields of view less than 100 can be extremely distracting. Some particle lighting effects can be confusing, as the player will expect a usable/collectable object only to find it was a spark. This point speaks mostly to the next topic, however.
<br>
<br>Discovery in The New Order, speaking of treasure, records, Enigma Codes, was a mechanic that I had several progressing opinions of throughout my playthrough. At the beginning of the campaign, I really didn&apos;t care at all about treasure or Enigma codes; I had no idea what they did and was so compelled to advance the story that I didn&apos;t concern myself with collectables. At a quarter of the way into the game, given the effort to clear some rooms and areas to get collectables, I got more serious about them so I wouldn&apos;t have to repeat these efforts later. At two thirds of the way through the game, and particularly because of a negative collectables experience in Chapter 10, I&apos;ve regressed to giving minimal thought and effort toward collectables. Some require just too much effort and time and it has impacted the flow of the game for me too much to continue.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, sticking to the story and combat, this game keeps me playing for hours. It&apos;s a new take on a topic that makes the player&apos;s mission feel imperative and rewarding. While I suggested earlier in the review that I wanted to avoid repeating efforts throughout the campaign, I&apos;ll most definitely be starting a second playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4222215">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After 30 hours of playtime and 100% of achievements completed on &apos;Uber&apos; difficulty, I feel I am ready to rate Wolfenstein: The New Order. Between the well-crafted levels and deep character driven story-telling, this game is easily one of the best modern shooters. The Nazi regalia art deco style thrived off creative and believable level design. That is to say, the graphics are stunning and tuned to the story as much as old great titles a Half-life or Golden Eye were. There is such fine detail that the weapon models are different for the era and location.
<br>
<br>The characters brought the game to life with beautiful true to the moment animations. The animations were cinematic throughout the game. The tempo and pacing of the voice acting over the animations were fluid and felt real. The outlandish game had a believable band of characters that truly came to life beyond previous standards.
<br>
<br>The mechanics offers fairly tight shooting while the gameplay offers various styles of play; Stealth, Run-and-Gun, Explosives. You could go cover hopping while dual wielding rocket launchers or silently takedown enemies with special knife attacks or equipping a silenced pistol to avoid alarms. However, you can mortally wound a foe by throw a knife into his foot.
<br>
<br>The AI was ok. The soldier enemies used cover well and the heavily armored foes close the gap and cause a lot of trouble for your health bar. I did encounter enemies that tried to throw grenades through pillars killing themselves and anyone nearby.
<br>
<br>Often considered related to AI is the difficulty options. There are five to choose from harkening back to the original Wolfenstein in theme. I only played the &apos;Uber&apos; difficulty so, I don&apos;t know how much the experience differs. The maximum difficulty felt like less of a challenge and more of it took a lot of bullets to kill everything other than yourself making shotguns the bane of your existence.
<br>
<br>All in all, I know I raved about the story-telling being amazing, and I mean it. On my first play through I felt like I was watching a two-hour film you would gladly pay $20 to see. Instead, I got a 15 hour experience for $60 dollars, that I could watch again with different mechanics, levels, and characters.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend this game. Fair warning, this game is rated 17 plus. Contains a lot of violence and gore. Also, has some, believe it or not, tasteful sex scenes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4208005">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you like classic FPS games, and games with a good (although somewhat unrealistic) story, this game is the game for you.  It&apos;s fun, satisfying, and it seems pretty long, from what I&apos;ve played. I highly recommend it.
<br>
<br>My one complaint is that sometimes it can be a bit too hard in a bad way. More than once I&apos;ve been shot and killed out of nowhere when I was behind unbreakable cover. Also, I feel it&apos;s not generous enough with the checkpoints sometimes.  The stealth can be annoying too, as I&apos;ve found myself sneaking around for 10 minutes only to be spotted by some random guy that came out of nowhere and probably shouldn&apos;t have even seen me.  I think it should&apos;ve given you the option to save at anytime, just like most classic FPS games do.  However, I was playing on the second hardest difficulty, so it&apos;s probably different on lower difficulties.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is excellent. If you like shooters, do yourself a favor and pick this one up right now!

The gameplay is solid, the environments and their diversity are also solid, even the story is fine. The shooting is executed very well and it&apos;s all about precise mouse movements, high frame rates and fast reflexes - in my book that&apos;s all it needs to be. Good old responsive and lively action. The weapons are implemented well and there are just enough of them. Graphics are high value and look convincing and interesting. The &apos;Perks&apos; system is fun while not getting in the way. It has fair addictiveness factor as oppose to the latest CODs&apos; single player, which in my opinion are worse than not playing any game at all. Some atmosphere is also there, though it is noticeably less than the Metro series (for ex.).
<br>
<br>And while I don&apos;t try to compare this game to older Wolfenstein games and didn&apos;t really have high expectations at the frist place, I am pleased to say I thouroughly enjoyed it and I whould be happy to play future games in the series based on the experience with this one.
<br>
<br>-1 point because of pure technical reasons - the 60 frames cap. (yes I know - the human eye...blah blah). I did enjoy some 120+ fps gameplay just before this one, and this limitation was a bit like a cold shower (only after getting used to the smoother performance, otherwise it is fine enough. Still, the point is: such technical policies should not be tolerated, especially for the FPS genre).
<br>
<br>PS: It totals to about 8-9 hours of gameplay</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4875292">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now to the game itself.
<br>The story is decent, the dialog , the voice acting and sound design are top notch, but I really don&#x2019;t understand why this game is called Wolfenstein. I thought the Wolfenstein Series was an action FPS, but this felt more like an average stealth FPS with a bit of action.
<br>The combat is just average, yes you can dual wield almost everything, but that also means that you will burn ammunition much faster, and since the game is very stingy at giving ammunition and the enemies are the bullet sponge type, coupled with the fact that you will need to grab every single piece of ammunition from the ground (like a few rounds at a time), it just ruined the shooting part of the game for me.
<br>The game is also riddled with performance issues, like really bad Fps fluctuations, and screen tearing, and it&#x2019;s also locked at 60 FPS, but good luck at even getting to 30 fps with an AMD card without the Voksi fix. And even with it, don&#x2019;t expect to play at the highest setting if you want to keep a 60 Fps lock (Spoilers! ............... You won&#x2019;t).
<br>
<br>P.S: And Bethesda, go f*** you self&#x2019;s, for not fixing the PC port for Amd users.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=7390963">Expand</a></span>

<br>For gameplay, it&apos;s ok. The fact that you can have double gun with rifles is nice but overall its so useless because your aim is awful, you spend so much ammo and you walk slower. You use it 2 times and then see that uts an awful way to shoot at ennemies so you just hide yourself and do headshot.
<br>
<br>And GOD, for a shooter that is named Wolfenstein stop asking me to look non stop on the ground to press a button to grab ammo or health. God... This is not an RPG. Its a shooter where you want to destroy your ennemy. Each time you enter a room you must search for ammos and hp because if you dont you will die so its alwahs taht mini search game looking at the ground for ammos. Sounds loke fun?
<br>
<br>No.
<br>
<br>And the laser gun... I suppose they wanted their gravity gun or something like that, but overall it seems pushed on you and plain annoying to use and recharge. Its powerful yes, but man I am playing wolfenstein: I want to shoot shotguns and non stop rifle on the ennemy. But you will be forced to use that laser gun.
<br>
<br>Its an ok shooter for 10$ max. 60$ is way too much. And also way too short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4372072">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all I&apos;ll comment on the technical aspect of it. Well it&apos;s no wonder that Carmack left Bethesda after he made idTech5, because the engine is currently the worst game engine there is. It isn&apos;t even on the same leage with other engines such us Unity, Unreal, or Cryengine. This game is made with idTech5, which is a very bad engine. First of all, the engine uses textures in such a way that they take way too much space, something obvious by the 50gb this game is. But while the textures are themselves big, don&apos;t make the mistake to think that they are appropriately detailed. In the game you will find many textures looking as if they were taken from a Playstation 1 game. Return to Castle Wolfenstein had better looking textures, and RTCW is a game from 2003, for God&apos;s shake! The game&apos;s lack of adequate anisotropic filtering even on the ultra settings makes the game&apos;s image too blury, and along with the nasty Depth of Field effect, visually, the game looks like a way overblurry pixel soup. Add to all that the unexplained fact that the developers decided to simulate color blindness for some reason which ended with the game being in various shades of gray, and you got a really ugly game, that&apos;s uncanny to look at.
<br>
<br>As if these weren&apos;t enough, the engine as I wrote earlier is awful, and thus the image is grainy kind of like how there was snow in old CRT analogue TVs when the signal of a TV station wasn&apos;t good, plus there are incredible amounts of screen tearing, and even on Ultra graphic settings, there is no Antialiasing, and as a result everything is juggy and lots of things flicker. Your head starts acking after an hour or so of playing this game because of all of these. There are also bugs, like for example enemies hitting you through walls. Oh, and the game randomly crashes...
<br>
<br>So now that I&apos;ve told you about the technical side of this game, I will write about its bad design. Supposedly it&apos;s an FPS, though since I started a new campaign, 40 minutes passed until it gave me a gun to shoot and do what is done in a real FPS game. For 40 minutes the game was playing cutscenes and had me either doing stuff boring and unrelated to FPSs, like finding tools and fixing a pipe, or having my character just stand without me having to do anything because NPCs were talking and I had to listen. That&apos;s bad. It&apos;s not normal for an FPS game to pass 40 minutes without having a gun and something to shoot with it. Aside from that, who in the world thought that the first ever moment that character control is given to the player, it would be a good idea to have the character in a tight place were he can barely move, and with a timer counting seconds and killing the character off, before the player even have had the opportunity to try out pressing buttons / keys to see what each does and how the game reacts ? Bad, bad, bad! The developers should go back to a Game Design 101 class.
<br>
<br>Playing the game isn&apos;t such a fun experience. Even when it gives you guns, and you have enemies to shoot, the weapons feel weightless, weak, and fake, let alone that they cover half the screen. It also managed to be less interactive than past Wolfenstein games. When you go to the castle level at this game, and you shoot at the Knight Armors that stand there, nothing happens, you shoot at the paintings and nothing happens either, while in Return to Castle Wolfenstein, the Knight Armor would fall and break, and the paintings would break to pieces too. I thought that as time passes and hardware becomes more powerful, and the industry more experienced, that interactivity would go up in video games, but instead, if we look at the Wolfenstein series it seems that games become more and more unresponsive, non reacting, non interative, things.
<br>
<br>And it isn&apos;t much of a Wolfenstein experience either. Don&apos;t let the supposed medkit system fool you. There are medkits every 10 steps you make so its practically the same thing. It&apos;s a Call of Duty clone, complete with iron sights, cover system, simplistic linear level design, 3-4 other soldiers to help you open a door, others talking to your cliche earpiece and giving you orders, waypoint arrows that show you were to go, and all that poop.
<br>
<br>If you are a Wolfenstein fan stay away to not get the series and your childhood ruined. Even the Wolfenstein game from 2009 that in its time was considered bad, feels way better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=5632467">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t get me wrong, the premise, the atmosphere and the story itself are  thought-over and executed well enough to satisfy my sentiments (mind you: I count myself as an avid id games fan), but there are too many things that let me down.
<br>
<br>Sin 1) Checkpoints: you cannot save game, when you make mistake, you have either to &quot;live with it&quot;, or restart from checkpoint - of which some are scattered unevenly across chapters. Even worse, sometimes you aren&apos;t even able to backtrack between them (see sin 3). Just think about a piece of action when you silently killed 15 Nazis, but somehow the 16th managed to avoid the execution and sounded the alarm... Kaboom! You have no option but deal with the mayhem or do everything from the beginning.
<br>Sin 2) The cut scenes - they irritated me rather than moved the story forward. In fact by developers&apos; choice some of the player actions are cutscenes as well. Take the attack of the panzerhund: not only you don&apos;t have choice of weapon (knife), but in some cases made the dog invincible to any weapon when attacking (because the cutscene took over while I was firing at it).
<br>Sin 3) Open world? Where&apos;s the bloody open world? The game and gameplay is annoyingly linear (don&apos;t be fooled by &quot;choices&quot; it offers you - not only they are marginal for the action, but they don&apos;t influence the outcome). Also you are VERY limited in exploring the surroundings, even to the point that finding an alternate route makes the game &quot;glitch&quot; - like Nazis spawning behind you in corridor you just explored.
<br>
<br>Not a sin, but still a thing to think about: the fun factor. Lets face it, I&apos;m still having more fun with trusty, TEN YEAR OLD Half Life 2 than The New Order. I don&apos;t recall ANY game that made me curse so much as Wolfenstein - not because it challenged me, but because I was powerless to affect what was unfolding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4460688">Expand</a></span>

The voice actors did a great job and the graphics are spot on, other than that it&apos;s hard to like this game. Space Nazi&apos;s and battery powered guns that need to be recharged using a wall panel aside, there are some real problems with this one. Save points in the middle of gun fights leave you respawning into fire with less than 10 health and having your guns removed or reset constantly while carrying over the ammunition you had at the end of the last level (sometimes almost none) leaves you scratching your head. There&apos;s also a forceful attempt to turn the games laser cutter into your favourite weapon, which doesn&apos;t have the desired effect. I found myself hating my allies and wishing it was over already by the time I was 2/3 the way through. Luckily the store I got it from offers store credit if you don&apos;t like the game. I&apos;ll be taking them up on that offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4411577">Expand</a></span>

His impressive jaw line makes it hard to look at anything else during the excessive third person cut scenes. Years pass in seconds, as you experience the life of a vegetable, before you spring back to life to battle Nazis while you whisper sweet nothings to yourself.
<br>
<br>New Order has dreadfully average combat. The pistol, assault rifle and shotgun feel too similar and look the same. You can duel wield all the grey-brown weapons to reload twice as often and walk around like your legs are tied together. The bullet weapons are soulless, but they do the job against standard enemies. When you get your hands on the chain guns, those unlimited ammo bullet-hoses the super soldiers carry, you&#x2019;ll discover they don&#x2019;t have unlimited ammo and BJ refuses to drop them once empty. So the laser gun is the main weapon you&apos;ll be using against the armoured units because it is order of magnitudes better than anything else you have on hand. It&apos;s also used to cut through metal boxes and grates, but not wooden boxes because the Nazis make wooden boxes to much higher standards. In the last third of the game you&#x2019;ll spend more time looking at the lasergun charge stations than enemies.
<br>
<br>So after every battle you have to scurry around and manually pick up ammo and armor. This is absolutely perfect for game designers because they can extend game length by forcing people to hunt for the stuff you should just be able to walk over. It might not be so bad if everything - ammo, health, weapons &#x2013; weren&#x2019;t the same shade of gunmetal grey-brown that blends into the environments. This manual collection of items does not suit the style of play New Order occasionally attempts.
<br>
<br>New Order is not all about mediocre action though; it has horrible, arbitrary stealth areas too. Stealth suffers mostly because the IQ of the AI is about 100 points below normal. When they get close to you, their heads turn to look directly at you, yet they do nothing. When the AI decides you stood in the middle of the corridor too long, get ready for them to walk towards you with their batons raised. Even auto-turrets firing at you do not attract the attention of nearby patrolling guards. Stealth is mostly optional, but you are essentially deciding between the poor covert approach or weak guns blazing.
<br>
<br>New Order includes its fair share of pacing issues, most of them ludicrous for a game that is often trying to replicate &#x2018;old-school&#x2019; shooters. When you return to your base between missions, you play errand boy for different characters. New Order isn&#x2019;t trying to make a joke of games that do fetch quests &#x2013; it just does them to pad out the already thin shooting. There are other sections with sparse action too, such as the moon base which has so few enemies that it felt like the game forgot to spawn them.  You can sleepwalk through the many linear, hand-holding areas before the game takes half your weapons away for the next combat mission.
<br>
<br>Not all is horrible in New Order, but there so few notable positives to talk about. The Wolfenstein 3D Easter egg (top floor of base) is a nice homage even if they couldn&#x2019;t get the shooting animations correct. Other references to the old games got me a little nostalgic too, like the roast dinner that restores your health. The ghastly RAGE engine is not so bad in New Order, even if it has low-res textures and minimal interactive elements. At least there is decent level variety, small bits of destruction and retro design. New Order is a huge letdown with its mediocre combat, dumb AI, poor pacing and questionable design decisions. 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4263311">Expand</a></span>

Seams to me that devs who brought us groundbreaking Riddick game have run out of steam. This game is a mixed bag. Gunplay is decent and lies somewhere between of half life and rage. Setting is also cool. The overall game is similar in it&apos;s structure to hl. Story is really bad, although voice acting is very good.  I started to skipping cutscenes after a while cause the plot just doesn&apos;t deliver and drags on. Game like this don&apos;t need story. All that budget could go towards making the gameplay better. Campaign super boring and disjointed, although there are some exciting setpieces in it. But I would trade those for great level design. levels feel very small ( the amount of rooms you visit, not small as not free roaming like crysis), and I really don&apos;t like the linear approach. Seriously, walking from arena to arena is super boring. It was cool when they did that in Painkiller, and painkiller build its gameplay around that with hundreds of enemies, but now it&apos;s just redundant. Levels need some variety in its structure. I still don&apos;t understand why games have left maze levels behind. Those were like little worlds. No amount of shooting will replace that. And interiors need to be spacier so it is easier to know where is what, because they are so full of detail that it is hard to see anything. Ai is pretty crap. Not sure why they didn&apos;t use rage ai. That one was solid. Most of the time I&apos;d be just camping in one spot, taking down enemies one by one. And if you try to run and gun, enemies will take you down pretty quickly. Slide movement is cool, although it is awkward to execute on the kb. But no shooting and reloading while running is really getting on my nerves these days. Also the loot - way too much of it. But that&apos;s because enemies accuracy is almost 100%, so you will always get shoot, and soo there&apos;s need to be a lot of pick ups. Again, missing that old school &quot;visible projectiles&quot; you could avoid. It felt like you actually gaining skill, and there was no need for so many pick ups. I can&apos;t imagine who&apos;s idea it was that you need to press a key for each item. Absolutely tedious in every game. Why not just automatically pick up everything you touch? That would make sense. There is a perk system also, but I&apos;m completely uninterested in it at this point. Music is pretty much none existent. The most fun I had in this game was first level after the intro sequence, and the Easter egg: the original wolfenstein level.
<br>I&apos;m very sorry to say that because Riddick is one of the best games ever made, and I highly respect the devs, but I would give this game a miss, maybe until sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4208776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Starts well enough, but after a few chapters it changes to feel very Half-life-ish - slower pacing, big industrial complexes, battling an oppressive regime, crates! etc.  I liked the Half-life series, so this wasn&apos;t so bad, but not really what I was expecting.
<br>
<br>Let down by:
<br>- Too many cutscenes, and the fact that they are 3rd person.  I found it quite jarring the way it  breaks up the flow of the 1st person action.  Contrast this with HL series where you remain 1st person during the whole game.
<br>
<br>- a poor save system (no quick save/quick load!), which makes the game tedious if you&apos;re struggling on a particular section:  hearing the same dialog over and over when the scene begins etc, and fighting the same fights again.   Also the checkpoint isn&apos;t a saved with your stats/weapons - it seems to reset to some default.   And if you run through a section, not killing enemies, hit the checkpoint, then die, when you reload the enemies are all gone!  This just seems lazy on the developer&apos;s part.
<br>
<br>- It just wasn&apos;t really that enjoyable.  Not enough action, bland story and characters... and lacking in a certain immature humour or deviant nature that Id titles had.  It felt quite ...sterile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4286790">Expand</a></span>

But the Wolfenstein N.O. just broke my heart. I was so excited to play this game. So eager to get into nazi genocide once more. Once more to save the world from evil with B.J. But instead of good shooter we&apos;ve got empty storyline with flat characters and wannabe love story. B.J. is like dumber brother of Max Hoss most of the time. Things doesn&apos;t work properly in most of the cases, like you cannot go with just sneaking and silent killing because nazis will see you even in darkest places, you can get stuck on the place by invisible wall or just held by some furniture. Half of the game is boring platforming, cut-scenes which I really hated and helping people who doesn&apos;t give a **** about you. Seriously there was a guy with assault rifle crouching and yelling at you but he never made a single shot. And who&apos;s idea was putting knife throwing button on mouse 3?! This game is so &quot;console&quot; made it hurts my eyes. Every time I saw a chance to let B.J. die I let it happen. Because he deserves that. If the B.J. from first Wolf 3D would live he would definitely smash the face of this **** for good. He is so dumb and other characters just use him for their own purposes. At the end of the game he crawls bleeding to the crowd of people and than fell to the ground when he reaches them. But they just shout some **** and let him there to rot . Even his great polish love! Seriously! And in next cut-scene another character needs help from him in stuck elevator, because dozen of people standing out of elevator cannot do it. The game, B.J. and most of other things are so stupid it hurts. Dumb nazis are damn sharpshooters and they can hit you even behind the corners. They also know how to teleport and most of the times spawn out of nowhere when you reach certain spot. You want to get all golden items and other collectibles? Ok, there is just one chance to do it so run around all corners and peek into every hole, because once you get through some point, you cannot turn back. Seriously that big muscled man cannot jump on most objects and don&apos;t know how to climb! So if you missed something, restart your checkpoint. And speaking of checkpoints, they are most evil thing of this game. What the hell is wrong with good old quicksaves. Instead of saving you got some weird checkpoints and when you die, which happens a lot, you will load from the checkpoint, which is far away and mostly behind big battles, where you will die again and again and again ... So my humble opinion after this horrible experience is, there is something very wrong with people these days, if they like games like this and make games like this and call it old style FPS&apos;s and other bull****. They probably never played old style FPS and doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about. The days of Carmack are certainly gone and this game is another tombstone to FPS games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777580">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: The story is nonsensical and caters to adolescents!  Way over the top violence (for what purpose) and subtle sex just for the teenage boys.  The main character is a jack of all trades in personality and doesn&apos;t logically make sense in terms of consistency or plausibility.  Key story elements in the game are accomplished and artificially become irrelevant.  I could explain in details, but it would to contain spoilers..
<br>
<br>Overall: Thank goodness I got it on a Steam sale for $29.99 (it is not worth $50+ dollars - not even close).  Id apparently is only good with game mechanics, the story could have been so much better...  I wish them luck with Doom 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4340430">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I love the scenery that blazkowicz has to transverse, from the aerial shooting stuff, to the ground combat, the environment leaves you in no uncertain mind what you are up against. I like this, the nazi symbology and signs etc give depth to the linear levels.
<br>
<br>Critically,
<br>i have a few issues, first i wish blazkowicz had more attitude, i know it&apos;s not duke nukem but the guy&apos;s a hero, i had hoped  he&apos;s be more carefree in his prose.
<br>
<br>I had hoped the game would stick to it&apos;s occult roots. This is semi-evident in the game but doesn&apos;t take it to the heights that i was used to in previous games.
<br>
<br>The combat rose in clunky, in that there seems little benefit in equipping 2 of the same weapon, when hiding and precision grants you more success.
<br>
<br>HEALING AURA ACTIVE...
<br>
<br>Yeah,mulitplayer. Sad because any game with the right mechanics in multi can usurp the big 2, there is a market there to offer a different experience to bf/cod but it has not been taken. The only reason i feel that this feature has not been a fundamental part of the game is that they felt they would lose users if they charged for dlc/add-ons</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4275558">Expand</a></span>

<br>I expected another crap shooter like Alien Rage,but this is actually pretty good game. I can imagine with co-op and multiplayer this would be a blast. The ending is open so we can expect DLC or expansions hopefully with multiplayer included. I hope the new DOOM will be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247928">Expand</a></span>

All its annoyances aggregate into a less than stellar experience.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s the good? Gunplay is solid. Players can dual wield nearly every weapon. This is handy at higher difficulties since even the weakest enemies take a dozen rounds to drop. Also, guns have alternate fire modes. Although players will have access to all weapons early on, most of the alt modes are not unlocked until later in the game. This breaks up the monotony and balances the game a bit.
<br>
<br>The campaign lasts about 15 hours. For a $60 title with no multiplayer, that&apos;s the minimum I&apos;d expect.  The environments are varied and allow for slight amounts of exploration. So levels feel bigger than what they are. Players can employ different tactics to dispatch enemies. Stealth can be more effective than run and gun at times. And sometimes camping behind a box and popping baddies one by one is most effective. No style dominates the game. At the hardest difficulties, run and gun is least effective. However, after a single playthrough I noticed stealth is broken. Patrols will walk over dead bodies and not sound the alarm. They will only sound the alarm if they see the player or see him kill someone. So there is no need to drop baddies out of sight. Not very challenging.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s the bad? The game is buggy. During cutscenes, audio and mouth movements don&apos;t sync (think Skyrim) breaking the emersion. Turning off Vsync sometimes helps, but then there is horrible screen tearing to deal with. Also, the game randomly freezes briefly at set intervals during the first few missions. The freezing magically stopped after progressing further. Using a controller presents other problems due to inconsistent button behavior. I select alt fire mode, and the map opens. I open the radial and select a weapon, my character briefly freezes while taking damage before the next weapon is available. Under normal circumstances that&apos;s annoying. While playing the hardest difficulty it&apos;s downright rage inducing.
<br>
<br>The graphics are OK but not a great showcase for the id tech 5 engine. Wolfenstein is plagued with inconsistent textures, pop ins, and jagged edges. Lighting effects drastically change by moving an inch. And there are limited advanced graphic options. There is no AA control. The frame rate is locked at 60fps. Currently, SLI and Crossfire performance stinks. Forcing features thru CCC did not help. Another negative: Wolfenstein is a 50gb install. Plus, a huge patch has to be downloaded. Since the graphics and sound are merely OK, the size is just excessive. Here&apos;s a bit of irony: TNO looks like it was made using the Unreal Engine with its almost cartoony/almost cel shaded environments and weapons. Artistically, it looks like any recent Unreal-based games.  Was this intentional?
<br>
<br>I hate TNO&apos;s erratic pacing. Between missions, the player hangs out at a base. And the &quot;errands&quot; between missions slow the game to a crawl. Forget about annihilating Nazis around the clock, because the resistance wants you to stop and find mold samples. Kill a few more Nazis and you&apos;re stopped again to find a blowtorch. The base and accompanying side missions mimic Dishonored. But this is Wolfenstein....
<br>Lastly, I don&apos;t like the story. TNO tries too hard. It felt forced. It felt d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu. And the ending was just plain lazy. The aforementioned base exists solely to advance the story, but kills the action as a result. Heck, audio logs appear just for progressing through the game. No need to find em. And TNO holds players&apos; hands thru everything. Someone is always on the radio detailing each step. And when &quot;map updated&quot; appears on screen, &quot;secret&quot; items are revealed on the map with a question mark. Too easy. Too pandering.
<br>
<br>Sigh. Overall, TNO feels like a tacky homage. I&apos;m annoyed that one of the final battles was ripped directly from Quake 4. Plus, TNO lacks the brutal combat and creativity of the games that made id synonymous with the fps genre. The new developers tried unsuccessfully to create an emotional backdrop instead of focusing on Wolfenstein&apos;s most important trait: Gunplay carnage. I&apos;m all for a good story, but TNO&apos;s story was so violent, so gory, and  just so over the top that I stopped buying into it. How much damage can the main character withstand? There&apos;s a difference between badassdom and just plain ridiculous. By the game&apos;s end, I didn&apos;t have that, &quot;Oh yeah, come get you some&quot; feeling like I did in Max Payne 3. Instead, I was glad it was over.
<br>
<br>Wolfenstein TNO is an OK fps. Unfortunately, TNO assimilates elements from other popular games without creating its own identity. This is not the nonstop ride gamers expect. Even worse, it&apos;s a console port that needed months of polish before its PC launch. TNO still has performance issues weeks after launch. Asking $60 for buggy title with no multiplayer is a tall order.  Wait for this game to go on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4246832">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>Graphics are a mixed bag. It runs on ID Tech 5 engine which uses MegaTexture technology and it is not surprising that the textures are low res tho I did expected them to be slightly better.
<br>But if you leave low res textures aside there were moments where graphics looked very realistic and absolutely beautiful but there were also moments where graphics looked very cheap and hideous.
<br>Game has some obvious performance problems on my PC which has Intel i5 3570k and AMD 6950. But they seem to be related to bad optimization and bad drivers rather than my PC being too weak.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>
<br>I was really happy from the beginning to around the middle point as the story was interesting and kept evolving in an interesting way. But around the middle  of the story it just got out of hands and it became over-exaggerated BS with some ancient jewish super technology and nazi base on the moon that has super futuristic design and everyone have lazer guns. Near the end it got better again but the middle part really ruined the story for me.
<br>Also game ended very promptly and left a lot of questions in the air. Including the Blackowiczes faith. This makes me believe that there is some big DLC or even a sequel coming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4205674">Expand</a></span>

It is very predictable in terms of gameplay.  However, someone loved this game.  There has been effort put in here which manifests in various ways that mean that this stands above any other offering using ID&apos;s troubled tech 5 engine.  It has a polish missing from many recently titles and although the Tech 5 engine is still very poor on the PC.  It seems its use has been perfected to the point it can deliver an acceptable performance on the best hardware.
<br>
<br>For the most part the game looks excellent at the ultra setting.  Unfortunately it is almost unplayable at the highest texture resolutions for most people without 6 GB VRAM video card (i.e Titan).    With Titan or equivalent 6gb VRAM Graphics card it runs fine though slower than one might have thought.   Personally, I found the characters and the story more adult and less patronising than most offerings of recent years and the gameplay offered enough variety to keep me playing to the end.
<br>
<br>Too linear and too reliant on cut scenes for atmosphere to be a great game yet it was a far better effort than any other mass hyped release recently.   Would buy instead of Dark Souls II and Watchdogs and it would be the better choice.  Would not turn down a classic for this but it has been a bit of a dry quarter for gaming recently.  Not perfect but a quality product within the limitations of the engine.  Overall, a step in the right direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4302826">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is retro breeze from the past but in a positive meaning. Take this game as an equivalent to Expendables movies. If Expendables showed up 15 years ago, everyone would be annoyed and bored in a way like &quot;jeez, not these crusty clowns again, please!&quot;. But nowadays, when everything must be shot with shaken camera, every plot has to have at least 3 twists and main antagonist is pictured as internally disrupted guy who deserves our sympathies, it has just hit the audience with the force of 10 has-been bad-asses. And so did the Wolfenstein.
<br>
<br>This game is pure linear corridor one with a couple of tiny options to finish the task - there are always 2 or 3 ways at the maximum how to reach the checkpoint, and so it is with the play-style: you can be Sam Fisher, the Terminator, or both. Nothing more, nothing less. But it is great and entertaining.
<br>
<br>The plot is surprisingly very dark and serious. I don&apos;t know why I expected the plot will be ironic, over-the-top humorous story about stupid and impotent Nazis against Duke Nukem style bad-ass. I assume it could be because of Iron Sky movie from which Wolfenstein borrowed some ideas for sure. Speaking of which, this game is full of pop-cultural references to movies like Robocop, Inglorious Basterds etc. for example, but anyway, the plot is neat, the atmosphere is brilliant and the ending is satisfying. And did I mention that B.J. is a fricking bad-ass?
<br>
<br>Now the negatives.
<br>Unfortunately, this game is not polished. It suffers from time-to-time crashes, micro-stuttering is almost everywhere (especially in interiors) and AI is poor and sometimes suffers from bad path-finding. There is also weird checkpoint system - sometimes, when you die, you are spawned behind the spot you died so you do not have to face those enemies who killed you before.
<br>Crashes and micro-stuttering will be fixed in time for sure with patches and new gpu drivers, but I am quite sure AI and checkpoint system will stay as it is now, which is sad.
<br>
<br>But hell, this game kicks ass anyway! I am looking forward for the sequel.
<br>Well done, Machine Games!
<br>

Bethesda has been involved so you can take the majority of things that make a good game and tick those boxes as a given. This game does exactly what it says on the tin. Run and Gun at its best.</span>

<br>
<br>+Pretty graphics, it&apos;s very good looking
<br>-No quick saves
<br>-very slow movement
<br>-Boring weapons where you tend to use Assault Rifle for 90% of the game.
<br>-Majority of the enemies are hitscan which forces you to play like a cover based shooter instead of a run and gun
<br>-Weird Tankly bult spung enemes and battles that are little more than well masked QTEs
<br>-No Quick save&apos;s
<br>-Linear maps
<br>-Huge interuptions in the flow of the game with Cutseens
<br>-Checkpoints that force you to rewatch &quot;cinimatic&quot; events
<br>-huge portion of the game is a walking simulator for pointless exposition dumps
<br>-disgraced the memory of Jimi Hendrix
<br>-boaring stealth sections
<br>
<br>If your intrested in the stroy then you are better off watching a Let&apos;s Play. If you want a fun Old School FPS, just play Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Quake or boot up Doom 2. If you are itching for Wolfenstine with modern controls, then just download the Wolfenstein 3D TC for Doom or play Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
<br>
<br>However, If you are a fan of Call of Duty 2 then you might like this game, but It&apos;s not what I consider a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=6462213">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s easily one of the most interesting stories, not just because of the Nazi&apos;s, but because of the actual characters. They feel like real people, even the Nazi&apos;s talk about their familes and how they would like promotions. It&apos;s hands down one of the best games I&apos;ve played in a while.</span>

<br>Its perks are too easy to achieve, in an attempt to enhance replay value. The game is too much frolic, not enough oomph. It&apos;s no Far Cry or Deus Ex...it&apos;s linear and not overly challenging or exciting. Blase&apos; is the word I&apos;d use. I&apos;ve come to expect more of Bethesda.

<br>
<br>What&apos;s disappointing is that the game makes it feel like actions don&apos;t really matter. There&apos;s no tension...no consequence...if anything, when you die you are actually rewarded with unlocking more perks.
<br>
<br>All in all, not terrible, but the overall feel is weakened by putting more emphasis on walking through levels and collecting ways of play than actual success. Too easy, too much handholding, while at the same time confusing at times (especially early on) with poor tutorials and unnecessary control options (lean, cover that are not explained).
<br>
<br>The story and fun in shooting are adequate, though. I&apos;m not sorry I bought it. I am sorry I bought it for $60 when I would rather be playing bioshock 2, which I got for less than 10 on sale.
<br>
<br>Put it on the back burner and buy on the cheap. It&apos;s fun-ish!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4260012">Expand</a></span>

Go play Ghost&apos;s campaign (don&apos;t by ghosts this is just an example), you&apos;ll probably be waiting 10 to 15 minutes before you shoot something.

<br>It has everything that a good game should have starting with NOT taking itself to seriously. There are some absolutely crazy elements and weird machines, insane gun play (dual shotgun? sure!), and an absurd story line. Sure, it might not be an ambitious game and it may have almost no depth in it, but at the same time it is simply FUN to play - not a common thing these days!</span>

Being a fan of dystopias, I was looking forward to seeing how the plot would be handled, and if it would be done well.  Coming from roots that never grew too &quot;deep&quot;, I didn&apos;t expect a whole lot of depth of story from the Wolfenstein franchise, and I was pleasantly proven wrong.  The narrative of New Order was exceptionally well done.  If you&apos;re here, like I was, for a good interactive story (and this is a single player game built to tell a story in a linear fashion...so why else would you be here?), then you&apos;ll be drawn in right away.  While New Order, like its predecessor, doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously from a technological &quot;what if?&quot; standpoint, it certainly does treat the themes it raises very seriously.  The issues raised are both chilling and alarming, and like its many dystopian inspirations, has something to teach &#x2013;&#xA0;even if it has been taught many times before.  This is not a knock on the story, mind you.  All dystopias share certain themes and words of caution, and this one is no different.  The point here is that Wolfenstein draws you in, slams you on the ground, and says, &quot;Here&apos;s a terrifying thought.  What if the Nazis won WWII?  Let&apos;s get crazy and explore this!&quot;  ...and they do!  They do in both horrible and absurd ways, but always in a manner that keeps your eyes glued to the screen in utter horror as you ask, &quot;What is going to happen next?!&quot;
<br>
<br>Once we get past the exciting plot, and terrifying narrative, we begin to dig down into the finer minutiae of the game.  The graphics are enjoyable, and these days, stunning graphics are everywhere and nothing special.  While I&apos;d agree the graphics in Wolfenstein are nothing groundbreaking, they do nothing to detract from the storyline, and there are several parts (particularly the hideout of the rebels) that makes you just want to explore every visual detail of the space.  You can tell the creators placed a lot of love and care into that area...and while others do not feel as lovingly crafted as that &#x2013; I never once felt as though I was being pulled out of the world and left lacking for visual enjoyment.
<br>
<br>Gameplay was, overall, extremely well done, with a couple of issues, which is where my 8/10 score comes from.  First off, the whole run and slide mechanic was poorly implemented.  It was so unwieldy to use I found myself never using it except in places where I was forced to...and learning how to do so resulted in multiple untimely deaths and repetitive and long-lasting load screens.  This was a huge frustration very early on in the game and one which didn&apos;t need to be there.  Secondly is the pickup system in the game.  While I understand there&apos;s a certain bit of realism in having to put effort in to picking up every item individually by clicking on it (much like you&apos;d place effort into leaning down and grabbing the item with your hands in real life) ...this is NOT real life, and the mechanic of doing this is a bit frustrating.  I&apos;d much rather have a hybrid &quot;grab everything within a radius of me&quot; type of mechanic instead ...if an auto-grab feature was simply out of the question.
<br>
<br>Overall, I cannot give this game any less than an 8.  It really did the franchise justice, and while I agree that gameplay wise it has done nothing new, and certainly won&apos;t show us anything amazing from a technical standpoint, it will tell a very fun and engaging story...and leave you terrified and chilled to the bone at what could have become of this world (in a semi-realistic, semi-over-the-top way).  Pick it up.  It&apos;s worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4319145">Expand</a></span>

Was expecting something similar to Bioshock (amazing setting, mediocre game play and graphics) Boy was I surprised. This game is awesome! Looks amazing, is fun to play, and the story is pretty engaging. This one of the best FPS&apos;s I have played in a very long time.</span>

Is 40gb of files worth of download? Answer is: maybe, but mostly no. And if you bought retail dvd version, You have to still download 10gb update. As much I wanted to enjoy this game, I couldn&apos;t. The Wolfenstein games I know used to be fun run&apos;n&apos;gun fps shooters. This game is far from good FPS in general and its even useless to compare it to RTCW. Many people hated Wolfenstein (2009), but I actually liked that one. Now you cant upgrade anything with big pile of gold anymore and open hub areas are gone.
<br>
<br>Story is bland and game has serious problem whether to be serious or not. Sometimes Blaskowicz speaks bravely about America but in next moment paintings drop from wall because he&apos;s screwing his girl so hard.
<br>
<br>Sidekicks are lame and feel forced. Black guy having rhythm in his veins and big physically strong but mentally disabled guy who like girl toys etc. Are this type of characters _the must_ thing in a Nazi shooter FPS? Where is the martial arts master Chinese ninja guy and others?
<br>
<br>Gameplay is somewhat good. Assault rifle actually feel like it has some pumping power. You can lean, lie down and slide on floor, but its pain in the ass to perform those key combos in tight battles. I didn&apos;t find much use for them.
<br>Reloading and switching between weapons takes ages and you die needlessly often due to that. Oh, You can reload faster when you unlock Perks, but only after you performed 10 backflips in a row while shooting ten dogs with one hand gun and finally landing on spagat. Perks are unlockable abilities. You unlock them by killing enemies in different ways. Often the way to unlock them is too hard, because invariably all fights are so chaotic that it&apos;s impossible to think of anything else than finding ammo, health packs and cover. I find myself eventually just ignoring those perks.
<br>Save/load feature is also gone. Checkpoint are mostly quite rare and you end up having same fights again, and they got just longer and longer as you go in game. What might dev&apos;s been thinking of when decided that...
<br>
<br>Levels are quite tube-like, but sometimes you get barely a slight breeze of open areas, just barely. There are secrets things hided in places, but I couldn&apos;t find many of them in first playthrough. Oh and I got new checkpoint and I&apos;m unable to go back finding them. Should I restart level or just go on? I rather go on. This game does no make me feel to explore places to find collectible or even play it ever again. It feels so clunky in many way. Malfunctioned (buggy) robot stuck in place, ladder become usable after killing hordes of enemies etc stupid things and AI just plays stupid. And Blaskowicz is tied on chair and Nazi commander stabs him with knife; Blaskowicz&apos;s health goes visibly down to 0, but raises to 20 in a brief moment. Quite cool.
<br>
<br>Im trying to be tolerated, but it is really annoying when level are straightforward and there seems to be a lot o places where to go or hide, but you can&apos;t. I&apos;m talking about bridge mission. It really did broke camel&apos;s back for me. &quot;Stupid way to die&quot; says he when I&apos;m trying to jump on ledge where anyone else vg protagonist could jump in (in real life), but our William now just can&apos;t because of invisible mesh colliders. If you&apos;ve played original Painkiller or Quake, you know what I mean by jumping all over places where&apos;s the skys only limit ((or water, heh).
<br>
<br>Conclusion: It&apos;s not worst FPS by any mean and is worth picking for like 5-10 euros, but there are so many annoying dev&apos;s decisions which I mentioned, that I&apos;m wordless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=5105858">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>i played one of the original wolfensteins on the amiga back in the 80&apos;s. that was so much more immersive somehow and it was only 2 colors. there was a real sense of tension and timing in breaking out and when the nazi&apos;s called for your papers the hairs on the back of your neck stood up.
<br>
<br>wolfenstein for the 386 was just ok. it was doom that really brought run and gun to the PC. but wolfenstein for the 386 was fun.
<br>
<br>this version is pretty. at least you can say that. if not a wee bit uninspired. i prey a sound mod comes out. its nothing new at all gameplay wise. kind of bland but good models. movevment is a little stiff. seems a bit watered down for a title of this day and age as far as pallette and atmosphere.
<br>
<br>game companies just dont give a hoot anymore. they riding on their laurels. they used to make demo&apos;s. not anymore and you know why.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4271719">Expand</a></span>

But there are some things that aren&apos;t so great like the you have to recollect your guns every new chapter, A.I.s sometimes ignore you or the bodies they see, and the story feels like it doesn&apos;t ultimately reach a closure where there are like there is a part of the story is missing or a few major characters that the story just leaves out at the end leaving for a ending that makes you wonder where did they go or what happens to them. Summing it up the game play mostly good the story is okay and a sort of cliff hanger ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438795">Expand</a></span>

Holy **** they did it: a single-player only FPS with an interesting and nuanced plot, great gunplay, graphics, and characters. Shooting Nazis no less! I loved this game, buy i t before you finish reading this.
<br>
<br>As a Polishman myself, playing as a Polish badass was inspiring to say the least. I know BJ Blazkowicz has been around since Wolf 3D, but here he&apos;s pretty much the perfect protagonist for the game: tough, sense of humour, and with a dash of philosophising. All the characters were great (stereotypes sure, but great), with special mentions going to Fergus **** keeping Wyatt around), Anya, and Set. Was really immersed, which is not something that happens often with FPSes for me (I definitely think the lack of multiplayer helped here).
<br>
<br>Shooting people was fantastic all through the game; dual-wielding shotguns gave me a warm fuzzy feeling I haven&apos;t felt with a game for a while. They really worked to make the Nazis hateable all over again, which made blowing them to bits that much better. **** political correctness. All the guns got great use, although I think a tiny bit too much emphasis was put on the laser weapon...but it&apos;s kickass, so who cares. Enemies were varied and kept you on your toes...I died many, many times charging in with the same tactics. Stealth was simple yet effective as well, and actually benefits you every time it&apos;s implemented.
<br>
<br>Finally, the environments and ambition of the game. This was the best part of the game for me. Environments were great (prison, asylum, A BRIDGE OVER GIBRALTAR?!) as was the globe-trotting. I love Europe, so seeing how much of it fell to the Nazis was always refreshing; this was also aided with the use of newspaper clippings and letters. The game uses the implication of what happened to other countries to give the impression that the situation is bigger than you. I really expected to go to America, I really did, and the fact that Bethesda averted that gives the game some cojones. Would have liked venturing outside of Europe for one mission (or perhaps a bonus mission or DLC) or having an epic airship battle above the clouds...just to mix things up.
<br>
<br>Oh yeah, and the graphics are sexy too (on Ultra)!
<br>
<br>Overall,  Wolfenstein: The New Order is a must-play. Badass mechanics, engrossing environments, and its excellent plot make it one of the best games of 2014 so far, if not the best. 9.3/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4239791">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A nice old school FPS game. To me, it looks like a sequel early 2000 shooter games I used to like, but like whose games, it is not perfect by any means. Graphic and gameplay are very good, the story is ok, but the level design could have been much better. I&apos;d like to see a multiplayer add-on for it ( preferably free ), I think it really needs it.</span>

If you expected a next-gen mind blowing game, dont buy it. If your gaming life were old enough that you know or played DOOM &amp; former Wolfensteins, I&apos;d say give it a try.

I cannot stand console ports, and am usually quite picky.   But I cannot recommend Wolfenstein: TNO highly enough.  It starts off as a basic FPS shooter but quickly evolves to a game that I can only best compare to Half Life 2.  The story is absolutely top notch, the voice acting is outstanding, and the FPS shooter is smart and a blast to play.  I&apos;m serious, this is the closest game I&apos;ve played since 2004 to Half Life 2.  If nothing else, I recommend you pay full price for this game, the developers deserve it, and it&apos;s the only way to keep getting titles like this.  This will be a contender for Game of the Year 2014.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4244310">Expand</a></span>

Although there are some performance bugs for the PC, overall it doesn&apos;t really affect how fun and enjoyable this game really is. The story is amazing. WTNO is probably the best FPS I&apos;ve recently played since BioShock Infinite.</span>

<br>
<br>Level/environmental design is quite varied, yet the visuals are slightly outdated due to some noticeable low res textures and lack of anti-aliasing. Texture pop-in and framerate hitches were some other performance issues I came across occasionally. Disabling screen space reflections and shadow resolution decreased the stuttering greatly while also producing little to no discernible difference in visual quality, yet texture pop-in remained unresolved.
<br>
<br>Gameplay mechanics are also quite solid and guns feel satisfying to use, though I do wish the game would automatically collect ammunition just to make it that little less tedious.

I&apos;ve played a lot of shooting games back in the days (quake, unreal, F.E.A.R, battlefield, CoD and many more...) but have been hooked to aRPG / MMOs for years now.
<br>
<br>Now, I have played many of the &quot;recent&quot; FPS titles but always ended up leaving the games aside for a reason or another. CoD: Ghost got me bored after only 3 hours of gaming, Crysis 3 was graphically stunning but kinda got repetitive and more like a chore to play for me.
<br>
<br>The problem with many new titles these days (not only FPS) is that they try to be &quot;unique&quot; and sometimes focus too much on &quot;new&quot; gameplay features rather than the actual content of the game. Wolfenstein: The New Order is not original in that regard and offers a rather traditional game play, so no surprises there.
<br>Progressing through the waves of enemies can be a bit dull in the way that there is not a huge variety of them but the AI is not the worst I&apos;ve seen in a FPS game.
<br>
<br>All of that aside, Wolfenstein: TNO kept me hooked until the very end. The strongest point of the game is clearly the story, and more precisely the way it is integrated to the game play. Some people might not like the &quot;lack of originality&quot; when it comes to controls but after finishing the game, I thought that the play through was rather &quot;natural&quot; and intuitive.
<br>
<br>The graphics are not &quot;next gen&quot; but pretty good. Crysis 3 did a bit better in that regard but people who rate the game 0 because they are not satisfied with the textures are a bit silly. (But hey, it&apos;s the internet!)
<br>I didn&apos;t find that controls were a problems in any way (&quot;finger gymnastics&quot; as mentioned by some people) and experienced one minor bug only through the whole game (went through the floor while trying to jump where i wasn&apos;t supposed to). There are occasionally however as mentioned by a few people collision issues with bigger sized enemies that basically make them harmless.
<br>
<br>I had no expectations and knew nothing about this title before actually playing it. I felt that some parts were a bit over the top but overall it had been a while since I enjoyed a FPS game like this. I liked the characters and their development through the game.
<br>
<br>Despite being a bit linear, I feel that the game should keep most people interested until the end.
<br>
<br>Gameplay / controls: 6/10 (because a bit linear / not innovative)
<br>Graphics: 8/10 (It&apos;s not next gen, but it&apos;s good)
<br>Story: 8/10 (It&apos;s not perfect, but it does the job well)
<br>
<br>I give it a 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4457990">Expand</a></span>

<br>The problem with this game is the same as many others, it tries to straddle stealth with action ala the Crysis series, then fails miserably. Oh you silently and successfully kill everyone in an area but a random dude two stories below you on a rainy night see you and calls the alarm? Totally plausible.
<br>
<br>Honestly, I was really looking forward to a game with what was billed like a game with great graphics silently killing Nazis with a knife, instead I get just might as well shoot them in standard linear COD format, with beautiful NP cutscenes and somewhat atrocious gamplay graphics. Not to mention an auto lockon bug which prevents stealth kill shots. I had seriously been waiting months to play this, and the wait and expectation was considerably more fun than the actual game
<br>
<br>Basic shootemup hoping once again for more. Killing some Nazis was the only thing that earned it a 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4613034">Expand</a></span>

Wolfenstein The New Order focuses on one thing: being an excellent first person shooter. The 2009 Wolfenstein by Raven Software tried to introduce an open world game concept but failed badly in the execution. Yes, Wolfenstein The New Order is a CoD-like tunnel-shooter with a lot of scripting and cut scenes but this is what works best for a character like B.J. Blazkowicz. The game feels more like the 2001 Return to Castle Wolfenstein but gives an immense insight in B.J. Blazkowicz&apos;s character. In Return to Castle Wolfenstein B.J. didn&apos;t say a single word while other characters have been talking. The parallel universe setting with a Nazi-Regime in the 1960&apos;s who won WWII in 1946 and even managed to visit the moon creates an extremely interesting environment to explore. The only thing that I missed in Wolfenstein The New Order was actually Hilter as the Ober-Boss. He was in the 1992 Wolfenstein 3D so why not in Wolfenstein The New Order as an old man in a gigantic robot suite? I also feel the game designers could have made more of the Jewish-Atlantis culture but maybe all of this will come in a sequel?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4304416">Expand</a></span>

The AI and the hit point system needs a complete make over. For instance: The amount of bullets needed to kill an &quot;Uebersoldat&quot; is absolutely unbelievable and does not make sense at all - less would be more. Best bit is the lame response of most of the common enemy soldiers during a knife fight. The game has a huge potential only by textures, design and characters, unfortunately the complete atmosphere will be killed by repeating shout-outs, a pointless hitpoint system and really stupid enemies. Fast food for for experienced first person action heroes. Graphics a clean 10, the rest is max. 4-5 which makes in total a 6-7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein-the-new-order/user-reviews?user_review_id=4206961">Expand</a></span>
