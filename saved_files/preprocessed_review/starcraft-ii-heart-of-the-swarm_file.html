I figured it could have only been better, but I was wrong. I guess as long as DBrowder is at the helm, you&apos;re going to get the most cliched snooze fest imaginable.
<br>
<br>Where it fails most is what made StarCraft such a memorable and great game. The story. I cannot begin to explain how weak and underwhelming the story and dialogue are. Gone are any sort of characterization or suttle narrative undertones. There is no heart, no personality, no life, and no atmosphere. Gone is the once articulate, conniving, Mengsk who has been reduced to a babbling old fool, the fiery Jim Raynor who is now simply there to be a damsel in distress. Kerrigan&apos;s actions and motivations are consistently questionable; there are a lot of failed attempts at evoking emotion, but frankly, you just don&apos;t care about her or Jim anymore. The flavorful and immerse world that was StarCraft  has once again been destroyed by $$BlizzActivison$$. What the hell happened to the storytelling? The heart? The universe? All I see now is a empty shell.
<br>
<br>/rant
<br>
<br>The actual gameplay is fine, the UI good, and the missions fun though repetitive at times. I&apos;m reviewing mainly the campaign/single-player here. The multi-player is polished and the visuals are smooth, if you don&apos;t care about the campaign at all (and just shelled out $40 for a few new units), then I&apos;d give it a 7/10 or 8/10. Blizzard could&apos;ve continued StarCraft&apos;s legend if they gave two  about the lore and could&apos;ve been the best at that, but I guess they wanted to focus on eSports and follow in the shadow of LoL.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3031316">Expand</a></span>

The quality of the campaign is good but not as good as WoL. Reason being the characters that drive the plot forward are simply not as interesting. This is an unfortunate side effect of playing the Zerg race: They generally have no minds of their own. This fact means the only interesting character in the swarm is Kerrigan and her focus is entirely on revenge. So this limits where the story can go a great amount. That aside, the Missions are the same general fare that can be expected with a few new twists. The highlight being the Evolution Missions where you test and then choose from 1 of 2 genetic mutations for a specific unit. This really gives you the feel of driving the Swarm&apos;s evolution forward to deadly effect. Other than that, it&apos;s all about Kerrigan and her very, very powerful unlockable as you level abilities. I will leave the details out as it is much funner to find out for yourself. Multiplayer, though I have played only 4-5 matches, is as strong as it has ever been and will be the focus of many a player for years to come. There are a few interface improvements and the new units are interesting without being overpowered. Old strategies still work most of the time so you won&apos;t feel betrayed or thrown in over your head. So to wrap I just want to say I don&apos;t understand how it took 4 years to make this expansion. Other expansions on other games with similar content took far less time. I wonder if they have a small development team or they intentionally delayed the launch. That aside, as it stands HotS is a very solid expansion to a great game. While the campaign could have been better it is still very entertaining and the multiplayer will keep you happy for a very long time. Worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3029679">Expand</a></span>

Some of the dialogue is a bit on lame side (from a writing perspective, voice acting is top notch as usual), but generally this is a story that has weight and gravity, and sets itself up well for the grand finale with Legacy of the Void.  I&apos;m terrible at the competitive multiplayer, but it is still excellent fun (balance is different with new units, but still very tight).

Now, I play SC2 for the REASON it&apos;s supposed to be played, which is a competitive RTS and E-sport. That&apos;s the strength of this game and the sole reason the first one lasted 2 decades. If you judge Starcraft by its campaign then you are not very smart, it&apos;s like going to eat steak at red lobster....they serve it, but you&apos;d be a fool to go there specifically to eat one. That aside, the improvements to Battlenet, and Blizzard&apos;s desperate attempt to keep up with the current Moba E-sports has made this expansion a good improvement over WoL in so many areas that the list is too long to mention. The Balance of the game is off, of course it would be of, it&apos;s a new expansion, but frankly I didn&apos;t expected to be this bad considering the extensive Beta and good feedback they got. So, all in all, is a good expansion, good improvements, a poorly written campaign (considering the wonders you can do with the Starcraft universe), with several of the units being potentially overpowered for the first few months and some other minor technical improvements. Not a 10 in my books, even though I&apos;m a fan, but definitely not bad at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032011">Expand</a></span>

If somebody wants a challenge there are mastery missions where you play a extra hard version of the mission with all upgrades unlocked I haven&apos;t tested it yet. So, from a design standpoint is game is very, very good. So why I&apos;m giving only 8/10? Because the story is kinda meh and the script is very, very cheesy taking every overused line of dialog there is and every overused cliche. Blizzard (Metzen!) must work on their scripts! But in the end: If you liked WoL or Starcraft/Broodwar then you can buy this and have very much fun. If you like RTS games, you can buy this, too. If you have no idea what Starcraft is pick WoL up (costs not much), play it and take a look if this kind of game is something for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3026766">Expand</a></span>

Probably a requirement for online play since the majority of players will migrate over to HotS, but not worth the price as a single player experience.</span>

The gameplay is still the same Starcraft 2 you love, but with more units and a new story. The new units add a an interesting feel to competitive matches. unfortunately, the story is lackluster and the big glaring retcon is annoying, especially because the story would have worked fine without it. The gameplay in the campaign starts you out at a disgustingly slow pace. Over an hour of a tutorial in an expansion wasn&apos;t necessary whatsoever. The difficulty is way too easy. I played the game on hard an I didn&apos;t even need to pay attention to win for the most part. You have the illusion of choice for missions like deciding to use different weapons to do the same thing, but in reality this tacked on feature does not challenge the intelligence of the player and, I have to say that while playing I felt like my intelligence was actually being insulted. Luckily the game picks up in later levels, getting far more enjoyable. Forget the main characters because the zerg are interesting creatures to have conversations with. Overall, it&apos;s a fine expansion pack with some flaws, but If you enjoyed Starcraft 2, you will definitely enjoy Heart of the Swarm</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3026519">Expand</a></span>

Those who, for some strange reason did not like the Wings of Liberty campaign (presumably because you are a boring person), will probably not find Heart of the Swarm all that interesting as, aside from several innovations, is still essentially the same game with different units, cinematic sequences, story, and a handful of other changes. But for the rest of us  the swarm hungers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025606">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay was fantastic as usual, and the replay value im sure will be never ending with arcade modes and regular ladder play.  Good job blizzard on this one.</span>

Compared to those, HotS is painfully average. Campaign: The story is okayish, mainly because most of the dialogue is between Zerg characters and has an appropriately odd ring to it, but when it switches back to human dialogue it&apos;s once again infuriatingly cliche and facepalm-worthy. The missions vary in quality, there are a couple refreshingly good ones but most of them suffer from the same problem as the WoL missions, i.e. they are extremely gimmicky and serve mainly as a means to introduce a new unit that is super useful for that specific mission and not so much later. There are also extremely frequent time constraints in missions, which don&apos;t allow you to enjoy them at your own pace. That&apos;s a really lazy way to do challenge. Very rarely will you find a mission that just gives you a giant enemy base and lets you just use your units in your own way and check for weaknesses to kill it, it&apos;s all scripted and on a strict timer and feels gimmicky. Very disappointing overall. Multiplayer: Nice additions with clans and replays. The new units however are not that great. Only the Viper can be considered a decent addition, and the hydra speed opens up a couple of more viable army comps, but for the other races it&apos;s pretty lackluster. Watch any stream where players are interested in actually winning and not just messing around with the new units, and you &apos;ll see most matchups play similarly to WoL, especially TvT is exactly the same except you start with a couple of mines here and there. Overall, for Blizzard RTS standards, HotS is just meh. It barely shakes things up online, and the campaign is mediocre. Not good enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3035040">Expand</a></span>

In HOTS The Campaign is awesome, it has a lot of cinematics, they have a lot of quality in graphics and plot, the AI in BRUTAL is not very strong but if you make a big mistake you will lost and i believe that the AI is not very strong because Blizzard want that new players and the lazy ones get fun and finish the game (Brood war was harder). The plot is 2/3 you get fun on the campaign. The only bad thing about the campaign is that is short, you finish it in at least 10 hours. The next part of the game is the MULTIPLAYER, it has new units, and with 7 new units is a different game now, you can win games that for sure you will have lost in WOL. Playing as Terran you can use widow mines to finish draws, same goes to oracle with protoss and Swarm host for zerg. the ladder is not fully balanced but as always more patches will come all over again to improve the game. This time the multiplayer is HARD because people that play HOTS already bought WOL they have skill and experience and you can choose the server you want (You can be Master in NA and Platinum in Korea). At last, the game has A LOT of extra minigames in custom, unranked games, coop vs AI. My recommendation is the next: If you only want to play the campaign and not multiplayer wait for the price to drop. If you want Campaign but most important the MULTIPLAYER (The real game) buy it because you really feel the difference between WOL and HOTS and HOTS is harder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025258">Expand</a></span>

Warning minor spoilers not that it matters.  I want to say I&apos;ve been a fan since Warcraft of Orcs and Humans, but I&apos;ve seen a laziness in the developer for the past several years that has degraded the quality of the games.  I began to be worried with the announcement of the Starcraft 2 Trilogy.  My initial thought was that it was an attempt to grab some extra cash, though I denied such a thought of my beloved blizzard for years.  Now after the catastrophe that is Diablo 3,the bulky, and borderline fluff. that was Wings of Liberty, I have come to the conclusion that my original assumption is true Blizzard has become the next bioware they in it for your money.  The entire campaign is a vain attempt to kill a man who should have died in the first campaign for the sequel, I.E, the title being wings of liberty sounds like the dominion would fall right? Yet despite the forshadowing the first campaign lends to the player, there is no development from the big xel naga threat other than the fact that kerrigan must fight it.   NOTHING contributes to the overarching story of the series, they even try to make it seem worth 40 dollars by adding seven missions where the whole purpose is to test out two different strands of a zerg mutation.  These fluff missions show how little blizzard cares for their products anymore as they have lost all pretense of even trying to create something worthwhile an unique.  Playing these missions was like revisiting the same dungeon for the tenth time in Dragon age 2, boring easy and repetitive.  Finally in the campaign though I did not even notice till the very last mission, which was extremely anticlimatic and  could have been any other level in the game, I noticed that the zerg campaign has no troop transport.  Overlords are now nothing better than a moving supply depot, especially without the evolution to overseers.  I&apos;m sure the multiplayer is fun and highly competitive, it was the redeeming quality to the bulky WOL, but guess what, getting a couple new units and maps for a game i already own is not a  expansion. I paid 40 dollars just to be jerked around  and I&apos;ve had it with blizzard trying to make money of their poor deluded fans.  If I wanted that particular experience I would have bought a call of duty map pack, FOR TEN DOLLARS!  They were my ivory tower, and now they don&apos;t give a damn,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3027907">Expand</a></span>

Attention writers: Prophecies are OVERUSED and are LAME! They are cliche and in this case the prophecy featured in SC2 retcons the original Starcraft and BroodWar, yielding many of the plot elements in both games nonsensical and convoluted. Game is also WAY TOO EASY. In the original Starcraft some of the later levels make you sweat. In this one the AI never cloaks, NEVER, for example. Lastly, the game is designed for casual players, which means everything is watered down and dumbed down.
<br>
<br>THE GOOD-- Cool cinematics. Nice graphics. The beginning of HoS pretty cool, which subsequently leads you on, makes you think that maybe the writers up at Blizzard learned from their mistakes with Wings of Liberty, but then after the 4th level the game falls flat on its face. Game has good multiplayer, but the expansion only adds a few new units that nobody wanted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3028200">Expand</a></span>

Nevermind the paid reviews flodding metacritic (and there will be more).  Nevermind the ad dollar scraps thrown out at the &quot;gaming journalists&quot; to buy their opinions.  Nevermind the massive hype that Blizzard/Activision has pushed and will continue to push  from Youtube to the Super Bowl.  At the end of the day, the play of this game is a rehash of the last chapter, shot through with more plot holes than a shotgun to swiss cheese, and wrapped up with gorgeously empty cinematics.  This game is certainly everything that they promised it would be.  It&apos;s also a complete perversion of everything that they once promised in games.  The scenarios play out just like Wings of Liberty, in that they teach you basic mechanics you picked up already in the last game, pushing you to choose certain paths that ultimately have no impact on the ending.  The play does not translate over to multiplayer either, same as Wings of Liberty did not.  The writing is depressingly cliche, while the voice actors inflect with a sort of &quot;I can&apos;t believe we&apos;re saying this stuff&quot; vibe.   And as of yet, we&apos;ll have to see how multiplayer shakes out, but the previews of units and live gameplay show that there will be an awful lot to tweak on the dev&apos;s side.  All of this for a price that so many other games can beat.  You have to ask yourself if this truly is the best that one of the largest gaming corps can do.  There will be a moment in HotS  and you will see many that get close  when the naive twelve-year-old inside you that once thrived on cool and interesting gameplay, dies once again, and the bittersweet aftertaste of nostalgia will never be washed away by all the dew and doritos in the world.  I won&apos;t spoil it for you, but if you&apos;re so interested to see what&apos;s become of the &quot;point&quot; of modern gaming, you can look at gameplay videos on Youtube or just check out the other franchises drained of fun by BlizzActi: SC2, WoW, and D3.  It will be the last time I buy a product from Blizzard, as I should&apos;ve done long ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3026838">Expand</a></span>

Why can a flying zerg act like some sort of frog on a massive unit like a colluses. I know its a game but that is just taking it too far. At least be in the realm of believable. WoL was mediocre, but this is just terrible. Points for polished cinematics i guess... Luckily I borrowed a friends account to play so jokes on you blizzard.

It&apos;s not &quot;playing&quot; a game anymore but learning modes of behavior to win. Even within the singleplayer campaign, 99% of the missions seem to be about getting used to the way the race of the zerg is supposed to be played in multiplayer-mode: Gameplay is frantic, almost every mission has some kind of timelimit and you&apos;re supposed to be clicking everywhere on the map at once. Building a base with nice defences? None here, that&apos;s &quot;not the way the zerg are played&quot;. In Starcraft 2, the campaign was the only fun part of the game for me, because it wasn&apos;t always frantic and hectic... Since there are no good RTS-alternatives right now, it&apos;s a shame that SC2:HotS is so monotonously action-oriented. The GUI and menus of the game strengthen these aspects: You access the campaign/story of HotS via a generic button within an e-sports-oriented interface.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025466">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gamplay: Same as Wings of Liberty, nothing notable to point out. Great RTS, it is losing it&apos;s shine though,
<br>
<br>Story: This is where everything sort&apos;ve downfalls. If you are tired of these &quot;WoW writers&quot; then get ready for the same old hubub when it comes to this game. Nothing original, not even close to following it&apos;s roots. Lots of retcon, lots of plot holes, lots of cliche dialog and generic actions scenes.
<br>
<br>After putting the original Star Craft on the back burner for so long, they lost everything that made a game unique.  Now it feels like a &quot;WoW&quot; set in space of a story line everywhere you turn. Diablo 3 is another good example of this. WoW just bleeds into everything they do now, churning everything into a gray mush of mediocre game play and story.
<br>
<br>The casual game play is fun, but after 10 hours the game is now up a creek relying on the multiplayer, which has potential, but probably won&apos;t be fully engaging till the last expansion comes out. By then, SC2 will be outdated and forgotten because that what happens when you split a game up into 1/3&apos;s and make people wait 4 extra years to see the end of a story line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=4460070">Expand</a></span>

The CGI is great but other than that its basically worthless. Blizz could have just easily added the new units as a patch along with the balance changes. You&apos;re basically paying for the cut-scenes and the stupid missions which feel like an extended tutorial. The narrative is extremely weak as it basically undoes everything the past games have done with Kerrigan. She basically gets a free pass on genocide just bec Raynor&apos;s got a bleeding hard on for her and her memory was wiped.  The balance updates serve nothing more than to speed up the game turning it into a contest who can crank out more units faster.  no new play mechanics are actually introduced. The firebat, darkswarm etc. are basically reintroduced in this game. Players could just as easily modded these units but since Blizz controls everything **** that.  The Title of this game should have been my super galactic Tyrant ex-girlfriend the Revenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=4779157">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Characters have this horrible division where you feel like half of them are Zerg(Dehaka, Zurvan, Abathur) and the other half behave like humans in a Zerg disguise(Izsha, Zagara). Izsha is particularly painful to listen to as every single line she has just reeks of a human being and not a Zerg. Put together with Abathur, it&apos;s really glaring and kills the atmosphere entirely. Also why doesn&apos;t the Leviathan talk?! It&apos;s a Zerg creature, thinking and understanding, not a machine!
<br>
<br>The story is extremely lackluster. If WoL had lots of side missions with their own small reward and one 10-mission main quest(which was ultimately a fetch quest of 6 missions and then just fighting Kerrigan and a few missions devoted to harming Mengsk&apos;s reputation), HotS is literally nothing but one main mission: assemble the Horde-I mean the Swarm. It gets very old very fast. Too simple a plot, it&apos;s also not really helped by the side missions since very few of them bring any sort of plot advancement. Ultimately, you spend 20 missions assembling the Swarm, then you (spoiler alert, watch out this&apos;ll blow your mind you&apos;ll never see it coming!) kill Mengsk. Which means that you literally had all this buildup about Hybrids and the world&apos;s end in WoL and no follow up at all in HotS where it&apos;s just Kerrigan being mad at Mengsk and getting stronger so she can kill him...
<br>It&apos;s not even lackluster, it&apos;s just lame in comparison.
<br>
<br>Music is still meh. Still can&apos;t recall a single tune, apart from WoL&apos;s cutscenes. And even those were not that memorable, despite being well-conceived along with their cutscene. When the cutscenes music appears in HotS, it&apos;s nice but unfitting.
<br>
<br>Cutscenes are really great, all of them, but since none of them are ever in a good story, they just aren&apos;t that likeable.
<br>
<br>Then you&apos;ve got the gameplay. Well, just like WoL, very little strategy, tons of spamming keys to get resources and units ASAP. Lots of exciting fun, almost no thinking, and a game that ultimately fails to be interesting, despite being entertaining until a certain point.
<br>The new units are fine, Zergs get a base defense/base siege unit akin to the Terran Siege Tank. Nothing really different, if you liked WoL you will like this.
<br>
<br>But really ultimately, if you liked the story in WoL and the gameplay was just ok and not particularly satisfying to you, or not at all satisfying if you like real strategy, HotS will feel like a step down in every aspect to you.
<br>The missions, the way they&apos;re chosen, the units and ways to upgrade them, the characters, the plot, the storytelling, the diversity of missions, which was one of the strongest points of WoL and added a lot of value to a game with virtually no strategy, all of that is either the same, or worse. 90% of the diverse missions of WoL are just copypasted here. Characters, mission choices, upgrade missions which appear here instead of credits to get unit upgrades, plot value, they&apos;re all clearly one hard step below Wings of Liberty.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still playable just like the last one, and still has value as a game or a story, but it&apos;s so pathetically weak an expansion, compared to its predecessor. It also, unsurprisingly, does absolutely nothing to try to help the lack of complexity and lack of strategy of Starcraft as a whole(yes, I&apos;m counting SC1 and BW).
<br>Just another super-fun-super-fast game with poor strategic elements and a story that will make you yearn to play WoL for the first time again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=4071400">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Game mechanics have been tweaked slightly.  There isn&apos;t much of a story in the cut scenes between missions which is quite disappointing.  Previous instalments of Starcraft used to have good stories.</span>

<br>Other than that it is still good SC, so multiplayer is superior to anything in the market (RTS wise).</span>

<br>I must say: The story writing is awful.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t want to spoil anything here, just state that it&apos;s really, really awful. And the gameplay isn&apos;t much better. The whole game plays like Warcraft 3 with dumbed down tactics. While in Warcraft 3 you actually had to make decisions and also had more options, like a wider variety of upgrades, tactics, importance of terrain, more decisions around your hero etc. you just have a dumbed down husk of that left for Heart of the Swarm.
<br>
<br>You run around with your group of units, including hero, and kill stuff. That&apos;s it. All the time. Everywhere.
<br>
<br>The mission design is annoying: It&apos;s so HEAVILY scripted that everything plays all the same every goddamn time. There&apos;s no real AI here. Just to a minor degree. Everything else is just scripted like hell. Even if you&apos;re not supposed to destory an enemy base they&apos;ll tell you to not do so and after you&apos;re done destroying the base you&apos;re not allowed to win because *hurr durr* you must still play all remaining events as we intended you to !
<br>
<br>Complete all tasks and the game ends the mission for you. You don&apos;t get to decide whether you want to continue until all enemies are dead. The game doesn&apos;t care what you&apos;d like to do and is fun to you. Ressource management is as catastrophic as ever: Turbo mining with 3 workers per ressource node is still a thing instead of either a wider variety of ressources or a slower, but more enjoyable game, like Starcraft 1 was, with less troop massing and less damage spikes. Base managemant is also quite boring: Protect your base as necessary, else there&apos;s no managemant. You construct all tech buildings once for unit access and there&apos;s nothing useful you can do with them or any relevance as why you&apos;d want a specific building in a specific spot, unless it&apos;s for defense. You can&apos;t research anything, except for +damage and +armor in one single building and that&apos;s it. Instead you choose some evolution stuff right before the mission starts. This is actually good, but taking away strategy and variety in each and every mission for that is far too annoying and only necessary because everything is scripted like hell - no time for actual gameplay / decisions here ! MUST GO FAST ! FAST IS FUN !
<br>
<br>This game is just out of control. Ressource gathering is either low or explodes, no healthy middle area, units are built in masses and also die in masses, thanks to the ressource flow and damage spikes. In the end you get a hero unit that can just blow up a whole base...
<br>Just... what were they thinking...
<br>Strategy game... ffs.
<br>
<br>At that point I&apos;m just gonna pirate the last part of the trilogy, assuming that it just continues on it&apos;s path downhill from here. If it&apos;s any good or even better or like, real good, THEN I&apos;ll buy it.
<br>
<br>If I had anything to say it&apos;d be this:
<br>1) Fire the idiot writing the story. Any school kid of any school at any age can do equal or better.
<br>2) Stop the heavy scripting. It&apos;s beyond annoying that the game tell&apos;s me how I should play in a strategy game or forces me to play a certain way. You&apos;re allowed to do that some time, if it adds to the game, is fun or any other good reason. But not all the time non-stop !
<br>3) The economy needs a redesign ! Mass harvesting as only tactical dimension for an economy is poor design. Past games already delivered good, fun, engaging ideas. Just because Starcraft 1 didn&apos;t have them doesn&apos;t mean Starcraft 2 would be less fun with them. Instead try those. C&amp;C had ressource depots, base capture, ressource stealing, intel sabotage, tech stealing, power levels and actual harvesters out in the field. Starcraft 2 is shallow compared to just this one game, even if it&apos;s just economical options. And there are other examples. Just pick what works and is fun but stop this mass everything concept because it has no depth !
<br>4) Give tech structures a purpose besides existing. Because that&apos;s all the tech buildings are good for in the campaign.
<br>5) Tell story like you did in Starcraft 1: Let the other characters talk to the player instead of having them act as if the player doesn&apos;t exist. That just disconnects.
<br>6) Actually play your game and see if it&apos;s fun. And stop ruining it.

They either falsely praise the game due to the reviewer being a idiot and/or paid off, or they sweep the game under the rug as if the game is the worst thing ever. The reality is that this is a very fun, but poorly written and mediocre product.
<br>
<br>Firstly, if you played Wings of Liberty; you pretty much know what you&apos;re getting here. I&apos;m going to compare this to Wings of Liberty; because I assume you played the last game or you probably wouldn&apos;t be playing this one.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem with Heart of the Swarm, which was also the biggest problem of Wings of Liberty; is the story. The story in this game is the worst thing you&apos;ll ever have seen since... well... Wings of Liberty. It&apos;s full of plot holes and meaningless made up crap for the sake of filler missions. I should mention that they ruin Kerrigan&apos;s character beyond belief, but is that surprising after they&apos;ve shamelessly ruined Jim Raynor already? Someone needs to tell these that Jim and Kerrigan never even had a romance in the past. Blizzard pulled that right out of their ass for the sake of these games. They wanted to force in a needless romance with no idea how to even write it, just like Georgia Lucas with Episode 2. It also reminds me of when they revived Illidan for the Burning Crusade just so he could be a raid boss. I hate how Blizzard completely ruins everything previously established in order to just &quot;do their own thing&quot; in follow up games. If you were once a fan of their games; things like this are downright insulting.
<br>
<br>Here, for instance, Kerrigan goes right back to being Zerg, even though she was suppose to be &quot;cured&quot; in the last game, something that already made no sense.(Not a spoiler either; look at the box cover and read it) It&apos;s very clear they didn&apos;t write very far ahead. Also, Jim and Kerrigan&apos;s romance is almost as pathetic as Bell and Edward&apos;s. But did you really expect much, after playing Wings of Liberty? This was a follow up to that; and seeing as how that game&apos;s story was up in every possible way and full of plot holes, why shouldn&apos;t this one be too? The cutscenes are numerous and have a nice quality to them... but it&apos;s just hard to care when the game doesn&apos;t make any damn sense nor has any kind of competent story you&apos;re going to be invested in. Like Wings of Liberty; as soon as you finish the game, you&apos;ll not care about anything that happened in it. I could go on more about how awful the stories are in these games; but I think you get the point.
<br>
<br>Putting aside the awful storytelling; you&apos;ve now got the actual gameplay... which is more or less the same as it was in the last game. The biggest differences are that the game is played 2-3x faster and Kerrigan is a main hero in most missions. Both of these are bad things. The faster pacing saps out most of the fun. By the time you get a hold of what you&apos;re doing in a mission; it&apos;s over. There&apos;s no time to actually enjoy it, think about what you&apos;re doing, or fool around. I hate how Starcraft has basically become an action genre. Why does it have to be so fast? Wings of Liberty was fast, but not &quot;this&quot; fast, and the originals were snails by comparison. But that&apos;s not to say that the game is hard. It&apos;s quite easy on the first 2 settings; especially since Kerrigan is a 1 woman army that can pillage and plunder forces with little to no help. That&apos;s more fun sapped right out of the game, because an RTS isn&apos;t suppose to revolve around 1 walking demi god. Warcraft 3, which I loved, had heroes, but they couldn&apos;t solo half an army this effectively. Kerrigan is better than a level 10 hero in Warcraft 3; and much so, even right away.
<br>
<br>I should add that the game features pointless upgrade choices and filler missions to unlock more. It&apos;s very clear that they had almost no content to work with; so they just filled it up with all this This is what happens when you break 1 game into 3 pieces. But while they managed to fill out Wings of Liberty with a nice campaign; the Zerg got the short stick. The campaign feels disappointingly short due to how fast the missions unfortunately are; and everything not in a mission, is just overly obvious padding or window dressing. You&apos;ve then got the multiplayer... which didn&apos;t do much except add a few new units. They want 60$ for this BTW. So you basically paid 120$ just to play SC2 online. Good for you if you did that, but I didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>In summery it&apos;s tough to recommend this. It does have a campaign that can be some fun, but once again is drowned is terrible cutscenes that do nothing but fuel a totally nonsensical story. And since you already got multiplayer with the first game... you&apos;re basically paying for that again. I leave this one up for you to decide.

The game is even more simplified than in WoL and feels like a 4-5 hour long matinee movie  a soap opera in space.  Could have been alright as an expansion that cost around 15 bucks but not marketed as a  full game.

The campaign also comes in fairly short on the clock, with most people being able to knock it out over the course of a weekend.  Also, if battle.net goes offline while you&apos;re playing, you lose any single player achievements you may have gotten for that map during that play session.  Blizzard has the talent and money to produce better quality than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3036751">Expand</a></span>

<br>So great game, too short of a story, overly easy even on Hard difficulty. I even got the CE that had nothing special in it it was 100 Euro. All in all disappointed by the content quantity in the game as well as in the physical CE box.

The scenes itself feel a little disconnected as when someone thought &quot;Oh, it would be cool if Kerrigan would do this. And later that&quot;  without really caring about why she would do it. The game was no edges. It&apos;s all round and comfy. Also it kinda does the Warcraft 3 limbo. Now since Humans and Zerg are more-or-less at peace, we will have some Protoss fun in the next title and i REALLY strongly guess that we have to team up against the evil space-god-zerg-protoss-hybrid-xel&apos;naga whatsoever antagonists and we will leave the universe in the state of fragile peace like we did in wc3.

Sure why not? Cinematic trailer gave me hopes, all sneak peaks into story and so forth. Bought the game and played trough story. While playing the campaign i nonstop feeling &quot;When this thing will evolve into a story&quot;. No zerg feeling, kerrigan hunting for revenge and most missions were fillers. Story did not go in depth about what is happening. Usually in Blizzard games the story itself runs deep and gives feeling you are actually watching a movie. This time? Mission after mission, nothing new and very little progress.
<br>
<br>Now that the rant about story is done. Let&#xB4;s look into other parts. Graphics, no improvement there. Still eye candy to play for my taste and i like the way they changed good part of the layout&#xB4;s etc.
<br>
<br>I&#xB4;m not big into all this 1v1 action. Game is horrible in my opinion when it comes down to 1v1, game might be over if you looked over shoulder and missed 2 seconds before making first SCV, Probe or Drone. Reacting into something wrong or not scouting something out in time. Just not my idea of an strategy game, but still watching streams, tournaments and so forth it&#xB4;s highly entertaining. New units are mainly boring and lame. Hellbat &amp; Widow mine are very awesome, but rest just total letdown. Was expecting more, even if it meant deleting few old ones. New maps are nice in visual. In my opinion best part about this expansion is leveling system (pointless, but still), worker count and &quot;competive AI&quot; play..
<br>
<br>Only reason i hit 7 for this expansion is arcade games. Game been out for 5 days and only thing keeps me logging from time to time is play some arcade action. Hat&#xB4;s off to the hard working map makers out there. Sum up of everything: Overall ok expansion, i was hoping more from Blizzard since they used to have high standards from themselves. I would buy  this expansion again only for the story, even if it&#xB4;s lame. I stop this review by saying good old blizzard phrase &quot;Expansion will fix it!&quot;. Protoss campaign im booking rest of my hope on you! </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3037572">Expand</a></span>

Some of the new units are neat but the Multiplayer feels pretty much the same, rewarding speed over strategy and skill. But if you are like me, more interested in the Campaign than the MP, I wouldn&apos;t get too excited for the &quot;epic&quot; story of HotS since it makes the cheesy plot of Wings of Liberty look like it was written by Dostoyevsky. Kerrigan is just not as interesting as she was in Broodwar. There she was a master manipulator as well as a tragic character; here she feels like an spoiled teenage girl who happens to command the Zerg Swarm. Some of the Campaign missions are cool since not all revolve around destroying all enemies on the map, but you won&apos;t spend more than 7 hours in the Single Player. Heart of the Swarm may look like a masterpiece compared to Blizzard&apos;s last pile of garbage known as Diablo 3 but it is hardly the  major improvement of Starcraft II that we&apos;ve been waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3077465">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Great Game! Cant wait to see the third part of the trilogy! Its not better than Wings of Liberty, its just a different compaign. I think Blizzard should still work on some PvP components as there are a few balance issues appear (easpecially when you play toss vs terrans) As fot the story  its amazing. I hope they will release it next year</span>

The new units are pretty decent too, with the Viper being my favourite add-on(can pull entrenched siege tanks and swiftly turn the tide of the battle in favour of the zerg player) Countless new strategies in multiplayer are avaliable, and if you are smart enough, you can destroy a entrenched position easily using the new units. Overall, the modifications made to the multiplayer are very good, and mass siege tanks or void rays can not be enough now, to win a multiplayer game.
<br>The campaign is equally good. What I liked most is the hero system of Heart of Swarm: You control Kerrigan in virtually every mission. She is revived at free cost at the Hatcheries and is almost as powerful as the old QoB unit of WoL(though i feel that  the new system of evoluting Kerrigan is overpowered, and despite being similar to the WC3 system, its almost twice as powerful than the latter system.) When Kerrigan reaches level 80, you will simply bring destruction in the campaign maps with almost no cost. Through i like swift destruction, however. Also I strongly like the concept of invading planets with strains very useful to fuel the evolution of the Swarm.
<br>The story is good, focused on Kerrigan revenge against Mengsk, and telling us more of the hybrid enigma. I don&apos;t really care about voice making or something like that, but I think that the actors have done a great job(both representing the talks and the voices). Through the game is relatively very good, the cinematics simply excel. Film-like quality, and excellent  representation. The cinematics also reveal the new personality of Kerrigan  and that&apos;s what I like most.
<br>I haven&apos;t bought the game yet, but believe me, if you like Starcraft 2 enough to consider it as one of the best RTS strategy games of all time, this expansion is a must-buy for you. You&apos;ll not regret it. Overall I rate this game a strong 8.8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3050146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Also, the multiplayer is much more casual friendly with the points system, interface, and arcade.
<br>
<br>A must buy for any RTS lover! A must by for people who enjoy social gaming!</span>

Since it&apos;s a Blizzard game, it will never be on sale or cheap, so I figured I&apos;d get it right away. Blizzard tried to make the game appeal to less hardcore RTS gamers and more noob friendly. Indicator on the base showing how many drones/probes/scvs are gathering out of what is the &apos;maximum&apos; capacity. This kind of takes away from the management of the economy in some ways so that you can use your time to micro instead. Other features like being able to select idle drones also makes it easier to manage. The campaign gameplay is pretty good. It&apos;s different from WOL enough to make it standalone but is a bit on the easy side. Even most of the achievements can be received without playing the harder difficulties. The story is also a bit weak and relatively straightforward and it&apos;s also a bit short. The new units are a pretty nice add on, but haven&apos;t gotten the time to use them all yet. Especially the new ones for protoss/terran, in which they really should have introduced via the story...went to play multiplayer and they just &apos;appeared&apos;, didnt have time to read or get used to them at all. Multiplayer AI has gotten better and now does not have the same weaknesses as before ie) use air superiority, or purely destroy AI with cloaked units...it severely punishes massing one type of unit. Auto adjusting difficulty of AI is also a nice touch.
<br>
<br>The pace of the game seems quicker, and forces the player to expand and hold positions. It&apos;s more about choosing when to expand and when to attack, rather than hiding in your base and massing a huge army, which was much of SC1. Mineral patches and gas, seem to run out faster, which leads to quicker games, quicker gameplay. Learning hot-keys become more of requirement, rather than a want. It&apos;s just not possible to keep up to any player or AI without using any hot keys at all...
<br>
<br>Overall, not bad. Would buy it if you have cash to spare or if you have some friends to play multiplayer with online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3069394">Expand</a></span>

Production values are through the roof, cut-scenes are amazing, game play is fun and addictive like always.  SC is one of my game staples along with the MGS series and even though I was slightly disappointed by WoL, this game pumped me up for the third one.  The story could be considered a little over-used and trite but overall awesome time.

Visuals, Story &amp; Characters, Gameplay and the Challenge is presents, Length and replay value, Multiplayer. Let&apos;s get started. Visuals are dependent on your computer. With my super monster 9000 of a computer the visual and CGI are TOP NOTCH but because of the overwhelming numbers the Zerg presents I even found MY computer to be lagging which has never occurred in a game in ever! The details are truly amazing in this. Story is great but useless if you haven&apos;t been keeping up with the Starcraft story so it&apos;s knida needed to know what&apos;s going on to follow along. As for the characters everyone fits the bills I enjoyed everything and I saw a side to the Zerg I&apos;d never thought to fathom or see. Gameplay in this is extremely well done! Never have I been so immured into a Starcraft game in... ever. The story flows so well and how they integrate it along with the missions makes you truly feel like you are part of the Swarm. Challenge though is up to you. I must say this first and foremost with replay value... if you want to beat the game do it in one run because I couldn&apos;t find the will to go through on Brutal... I was just so bored. So it really lacked in the replay department but if you choose Brutal your first run you&apos;ll defiantly be playing this game for hours angry as hell at the crazy things you face. I never once played Multiplayer in Starcraft. Not the normal kind oh no but thanks to Blizzard adding tutorials now and even an unranked mode I been enjoying it to no end! It&apos;s really fun! So overall I have to give this game a 9 out of 10 as the replay isn&apos;t all there but everything else hits home. This is a definite must buy and must own for those who have SC Wings of Liberty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3063248">Expand</a></span>

And i have to say i am a bit disappointed. The plot is too simple and to be honest feels uninspired and sucked out of a tonn of forced brainstorms of the campaign team. Most new characters are really vague and boring and the old ones aren&apos;t as charismatic as they were in WoL. The only new character i love is Abathur the Evolutions expert he is really charismatic and funny in his own way. Just for Abathur i give the campaign an average score rather than a fail.   I understand that it is much harder to make a campaign for an Alien race than for humans and the team had to be really creative to make it interesting but they kinda failed to do tho. It is a solid experience but u don&apos;t get that warm feeling like u are watching a really good movie that hooks u from the first missions as the WoL campaign did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3048621">Expand</a></span>

A tone of delicate details in missions and cut-scenes,  interesting conversation inside the Leviathan and abather. Bitter-sweet ending capped it though it was a little depressing.
<br>
<br>like the multi-player (so far, dont nerf terran into the ground like you did in wings please!) and the UI changes as well. Good things lie ahead for the SC2 franchise if they keep the quality up like this for Lov.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3035649">Expand</a></span>

I grew up on 90&apos;s action movies so the campaign doesn&apos;t bother me, i enjoyed the story. I would give it a nine overall but i refuse to let people who give zero&apos;s get away with that. No game deserves a zero. Now for the review. The story is going in the same direction that wings of liberty was, so if you didn&apos;t mind the dialogue or story in Wings of liberty you will like the campaign. The interface for Kerrigan is cool and being able to choose powers for Kerrigan was fun. The cinematics were great and the online is amazing. I felt the missions were more varied and overall a success. For the online you can complain that not enough units were added in the expansion but i feel starcraft has always been about balance and i think blizzard pulled it off well. If you didn&apos;t like wings of liberty there really won&apos;t be anything here that will catch your eye or satisfy you. Is it game changing or pushes the boundaries no, but i feel its a good game nonetheless. If you like playing rts games or/and are a fan of starcraft i say buy it. The game is worth the $40 but if your on the fence i say wait a bit and then get it when the price drops. Overall a good game which may stumble a little but i give it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3035615">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty of normal is far too easy for experienced SC2 players (particularly zerg players). However multiplayer is obviously where the game makes a lot of sense to buy. Personally spent over 100 hours playing multiplayer already and I havent even scratched the surface. A great game.</span>

The store was pretty rich and engaging I look at it like Darth Vader going back to the light side in ROTJ and then having to remain Darth Vader to save the universe this of course being compared to Kerrigan. The level design was great and there were some pretty awesome missions. There were a few missions that had a very cool platform feel to that with was neat. With games like D3 being a let down you won&apos;t be disappointed with this installment some may hate the game but RTS&apos;s have never been something everyone has enjoyed and Starcraft 2 is the cream of the crop right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3030278">Expand</a></span>

Although, for those, who actually played Wings of Liberty(later WoL) this wait might not have been so long after all(considering the amount of gaming everyone was doing). I am of course talking about the wait for the Heart of The Swarm(later HoTS) sequel  a game which brings us one step closer to the epic conclusion which will be Legacy of The Void. A game we all anticipated and deserved. Or is it? To answer this question I feel I must divide this review into two parts. And I am reluctant to say that the single player part of the game was quite disappointing.
<br>
<br>For those of you, who aren&apos;t familiar with the setting, the game is about a human soldier Sarah Kerrigan, who was left behind on a Zerg(an alien race) infested planet by her commander and afterwards artificially evolved into a monster. She would later become the sole leader of the Zerg and get saved by her friend Jim Raynor. Jim is deeply in love with her so he doesn&apos;t let his fellow humans kill her. The events in HoTS are what follows afterwards(WARNING: A LOT OF SPOILERS!).  Firstly, the plot was not worthy of WoL, which means it couldn&apos;t even hold a candle to the first Starcraft or the Brood War expansion. It was cheesy at times, the ending was completely predictable and it wasn&apos;t at all thrilling. For example, for those, who remember the first Starcraft game, Tassadar had to make difficult choices like whether to trust Zerathul, who was an outcast of his people at that time, or to ignore him and risk a Zerg invasion of the entire galaxy. Or how Sarah Kerrigan was betrayed by Arcturus Mengsk and turned into a zerg monster afterwards, how Jim Raynor was so passionate about her and how it broke his heart and changed his life. HoTS was very lacking of such thrilling twists that actually keep you interested in what&apos;s going to happen later on.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, the missions weren&apos;t challenging at all. The difficulty level &apos;Hard&apos; should probably be renamed to &apos;Very Easy&apos; in an upcoming patch just to make it more accurate. Even the Brutal difficulty didn&apos;t prove to be much of a challenge. And the hunt for the achievements is also much easier than in WoL and probably takes twice less the time. Which is very bad, to be quite frank. Simply because a lot of players buy the game just for single player campaign alone and they want to prolong their gaming experience as much as possible.
<br>
<br>But then, I actually couldn&apos;t say that the campaign was a complete waste of time. It had some good moments as well. Even though the story wasn&apos;t very good, the missions were quite fun and very versatile. Also, the cinematics were very cool and they probably were the thing I was looking forward to the most after every mission. And Kerrigan was really bad-ass. She had a lot of personality, she was witty, passionate, relentless and determined to have her way. The voice over was perfect and I&apos;m actually really sad that she won&apos;t be playing such a huge role in the upcoming expansion. But I really think that she and Jim deserved a better ending considering that throughout the whole game she was driven by the feelings she had towards him. And of course we also have the multiplayer part of the game, which delivers a very unique and practically endless gaming experience. Even though to some it may seem that the online play in HoTS isn&apos;t really that different from WoL considering that there are only a few new units. But don&apos;t be alarmed  they are dead wrong. It&apos;s these few seemingly small changes are they key aspect that actually changes almost everything  the builds, the compositions, the styles and strengths of every race and basically the whole mechanic of the game. Of course your knowledge of WoL mechanics is still valuable and gives you the edge over less experienced players, but to be an accomplished player you&apos;ll have to learn new builds, that require a lot more multitasking than the ones in WoL which makes the game even more challenging and further prolongs the gaming experience.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Heart of The Swarm didn&apos;t disappoint. Even the single player oriented gamers should try this game(I guess you could get a lot of time out of the arcade mode plus the versus A.I. feature has been completely revamped and is a lot more challenging than it used to be), especially if you liked Wings of Liberty. Normally I would give the campaign part of of the game a 6/10 and a solid 10/10 for the multiplayer and write an average of 8/10, but considering that the game is largely based on the multiplayer feature I just can&apos;t let my self give it less than a 9/10. It is an excellent game  good work Blizzard!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3040524">Expand</a></span>

If you are on the fence about buying it take some time and look through YouTube, there are hundreds of videos over the past 6 months about HoTS. It is exactly what I expected that I would get, because I have been following it for some time. I have yet to play the single player, but if it is half as good as the Wings of Liberty campaign I wont be disappointed.</span>

It&apos;s meant to be experienced online as a balanced and competitive multiplayer RTS, and this is the one thing that SCII: HotS does better than any other game in the genre. Period. The UI is great, and with the new additions of unranked play and the new leveling system, the game is more friendly to newcomers than ever before. Plus, it comes in a nice, polished package that is easy on your hardware even if you are playing on an outdated rig. And perhaps best of all, you won&apos;t have to worry about any crippling connection issues with Blizzard&apos;s Battle.net service (a la Diablo III and SimCity), and you can play to your heart&apos;s content as soon as you install the game. This is best RTS experience on the market and deserves a 10. However, if you&apos;re playing this game only for the single player component, knock the score down to a 8.5. The campaign is extremely entertaining, although it is a bit short, and is also the easiest campaign in a blizzard RTS to date. Some of the mutations available to Kerrigan&apos;s swarm as well as some of her own abilities are so powerful that you can basically sleepwalk through many of the missions even on the harder difficulty settings. Despite that, it&apos;s still a blast to play. There are several boss-type fights, which are extremely fun, and evolving your swarm in between missions is an enjoyable experience and allows you to customize the swarm to fit your play style. The story is a C+ effort at best    typical of Blizzard&apos;s efforts as of late. Don&apos;t expect the same type of gripping narrative as Brood War, or you will be disappointed. Still, this is a more than worthy expansion to a great game, and deserves all the praise it gets. It&apos;s not perfect, and I&apos;d give it a 9.5 if I could, but this is the game that sets the standard for the genre, and HotS definitely raises the bar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3031170">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m a fairly critical person in general. I&apos;ll admit that I&apos;m the first one to pounce on the negative aspects of a book or movie or game.
<br>But StarCraft II is taboo.
<br>
<br>You can&apos;t do that. You can&apos;t be negative about this game and still consider yourself a good person.
<br>
<br>Everything in this game is perfect.
<br>If you&apos;re trying to decide whether or not to buy this game because you&apos;re worried the story will be a let down, well, listen. If you&apos;ve ever watched Firefly or Doctor Who, the same cheesy cliche-esque stuff is in the StarCraft II campaign. The story may be corny, but in that lies the charm.
<br>
<br>I bought this for the multiplayer, having won more than five thousand matches in Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm&apos;s predecessor. The campaign (~7 hours in) is fantastic. It&apos;s beautiful (graphically), it&apos;s got deep characters with questionable motivations and backgrounds, and it&apos;s got an interesting story with really fun gameplay. I expected a lot from the campaign, considering Wings of Liberty had a campaign touted as the best in the history of RTS gaming, and you know what? The campaign in Heart of the Swarm TOPPED that. Yeah, it EXCEEDED my expectations, and again: I&apos;m not the most positive of people.
<br>
<br>So when I see 0&apos;s and anything less than an 8 on Metacritic, I know that the person who rated the game as such is either a troll, or has no taste in games.
<br>
<br>To sum it up,
<br>If you&apos;re looking for an RTS that&apos;s got a casual vibe to the single player with multiple difficulty settings and a fun and interesting, immersive experience, buy this game.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for something competitive to sink hours into fighting battles against others online, buy this game.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a game to play with your friends online cooperatively in a very wide range of custom games (I&apos;m talking about tower defense maps, tug-of-war maps, hero maps like DotA, etc), buy this game.
<br>
<br>If you want to rail on Blizzard for greedy DRM or whatever other adjectives and nouns you can crunch together haphazardly, go ahead. But nobody cares because as long as Blizzard keeps on shaping these gems, we real gamers will keep on buying them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3030776">Expand</a></span>

Playing the HOTS multiplayer for the first time surprised me a lot: the whole gameplay got much smoother, the graphics got sharper. The tweaks and new units shows that Blizzard listened to the community (of course some minor balance changes will still be required). The new physics engine makes battles more spectacular both in multi- and in singleplayer mode. All in all, this game is the Blizzard quality I hoped I could once again experience (Diablo 3 was a disappointment for me).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3031503">Expand</a></span>

Times have changes, games have changed and the gamers have changed. However, it is a fully-fledged expansion set that improves all the aspects of the original StarCraft II. The single-player storyline may be a little dull (still being very well crafted), but it&apos;s in the Battle.net and multiplayer aspects that HotS shines. It guarantees a very smooth transition from WoL, opens up lots of possibilities for newcomers and gives many incentives to play the multiplayer battles for hundreds of hours. In the times of hidden DLCs that are embedded in the original game, Blizzard proves once again that it&apos;s one of the best developers in the world that treats the gamers with the respect they deserve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3039896">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First things first, after the cheesy single player campaign in WoL (and after a horrible Diablo 3 storyline), Blizzard redeems itself in this expansion. The HotS campaign might not feature Bioware-perfect dialogue and character development, but it gets the job done, it&apos;s engaging, emotional, much less cheesy than before and actually has characters with motivations and feelings. They are quite memorable (unlike the one-dimensional testosterone packed, bravado-infused Hyperion shipmates of the original) It&apos;s a very straightforward story, but it&apos;s well executed and the in-game and CGI cutscenes work well and don&apos;t seem as choppy as in WoLl. Moreover, most of the scenes are recorded so you don&apos;t need a powerful computer to see the cinematics in all their splendor.
<br>
<br>The UI of the game got a huge facelift. The multiplayer got a slight overhaul with addition of new units and abilities to each race, but it&apos;s mostly in the surrounding areas, where the changes really make the greatest impact. The leveling system, while imperfect, makes sure that losing a game is not time wasted, and the unlockable dances/portraits and unit skins are now only tied to this system, making the simple process of playing more rewarding. Overall, it&apos;s a perfect expansion. If you didn&apos;t like the original, then there&apos;s nothing for you in this installment, but that&apos;s the point. SC2 is an RTS where change in underlying mechanics is impossible (how would you change chess?) but the polish and error-correction that Blizzard undertook really makes the game feel more cohesive and enjoyable in all aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3036615">Expand</a></span>

One of the best games in a while and i&apos;m sure i will play even more SC 2 in the future, now that HotS has arrived.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3034024">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t think it was possible for Blizzard to polish their starcraft sequel any more. With their refinements to the interface and overall experience, Heart of the Swarm is a breath of fresh air in a staling eSports-orientated title. I had my doubts of the new units, but am warming up to them, and even becoming thankful of their addition.
<br>
<br>The Single Player experience is cinematic, and enjoyable, and revolves heavily around Kerrigan, the central protagonist. This is not a bad thing, thanks to an excellent cast of supporting characters, gameplay elements, interesting missions and appearances from other series characters. Overall it made an impact to see Kerrigan&apos;s journey and development following the events of WoL. Blizzard have done an outstanding job of injecting a Zergy storyline with feel and a Human touch, and have given fans of the Swarm another way to identify with the race. My only complaint is that the campaign portion was short and sweet, and relatively too easy on Brutal when compared with WoL. Not that I liked playing Terran much. HotS has left me in anticipation of Legacy of the Void.
<br>
<br>The addition of unranked matchmaking is the best thing for me. This encourages practice and refinement, and most importantly, experimentation  without any of the stress associated with competitive laddering.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3039891">Expand</a></span>

Overall, I&apos;ve been playing this off and on for 2 years and I can say for sure that there is virtually no limit to the amount there is to learn about it. It&apos;s huge, it&apos;s a lifetime game, getting to know it feels like I&apos;m getting a small Degree for a university course. I would say getting to know the technical (controls/interface) is bigger than some entire games, and then getting to know the technicality of each race (builder order/units/uniqueness) is like 3 full other games (3 races), and then actually getting good at the game is like 10 full other games. So you&apos;re basically getting 14 games worth in this one game. That&apos;s actually not even an overstatement because I&apos;ll be playing this for 5 years and I&apos;ll probably get 14 times the number of hours I get out of most games. Wow, I just realized that I&apos;m not in hyperbole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3070672">Expand</a></span>

The story is fairly engaging with great characters, good rising and falling action, decent dialog(some of the dialog from the other Zerg creatures could have been better). However there are parts in the story that where it seemed like the writers wanted to make the player sympathize for the Zerg. How can you ever sympathize with a giant alien killing machine? Also the societies they&apos;ve created on Zerg&apos;s origin planet make very little sense. The Proto-Zerg creatures are feral beasts why would they even have societies and packs when their lifestyle seems to be a highlanderesque dog eat dog. Gameplay wise there really isn&apos;t much to it. Its the same old build a base and a bunch of creatures and attack the missions are incredibly easy with a few unique gems in there. The new leveling system is interesting but falls short as it seems like a substitute for the research portion of WoL only minus the quirky scientist guy. Overall I feel like Starcraft 2 hasn&apos;t really done anything to redefine the RTS genre but because the game flows smoothly with a pretty good story and atmosphere I&apos;ll give it a 6. If you&apos;re a Starcraft fan its worth it for the story but beyond that the game doesn&apos;t really have much to add.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3031047">Expand</a></span>

I felt like Blizzard was segregating the community and that the community would form a coup against them. However great cinematics, familiar gameplay, and a coherent Blizzard storyline: I was going to give the single player a shot and enjoy the multiplayer regardless, despite feeling like &#xA3;25 was too expensive.
<br>
<br>The point of this expansion, like many others  is to fix the shortcomings of the previous title, and continue the storyline while possibly expanding on the gameplay. Blizzard succeeded. Take the critics reviews with a pinch of salt  the singleplayer game experience draws a lot on the successes of other genres. There are many mechanics within the story that you don&apos;t often see in a RTS that alter the pace of the game and turn what is ordinarily a trivial singleplayer vs bots into an engaging and dynamic-flowing-epic tale of a fallen, and yet rising hero. Continuing where WoL left off you are in control of Kerrigan, or as you may know her &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;. Your control of her is one of the important advancements in the core gameplay. Kerrigan has abilities and levels up (persistently through the game)  by completing objectives within missions. These abilities can be changed before beginning  allowing you to change your tactics entirely. It also fits symbiotically with the story of the zerg, their constant need and desire for evolution. On the subject of Zerg  you also control their evolutionary path through side missions, while communicating with &quot;Abathur&quot;. the hive minds evolution expert who searches for new essences to incorporate into the swarm.
<br>
<br>There are missions that involve traditional RTS elements, with base building, expansion and race-against-the-clock battles with an overpowering enemy; and there are missions that involve controlling only a few units  with specific abilities, and fighting against tough and epic bosses and armies with devastating effect. These are tuned well  they are not too easy but are satisfyingly challenging, the game alters it&apos;s pace constantly and frankly it is the best single player experience I have encountered in a long time  I rarely give single player a second thought on any game but I found this  surprisingly to be a gem. Well worth the money  and better than the previous single player tenfold. Alongside this  the multiplayer is expanded greatly also  new portraits, new achievements, new leveling up system  new mechanics, league changes, interface changes  lots of new multiplayer maps and a long awaited non-ranked matchmaking system. Obviously the multiplayer changes are something that is impossible to review without many hours being spent to consider the balancing and relative powers of the individual races. I believe Blizzard achieved what they advertised, and the expansion is 100% worth getting if you have the previous title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3036634">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s so many achievements still to do as well (I&apos;m only about 35%).  Very challenging singleplayer game.  Very fun.  Great story.  Has a lot of cool moments and great sense of accomplishment and a feeling of &quot;kicking ass&quot;.  I will admit that some of the intro&apos;s are annoying and I skip those.  The missions where u get your unit upgrades could have been better.  I liked being able to see the ability and how it works, but they should have made a few more of those levels with a micro challenge like on bnet to make it more fun.
<br>
<br>Also, you only get to play Zerg except for a brief Terran usage.  They should have made it like SC1 and Broodwar expansions using 3 races.  They could have done it by reducing the cutscenes and character discussions which are useless except in game.  It reminded me of Diablo, upgrading Kerrigan with different skills and XP.  It was pretty cool, but I think again, they should have just cut all that extra useless stuff out and focused on just giving you core Kerrigan abilities.
<br>
<br>Great to see some new ideas in this game and it definitely was fun playing the singleplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3037317">Expand</a></span>

I sat here for a good 5 mins trying to think of something I did not like about the game. But honestly, as far as RTS&apos;s go this is a great one.
<br>
<br>Story gets a 11/10  The story is not original, but its hard to be truly original these days with the shear amount of product out there. The plot is a great continuation on the first 4 games, it has sacrifice, pain, hope, and tragedy. What starts out as a great re-unification of our favorite lovers, separated by a war, quickly turns into tragedy, eventually (without spoiling any story) the prospect of great hope comes at the end, though permanent, irreversible sacrifices may have been made. Truly made me feel for the characters in this world and their struggle. I am looking forward to the final act!
<br>
<br>Play Control and Interface, 10/10  Its hard to screw the pooch on this one, never the less some developers can fail with immeasurable grace and precision. Blizzard has enough experience with this that if they ever got a 9 or an 8, it would be a complete fail. Keyboard controls and character controls are centered around the left side of the keyboard, and Kerrigan&apos;s controls are always q,w,e, no matter what skills are mapped to the character. Mechanics and Replay-ability 10/10  Like in the previous campaign game you get upgrades to your units and buildings, this is done a little differently in HotS however. Short concise missions are used to demonstrate new abilities. Additionally, and unlike the in the original Star Craft II campaign, you earn ALL upgrades, which can not all be used at once but can be swapped and changed during the interm between missions. Achievements are plentiful, and again, the hard and brutal difficulty setting have their own.
<br>
<br>If I had one complaint about this game it would be that most missions are timed in some way, either to finish or to collect optional goals, so most of the game is go go go. While there are a few missions that will let you just build and play the game at your own pace, they are indeed in the minority.

The main negative with this expansion is that missions are more linear. You choose a world as Kerrigan and end up doing a 3-4 mission sequence that you can&apos;t get out of.  This makes the game somewhat linear for long stretches.</span>

The multiplayer improvements are great thats the only reason why you probably got starcraft 2, if not then why did you get starcraft, get company of heroes which has a great singleplayer and a ok multiplayer</span>

Although I have yet to complete the campaign, I&apos;m enjoying the continuation of the story, as well as everything that goes on in between missions.

<br>
<br>Other than that, I highly recommend this game to any fan of Starcraft: Wings of Liberty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/starcraft-ii-heart-of-the-swarm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3082358">Expand</a></span>
