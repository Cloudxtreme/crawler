<br>
<br>Seriously though, this is the kind of DLC that&apos;s justifiable. Bioshock Infinite with the added DLC is nothing short of a masterpiece. It takes the cake as my favorite of the Bioshock games.
<br>
<br>Pros: The story
<br>The atmosphere
<br>The cinematic gameplay (the directing and perspective work on this is amazing)
<br>Completely new type of game play. (Combat isn&apos;t necessary, you have to find other solutions to situations besides just hack and slash)
<br>The characters
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>It&apos;s the end of Bioshock.
<br>
<br>Overall, the DLC provides a good 6 hours of extra game time, if you take the time to explore most of the areas to do some side questing. I think I missed some voxophone recordings, still. Also, if you plan on playing through an even harder mode, they have 1999 mode and an extra 1998 mode.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t give many (if any) games this kind of score, but to me, it&apos;s definitely a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082851">Expand</a></span>

Unlike the first part of Burial At Sea, episode 2 focuses more on story. I won&apos;t spoil anything, but this DLC goes off constants and variables and connects BioShock and BioShock Infinite&apos;s universes. You play as Elizabeth instead of Booker in Burial At Sea Episode 2 and use more stealth. You get the skyhook, but can only knock back enemies as well as a few weapons and plasmids. The new weapon is the crossbow, which includes a noisemaker that distracts enemies, a poisonous gas one, and a tranquilizer dart. You also get the plasmid peeping Tom which makes you invisible. 1998 mode is also featured, which involves no killing and is similar in difficulty to 1999. Unfortunately,  when you die it goes back to the auto save instead of being revived, the screen after every time you die gives interesting details. Overall, the gameplay is almost identical to BioShock Infinite, with a couple differences since Elizabeth isn&apos;t as strong as Booker.  The DLC, like I said focuses on story and relates to BioShock and BioShock Infinite, so play this after you beat both games. The ending will leave you just as shocked and surprised as the ending of BioShock Infinite and if you loved the BioShock series, you will love this DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082203">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There was no reason to tie up all the Bioshock games with this final episode. The two separate worlds could have easily existed without much touching one another.
<br>
<br>Elizabeth&apos;s final chapter is frankly bleak. From the end of the original Infinite she has the all existence at her fingertips, all possibilities were open to her. But she took it upon herself to go on a brutal crusade against her father, to stamp out his very existence in every possible universe. I guess the story is a cautionary tale for vengeance at all costs as Elizabeth threw away everything for the sake of revenge, then again the poor girl was probably already broken from her upbringing.

<br>Whether I rate it highly or not I&apos;ll remember this game for a long time to come...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=5771025">Expand</a></span>

Episode 1 was terrible (short, didn&apos;t introduce almost anything new, except the setting), but Episode 2 does nothing to fix its predecessor&apos;s mistakes.
<br>First of all, gameplay feels underdeveloped and generic. Opponents&apos; AI is just bad - if you get spotted by someone, you can hide in the nearest shadows and perform a silent takedown on him once he&apos;s close enough. Also, it&apos;s hard to being spotted in the first place - even if you stand literally next so someone, he may not notice you at all. I&apos;ve felt that stealth missions from GTA San Andreas were more interesting than Burial at Sea, not even mentioning stealth oriented games, like Manhunt, Splinter Cell or Hitman series.
<br>The only good thing about gameplay is its idea - I have to admit, changing the brute force known from all the three Bioshock games was a fresh idea. However its practical usage is less than mediocre, and not everyone has to like it.
<br>
<br>Next important thing - the story. It&apos;s simply pathetic. Episode 1 is accused to be nonsensical and diminish/contradict Infinite&apos;s ending. Episode 2 doesn&apos;t even try to fix the plot - it adds only more nonsense to it. Connection between Infinite and Bioshock 1 fails so miserably, by contradicting with literally every single Bioshock in existence (especially Bioshock 2, but also there are problems with Big Daddies and Little Sisters&apos; history and behavior from Bioshock 1, or events from Bioshock: Rapture novel).
<br>
<br>The entire DLC seems to have little to no character development and chemistry. Elizabeth is actually quite boring and characterless - that&apos;s really sad, after seeing her complexity and evolution in Infinite. Atlas is a purely evil antagonist, with absolutely no good sides - thus making him one dimensional. He&apos;s portrayed as a dumb thug - nothing compared to Atlas known from Bioshock 1 or Bioshock: Rapture. Sally, not surprisingly, has no personality whatsoever, just like in Episode 1.
<br>
<br>The DLC&apos;s ending does not connect Infinite to Bioshock 1 - it tries to shock you and tell &quot;Bioshock 1 is superior to Infinite by every aspect. It&apos;s the one and only relevant game in the franchise&quot;. The &quot;connection&quot;, however, is based upon nonsensical plot, contradicting with other Bioshock games, yet dependant on them.
<br>Even though the idea of stealth oriented gameplay and Elizabeth being the protagonist is nice, the final product is far from satisfying. It&apos;s rushed, underdeveloped and its story, sadly, has no logical sense whatsoever. It&apos;s criticized by a huge part of the fanbase, to the point, it&apos;s often considered to be a &quot;what if scenario&quot; or, in more extreme cases, as a completely non canon product, rather than a &quot;bridge&quot; between Bioshock 1 and Infinite, as it originally was intended to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=5647068">Expand</a></span>

Personally, I&apos;m not as enthused.  First, it is a stealth game.  You can&apos;t brute force your way through things.  This is fine and all.  Personally, it made exploration a little tedious for me.  However, big tip - explore early on.  There are two upgrades to your Peeping Tom power which make stealth and exploration a lot less irritating.  Once I had those the game became considerably more fun without becoming too easy.
<br>
<br>Plot-wise it is certainly interesting and the ties between Columbia and Rapture are quite tantalizing.  That said, i wasn&apos;t too excited.  Burial at Sea 2 explains some things that I didn&apos;t really feel need a lot of explaining, completely retcon one of the pivotal moments in Infinite (in what I can only interpret as a bit of politically correct pandering) and as such really robs Infinite of a lot of what I liked about it.  I liked that Infinite really didn&apos;t take sides and instead presented the darkness in everyone.  It was a good way to address some sensitive issues without stepping on toes.  I liked that Infinite tied into Rapture a little bit.  Now the two are practically joined at the hip, it is all a bit much in my opinion.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it a 7 because it was fun and interesting so I feel it deserves a high score.  The only area it really loses points from me is plot.  I didn&apos;t like the directions the plot went and feel it was all a bit of a letdown.  Overall worth playing if you&apos;re a Bioshock fan but you&apos;re either going to love or hate the plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4095519">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My biggest problem with the game is that it feels more like a Bioshock 1 prequel than an expansion of Bioshock Infinite&apos;s story. The game focuses on filling in the plot holes of a 6+ year old game rather than addressing what unanswered questions you might have leftover from Infinite. It seems like it was made more for people who hold up Bioshock 1 as the gold standard, while those of us who preferred Infinite will probably find it disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4089845">Expand</a></span>

While these games were in the end more about storytelling than gameplay, I think we need to acknowledge that the story WAS interesting. Nothing is perfect and it is easy to nitpick elements that are less than satisfying along the way. however in the end it was a landmark franchise. It is worthwhile to buy and play all the parts of it. And in the end it leaves more than a few interesting memories, much as though we had read a good book. Thanks for the games to all the team at Irrational. Hope you all move on to new good things!

For the length, we have to remember that this is a 15 dollar DLC (cheaper if you bought the season pass), not a full game. You  didn&apos;t pay for a 15 hour epic, you will not get one. what they did deliver was closure, which is much needed in this series, the fact that they were able to pull together a satisfying ending to such an outstanding series is insane. As for the focus on story, if you wanted more gameplay, go check out the first Burial at Sea installment or Clash in the Clouds, Irrational Games said from the start part 2 would have a different style of gameplay for Elizabeth and that it would focus more on story. As for the quality, of the story it is fantastic. The way they setup dominoes and let you knock them down is incredibly fun, and the fact that they treat gamers like the smart humans they are is very enjoyable. The story ties into Bioshock 1 moreso than Infinite and will spoil the ending of the former if you have not played it. All in all, the game is worth every penny, if just for that closure you feel at the end. Good job, Irrational Games, and farewell. This is the sendoff every developer should hope to aspire to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4087712">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the game is well paced, looks beautiful, will keep you guessing until the very end just like any game that Ken Levine touches, and it&apos;s definitely a must play game for anyone who&apos;s played Bioshock Infinite and wants to get the full story. The game plays like a hybrid of the original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, and works well. Also, it looks like Irrational games definitely put a lot of time and work into making this DLC considering all the new art assets that can be found in it.  There are however a few glaring issues with this 4-5 hour DLC that do stop it from being a much better game than it could have been.
<br>
<br>One thing that bothered me was how the game&apos;s combat seems pretty unbalanced. For example, there&apos;s an invisibility power-up that you get very early on in the game. The power-up in and of itself is actually really fun at first, but as time goes on, I began to realize how broken and unfair the power-up was. Essentially, you can go invisible, melee kill an enemy, and then go back to being invisible without anyone laying a finger on you, and since the invisibility power-up takes away almost no salts from you, I found myself clearing out entire rooms with the process of going invisible, whacking a bad guy over the head, and then going back to being invisible.
<br>
<br>[Note: minor spoilers in this next paragraph]. The one other thing that kind of bothered me about the game was how it tried really hard to tie together BioShock Infinite&apos;s story with the original Bioshocks story. It all felt really unnecessary, and I really wished we didn&apos;t have to go back to a story that was already told to us over 6 years ago. I don&apos;t know, maybe Ken Levine is just trying to close off the Bioshock/Bioshock Infinite canon because he doesn&apos;t  want 2K Marine to make a Bioshock Infinite 2, or a prequel to the original Bioshock. Either way, I really wasn&apos;t blow away by the games ending like I was with Bioshock Infinite.
<br>
<br>Despite these few complains however, Burial at Sea - Episode 2 is still a must play game for anyone who has played Bioshock Infinite. It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s still a high note for Irrational games to go out on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082581">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anyway, The DLC&apos;s story is superb and like Bioshock Infinite it does have a great ending, the gameplay however does feel a little bit unfinished. The stealth mechanic in the game does work in most areas but some levels are designed in a way which will end up you going guns blazing which leads on to another issue.
<br>
<br>The DLC is heavily focused on stealth, you can go guns blazing but it does usually ends up with you dying. Now when you die in this DLC, unlike before when you were revieved and pushed back into battle. In this you will start from your last checkpoint which does force experimentation.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s artistic look is amazing and the voice acting is superb throughout and I couldn&apos;t say enough about this DLC, it takes around 3-4 hours if played in a stealthy way but play time may depend on skill.
<br>
<br>Perfect DLC, might just be the killer to Red Dead Redemptions&apos;  Undead Nightmare</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4083331">Expand</a></span>

Booker dewitt was killed by elizabeth so then that leaves elizabeth the last main character. It is indeed a new story and pretty much everything new. In fact, it is so different that it is some different from episode one that you must be in stealth mode pretty much through the entire episode for in order to stay alive.
<br>
<br>I regret buying episode two, wish I bought one instead, however the length is very short and booker doesn&apos;t die till the very end of the episode. Also, as I played through most of Ep.2 i am noticing somethings are not quite finished, would recommend playing with some friends or possibly waiting till the price goes down alot more. Don&apos;t want to pay some developers good, hard, earned money. (haven&apos;t earned it yet till the game/update is entirely fixed and fully working the way it should)
<br>
<br>Good idea&apos;s in the episodes, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4092444">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Also I absolutely loved the enemy characters, I would stand there for like 5 minutes just listening to them ramble off random catch phrases, I almost didn&apos;t want to kill them because they were so entertaining.
<br>
<br>Story is excellent and atmosphere surreal as usual. Can&apos;t wait for the next Bioshock installment.

While the overall package doesn&apos;t help push Bioshock Infinite to the level of the original Bioshock, it&apos;s a good way of wrapping things up for the game as whole.
<br>Episode two picks up right at the end of episode one: You play as Elizabeth for the first time in the series and you are tasked with saving the young girl from the first episode. The journey will take you from Rapture back to Columbia and back on a wonderful trip. The characters are really well done. Troy Baker does it again as Booker, who is now assisting Elizabeth on her journey. I really liked how things moved along here but I don&apos;t like the overall goal. This girl is not really that important to Elizabeth in the grand scheme of things and to see her go as far as she did for her is kinda odd. There are alot of things here to see and alot of things to do for a piece of DLC.
<br>The gameplay is more stealth in nature as Elizabeth can&apos;t take as many hits as Booker. There are moments where conflict is unavoidable and those are the worst parts of the game. It also doesn&apos;t help that, while there are new plasmids in the game, the plasmids they do give you are not very good, except for the first one you get that lets you see through walls for enemies. I liked the focus on stealth but the fact that they don&apos;t really give you an option, based on the weapons you get and the plasmids you get, doesn&apos;t leave alot of choice in how to handle alot of situations.
<br>The best part of the game though is the fact that this ties everything together. Honestly they could have worked it out to where you wouldn&apos;t need to have played the first episode if they wanted too but the fact remains that it&apos;s really nice to see the whole series finally tie together between Rapture and Columbia. The ending is also pretty good as it was definitely something I wasn&apos;t expecting. But, again, they could have found a better reason for Elizabeth to venture on than to find a girl she didn&apos;t even know.
<br>This game is more about the journey than the destination. I highly recommend anyone who liked either or both Bioshock games (I don&apos;t count Bioshock 2) to play this game and to see what happens in the end. It&apos;s very well done and it probably is the final piece of Bioshock content that will be coming out with the closure of Irrational Games earlier this year. It&apos;s a great momento to a great series and you will be extremely impressed with the way they wrap things up and set in motion the events from the original Bioshock.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4324942">Expand</a></span>

Taken on their own, Episode 2 is more enjoyable game and is a fulfilling end to the tale of Rapture and Columbia.  Episode 2 uses a different game play style that fits for your &quot;new&quot; protagonist.  This is a great send off for one of my favorite companies and game series (forget Bioshock 2 - not Irrational&apos;s game and it shows...).  Thankfully Ken Levine will continue with a smaller studio producing his strong narrative games, it just won&apos;t be the big group that formed Irrational.
<br>
<br>TL;DNR: 9: Great way to close out Irrational games work on Bioshock.s.  If you enjoyed Bioshock and Infinite (forget Bioshock 2 please) then you owe it to yourself to bring the series and the story full circle and get these DLC.  Great graphics, smooth game play, intense combat and a great ending to a complex and intellectually provocative story.
<br>
<br>Technology/engine: 7: Uses Unreal 3 and is well optimized but nothing really innovative on this end.
<br>
<br>AI: 7: A little brain dead in places and incapable of missing at other times but on a whole its a challenge and keeps you on your toes.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9: Great sets, good character models with plenty of variation, good particle effects and gun play is as sound as ever.
<br>
<br>Sound: 8: Slight distance to source issues (voices sometimes sound like they are on top of you but are really across the room) but otherwise great ambient  sound that provide immersion.  The audio logs are just great and remain a highlight of the series.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack: 10: Superb period appropriate music that does not overwhelm and only enhances the experience and immersion.
<br>
<br>Voice acting: 10: Really top notch voice acting.  Some of the best in gaming.
<br>
<br>Crafting: N/A
<br>
<br>Customization: Not really able to rate on this as its very minimal.
<br>
<br>Game play systems: 9: Simplified from Episode 1 and a vast improvement however the continued use of sky hooks is questionable.  In fact they are used so little it appears that they were included just to keep a thread of connection between the two worlds - Columbia and Rapture.
<br>
<br>Controls: 9: The controls in Episode 2 are streamlined and improved when compared to Episode 1.
<br>
<br>Story: 10: Fantastic writing with great dialogue - everything from the short short films to cut scenes and off the cuff comments.  Ken Levine is a masterful story teller.

Oh and overall this dlc is brilliant and if you are a Bioshock fan this is a no missing part of your collection</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4086562">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A great story connecting Bioshock Infinite with the original Bioshock, great atmosphere, very beautiful locations. Though I&apos;d prefer this to be a movie or I don&apos;t know...an adventure game, not a shooter. The plot and level exploration really outshine the battle system. Overall, a very good ending for the story.</span>

This DLC is about the torture and killing of Elizabeth for no good reason at all.  She gave up godhood, lost all her powers, and adopted a suicidal mentality for what?  The random little sister who she used as bait in BoS 1?  Bull.
<br>
<br>So because of this, she winds up playing into the bad guy&apos;s hands, when she knows he will betray and kill her.  What the heck kind of message is that?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m knocking off 4-5 points on what would otherwise be a 7-8 experience.  3 for the incredibly badly written, insulting plot and 2 for the most disturbing torture scene in gaming.  I did not play this series to watch a main character be tortured in this way, I had to choke back vomit.
<br>
<br>Also combat is totally broken when you fully upgrade the peeping tom plasmid, just stealth standing still, wait for a target to be vulnerable, then instakill it with your melee, cloak again and repeat.  Don&apos;t worry, even if the enemies collide with you, they won&apos;t find you.
<br>
<br>Also there was no payoff for doing a no-kill run either, thanks for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4086487">Expand</a></span>

One year later, I&apos;m overwhelmed again by its storyline, the ending, the quantum mechanics, multi-universe stuff... Everything. Except, this time I&apos;m crying. I&apos;ll be honest here, I have never cried over a video game ever in my life, and let me assure you it&apos;s not easy at all to make me cry.
<br>
<br>At the beginning of Episode Two (in Paris), I was shedding tears because of how beautiful and happy everything was. The music, the atmosphere, graphics, animation... The amount of detail everything had. Not only that, I realised that it was going to be the end of Bioshock as a whole as Irrational had closed down and I didn&apos;t want the story to end at all. So thats why it made me cry even more.
<br>
<br>But anyway, the gameplay is more stealth based on Episode 2 as you play as Elizabeth. I like how they&apos;ve added stealth to this episode as well. It makes the episode a lot longer and challenging. You have to be creative and to think on how you&apos;re going to clear out your enemies, who you&apos;ll take out first, whether to wait or not etc.
<br>
<br>The lockpicking is good as well, I like that it requires patience. Just like the stealth.
<br>
<br>I like the crossbow weapon, its actually the main gun I used along with the Revolver. Surprisingly I didn&apos;t use any of the other weapons. I guess it&apos;s because I wanted to be stealth.
<br>
<br>Everything about Episode 2 is just terrific, from voice acting, to atmosphere to combat, everything. I don&apos;t know what else to say.
<br>
<br>The ending again was beyond amazing, I cried again at the last part where you see Booker leading you to the Ace in the hole and also shedded many tears at the ending. I have never enjoyed a video game storyline so much in my entire life that has given me so many feelings. Sadness, happiness, overwhelm (in a good way of course haha), confusion, and shock...
<br>
<br>Thank you thank you thank you to the brilliant voice actors and everyone who worked on the games and DLCs.
<br>
<br>Thank you thank you thank you again for everything, and to everyone.
<br>
<br>You will be missed Irrational. (Thank you Ken Levine!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296188">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Good things about this dlc include the voice acting as always, the writing is sometimes cliche as it tries too hard to be philosophical. The gameplay is alright but really easy. This DLC will take you about 5 hours if you take your time to look at things and find audio logs, but in reality it is probably shorter than the first episode.
<br>
<br>The problem with this episode is that in a worthwhile effort to tie everything together there is a lot of dialogue and cinematic cutscenes without gameplay. So this DLC is essentially a fairly easy stealth game played during a short movie.
<br>
<br>So yes, the DLC is good regardless. The story is interesting and I have never felt so uncomfortable during one of the cutscenes, which I will not spoil. I&apos;m legitimately impressed with the DLC for that alone. Truly a suspenseful and genuinely tense experience there.
<br>
<br>As good as the DLC is though, it&apos;s a bad way to use DLC. Using DLC to flesh out a games story is like saying, &quot;If people want to understand the whole thing they&apos;ll have to pay us 70-80$.&quot; I don&apos;t respect this decision at all as a consumer, but from a business standpoint I&apos;ll admit it&apos;s brilliant. People are going to feel like they missed out on something if they don&apos;t get the DLC for this game. I imagine nearly every person with this game will have the DLC because they&apos;ll feel like their experience is incomplete without it.
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s good. This was a good place to stop the series, and I hope nobody ever touches the franchise again. Would I have been happier if the other 2 dlc were more gameplay focused like clash in the clouds? Yes. It wouldn&apos;t have been a **** you&quot; to everyone who bought the base game expecting to get the whole story.
<br>
<br>This DLC is not about the combat. The combat is a joke to anyone who doesn&apos;t suck horribly at the game. This DLC is about wrapping up the story, and it does its job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4087541">Expand</a></span>

With a brilliant plot that ties together the worlds of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite, the addition of new stealth gameplay that is consistently engaging and keeps you on edge, and brilliant thematic elements that Irrational Games have exceled in time and again, this is a fitting end to the Bioshock franchise.
<br>Gameplay: In this dlc you play as Elizabeth, and unlike Booker, she is not a tank who can carry large weapons and has a great deal of health. Unlike past Bioshock games, where you would go guns blazing nearly all the time, a new stealth component is added that is used in a majority of the game and it is a welcome addition. You get a new plasmid that lets you see enemies through walls and you can turn invisible and completely avoid encounters with enemies, but if you do encounter an enemy who is about to spot you, then comes your handy crossbow. With three different types of ammunition, each having a distinct feature you can strategically get through different areas in a variety of ways, which keeps the gameplay interesting, tense, and gives it variety.
<br>
<br>Story: I will avoid using any spoilers. The story in this dlc is mind-bending. What we have come to expect from Irrational Game is killer plot twist, and they deliver. But it goes beyond that, the story is both an personal and emotional experience. Thanks to excellent voice acting, brilliant animation sequences, and absurdly good writing, you can&apos;t help but feel an influx of emotions and constant jaw dropping. At the same time it requires a lot from the player to fully grasp the story. You should play all the bioshock games. (minus bioshock 2) So in that sense it is really demanding, but if you are a bioshock fan or love games that are story centric, then it is well worth the pay off. I do not think we will see a story this multi dimensional and original in a game for a long time. Kudos to Irrational!
<br>
<br>World: ITS FREAKIN RAPTURE!!! WHAT&apos;S THERE NOT TO LOVE. And built entirely from scratch from the bioshock infinite engine, it is absolutely gorgeous. The way they blend the lighting and shadow effects is superb and adds a whole new element to the setting and the art deco halls are truly breathtaking to look at. It even adds to the story, half the time characters are shrouded in shadow making it difficult to see there face and only adding to the tension and mystery of the game. Marble floors ,large chandeliers and an excessive amount of detail showing how Rapture went to hell. Its been a year since Bioshock Infinite has come out, and I can say that even with all these next gen releases, the graphics have not aged by a day, the world is gorgeous.
<br>I give it a 10 out of 10. With 6 hours of gameplay (which is a lot more content than other games offer for a much steeper price), an engaging story, excellent stealth gameplay, and a beautiful world to explore, this is the best dlc I have ever played, and a fitting way to end the bioshock universe. Thank you Irrational for providing the best gaming experience I have ever had, you will be missed dearly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4088116">Expand</a></span>

<br>After an Okay first episode, Burial at Sea episode 2 redeems itself with and outstanding closure to BioShock and BioShock: Infinite.
<br>After steping into Elizabeth&apos;s shoes, the story kicks-off right away with brilliant writing and new sides that will make us think if it was trully justified to love or hate some characters. The mechanics/gameplay. Burial at sea episode 2 adds a stealth side to the game that&apos;s totally satisfying and well executed. The music is really touching. The sounds are top notch. The graphics are great. I found the ending not very satisfying and it left me wanting a bit more of closure, but that&apos;s the only complaint I have.
<br>In the end, Burial at Sea Episode 2, is an incredible closing chapter to one of the best franchises of last-gen.
<br>Average Score: 9.4</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4094745">Expand</a></span>

The change of pace was good, and this helpless feeling left me chilling several time. However, the dlc felt kinda short in length.
<br>
<br>Burial at Sea 2 answers some question, but a lot of unanswered one remain, which can be summed up in one question, Why ?
<br>-Why Didn&apos;t Elizabeth used Tears to left Rapture when the local Big Daddy got started ?
<br>-Why did she die but somehow ended being back as a normal person ?
<br>-Why are the Luteces doing all this ?
<br>
<br>So the ending is quite frustrating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4125768">Expand</a></span>

<br>But the real reason you would buy this dlc is for the story and conclusion. The story leading up to the end is great taking you back to Colombia at one point and giving you more information on both of the world&apos;s and the things that inhabit those worlds. But the best part of the story is the end which I will let you experience for yourselves just know it is truly amazing and a great way to close the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4226397">Expand</a></span>

<br>This DLC felt like a chore to me, I played it because I purchase the season pass, but just got half way through since I keep getting killed over and over. I got bored of it.

<br>Gameplay: it&apos;s a stealth game. I did not disliked it entirely, but it get repetitive very fast, especially with enemies respawning without reason in places where you already have been  just moments ago. It&apos;s a 6/10.
<br>Story: it has few good moments (the beginning), but to me it&apos;s a 0 since it means nothing for someone who just played Infinite but not BS1. At the same time, if you have to give it canon status, its retcons destroy a lot of Bioshock Infinite lore making it all about BS 1. Also plotholes big as houses (spoiler ahead: if Liz cannot go back to a universe where she died without losing her powers, how we can find a voxophone in Bioshock Infinite at the photograph store where the owner ask the Lutece how could they be alive if he took the pictures for their funeral, and they didn&apos;t lose their powers to travel through tears in BS:I? It&apos;s a big plot hole that scream &quot;we just wanted a reason for Liz to not save herself with her powers.) .
<br>Wish i never played it, but since a lot of people loved it give it a try if you preferred BS1 over BS:I.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=5970041">Expand</a></span>

But it&apos;s story feels fresh and new two, you will want to start right over from the beginning from the moment you you finish it.  It really is one of the best piece of DLC I have ever played and any fan of the series needs to play it.

The story is great, the graphics are good (Although there was one part when you had to get the CO2 scrubber where i experienced some slowdown) and the story fleshes out the questions you may have had from the main game.
<br>
<br>Anything that isn&apos;t a shotgun or crossbow is basically useless on regular enemies. You are very fragile and they make sure you know that. All you have is a health bar that doesn&apos;t regenerate and whatever medical bags you find in the world.
<br>
<br>That being said the main problem with the game is the plasmid/vigor upgrades you can find around the world make you so overpowered its crazy. The new plasmid called Peeping Tom gives you the ability to see through walls and make you invisible. Once you get the upgrade that allows you to stand still and become invisible indefinitely it massively breaks the game. It got to the point where I would go into a room, alert everyone to my location and then just use your instant knockout melee on one of them. Then you would go invisible again and the cycle continues. This really speaks to the way the stealth is handled in this game. They won&apos;t even shoot at your last known location. They just act dumb and it allowed me to make it past the final parts of the game quickly, throwing any other strategy to the wind.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is worth the money, even if the late game is fundamentally broken near the last hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4101110">Expand</a></span>

Plus Playing as  Elizabeth  was also cool. But what fail this dlc for me is the fact the Story was weak and ending was more bitter-sweet than satisfying if ask me. Why you may ask cause they try too hard to try to connection first Bioshock game and too me that can ruin what Infinite ending kind aiming for. Also anything but stealth on hard if not very effect and Elizabeth die way too quickly in out in the opening and really most 3 of guns you get you  barley used cause they do not. Crossbow is what most going to used. Overall those I fun the DLC Fun just needing for me better story and better ending</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106558">Expand</a></span>

<br>Plusy:

<br>+ intryguj&#x105;ca, aczkolwiek mocno zawi&#x142;a fabu&#x142;a
<br>+ &#x15B;wietnie przedstawiona posta&#x107; Elizabeth
<br>+ dialogi i muzyka
<br>
<br>Minusy:
<br>&#x2013; to wszystko ju&#x17C; by&#x142;o&#x2026;
<br>&#x2013; ograniczone i schematyczne etapy
<br>&#x2013; mocno zubo&#x17C;a&#x142;y ekwipunek
