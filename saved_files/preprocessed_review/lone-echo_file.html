If you are looking for an amazing journey rather than a game-like demo, you should give this a try. Movement in zero gravity eliminates nausea brilliantly. The story takes me through a series of emotions and reactions I did not expect from myself. Voice acting is great and the level of detail in the visuals are stunning. Mapping of the body and its movement is stimulating to experience and gives a much more real sensation than most other games I&apos;ve tried. Especially when it comes to all the different kinds of interactions you can do with your virtual body. If every game from this point takes a lesson from Lone Echo, Virtual Reality itself has gained a lot. Great work, Ready at Dawn Studios!
<br>
<br>I can find nothing to complain about and the only reviews I&apos;ve seen giving bad grades are people not giving it a try because it doesn&apos;t come in Spanish, which in turn is unfair to the game. It is not like I walk around expecting games to be released in my mother tongue, that would&apos;ve been retarded, both by me and whoever in the industry that decided on such a bad decision. So instead of shooting down a masterpiece like this, learn English. It is 2017 and the age of IT does come with one particular language up front.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=7559198">Expand</a></span>

Olivia (Liv) and her AI assistant Jack (you). The human connection you form together - YOU form together, not the characters form with each other - is almost unmatched by any other relationship in gaming. This is on level with the Witcher 3 in terms of emotional investment and realistic dialogue.
<br>
<br>Another incredible aspect of Lone Echo is how you can shape Jack through your dialogue choices. Does he remain steadfastly adherent to protocol, save for in the most dire of circumstances, or does Liv&apos;s habit of risky improvisation rub off on him? Does he understand humor? Would he adhere to his stated purpose forever, or would he - if the moment was right - define a better one? It&apos;s entirely up to you.

I&apos;ve had a PSVR and Vive for almost a year, and this is my first Rift game, so maybe that is why I am underwhelmed. Some VR movement used to make me motion sick, but I got my VR legs some time ago. Yet this game is only playable for 10 minutes at a time. There is no way to teleport around. You have to move through the air, in zero gravity, by pushing off of objects or using little thrusters. There is no way to stay still easily. You float to the ceiling or sink into the ground, often through table and other objects in the room. It is like a bad tech demo. You have to make dialogue choices with multiple button pushes very quickly sometimes, which is hard to do when you&apos;re grabbing a wall so you don&apos;t sink through the floor or bob around in a vomit-inducing manner. I&apos;m used to Steam&apos;s generous return policy for lemons like this. I hope Oculus has a similar policy or I might not be trying any more exclusives that don&apos;t have demos.
<br>Apparently the multiplayer part is free. If it is, I would recommend trying that out before buying the solo mission. If you can handle the horrible movement quirks, you might enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=7500278">Expand</a></span>

On top of that, the game is way too short. It&apos;s sad to say that It&apos;s definitely not worth the price.</span>
