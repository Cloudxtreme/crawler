Unfortunate fact of the matter is keyboard and mouse controls are rather bad. But if you&apos;re set with a controller there&apos;s a bunch of cool stuff here. Ubisoft made a huge emphasis on controls in this game. Just from pressing your left analog stick at different intensities, there are around 4 different walking animations, and then there&apos;s another animation for running once you hit the &quot;high profile&quot; button. This allows you to seamlessly transition between movement speeds for incredibly tight and precise controls. This ties in beautifully with the game&apos;s focus on parkour style gameplay. Climbing up Jerusalem&apos;s tallest buildings and beholding the surrounding view is an amazing experience.
<br>
<br>Sadly, the game does suffer from lack of variety in combat and missions. Not enough to spoil the experience though. Between the controls, the gritty atmosphere and plot, and the environments, there&apos;s quite a lot to enjoy. here A real step forward for action platformers in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570252">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a stunningly realised Medieval world, and the first few missions are breathtaking. Hearing the characters speak, negotiating crowds, and running up walls and climbing is just pure joy. The draw distance is good and I was worried that my PC wouldn&apos;t cope (ports of console games tend to be badly optimised). But my year-old MacBook Pro could play everything on max settings and it simply looks superb. But I&apos;m only going to play halfway through this game because of what everyone else has been saying: the repetition, which is starting to pall. A real shame, because such a detailed and believable world deserves a more developed gameplay dynamic. And the main character Altair is simply arrogant and American (the American accent didn&apos;t exist in 1191AD, but of course it is Desmond being projected into that world as an avatar; but still, why make the protagonist cheesily American like every other action hero?). Definitely worth seeing and playing, but not worth 40.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=416029">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I really love the Assassin&apos;s Creed series, I like this game very much. I like the graphics too. Great controls and story, the enemies need some more voices, but that&apos;s alright. The thing I don&apos;t like is that the structure of the missions is repetitive, and sometimes the dialog is too long. Other than that, it is a good game to buy. 9 out of 10 is what I give it.</span>

Altair messes up a mission and is demoted in his assassin guild. In order to regain his high rank Altair is tasked by his master to assassinate a number of Templars-his guild&apos;s mortal enemies, including their grand master. The story has an interesting conclusion-I&apos;ll leave it at that. The gameplay is fluid and amazing. My only real criticisms are that the NPCs don&apos;t do much else other than walk around and utter the odd sentence. Also, most of the time you simply duel your target face-to-face, rather than employing skill to take them out stealthily. Overall, a great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2561115">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately this game is very repetitive. Basically every mission is exactly the same and every map has the same scripted things you need to do and can do. This gets old somewhere around third mission. I originally expected something more like Thief series. Optional side quests like &quot;collect zillion flags around the map, to get nothing concrete&quot; also don&apos;t help.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also mind boggling why we need convoluted double plot. You see, all the assassin stuff actually happens inside this guy&apos;s head who is kidnapped by some organization in present time and placed inside machine that can play his &quot;genetic memory&quot;. I really can&apos;t see any relevance or added value between this and the game&apos;s central idea of being medieval assassin. Granted that I didn&apos;t finish the game so I don&apos;t know if it starts to make sense at some point.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is ok. Unfortunately, there are tons of better ways to spend your time than this game. It offers nothing exceptional or memorable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3242229">Expand</a></span>

First of all, the story is somewhat unique and interesting, both the Desmond and Altair parts. Gameplay is not that bad either, but those missions... Holy ****, aren&apos;t those missions a series of boredom sources... First of all, I must say that the assassination missions/main missions were very interesting and kind of challenging to do it sneakily. But the missions we had to do in order to unlock those missions were nothing but repetitive cancer. Here&apos;s a brief summary of the game: eavesdrop, pickpocket, fight some guards, assassinate the significant target. Cool, now all you need to do is to learn about the story and you can start the series from AC 2 !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6528980">Expand</a></span>

The storyline is reasonable, but nothing to write home about. It pretty much spoils itself before it&apos;s halfway through. The &apos;random&apos; banter from NPCs is highly repetitive, most of them have only one or two sentences which they repeat over and over again. Which gets really annoying after a while. This annoyingness is matched easily by the behaviour of the NPCs, drunkards and beggars will only harrass the player. I ended up getting killed several times by a drunkard who for no reason at all lashed out and pushed me into the water. No guards or any NPC seems to care about the violent behaviour displayed by these drunkards, though if you fight back the heat will be on like there&apos;s no tomorrow. NPC guards in mini-game missions will instantly know where you are and of your intentions the second you &apos;lock&apos; on to them, regardless of how stealthy your approach was. This completely negates the option of using the throwing knifes to get a free kill on these mini-games. I find this a rather immersion breaking issue. The controls leave the most to be desired though. Clearly it is a console port and the controls will constantly remind you of this fact. AWSD only allows for movement in 4 absolute directions, where in combat it is often needed to be able to &apos;move&apos; diagonally or else the game will lock onto a different target and ruin your combo. The same goes for getting around the towns, in freerun mode the game decides when to jump, how far to jump and will adjust your direction to accommodate the jump it wants you to make. This will often lead to frustrating gameplay where the character either jumps too far or onto the wrong object killing the momentum of your run. Even when playing with a gamepad the controls feel unresponsive and like you&apos;re not the one in control of your character. Yet despide this &quot;AI&quot; controlling where and when you jump it&apos;s more than happy to let you jump to your doom, even though you have already changed directions or let go of the freerun mode entirely. I&apos;d give it a 8 for graphics and animations, a 5 for the storyline, a 2 for immersion and a 1 for the controls. All in all, I give it 4 out of 10. Sorry, but lavish graphics do not make up for such poor controls and poor NPC behavior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=412207">Expand</a></span>

I would like everyone that complains about the controls to read the reccomended specs for this game.. Yes a xbox360 gamepad makes all the difference in the world when playing this game and I highly reccomend everyone picking up a gamepad if they buy this game.</span>

Graphics are well done, no doubt about that, assets, clothes, armour and architecture put you back into the time of crusades without too many fantasy like touches -- as an upcoming reenactor I found this very inspiring!<br>+++<br>Game controls are a joy to play with. While many jump&apos;n&apos;run games fail to guide you along thin beam or on critical jumps, you really have to force your character off, which can be done quite well after a little practice. As mentioned before this sometimes gets into your way when your character automatically grabs ladders or beams to climb, while you actually want to run/fall/whatever.<br>+++<br>The fighting system is nice in terms of animations and feeling, but it is way too easy. While you are able to draw attention at you by an entire crusaders encampment you may get surrounded by 20 knights in a &quot;circle of death&quot;, meaning you only fight one enemy at a time. Despite the honor of your enemies you will never get attacked when lying on the ground after you made a bad turn. You can use instant kill counterattacks efficiently after the first few fight leaving no challenge to such situations!<br>+++<br>As an assassin your job is to kill hits (people of influence, nobles, etc.) and nothing is more useful but having some clues on your hit before you strike. The game does not only offer clues, it forces you to collect them by playing repeating mini games. Even failing at those mini games is not a loss as you may retry as many times as you like -- so no pressure. After all clues you get are not only things you already know or you get to know -- at least while you try to find your &quot;contacts&quot; for the clues -- but they also have no impact on how you will strike! There usually is only one way in, no way to really prepare your strike and no way to strike silently. It always ends in a &quot;honorable&quot; fight (mentioned above) so you could rush right through if you didn&apos;t had to do those (now) pointless mini games....<br>+++<br>As mentioned before AI behavior only focuses on the player and gets really annoying as you -- the one in a robe wandering with the monks -- are literally attacked by beggars in a place crawling with nobles wearing silk more worth than half of the city.<br>+++<br>The story of Assassin&apos;s Creed has a nice idea inside. In good story telling characters called &quot;shapeshifter&quot; are the ones who betray you, fooling you to have worked for the wrong side after a long way, but still leaving you -- the player -- fooled as well when done well. Assassin&apos;s Creed tries that as well, leaving hints by each hit that you are fooled and if you have an IQ greater than a stone you will get it at least after the 3rd hit. This would not be the problem if there were not 6-7 more! From this point on I was not that motivated very much as I -- the character -- had to do things I -- the player -- didn&apos;t really want to do.<br>+++<br>I kept playing until the final punch in the face: You finally know what the master plan was behind everything in this game, but then suddenly be left alone in solitary, able to walk around, use &quot;the machine&quot; or literally find &quot;the game&apos;s credits on a wall&quot;. The game has no satisfying ending, keeping you -- the player -- eager to continue right there. You may call it &quot;cliffhanger&quot; but it felt like someone ran off with the bag of money two month before the game was finished....<br>+++<br>CONCLUSION: The game is fun for one or two hours with so many ideas BUT looses depth quickly, like a teaser shooting all golden moments of a movie. As a &quot;pilot&quot; of a series it failed to get me....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2253642">Expand</a></span>

It features a compelling story, great atmosphere, and fresh gameplay mechanics. I found the parts where you must control Desmond to be rather tedious, but thankfully they are relatively short and do at least help to build up the story. The actual heart of the game, playing as Altair the assassin, is plenty of fun. The world is fairly large and mostly open, so you can explore, cause havoc, or do missions largely at your own pace. The cities are beautiful and each have their own look and feel, whether it&apos;s the holy city of Jerusalem, the crusader fortress of Acre, or the Muslim city of Damascus. Unfortunately the game provides you with limited weapons (you don&apos;t have the luxury of crossbows or smoke bombs as in later games), and most major assassination missions end up in huge sword-fights or long desperate chases. Still, there&apos;s nothing quite like hearing the chase music pumping as you leap around rooftops trying to escape a horde of pissed guards!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901161">Expand</a></span>

Okay first off, after playing Prince Of Persia The Two Thrones i was Pumped for this game Assassin&apos;s Creed. Why? Because the producers of the games are Same---Ubisoft. Prince Of Persia was an Epic Series and it is considered by many as the Best Action Adventure on the PC. So there, i bought the ORIGINAL DVD for Assassin&apos;s Creed Confident of the fact that it will be like Prince Of Persia and won&apos;t disappoint. Okay first off, the starting was very confusing and my friends near me Puked and ran away. But i wasn&apos;t gonna let this slip so easily. Being next-gen i knew Ubisoft were trying something different. After the first three assassinations i was FLAT. Yes i believed i had played the Best Game Ever. After the third however, things started to get a little repetitive and a lot till the 9th assassination. There are only three cities. Same Beggars and retards everywhere make the game so depressing. Also since this is the PC version the Side Missions are so Painfully Horrible. Two advantages you get playing this game is that it is Open World and it has the Best Graphics Ever by any Ubisoft Game. The ending for this game was pathetic and i was so disappointed that i felt like Tearing my Hair apart. I had wasted 50$s on this piece of SHIT. All in all, if you like Realism do play this game. But if you are a God Of War or a Prince Of Persia fan or a Fan of Fantasy games don&apos;t ever try this game. Prince Of Persia may be low in sales but it is a MUCH BETTER game than this Crappy Prince Of Persia Rip Off. If there is an Assassin&apos;s Creed 2, they better make it absolutely ZERO Repetitive and with no Side Quests then only i will rate it above or even in the league of Prince Of Persia or God Of War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=419938">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>- graphics are great, considering how old it is.
<br>-The cities are beautiful and interesting.
<br>- The story is ok. Nothing special though.
<br>CONS:
<br>- controls with mouse and keyboard are plain terrible. Just do you a favour and play with a gamepad.
<br>- The game is REPETITIVE as hell. You do stupid tasks over and over again.
<br>- Combat is boring, frustrating without being challenging. You have 2/3 moves in total and always have to deal with large groups. Assassin style.
<br>- The game is more linear than Virtua Cop. Complete absence of any freedom in the storyline. There is some free roaming, but there is no reason to waste time picking up flags around.
<br>- Hours of cinematics, and you can&apos;t skip them even if you have to replay some mission
<br>
<br>You are an assassin. A deadly assassin. That&apos;s why the last hour of gameplay you will roleplay as a Barbarian and fight some 100 enemies in groups of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3509312">Expand</a></span>

This game has a very good story line to it and i recommend playing it if you like stealth and assassinating games then this is the game for you. The story has a big twist at the end of it which keeps you on you feet. The end of the game really shows you about the continuing story from Assassin&apos;s Creed &amp; Assassin&apos;s Creed II via Desmond Miles. Although this is a great game i cannot deny that there are some problems in the gameplay. For example there are a few bugs that get annoying in the storyline, the fighting also has problems and the occasional glitch. But overall its a great game and i recommended it to those who love these types of games.

<br>Ok, it was the first of the franchise.. but it feels really old (the characters, the story.. the mechanics.. it&apos;s all so naive and outdated).
<br>
<br>Only good remark: the good graphics, for a 2008 game - but considering I played it with a total retexturing mod, that uses textures from Revelations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4388495">Expand</a></span>

<br>It IS showing it&apos;s age a bit, and a lot of things that are standard in more modern AC games aren&apos;t in this one yet.
<br>
<br>The game, to me, still looks pretty good, comparable to the Ezio-ACs. They did a great job capturing the vibe of Jerusalem and the whole area back in the days of the crusades. It&apos;s colorful, with lots of detail, and I find that the cities especially do have a lot of atmosphere and do feel kinda alive.
<br>
<br>However, since this one started it all, and the other ACs build on it, there still is quite a lot of stuff missing here:
<br>- The freeclimbing/parcour is still quite clunky. Yes, mistakes can happen even in Unity, Syndicate and Rogue, but here, you will have accidents, it&apos;s guaranteed. The parcour isn&apos;t as &quot;safe&quot; and automated as it is in newer ACs, so you will have &quot;misjumps&quot;, where you don&apos;t reach a ledge and fall. It&apos;s not horrible, it&apos;s just a bit slower and way less safe than in modern ACs.
<br>
<br>- Combat can be tough especially against a group. Please stay patient. At first, Altair has all abilities, then loses them (because he gets demoted), and gets them back one by one. Once you have counterattack, you will have a much easier time dealing even with groups. Hold the block-button or key, and hit the counter attack at the right moment - instakill.
<br>Actually... even though I enjoyed the combat in, say, AC III, Rogue and Unity much more than I did enjoy this one, it still is more fun and feels less frustrating than it does in the abomination that is Syndicate with it&apos;s horrible, spammy and often unfair combat.
<br>
<br>- Abilites are not in yet. You don&apos;t have ropedarts, smoke bombs, firecrackers, mortars etc.
<br>Basically, you have your wristblade (which you can&apos;t fight with once you are in combat, so it&apos;s only for assassinations, killing unprepared enemies), a sword, a short blade, and later on a ranged weapon.
<br>You don&apos;t get health potions either (a bit like in AC III). So if you lose health, you can&apos;t recover it unless you flee. It recovers while you do, so you can retreat a bit, then turn around and kill your pursuers.
<br>
<br>- It&apos;s a bit shorter than modern ACs... but then again, it has less filler. YOu know the deal... tons of side stuff and collectibles. A bit of that is here, too, but not even remotely as much as in Unity or Syndicate.
<br>
<br>- There are a lot of cut scenes, and you can&apos;t skip them. Stay patient and enjoy the story.
<br>
<br>While it might feel weird to play this after more recent ACs, it still is a fun game with a great protagonist and a cool, albeit short story. Playing with a controller is very much recommended.
<br>It still has vibe and atmosphere, and it&apos;s great to see the story begin.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the franchise, you should at least try it, you can usually get this quite cheap. If you want to get into the series, AC II might be a better start, but this still is a solid, classic game and the start of a great series</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6526770">Expand</a></span>

The way you get around and interact with the world is ingenious. There are a limited number of things you can do in a very large world, but you do those things incredibly well--the way a master assassin would. The game itself is gorgeous; you just have to remind yourself to look around when you&apos;re jumping from the top spire of a gigantic cathedral, or jumping over the Dome of the Rock. Combat can get deadening if you let it; but if you try new strategies (like drawing opponents into side streets by throwing a dagger) you can keep it interesting for a long time. I&apos;m starting my second round through (on a much more powerful computer than my first time) and am finding it very entertaining--even the story grows on you--just don&apos;t let yourself get tied down by the less interesting elements, such as the flag &quot;achievements,&quot; and when something gets repetitive, find another way to do it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=423386">Expand</a></span>

A control set, and control system, totally unsuited to PC gaming. Just awful. Imprecise, unpredictable, and frustrating. An average plot with even some semi original elements that, once you have seen it the first time, is unskipable on later re-plays. Unforgivable. Very restricted gameplay in the modern sections of the game. It totally breaks my suspension of disbelief that this guy just mutely goes along with everything. As a professed former assassin himself he doesn&apos;t grab the fire extinguisher off the wall and try to brain his captors with it before using their biometrics to escape... No, he just mutely does everything he is told to do like a sheep. Speaking of suspension of disbelief, as the game opens you have a character that is capable of amazing feats. Then he is demoted in his order, and suddenly can&apos;t do half of that stuff anymore. Cos that makes absolute sense. No. This whole thing screams &quot;LAZY CONSOLE PORT&quot; at the top of its lungs and is sadly representative of the disaster that is PC gaming these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=413399">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the game for the first couple of cities, but then it became very clear that there was little variety and that the gameplay for each city was going to be the same: save a civilian, climb a few watch points, eaves drop, assassins challenge, go take on the main assassination target, escape. I finished the first 3 &quot;memory blocks&quot; and then uninstalled it. I just couldn&apos;t face wasting any more of my life playing it, and would quite like those few hours back please. If only game developers spent a bit more time on making a good game than trying to wow us with pretty graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=413804">Expand</a></span>

A great combat system that is 15X better than the usual hit, run/block, hit, but it isn&apos;t good enough to support an otherwise boring game. It is cool to climb up buildings, but doing so takes too long.

That being said, I easily gave this title a 9 out of 10, and only because most, if not all, missions are repetitive in nature. The essence of not only the main character but his surroundings are superb and at no time did I feel that things within the context of the overall game were out of place. In fact, I became more interested in the real history of the area and time period because of this game. The end of the game only solidified my curiosity as to what Ubisoft will develop with the other two games of the trilogy and seeing as how Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 ships late 2009, I count the days and crave what comes next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=424844">Expand</a></span>

AI (8) - Characters in this game ( if not disturbed ) are the closest thing to real as any game can get. but if you walk in front, not using any force or anything, it would almost be guaranteed that you would get a comment either about you being a &quot;stranger&quot; or you being &quot;crazy&quot;. and when you kill assassinate, the same repetitive remarks of &quot; who would have done this!&quot; or &quot; get the guards&quot; gets a little annoying, buy it doesn&apos;t ruin the over-all game experience. Sound (10) - have you ever been in a shopping mall and herd the scuffing of the feet and the whispers of the people around you and the laughter somewhere far away? This game is just like that, showing SFX and music at its best in a game. almost everyone and everything makes a perfect life-like sound. Though the voices of the characters repeat once in a while, there is such a variety that you just don&apos;t notice. Story (9) - One of the most unique story lines in any game i have ever seen. to not spoil the fun, dreams is all I will tell you, the cut scenes may get annoying if you like the main game play, if you like getting deep into a story, this games for you. Overall (10) great graphics, great sounds, great characters, great story. Top notch game, I recommend it for everyone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=410567">Expand</a></span>

However you will want to get a controller to play it. It allows for smoother gameplay and better control of the character. It isn&apos;t perfect, first off your going to need an up to date PC to run the thing and the loud in game sounds can become distorted(although that might be due to my headphones rather than the game itself). Over all the game is deep realistic with a large and detailed world populated with individual people rather than a few generic character types. Altier moves like a flowing river, his every move looks realistic while still allowing you to direct him any way you wish. You feel that you are controlling a real person whose every move is the same as it would if you were there in person. If you already have the Xbox version then your not missing out on anything but if your PC is riding solo then this game is worth a look. If you happen to buy a copy then make sure to take your time playing it. If you try to play it to quickly then it will seem repetitive. Take your time and enjoy it for what it really is, a very well designed game(except for the unskipable cut scenes).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=411608">Expand</a></span>

A laggy experience that also plays very slow and feels empty despite the variety of the &apos;sandbox&apos; open world intention. Interface is irritating because its trying to dress up everything to look nice but it ends up feeling rather cheap and slow. The story would have been ok if not for some typical and frustrating spelling-out of all details to get the plot conveyed to 6 year olds. Honestly, there is something wrong with games that don&apos;t allow you the option to skip dialogue sections, making you sit through painful dialogue at stiff pace. I dont want a cinematic experience - I want to enjoy a good game. This game is trying to be all story and production values at it hasn&apos;t got the basics right as a consequence. Graphics and sound are where it gets some points only because they are up to standard as expected. Models also look nice and relevant. Games like this time and time again fail to entertain and become a chore because of sluggish interface and control. If you&apos;ve seen this sort of review before, you know what to expect. If you want to play this so bad because its hyped then expect to be underwhelmed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=411449">Expand</a></span>

It only took me 10 hours or so, and I loved it. However, there is practically no replay value. Upon starting a new level after beating the game, you have to sit through the dialogue between Altair and his master for up to 6 or 7 minutes, it&apos;s unskippable. You can&apos;t &quot;free play&quot; and jump straight into a city from the beginning of the level, you must go from the palace, through Masayaf, get on your horse and ride to the gate to even get to a city. This is around 11 or 12 minutes before you even get to gameplay again!! I suppose this is ok the first round through because you haven&apos;t seen the cutscene yet, but after you&apos;ve seen it once there should be an option to skip it and it&apos;s very stupid that there isn&apos;t one. The 10 minutes it takes to get to a city to play is a drop of 1 or 2 points by itself. It is very repetitive after you play it once through. The graphics are amazing on any system, and the crowd mechanics are cool. It&apos;s very immersive, especially the free running system. You can climb pretty much everything. However, the combat is much too easy and again, really repetitive. It&apos;s pretty much a timing game: a crowd of attackers attack one at a time (stupid) and you must guard and counterattack exactly when the guard hits. It&apos;s not very fun and doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense. Wouldn&apos;t the guards want to swarm and attack you rather than lining up for a go one by one? Wrapping up, this game is probably one of the most fun rentals you could ever get. You&apos;ll beat it in a few days and have a blast. Just do yourself a favor and don&apos;t buy it. It&apos;s great the first time through and monotonous any other time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=413689">Expand</a></span>

Stunningly rendered detail that makes up for any lack of gaming depth and to those who said the control was a bit too simplistic - it might be but there&apos;s no way they could have rendered such classy moves without making it impossible to learn. Maybe a bit &apos;samey&apos; but I can&apos;t get enough.</span>

Gameplay is annoying, lacking in depth, confusing, and has the appearance of a game that poured all resources into sells and graphics rather then make it actually entertaining for the customer. Ubisoft really let me down on this one, I expected much better.</span>

It&apos;s my favorite computer game of all time, I think.Sneaking up on people, quietly stabbing them, and then calmly walking away...lol It&apos;s just an all around fun game, good story (so far), fun game play, though the controls still give me a hard time, sometimes. All around... Amazing! 10!:)</span>

One of them is the sound, and it took me like 2 days to fix it (there&apos;s a ultra short tutorial on it for XP, but now vista which im currently using). Another glitch (or bug rather) occurred when i was fighting the 9th boss (the one at the end of a passage). I somehow managed to kill the biss in the &quot;Memory Error&quot; zone after 10 minutes of nintendo tumbs and tada, I&apos;m dead cause he was beaten inside that zone. Well, apart from these 2 experiences, it&apos;s generally is fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=83305">Expand</a></span>

The devs really did a phenomenal job of brining the crusades period middle east to life. The architecture and scenery is spectacular, and walking around in it (or on horseback) you really get the feeling the place is living and breathing. Unfortuanately, that&apos;s where the fun ends. The gameplay is about as repetitive as a night with diarrhea. The cities you get to explore are divided up into rich/poor/middle districts, each opening up after a new level is completed. Within each one you are tasked with several side quests, which really don&apos;t further the story along any. The annoying part is, is that the quests are all the same in each district with a few minor differences. Boring. The developers could have created an epic game here, with some real immersement, but chose to go the easy route and dumb it down, I assume for the console crowd that it was originally marketed to. The story arc, which diverges into two paths, could have been neatly tied together by using interactive elements a la Elder Scrolls, to add some more realism - this could have been an excellent rpg, in addition to what it already is. Unfortunately now it&apos;s just another mediocre game admist many others. So sad. Game developers need to realize that to make something great, they need to reach new levels of inspired thinking and creativity. PC gamers have just about seen everything and done it all. Lame console ports just don&apos;t cut through the cheese. Definitely play this game, its mindless fun, but don&apos;t expect any replay value or excitement after the first few levels start becoming a repeatfest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=411526">Expand</a></span>

I got a gamepad though, and everything from the overall experience, controls, graphics, fun factor, and originality definitely make this game worth its cost. However, I must say, that the storyline is quite awkward. If an epic plot is important to you, you will be let down.</span>

Playing the main character is so immersing in this one that you will thrill to stalking your victims, feel the terror of being hotly pursued or just feel plain MEAN when fighting your way out of a sticky situation. I love this game, I can&apos;t wait until part 2 of this trilogy come out.</span>

You should only plan to buy this for PC if you have a computer capable of taking advantage of the graphics vs a console and if you have a controller (the game instantly recognized my Logitech Rumblepad 2). The PC controls are beyond awful. Controls aside, this game had some good ideas for assassination but could have been executed much better. Every aspect in the game is repetitive. All three cities you explore look exactly the same. The AI citizens same the exact same things, perhaps in a different accent. The missions you do are indistinguishable from the other. Saving citizens, finding flags, chasing people down, everything you do in the game is pretty much restricted to those few actions. This wouldn&apos;t be so much of a problem if the story was good, but it&apos;s not. While getting to the end was intense, the long middle was just hunting down an evil person, killing them and viewing their cinematics, then repeat. You meet no indistinguishable characters and everything gets REALLY boring, REALLY fast. I can only think of one reason to recommend anyone to play Assassin&apos;s Creed, and that is to play Assassin&apos;s Creed II. While it&apos;s not mandatory to play it to understand AC2&apos;s backstory, it&apos;s nice to be less confused in the game. And believe me, AC2 fixes EVERYTHING from the first game, and adds so much more. Assassin&apos;s Creed II alone, makes the first game worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390135">Expand</a></span>

Even the lowest settings are great! The story is about a dude. In 2012 he has been held in captivity by a mad scientist. He puts the dude in sort of a time machine (or what the hell it is) called Animus. You actually control the dude. The environment is massive and you can go wherever you want. You will be in Middle East and there is a village, a big kingdom, and three cities - Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. There are there three areas in each city - rich class people area, medium class people area and poor class people area. All those things are nice but sadly, that you do the same thing over and over again. There are some bugs too. Two or three times I fell out of the graphics. The good thing is that you can climb walls, jump from roof to roof etc. The controls are a bit confusing but you will get used to them.<br><br>Graphics: They are awesome 10/10<br>Sound: I usually play and don&apos;t listen to sounds<br>Gameplay: 7/10 because of the repetitive gameplay<br>Story: Great but confusing 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1657927">Expand</a></span>
