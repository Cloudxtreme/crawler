Just based on flanking tactics, and gets pretty monotonous and annoying sometimes. Not to mention that pressing F5 gets you to change cameras but not told in the documentation on how to revert to first-person mode.</span>

The mechanics of the minigame are simple: see the Germans, shot in the general direction of the Germans, tell your squad to stop taking cover from the wrong direction and shoot at the Germans, walk over to the Germans, shoot the Germans. The friendly AI is so useless that despite the levels constant attempts to railroad you into using this tactic, I found it more effective to order my squad to sit in the corner while I single-handedly slaughtered the Germans. The weapons behave as an experienced shooter would expect them too, in the hands of untrained game developers. The German AI compensates for the flaws in the American AI, demonstrating a complete inability to use grenades effectively, cover their flanks or rear, or even utilize the old tactic from Wolf 3d and gang up on the poor Americans. On authentic difficulty, the weapons are still almost completely useless, requiring multiple head and chest hits to bring down a German. Fortunately, the Germans have the same problem, allowing you to simply charge enemy riflemen, emptying the clip of a Thompson into them, and ignoring the hits you take in the process. Perhaps most disappointing was the fact that for all their efforts and attention to detail in historical accuracy, the levels were essentially long clear tunnels. If pinned down by a German machine gun in the street, it might seem reasonable to jump the fence beside the road and take cover in the ditch, move forward and flank, right? Wrong. The fence should be easily cleared, but it is in actuality the base of an invisible wall. Such invisible walls abound, in order to ensure that the path chosen by the game designers is the path the player follows. All in all, this feels less like playing a game, and more like playing a role in a movie, only instead of a script, you simply have a director yelling at you whenever you do anything that isn&apos;t what he wants.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=400170">Expand</a></span>

Soliders yell and bullets fly over your head with dirt land on your screen, when a near by explosion ocurrs. The game runs great on my PC and i have a 1.3 GHz, with 512 Rdram, a ATI Radeon 9800 128 MB video crad and it runs great. Load times arn&apos;t even an issue they are not long at all. Some hard core Call of Duty players might be turned of by the game because they are a super solider. Give it a chance because if you compared the 2 games you feel a little scared of this one, the reason being that you die fast in Brothers in Arms. So you might get fustrated for a while. Play the game, it&apos;s fun and different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=379639">Expand</a></span>

Not that this is bad, but you need to add something original to stand out and not get boring. The developers did not try. they slavishy put everything what is part of the band of brothers trade in it: the melancholic overvoice, the dramatic music(stings!!! more strings!!!) and the reluctant hero(s). What is a pity is that you can&apos;t skip these ramblings of fantasy and you are forced to sit through them all. And then what is it? The game can best be described as a simple squad based shooter. It is basic because they stripped the shooter part to it&apos;s bare minimum: you can&apos;&apos;t run, lean, lie down and aim properly. And even when you get close to a german you notice that your weapons are underpowered. It takes a full clip to kill one. An strinking example of this weakness is the grenade. When it detonates, you need to be very close to get harmed, less than a meter, and then it does hardly any damage or fails to stun opponents. Of course this was done on purpose. If this was a call of duty with a team added to it, you might ditch the team and go on your own. Because you would do this because your teammates are to stupid to be left on their own and need constant watching. So to prevent you from dumping them and to force you to work with the team they make you weak. But amazingly enough, the team tactics are very basic too: you can&apos;t command indvidual members nor assign members to groups, or arm them as you want them and you can only give them a few basic commands. In addition the game is very scripted. As in a shooter you run along one path. In this game however the path has somewhat been widened to allow you to &apos;Flank the enemy&apos;. Because that is what the developer hit upon. Each and everytime the germans conveniently appear in small groups consisting of 2 to 4 men, take up position behind some cover where they stay until you have killed them. You assign one team to pin them, and you or another team move in from the flank. Luckily the german will fall for this same tactic each and every time. Germans won&apos;t attack you except in scripted moments or pin your team even if you are under fire from a mg, they leave their positions open to flanking fire and rear attacks, won&apos;t shift their positions,leave strongpoints open to the rear and won&apos;t cover the approaches or each others positions, and setup mg&apos;s and guns only to shoot out to one direction and finally: germans seldom use grenades(but we know why now). Brothers in Arms therefore quickly becomes boring. If you want proper based squad based game I would advise to try out SWAT IV or Rainbow Six.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=397710">Expand</a></span>

Usually, you have to shoot 5-10 bullets into your enemy&apos;s body to kill him. It&apos;s ridiculous. Your teammate&apos;s AI is poor. They running like chickens in the garden. When someone is killed in your fireteam it&apos;s a big problem you think. But it&apos;s not! He will be there in the next mission. How? What is it? Brothers in Arms: Return to Castle Wolfenstein? Another bad point is the fighting against armour. Your Stuart can easily destroy a Stug III. But the Stug can&apos;t even hit your tank. Yes, a 37 mm tank gun can easily penetrate a 50 mm armour, but when the Stug&apos;s 75 mm tank gun fires and hits the Stuart, it&apos;s 50 mm armour is still up. Is this realism for you? I don&apos;t think so. And the &quot;flanking&quot;. The game says in the start to flank your enemy every time you can. But how can I flank the enemy when the maps are not enough wide for it. There is not enough space to flank (except one or two times). If you want realism, good AI, good story, good gameplay or good graphics, then don&apos;t try it! Otherwise it&apos;s your game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=2525785">Expand</a></span>

Critics, play the whole game before providing your two cents worth. This game, although appearing good at the beginning, quickly becomes worthless as you play on. I think that this game will go down in history as the most overrated game ever.

                                        <span> Gameplay seems quite funny, at least in the beginning. Unfortunately, being a PC game, it totally lacks the graphic and audio component. &quot;Outdated&quot; was the first thing I thought when I installed this game. Poor, very very poor details. Bad animations. Choppy ramerate even on high-end machines (22-30 fps when lucky). Good voice-comments though.</span>

The gameplay is bit repetetive but still quite enjoyable and at any rate, it is more innovative than games like medal of honour and call of duty - this time there is some strategy to the game :) But two major problems drag this game down; 1. The LOADTIMES are truly horrible - loading a level can take up to three minutes and reloading a checkpoint (quickloading) takes more than 1&#xBD; min. In a realistic game where u really cannot afford loosing much hp on any of your 7 men, it is absolutely devestating that u have to spend so much time watching a line grow from the left to the right of the screen. I really dont play the game very much as the 2 min. interruptions get more more frequent as the difficulty increases 2. this game is built un the unreal2 engine - a 2 years old, yet rather powerful, game engine for the pc. And what is this!??!?!?!?!? My framerate was around 5 fps at the beginning of a particular level (not caused by loading issues or too little system memory or graphic memory). bottomline is that Brothers in Arms is a good game, that sadly is spoiled by a poor engine...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=379880">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are good enough- runs smoothly with olde r computers, sounds great- weapons and explosions have a realistic feel in them, Great animations and voice acting- soldiers act like living beings, hiding behind covers and yelling for each other in the heat of a battle. I highly recommend playing this game, you don&apos;t even have to like war games that much. Tactical elements and effort they put in realism separates Brothers In Arms from titles like Medal Of Honour and Call Of Duty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=414133">Expand</a></span>

The game keeps telling you to flank the enemy, but then you run into invisible barriers. All in all a good try, but not very well executed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=379601">Expand</a></span>

Not as good as the reviews lead you to believe. Wait a while and read player opinions on the forums. 1. Team commands are too simple. Either &quot;follow me,&quot; &quot;take cover,&quot; &quot;covering fire,&quot; or &quot;charge.&quot; A real step back from superior games like Operation Flashpoint where you can go stealth, re-assign soldiers to groups, etc. The soldiers pretty much shoot anything but miss when up close! You can&apos;t tell one to man a machine gun. The game essentially becomes an exercise of telling them to go there, go there, go there whenever you see a part of the &quot;maze&quot; where they can hide behind. 2. The &quot;maze&quot; factor is really annoying. Again, no comparison to Operation Flashpoint where you can really flank opponents by going anywhere ...not just around the enemy on a boring maze route that is so obvious it takes 10 seconds to find it. 3. Multiplayer is pretty frustrating. Its hard to find a server, you can&apos;t use server filters, you can&apos;t even refresh the server listing. Usually by the time you select a server it is already full or disconnected. Setting up your own game and waiting 20 minutes for other players is not fun, either. Once in the game, the gameplay is pretty simple and not as strategic as reviewers stated. Finally, you can have only 4 players at once in multiplayer...most of the time someone drops out and your stuck with 3. If you really like Call of Duty and scripted combat events, you can ignore this review. You&apos;ll enjoy it. If you were expecting a more open-ended adventure using strategic elements, I think you&apos;ll be disappointed after about 3 minutes. Eventually, some company will make a combat sim that is easy to play, has good AI, lots of combat options, is open-ended in terms of map landscape, and has decent multiplayer options. Unfortunately, this isn&apos;t it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=379612">Expand</a></span>

The only time when there is a problem with the ai is when the engagements are very close. I shoot, and I find that the gun sway isn&apos;t as bad as everyone is making it out to be. This isn&apos;t as good as CoD, but its pretty good.</span>

The sounds are excellent, especially for the game of its age. And the story telling and the story in generall is just great, the three BIA games are by far my favourite series.

It goes to show that the industry vets should do the innovating, and the newbies should do the polishing. Graphics are fine. Sound effects can be underwhelming, but are balanced out with great voice acting and music. Running speed it good, squad commands are functional. AI could use some work but is good as it is. All the basics to make a tactical, squad based WWII shooter are here. Too bad the Combat isn&apos;t. To start off, the shooting mechanics are terrible. Its funny, its like your player, a trained soldier, shoots with the skill of a game developer testing out weapons for his new game, so as to implement realistic recoil effects, without realizing he needs to practice take firearm classes for a month first. Anyway, recoil from guns is totally unrealistic (Trust me, I won 7 guns). Combat is slow, underwhelming, and utterly frustrating. Its also annoying as hell to lose a whole fireteam to a random artillery shell. Overall, actually fighting Nazi&apos;s in this game is like sludging through tar, its slow, annoying, and something you don&apos;t want to do again. Its like this game never even went through a beta or an alpha stage. Rather than making you play the game the way it was meant to be played (tactically) with streamlined, intuiting gameplay, the creators gave up and just tossed in a few cheap tricks to force you to play how it was meant to. For example, the game doesn&apos;t reward patience, smart thinking, or good positioning. This is not like Red Orchestra. Instead, the game makes it impossible to kill anyone with anything other than a chest hit. Why? To FORCE you to flank those behind cover. So even if their heads are exposed, but they&apos;re crouched behind cover, you can pour on 100 rounds with a BAR at their helmets and the enemy will just sit there unscratched. This is, ironically, a method to make the game more realistic! This game should have been sent back to the drawing board. This game feels like it never went through any refinement process at all, at least gameplay and level design wise. This game is like playing a beta test. Guns are waaayyyy off, too many of the sound effects sound like place holders, sometimes kooky AI, bad, crappy level design. Usually after a beta test, the team cuts the bad levels out, makes more good levels to make for that, and fine tunes the gameplay. But it just seemed like that never happened here. Instead, the devs just stuffed in some cheap tricks to make you play the game as it was advertised, instead of refining and adding stuff to they &quot;F&quot; system, and published it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=396961">Expand</a></span>

<br>Critics and users alike have praised the sound design, and in that case I agree that there seems to have been great effort to fill every nook of the game with noise and chatter. It does not get in the way of the experience and it does indeed fill you with a certain sense of urgency that unfortunately the game-play fails to do.
<br>With a strange mixture of extreme ease and bewildering difficulty Brothers in Arms fails to create on the player the wonderful immersion many people talk about.
<br>Just during my first missions I encountered A.I. in the form of the German troopers, that either stands still waiting for you to shoot it, or kills you with one shot through the same type of barricade that makes them an impregnable target.
<br>The game seems to be so dedicated to the repetitive &quot;suppress-flank-anihilate&quot; game-play it offers, that then almost all fire towards enemy positions ends in just being harmless suppressive fire. This next example is ridiculous and happened to me several times just during the first chapters:
<br>I run to take cover behind a fence. Germans start pouring out a burning edifice. My one companion is ordered to suppress the very door they come out of. Suddenly a German soldier makes a run for it and stands in front of me on the other side of the fence. He is completely uncovered and a meter or so away from where I duck. The interface of the game tells me he is being &quot;suppressed&quot; (not killed but suppressed) by the fire of my buddy and other soldiers that are there just for flavour since they really do nothing but shout. From behind my cover I shoot at him. At his face. My crosshairs are clear upon his nose. I almost empty my machine gun on his nostrils. And all I do, according to the interface of the game, is &quot;suppress&quot; his position. He wakes up from his A.I. stupor, and shoots me dead with one bullet from the other side of the fence.
<br>And that is just the A.I. and collision sensors. Now, during the same scenario I had seen some Germans pouring out from behind some hay stacks next to a house. I ordered my one-man platoon to follow me on a daring charge, since I was sick and tired of battling this bloody game for results and wanted to end this ridiculous scenario.
<br>We run and reached those hay stacks and there was a space between them and on the floor some boxed ammunition for a machine gun of some sort. &quot;Ammo and a hole to the flank of the enemy, sweeeet&quot;. If the game would only be that logical. I tried running through the stacks and the &quot;ammo&quot; box was a barrier. An invisible wall that could not be passed nor jumped. Although these things were only small boxes lying on the floor. The next thing lying there were me and my trusty side-kick filled to the rim with, probably, the very same german led I had tried to jump.
<br>I can go on forever with the flaws of a game that supposedly rewards the tactical enthusiasm (which I imagine in reality changes with every situation making a charge of equal value to a specific scenario) but punishes any move out of the predetermined choices of what is an acceptable strategy. Like &quot;suppress-flank-anihilate&quot; one.
<br>I say, search your Nazi bashing somewhere else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-road-to-hill-30/user-reviews?user_review_id=3027815">Expand</a></span>
