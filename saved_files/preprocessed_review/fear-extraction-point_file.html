It&apos;s somewhat fast paced, but also builds up a sense of tension and horror.. as if a little dead girl is following you&apos;re every move. A must play of horror/fps fans.</span>

The major gripe however is recycled EVERYTHING. Weapons, environments, gameplay and encounters are basically the same as the original. The are 3 major differences however, 1. A new scary enemy type that creeps me out 2. You can use a handy minigun and 3. It has some new environments that would be made better in FEAR 2. Extraction Point has more mech fights too and they work well, along with the rest of the intelligent AI, slow-mo and mostly non-linear levels. The only other problem besides the minor recycling issue is the connectivity of levels. Some jumps to other locations are absurd; at one point; you exit a subway tunnel to go to the top of a car park building. Also one moment that made me annoyed is this-if you played the first FEAR and remember the fat guy who the only real baddie that did anything against you, he appears in this game, but for about 5 seconds and he&apos;s in a place that makes no sense. Overall the game is like the original, but has the fact that it is basically the original with some aged problems, but is still brilliant-pcik it up, especially if it come in the FEAR Files pack cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-extraction-point/user-reviews?user_review_id=3444360">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, being from 2005, the graphics have aged poorly, and the expansion, Extraction Point, made in 2006, was not made by the team of the original game; it shows.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>The game picks up where F.E.A.R. left off, with your character crashed in the city with his two companions. Unfortunately, the story is incredibly minimal, vague, and pointless; your two companions die horribly without any ability for you to do anything to save them, but you don&apos;t care because they don&apos;t really do anything interesting with you the whole game, and the latter one disappears for most of the game until she dies towards the end. It is all quite pointless feeling, and the cleverness of the original game&apos;s hallucinations are gone, leaving the whole thing with the stink of nothingness; you&apos;re just fighting your way through the city, killing a bunch of samey enemies, for the purpose of escaping, without any characters of consequence being involved.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The AI in this game is actually okay; the bad guys try to flank you, use cover against you, throw grenades, and generally actually try to kill you. Unfortunately, that is about all that is good about the game. The enemies themselves are incredibly samey, and in the end, there are essentially &quot;guys with guns&quot;, &quot;invisible assassin dudes&quot;, &quot;really tough guys with more powerful guns&quot;, &quot;giant mechs with missiles&quot;, and &quot;ghosts that fly straight at you and die in a couple shots and thus aren&apos;t a threat&quot;.
<br>With this being all that there is, it rather rapidly becomes very samey, and while the assassins are a somewhat interesting change of pace, in reality they end up boring too simply because after you&apos;ve fought them a few times you figure out how to beat them (back up against the wall, shoot them as they approach as they are barely visible) and you can do it every time, and almost never take damage from them to boot.
<br>The fact that you can go into bullet time just makes the game easier; it would actually be pretty tough to make your way through the game with the limited amount of health packs it gives you without it, but with it, frequently you end up at full health and leaving health packs (and ammunition) behind.
<br>You can only carry three guns at a time, but you&apos;re usually pretty good on ammo, and indeed you can frequently be carrying around a few special guns plus a normal gun at a time; it is actually only seldom worth ever even using a normal weapon after the early game, because the special weapons are so powerful and drop so frequently that dispatching enemies with the particle rifle and other weapons is just the right thing to do; in fact, it is a waste of them not to, as you can only carry three weapons at a time and you might as well spend the ammo on the good ones. Grenades, likewise, are extremely plentiful, and can solve all sorts of situations, and a variety of special grenade types (remote mines, remotely detonated mines, and automatic turrets) end up sitting in your inventory, likely doing nothing until you get into the actually dangerous fights with multiple powerful enemies, at which point you use a bunch of grenades, win the fight, and then restock on them.
<br>Even on hard difficulty, the game is mostly easy, but the truth is that the difficulty is not what makes the game bad; it is the simple repetitiveness. The environments are never really interesting and more or less consist of darkened corridors for the entire length of the game; the base game was problematic in this respect, but this game was, if anything, worse.
<br>Even the hallucination sequences in this game were thoroughly pointless; the idea behind them is to give jump scares, but the truth is that they aren&apos;t nearly as good at it as the first game&apos;s were, and the environmental cues, music, and sound effects were much more effective at making the game feel creepy; unfortunately, the game never really delivered on such, so you never really got anything out of all the creeping horror, and by the end of the game you mostly ignore them because nothing ever happens to you in said sequences - ironically, the most &quot;horrifying&quot; parts of the game are the SAFEST, and that ends up ruining the whole horror aspect thereof.
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>
<br>This game did not age well, and the graphics are drab and ugly. The environments are repetitive, and you get very sick of &quot;running through dark passageways&quot;, which is what the entire game consists of. It is very samey and very boring, and the only good thing about the game is the music and sound effects, which do a good job with the creepy ambiance.
<br>Unfortunately, nothing else really looks all that good, and all the environments just look uninteresting.
<br>
<br>Final Summary
<br>
<br>F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point is a product of 2006 and belongs in 2006; there is no reason to ever play it now, as the game is quite boring, not nice to look at, and doesn&apos;t deliver on anything. Skip it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-extraction-point/user-reviews?user_review_id=4139327">Expand</a></span>

The combat feels meaty and all the area and weapon effects really brings the combat to life. The story in this game is pretty much non-existent and its basically about you getting to the evac point. And to get there you have to pass trough pretty standard combat areas like a construction site, a hospital, an office, a train station and let us not forget the sewer. The developers have drenched some of the areas in ridiculous amount of blood to  make it fear-like but most areas are really quite grey and unimaginative. There are some new enemies and weapons in the game but players of the original will probably not find a whole lot of new exiting features in this expansion pack. The core gameplay is extremely similar to original which is fine since the original game is by no means bad. The campaign could however be a little bit meatier not to mention actually scary.  I didn&apos;t get particularly scared at any point in the game despite being a gigantic chicken so the game hardly lives up to its name. The length of the campaign is also a little bit on the short side. This game is by no means bad and its a pretty average first person shooter. Its basically a couple of more hours of the original game which is not a bad deal for a fair price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-extraction-point/user-reviews?user_review_id=3013610">Expand</a></span>

<br>Replaying it in 2015 you really begin to appreciate how a game for a PC should be made.
<br>Really puts all the lame abysmal garbage console ports we get now a days.
<br>
<br>Highly recommend this even now in 2016 for its awesome execution (remember how a PC Game should feel like), amazing atmosphere, serious level design, sound, and - of course - amazing gameplay.  It is not F.E.A.R. - but a damn good expansion.
<br>
<br>Some advice for devs and pushers - Complete a PC Game first - THEN port it to consoles.  Not the other way around.
<br>Learn, you greedy bastards - maybe you&apos;ll start earning back some respect from PC Gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-extraction-point/user-reviews?user_review_id=6673353">Expand</a></span>

The story is almost non-existent and the FEAR series doesn&apos;t even consider it canon. You&apos;ll fight your way through the same areas, fighting the same enemies, looking at the same grey color for the entire campaign. Not really worth it unless you&apos;re a die-hard FEAR fan itching for more action.</span>

The graphics appear unaltered, but it&#x2019;s not bad looking for a game of its age. There&#x2019;s still no humour but there is a reasonable story line.

But it&#x2019;s the atmosphere and combat that make the FEAR games, and FEP delivers in both areas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-extraction-point/user-reviews?user_review_id=5221768">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+new locations
<br>+new enemys
<br>+new weapons
<br>+continue story from the end of the original game
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-not so diverse as I expected
<br>-storyplot a little bit disappointing
<br>
<br>A must play for those who enjoyed original F.E.A.R
