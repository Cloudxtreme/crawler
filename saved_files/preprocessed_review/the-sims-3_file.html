But I will agree that having no choice to have pets does kinda suck, and the graphics aren&apos;t the best. But this game will have you singing along to whatever Sim Language song is on the radio.</span>

About 75% of the bugs you come across can be fixed with console cheats if you know how. Such as, Sims getting stuck places they shouldn&apos;t be, Sims disappearing, etc. However some aren&apos;t as easily fixed such as miscalculations of the Sims in your household meaning you can&apos;t adopt, graphics glitches, stopping your Sims from finding a job, sound loops etc. It seems the longer you play one saved game the more likely you are to come across bugs.
<br>
<br>Aside from the bugs the gameplay is awesome. You can customise your Sims pretty much however you want, you can extend their life to ages and ages or move through generations quickly, build awesome houses. Sims 3 gives you a lot more control over the game than previous Sims games. However, the exception to this is the building which doesn&apos;t offer anything new and can be very clunky at times. If your the main thing you do in the Sims is build homes I&apos;d suggest you play TS2 and skip all the bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988984">Expand</a></span>

I look through my old games and try to decide which one can satisfy my open world hunger. And at the end i always embrace my Sims games as a savior. Sims 3 is a very good game with expansions. In spite of many serious bugs and long loading times, game world is relaxing and beautiful. Gameplay is deep and diverse. Challenge is optional and creation tools are great. This is the last maxis game which respects hardcore and casual players equally. But Sims 3 is very expansive toy and without expansion packs content is limited and repetitive. If you have money and patience to ignore serious bugs, game is worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4721956">Expand</a></span>

Nothing really is worth the sixty dollar price tag and I honestly feel robbed and ripped off.  My money might be gone to feed the greedy pigs at EA, but at least I can give my honest feedback of this game here.  Only positive aspect and to start my review, the only redeeming feature is the Create-A-Sim all else falls flat and feels hallow.  Within an hour, I felt bored and just could not get into the game.  I&apos;m a veteran of Sims 1 and 2 and prefer those two in the series.  The core game feels too focused and prioritized on visuals, something the previous games did not need.  What actually let me down and disappointed myself was to see content resisted to The Store, a service on The Sims 3 website which you need to pay to unlock an object.  This is not necessary to hold content from us and having us pay, it feels like theft.  If you take a look at the forums, there is a vast majority who have problems due to bugs and/or glitches and I feel bad for them that they cannot play the game or properly.  This is another problem, bugs and glitches which remain causing problems with the game.  Ah well, I&apos;m sure this new generation of simmers are having a good time because to them graphics only matter mostly and are &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;epic&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479191">Expand</a></span>

The SIms 3 haves some cool extras like, exploring the city, new jobs etc. The graphics are better, but the gameplay no. I miss building my own shop, I miss visiting aliens, I miss their cool expansion. So, I&apos;m giving a positive rating, 8 points.</span>

Fortunately, you can get most of the good ones with the $10.00 worth of free points when you buy the game.

The first is the fact that they skimped in some areas where they added it other. Sims don&apos;t get in there car any more they just appear in there car or bike about 5 or 6 feet away from the ride. My second issue I found that its one Sim to a neighborhood. You can have as many as you want but you cant work with more then 1 family inside one neighborhood filled with a bunch of family&apos;s to pick from. This doesn&apos;t phase me all that much but it kinda is an annoyance. I haven&apos;t gotten to the point where the kids move out but who knows what will happen then. The last thought I have is how cluttered some of the options are compared to the Sims 2. It just feels to diff rent. I know some people say don&apos;t compare it to the Sims 2 but you kinda have to because sequels seek to improve not create something new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424774">Expand</a></span>

But I will agree that having no choice to have pets does kinda suck, and the graphics aren&apos;t the best. But this game will have you singing along to whatever Sim Language song is on the radio.</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3090392"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I bought this game about a year after it&apos;s release. I&apos;ve been playing ever since; however, not everyday. The more I play this game, the more it disappoints me. I will first state my PROS. The graphics in the Sims 3 are much better than the graphics in the Sims 2. Surprisingly, this is my only PRO.
<br>
<br>Now, on to the CONS. In The Sims and The Sims 2, it was much easier to lie down a lot and build a house because there was so much space and in The Sims 2 about two or three worlds were given. The Sims 3 only gives one world, other worlds have to be purchased, and most of the space is used by rabbit holes or already laid houses. There is little space to lie down more buildings. You can renovate your world but not all of the land is flat and making it flat requires patience. In The Sims 2, you could see your Sims work. In The Sims 3 it is quite the opposite. Your sim will go to work but you cannot see any work they will do; You will only be notified that they are working. This was a huge disappoint for me.
<br>
<br>In The Sims and the Sims 2, almost every item in the game you could use or your sim could use. There were only very few items for display, such as statues or plants. In The Sims 3, there are many items that cannot be put to use in this game. For example; the powder bar (I forgot the name but it is located under items for the bathroom). In The Sims 2, babies were to be changed on a bar very similar to the powder but in The Sims 3 they are changed in the air. In The Sims 2, dirty diapers were left behind and so was messy baby food and bottles. Babies are a handful. The game-play is more realistic in The Sims 2 than in The Sims 3. Another example is the cash register. Placing a cash register will not result to Sims working or the fact that you cannot hire and fire. The whole business/working aspect is a complete miss in this game.
<br>
<br>The action in this game is a miss also. I liked when the Sims would have their first kiss or get married, the screen would show a brief moment of their happiness. By the way when the Sims get married, in the Sims 3,   there isn&apos;t a preacher to wed them only an arch. There isn&apos;t even a wedding cake available. There&apos;s only one buffet table but there isn&apos;t a chef. I bought the Sims generation expansion pack because I thought it would fill these lacking elements...I was wrong. Completely wrong! Speaking of lacking elements, there isn&apos;t a butler available either.
<br>
<br>Simple things that were available in the previous editions are pulled from this game so you have to purchase (BUY) these objects on The Sims 3 site i.e the wedding cake and other buffet tables. A sim can gain skill to play the guitar but cannot sing unless you buy The Showtime Expansion pack. The guitar is the only instrument available. In The Sims 2, there was also a piano and the chance for your sim to sing without the purchase of any expansion packs.
<br>
<br>The more expansion packs I buy, the more I start to dislike the game. The expansion packs are to expand the game but instead they only add a few more objects, maybe a skill, and more rabbit holes. The expansion packs to the previous editions really expanded the game. For example, In one expansion pack, you can invent. Which is pretty cool but it&apos;s very limited; especially in action. A sim can invent a drill but only drills holes. What&apos;s the point of watching your sim drill a hole only to find more scraps and gems? Also there is a genie available in the ambitions expansion pack, the genie only grants few wishes and there are only a few things to wish about. Once the genie grants the wish, only a small segment of action happens and that is it!
<br>
<br>The buildings, such as a salon and tattoo parlor, are useless in the Sims 3. I was expecting for these additions to change the game play. I thought I would be able to see a sim give another sim a makeover or do another Sims hair. Negative, Your sim steps on the block in front of the mirror only for you to change his appearance. You can do that with a base mirror in your own home. The tattoo part is OK. But it still needs updating. The Sims 3 lacks creativity. Call me picky...but I like to see my sim use all of its objects. If there&apos;s a candle, I&apos;d like to see my sim light it. If there&apos;s magazines, I&apos;d like to see my Sims read them. If there&apos;s a clothing rack in a shop, I&apos;d like to see my sim be able to try on and buy clothes. If there&apos;s a cash register, I&apos;d like to see my Sims be able to work. if there&apos;s toilet paper, i&apos;d like to see my sim use it. The Sims 3 needs more useful objects. The light up dance floor isn&apos;t available not even in the ambitions or showtimes expansion pack.
<br>
<br>Also This game heats up my computer and causes it to shut off. The more you add, the more it slows. I hope things are better for the Sims 4. However, I&apos;m sure they will make you purchase things that should already be loaded onto the came. I&apos;m still a hardcore Sims fan just a disappointed buyer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3090392">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My background, I player Sims 1 a lot, I always liked it, so no, I&apos;m not a &quot;hater&quot;.
<br>
<br>First the game is badly programmed, filled with memory leaks that will lag your PC into oblivion, it took modders to fix what EA should have done. The game is extremely slow to load even on a good machine and has lots of bugs, and not the glitchy type, gameplay breaking bugs.
<br>
<br>Second the game gives such a low amount of personality options that you have to wonder, is this really a game about people and their interactions? No, its a game about repetitive cliches. Take almost any person you know, try to bring their traits and personality into the game, no can do, impossible, there&apos;s just no traits or combination of them to simulate most basic personalities.
<br>
<br>Third, the engine makes a very poor job at handling the towns, and by very poor I mean, ridiculous bad, it makes choices that make no sense whatsoever. The mechanics design of most features of the game, including expansions is completely broken, in my opinion not because it would be hard for a computer to process, but, due to very bad game engine design which limits the game into pure boredom and repetition.
<br>
<br>But not all his bad, like I said, there&apos;s some very few funny moments like seeing your next door crazy neighbor going through the trash at 3am. Building is also very nice and detailed.
<br>
<br>This game is a nice &quot;architect for children&quot; simulation, other than that, avoid it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833138">Expand</a></span>

When it comes to game-play the open neighbourhood is amazing, no more lengthy loads, you can just cruise around town. Sim interaction is improved, there are more skills to learn, things to do and the opportunities addition is a great idea. I&apos;ll admit, it took me about a fortnight to make the move from 2 to 3 but now there&apos;s no question.

The only thing that set me back is that there were a few items missing (diving board, hot tub, pool table) but like any Sims game they&apos;re on their way shortly, and judging by how much i like this one at the moment I&apos;m going to be investing a lot in this title. Its brilliant. Tiny install time and gorgeous graphics. It can be a little confusing with selecting houses and things from the neighbourhood screen (I think it goes without saying the old systems were more simple) but it&apos;s a new touch and judging by how you now play the game, it works. You zoom out from your home, mid gameplay, click a restaurant, and within 10 seconds your Sims have responded and are on their way in a cab (or your own, very generous costing car). Behing able to put an object on a table in a grid of 9 rather than just one spot is much more appealing than you&apos;d think. Having a lamp and a pot plant on the same side table puts that little bit more depth into your design.. the capabilities are endless. There is so much humour within the game and the new Sim character design is great, although for some reason the stock heads are awfully wide, it doesnt take much to squeeze the cheekbones in. Skill raising is even more challenging than before and the game has seriously added a whole new lifespan to it with this 3rd title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424865">Expand</a></span>

The Sims 3 replaces The Sims 2 in terms of funding, that means that EA will finish up whatever it has left for the platform and start funding The Sims 3 instead of The Sims 2. Now this sounds typical, but understand that if The Sims 3 simply built upon The Sims 2 there would be no problem in the transition, but as it is there are many people who are unhappy with the new product, who continue to play with the old and are being pushed aside as EA abandons its old playerbase to form a new one with this release. Honestly, the Sims 1 was a lot more rewarding than The Sims 2... it was more difficult, and items had a more... marked... effect. The Sims 2 was a rewardless sandbox with many features that could have been cooler... the Sims 3 is... something else... I don&apos;t even understand what it is suppose to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=84064">Expand</a></span>

The idea of a seamless neighborhood is amazing! Unfortunately though, the seamless neighborhood isn&apos;t complete. You arn&apos;t allowed to follow your sim inside stores, restaurants and other buildings. The building creator is worse too. You can&apos;t build stores anymore, which was one of my favorite features of the sims 2. It gets worse. There is only 1 playable neighborhood, and you can&apos;t create your own! Changing families is a drag too. It is a lot of work, as you have to go to the new&quot;town editor&quot; and deselect your family. On the other hand, you can walk around town, which is fun for a while, and the Create a sim has a lot of new great features. The seamless neighborhood is great too, if you dont consider what I wrote about the public lots. If they make a Sims Box like they did for sim city(we all know why ea did that) then you might have fun with the sims 3 for a few days. I recommend that you stay with the Sims 2 for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=84167">Expand</a></span>

I liked the simplicity of Sims 2, and some of the quirky add-ons from Sims 1 i.e. Making Magic, shame Sims3 isn&apos;t an synergy of the best parts of Sim1 &amp; 2. I may get used to this one - or atleast I&apos;m hoping I will, but for me, the clarity of the graphics is disappointing!&quot;
<br>  **How can you rate this at a 5, i have a 4 year old computer and the graphics are way better than &quot;the sims&quot; or the &quot;sims 2&quot;, either you must have a shit graphics card with dx8 or you got a broken cracked version of sims 3, and there are also a lot more colors, so wtf?**    &lt;3</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=81972">Expand</a></span>

But, they took risks with the Sims 3. These risks paid off, BIG TIME! After playing Sims 3 you wonder how we ever managed before? There is now a whole town that you can explore in (which looks incredible btw), all with no loading screens. There is new music, and combined with the look of the game feels like you are playing a game of Desperate Housewives or the Stepford Wives. While this by it self is great there is a lot more. New &quot;moodlets&quot; keep the game much more interesting, as do lifetime wishes. I did think that I would miss all of The Sims 2 expansions, but EA have taken the best from each and put them all into The Sims 3. The game continues to impress me everytime I play it, there is so much depth. The only problem I can find is with performance. I have all the graphical options turned up, and the game runs very slow (there are few more powerful computers than mine). I suspect performance will be improved in upcoming patches. Overall I would give this game full marks...it is truely deserved!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424890">Expand</a></span>

Some new design toys for the player are added, as well as the ability to find rocks and do virtually nothing with them;; a glittery paste caving in upon a non-working, disjointed hollow. The Sims 3 is a derelict of titles passed, fully featured with families that don&apos;t autonomously show love, limited cross-connectivity between game features, and a total lack of uniqueness in animation and personality variation. Ex: &quot;Evil&quot; sims can &quot;take maniacal naps&quot; which do not even look different. This game is not only a disappointment; it is not only tear-jerking for true fans, it is a completely dangerous standard regression for our youth, who will hardly see their efforts to play creatively be rewarded by unique results, as with previous maxis games. Our young will learn and adopt this standard, bringing us to true idiocracy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=83394">Expand</a></span>

Why is it that people think that they have to fix something that isn&apos;t broken. It&apos;s a very boring game and why can&apos;t there be sims that are gay in sims 3.</span>

Most games actually have tools to make mods and make custom weapons/furniture, but it&apos;s almost as if EA don&apos;t want any of their games modded. Took me hours to find tools, because EA don&apos;t provide all the tools needed on the Sims site, and it&apos;s very hard to make anything at all. Graphics aren&apos;t great, lack of locations, I played at the most 6 hours then never played again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1473149">Expand</a></span>

Though the advent of user-made content being made free is really quite something on their part. I didn&apos;t play 2 as I felt they overkilled it with the expansions and so lost my interest...so keep that in mind..but anyway, I freaking love this game. I got it in the mail the other day and haven&apos;t stopped playing it since, pretty much. It&apos;s possibly the most addictive game I&apos;ve ever played -- no lie. I agree with everyone who says this game is a masterpiece -- I wanted something different for my collection, a real full package that offered what something only like The Sims can offer, and godamn, did I get it. As noted, probably the game&apos;s greatest strength is the combination of its breadth and accessibility -- the accessibility doesn&apos;t feel &quot;stupid&quot;, though, if you get my meaning. In short, this is a near perfect game, and I think pretty much everyone should have it. Get stupidly addicted (&quot;I just gotta do this next thing..!&quot;) -- you&apos;ll be thankful for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424886">Expand</a></span>

But, they took risks with the Sims 3. These risks paid off, BIG TIME! After playing Sims 3 you wonder how we ever managed before? There is now a whole town that you can explore in (which looks incredible btw), all with no loading screens. There is new music, and combined with the look of the game feels like you are playing a game of Desperate Housewives or the Stepford Wives. While this by it self is great there is a lot more. New &quot;moodlets&quot; keep the game much more interesting, as do lifetime wishes. I did think that I would miss all of The Sims 2 expansions, but EA have taken the best from each and put them all into The Sims 3. The game continues to impress me everytime I play it, there is so much depth. The only problem I can find is with performance. I have all the graphical options turned up, and the game runs very slow (there are few more powerful computers than mine). I suspect performance will be improved in upcoming patches. Overall I would give this game full marks...it is truely deserved!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=425321">Expand</a></span>

This review would be completely positive if it were not for one big concern. Bugs. Oodles of them. I&apos;ve played through multiple households and over time each one has become unplayable, bogged down with debilitating bugs. I&apos;ve spent over a year monitoring the official community forums, and patching my game. Nothing. It&apos;s one thing if EA would keep up a dialogue with it&apos;s customers, but instead the forums go completely ignored. Meanwhile, they start work on a store for peddling digital items. I can see where EA&apos;s priorities lie.  Accordingly, nothing EA produces will have priority in the future as far as my gaming budget is concerned. I suggest you all adopt the same outlook until EA seriously improves its customer service performance. At the very least DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Otherwise, all you&apos;re in for is frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2127333">Expand</a></span>

The game churns out bug-fixing patches and its DLC is online (some free others you have to pay for), but you need internet for both. If your sims die from old age or something else, chances are an opportunity may arise to raise them from the dead (and be able to control them once more). Adoption is a must-have phone service for sims that fail to &quot;woo hoo&quot; before they become elderly. Child-raising is a tad easier in some places, but a tad harder in others. Before I ramble too much about the game, I might as well remind you that hating it just because you hate it isn&apos;t really a good idea. Those who want to abuse sims should look elsewhere, though, as not much options for killing them exist. In a nutshell: Pros= Graphics, sfx, bgm, customization, dlc, etc. Cons= System requirements, price of some dlc, can&apos;t go into community buildings, lack of killing options, etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=83898">Expand</a></span>

While not perfect, it improves so completely on the Sims 2 by offering both an open world with no load screens and endless customization. It retains the charm and humor of previous games, but it is a dramatic step forward technology wise.</span>

I am a huge fan of MMOs, RPGs, Action FPS, RTS - what have you, the normal fare. But every so often games in other genres come along and grab me. This is one. I must be one of the few who never spent a long time on previous Sims incarnations - a bit here and there, so was familiar with the basics but not much more. So I come with a relatively fresh mind; dont really judge it by its history. This is one of those game that really can keep you going til the wee hours of the morning.. the effort reward structure is perfect - always one more thing to achieve. Its funny, and alluring, and entertaining - and creative! The movie mode is golden. Games really do not come better than this. My main concern is this: that certain tools have been denied the user in order to drive a vibrant microtransactions market. But that is not so much a comment on the game, but the revenue model.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424782">Expand</a></span>

There is 10x more things to do creating your sim and props. You get to know &apos;bots/players&apos; better. It has multi-player aswel so that makes the game more epic.</span>

Maybe I&apos;d like to do a Juvenile Detention Centre. If any one of the detentionees sets their oven on fire, they burn to death because it&apos;s their fault. The building tool is the best feature in the game. I can spend ages building an awesome house. It&apos;ll have five floors and a basement. It&apos;ll be old fashioned. Yeah... But, why are the cheat codes so unhelpful? Players cheat when they want to. In the Sims 2, you can change everything about your Sim, kill them instantly, gain rewards deliberatley and set a person to live in my family and kick them out easily. There&apos;s of course more, but bottom line is that the cheat codes are more like help codes... And the diabolical clipboard and the millions of menus you have to go through? Come on. That is unfair. Oh, and the camera s fairly annoying. The problems that the previous two games had were not fixed. How annoying is that? There&apos;s bugs and glitches aplenty. Those annoying flaws aside, there&apos;s something for everyone in The Sims , even the true hardcore gamers out there (hence the building part). 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1463159">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s so much more you can do on here, what with all the new improvements. Now you can style your Sims clothes using a free, almost limitless range of patterns and colours. Creating amazing houses and gardens is fun too - what with making a matching bathroom or bedroom, or contrasting two different colours together so you can improve your Sims environment. And what makes it so much different than what came before is the addition of moodlets which shows exactly how your Sim is feeling, and the addition of traits that you can assign your Sim. It&apos;s a very interesting game, and goes into the more minor details - with all the creativity and imagination in the world you can do whatever you want to create an infinite number of possibilities for your Sims.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705876">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not sure why there are so many rabid anti sims 3 reviews here, I for one had absolutely no problem with it. There&apos;s only one real problem with it; the system requirements to run this smoothly are high. You&apos;re going to need a high end multi core processor, 4gb ram and a pretty new graphics card. If you&apos;ve got that this is easily one of the best games this year (so far).

However, it detracts from itself in the variety of clothing and hairstyles to pick from (pretty much all of them seem to be hellbent on being &quot;hip&quot; rather than giving a spectrum). The gameplay gets a bit daunting since if you&apos;re trying to manage several Sims who are all about town. Since the world is completely integrated, visits to other lots no longer freeze time and you have to juggle your multiple sims&apos; interactions while being almost in two places at once. Perhaps its the lower graphics settings I have on my machine, but the movement of the character seems to kind of be clanky at times. If you want to clean up a plate on the table, they stare at it for a few seconds before finally picking it up. Sometimes while walking my sims will just stop midstep for about half of a second and then continue on. The new &quot;time bar&quot; that&apos;s added to several actions (such as sleeping, performing a skill-leveling activity, etc.) doesn&apos;t let you switch between options of sleeping until a certain time and sleeping until fully rested (or skilled up) freely without stopping your action and re-entering into it. Also it suffers from some of the same bugs as Sims 2, such as sleeping after WooHoo will be interrupted if you initiate another action afterward. There&apos;s also some minor clipping problems I&apos;ve seen when sims get out of bed (if there&apos;s a nightstand right next to the bed, you tend to be able to put your leg right through it). There&apos;s also the issue of &quot;The Store,&quot; EA&apos;s newest way to make money off of the franchise. New items, decorating sets, hair styles, clothing, cities, will all be offered online using The Sims 3 Store. You pay real money to get Sims Points which you can spend on items to add to the game. I believe EA was including a $10 (or 1000 Sims Points) card with the game, as well as a new town to play so it gives you a little bit to start with. But the cheesiness of having to pay more for items that really aren&apos;t that amazing (most are of moderate quality and don&apos;t really add much to the game) isn&apos;t that appealing and is actually more frustrating than handy. But The Exchange is a nice touch, where people can download other players&apos; content from around the world including lot designs, tile designs, clothing designs (primarily in the form of changing the colors of an existing item), etc. Some of the lots designed on the Exchange are amazing, albeit in different languages (which they tell you before you download). All in all, it&apos;s a very good sequel to one of the most successful franchises in gaming history. I enjoy engaging in the new challenges it offers as well as the new dynamic it gives in gameplay. However, I still go through the game used to all of the amenities I had while playing Sims 2 and find myself going back when Sims 3 is getting a little repetitive. While you have to wonder if EA is going to be responsible and fix the bugs in a timely manner, you also have to wonder if the Sims 3 expansions are going to follow the same repetitive path that the Sims 2 did with the original Sims.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424881">Expand</a></span>

Performing actions in the game is simple, except that some are set to a near limitless time, such that your sim may end up skipping school/work because the former action has not stopped.  Building your home is probably the most annoying part of the game, some items fail to be placed in locations that seem logical, can be placed in mid-air, or are so insanely hard to make a spot for that you become frustrated.

Creating clothing and furniture patterns and colors is fun if you like design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458715">Expand</a></span>

Playing the game, you do feel very much like you are living another life within the game. However, the franchise does need something soon to jolt it back into the life, otherwise it will inevitably die a slow death.</span>

                                        <span>I have been playing EA The Sims, 2 and 3 plus their Online Game for many years and I just have to say, its gets better and better! Each game has its perks and yes there is a repetitiveness to it but if you are already a fan of The Sims, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span>

<br>But there&apos;s a downfall :S, the game gets boring if you play it too much, for an example if you play more then 1-3 hours a day it will get hell boring....
<br>But besides that the game is very good.
<br>But you can get new things in the game-play if you buy expansions packs at Pirate Bay.
<br>The best expansions out right now are Ambitions, Late Night, Pets and Supernatural, those are the best and if you want a good experience with the game get all this expansions on PB and buy the game on Ebay or Amazon and prepare your self from some fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2618547">Expand</a></span>

This game implemented a lot of ideas that move the series closer to an immersive simulated reality, which is exciting.  The next game is probably going to be a lot better.</span>

I will of course also express some of my dislikes.<br><br>Sim Personalities: The whole neat, active,nice point system they had before is gone. To give your sims personality in this game you select traits and that drives them. you can select 1-5 traits, and some of them can&apos;t be combined because they contradict each other.<br>I love this over the previous system. I really feel my sims are getting personality, and in the old system I didn&apos;t because I was spending to much time trying to fulfill needs. Which brings me to the second part.<br><br>Sim Looks: Unfortunately there aren&apos;t as many choices here as I was hoping. There aren&apos;t many hairstyles in the vanilla game, and not many clothes or anything for that matter. HOWEVER the details can be customized to an extent that you have many options. While your limited by your hair style, it can be any color you like, and if you wanted, you could make your sim have steel hair or whatever other material you like. So your limited in your styles, but the materials and colors can be anything. Needs: Your sims aren&apos;t as needy in this game as they were previously, the values seem to be slower, and can be somewhat counteracted by your mood, which can have several bonuses, so that even if your hungry and stinky, your still in a good mood because your listening to music and received a promotion... etc. I find this realistic as well, since people in real life can be in a good mood even if they are hungry and need to go to the bathroom. It also allows you to focus on other goals such as skill building or making enough friends, or whatever. In the sims 1, I spent my entire time trying to put my sim in a good mood - even to the point of cheating for money to get better items, and I still didn&apos;t have enough time to make any friends to advance my career. Perhaps I was bad at the game... all I know is that the sims 3, allows me to have more fun and focus on several goals.<br><br>The neighborhood: Compared to the sims 1, a definite improvement. There are a lot more pre-made sims to either play as or interact with your creations in the neighborhood and they were very creative with the houses that they all live in. You can also do things like seduce a rich wife, then kill them and their family so that your sim can have a much nicer place to live without having to earn money the &quot;hard way&quot; also better is that you don&apos;t feel trapped inside your house with your sim, People are constantly passing by and certain characters that you couldn&apos;t interact with in the sims 1, you can in the sims 3, such as the mailman, or repairman. Some of them might even turn out to live right next door! Very fun.<br>if you let your sim do so, they will wander around the town as well, which gives a much more lively game than before.<br><br>Aging: This is new, but fortunately customizable. They can&apos;t quite live forever, but you could slow down the aging process to a degree that would probably take you a year or two of solid playing to kill them from old age. You can also speed it up to the point where one day your a baby, and the next your young kid. If this weren&apos;t customizable I would have hated it. As is, I love it.<br><br>Steam: It requires Steam-play. This a negative to me, because steam requires internet which of course means if your traveling, or have no internet for whatever reason you can&apos;t play. The Sims 3 shouldn&apos;t NEED internet to play. However... this might be more or a problem with Steam than with The Sims itself. Just mentioning for the sake of those who may have thought it can be played offline.<br><br>another negative is that the graphics from the sims 2 haven&apos;t improved much. Personally though I think of it as a positive, since I don&apos;t play The Sims for the graphics, and it means comps with lower specs can handle it.<br><br>Camera angles can be horrid at times, and can take quite a while to transfer from one sim to the other - even the sims 1 had better camera angles in my opinion!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150348">Expand</a></span>

Without expansions, its a fun, content filled, funny, enjoyable simulation, with tons of things to do in your beautiful town. Meet friends, make food, make your sims wishes true...You can do it all. Only down side is you can spend some time learning how to do everything. Plus ipos version sucks</span>

The Sims franchise has improved throughout the years and I&apos;m pretty satisfied with this version. If you have never played before, you can do almost everything you would in real life. Own a house, go to work, go to stores, go to friends houses, host parties, learn to cook, play chess, watch TV, and have relationships. It&apos;s a really fun game. The Create-A-Sim is also fantastic because you can customize basically every part of your Sim, including your build, clothes, and personality. It also has a memory book where it saves important parts of your Sim&apos;s life, such as you got a promotion or had a baby. It&apos;s also customizable. There are websites you can go to where you can download extra clothes and items.
<br>
<br>There are a few cons, though. The Sims 3 is integrated with EA&apos;s wannabe Facebook, so it prompts you to login in a lot. It also has a few glitches and problems, but what else do you expect with an EA game? I recommend backing up your Sims and houses in case of a problem in the future.
<br>
<br>Even with the cons, this is a game you will most likely enjoy and spend a lot of time playing. I hope you enjoy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511719">Expand</a></span>

With EA at the helm, plenty of new and excellent features have been introduced. Your Sims now inhabit a   cohesive town, free of loading screens. Furthermore, all your Sims age simultaneously, and the random-pairing ability of the game makes the Sims you are not playing go about their own lives; other Sims will marry, move in and out of houses (sometimes even leave the neighbourhood), and die, all with their own free will. The new moodlet feature makes the intricacies of the Sims shine even more detailed than ever. But the game seems to have lost something in the transition between companies. Something uniquely Maxis is absent. Objects that have been with the entire series since its inception now no longer exist, and some of the finer details on buyable objects or background storylines for the stock Sims that the game provides seem hollow and mute. The Sims 3 is distinctly different from The Sims 2, and takes a lot of getting used to. But if you can get used to the changes, then Sims 3 will delight you for hours on end with its addictive gameplay and in-depth customizational abilities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2711649">Expand</a></span>

I played the original Sims years ago, then later the Sims 2, and despite my abhorrence of EA&apos;s customer service record and takeover and decimation of companies I loved, I couldn&apos;t resist buying this game and several expansions. I played the original Sims 3 without expansions for a few months, and I have to say...it&apos;s highly enjoyable, and I have wasted many hours neglecting my real life to develop the life of my Sim. LOL! Not only do you have your career and relationships to focus on, but the &quot;crafting&quot; (for lack of a better term) - gardening, fishing, logic, etc. - is a lot more fun. I also like the option of being able to run your own business (I make HELLA Simoleons as a busker) and the exploration aspect of finding new seeds, meteors and making money that way. It kind of makes me wish real life was like that. LOL! I also love how your offspring don&apos;t end up with pointed ears like they did in Sims 2, which annoyed the crap out of me. I wish EA didn&apos;t take out the ability to have children with the Grim Reaper, that added a humorous aspect to the game that I loved, though apparently you can still mate with ghosts. LOL! So though I hate EA, I love this game, and I love most of the expansions, which I will review at a later time. I wish EA would add a multiplayer aspect to this game, though I guess that would make it an MMO, and seeing how The Sims Online was a spectacular failure I&apos;m sure that won&apos;t happen anytime soon, but it would be cool if you could instance into other people&apos;s towns and explore around. Great game if you like simulation games like this. I&apos;ve always been a fan of the Sims franchise and will continue to play it. Though I don&apos;t play it every day, every now and then I get into a &quot;Sims mood&quot; and will play it for a few weeks before moving on to the next game. There&apos;s something irresistible about meticulously creating your ideal life in as realistic a way as you can...and then bringing a ghost home, having a baby with it and trying to save your marriage. LOL! Your Sim&apos;s life can be as close to your real life or as wild and crazy as you want - or something in between - and that&apos;s something I simply love about this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2656884">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Then there are the micro transactions. It doesn&apos;t matter to EA that you shelled out tons of money for any of the expansions, they still want to charge you more for things that you can not get in the expansions.  So unfortunately, this game is pretty unplayable.</span>

<br>There is really no point in having relationships in this game because in addition to the sims being souless nonhuman robots(like EA&apos;s staff it seems) in my experience the option for proposing marriage has ALWAYS came up before &apos;propose going steady&apos; and I can&apos;t play this game for very long before the AI decides to get stuck somewhere and make the game constantly freeze.

Sims 3 is a 2009 game, and the graphics are great, but not fantastic. There are a lot of things to do, building a house, keep a family and other many, but the movement, vocal and CAS items should be improved better. Also, I appreciate that there are lots of special and hidden things, as places, relations and characters. But there is a major problem: there are no special changes from The Sims 2, and here I&apos;m talking about things specific only in gameplay. Nevertheless, The Sims 3 is a very important game in the sims franchise and therefor I give it an 8, rating it great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4013958">Expand</a></span>

And what really T&apos;s me off is the part where in order to get all of the content you have to go online and buy gay Sim points to get a bunch of crap that won&apos;t work and it cost even more money added to the already outrageously high priced $50 dollars. I will never buy another Sim game again. I&apos;m to the point of disgust with it, it has so many problems. For $50 you would think this would be top of the line, best of ever thing but IT&apos;S NOT. Do NOT get this game. To sum it all up its: high priced, has compatibility issues, comes with bare minimum anout of content, and you have to buy more stuff to go along with it. So just please don&apos;t cause yourself to be VERY disappointed and just stay far far far away from this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=83824">Expand</a></span>

(&quot;spoilers&quot; of features below) No loading screens across town. The ability to place objects diagonally. Adding rooms and roofs to houses are much easier (click-and-drag will automatically do it. No need to add and bulldoze single sections of walls). Your Sim gets his own cellphone. You no longer need a house phone. The cell can take photos, and you can have those photos framed and put on the wall if you choose. You can pay for skill-raising classes to boost skills quicker, you can choose to purchase businesses in town to get a stake of their profit. There are also &quot;opportunities&quot; (basically quests) doled out over time to get extra cash and maybe a raise at work. You can also choose what your Sim does while at work or school, which has an effect on job and social performance and may also help increase skills. Your Sims don&apos;t go to college, don&apos;t have pets to play with and can&apos;t &quot;go on vacation&quot;, but considering the graphic upgrade and great attention to detail, there&apos;s no reason to let that stop you -- your hands will be full enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=424749">Expand</a></span>
