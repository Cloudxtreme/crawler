It&apos;s no wonder they spent tens of thousands of dollars pampering professional reviewers, there is no other way they would give this game a good score.  CoD Black Ops is just a plain bad game.<br><br>Black Ops does nothing really new.  The only real exciting thing about Black Ops is the extra layer of customization available for the online multiplayer.  Dedicated servers for the PC version was a good way to win over the hearts of the anti-Infinity Ward group, but they should have probably done at least SOME testing, since it&apos;s obvious the server and clients just aren&apos;t on the same page.  Using dedicated servers is actually worse than the P2P connections of Modern Warfare 2.  As far as gameplay is concerned, it&apos;s the same ol&apos; respawn and shoot &apos;em up.  I really don&apos;t mind that, as I didn&apos;t expect this game to be anything different, but given its other flaws, they needed to do something new.<br><br>The multiplayer gameplay is horrid.  It&apos;s far too fast, and the game clearly favors SMGs with fast moving kits.  Let me stop here, and stop the flames, I played CS2 as a part of a tournament invitational team, played every FPS under the sun, and I would consider myself pretty damned good at shooters.  The multiplayer matches are chalked full of guys diving every time they see someone, even if they come up behind them.  If they are not whoring out their prone key, they are bouncing around like a drunken night elf.  The weapons behave as far from realistically as possible.  I understand realism isn&apos;t necessarily fun, but it&apos;s almost as though Treyarch just pulled some numbers out of their ass as to how these weapons act and how much damage they do.  And why are knife kills from the front still 1 shot kills?  Every other modern game has addressed frontal melee kills, but not Call of Duty.  I like a little bit of realism in games I play, and this game is far from that at every level.  I was in the Army, and have extensive weapons and explosives training due to my MOS, so I think I can safely say I know what I am talking about here.<br><br>The single player portion of the game does nothing new or different.  In fact, most of the single player campaign seems ripped right out of Modern Warfare 1 and 2&apos;s playbook.<br><br>In short, this game&apos;s flaws are frustrating at best, and infuriating at worst.  Black Ops multiplayer is far too fast and favors the one who can hit their prone key fastest, and aiming seems to do little to help, as the characters move inhumanly fast.  Save your money for Battlefield 3, and this is coming from someone who got through all 10 prestige levels of MW2 and WaW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1423927">Expand</a></span>

Joining your friends via the browser does not seem to be activated yet, so you must wait until one buddy finds a good server and then invites you. The game will grab onto and hold most of your CPU resources making the game lag something fierce in MP and somewhat less in SP. This seems to be an issue for the majority of the players and a quick search on the web confirms this. My score is based on the SP part since the MP part is unplayable and would have to be given a score of 0. Once the emergency fix/patch is released, Black Ops will probably be a decent expantion for World At War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1423865">Expand</a></span>

However, there are very too many game-breaking issues at launch for this game to deserve a decent rating. Perhaps the console versions are okay, but the PC version is buggy beyond being enjoyable. Nazi Zombies game lobbies close with &quot;Game is no longer available&quot; or &quot;Party is no longer available&quot; if just one person quits. No matter who the host is, if one person quits, the whole lobby goes down. Multiplayer suffers from serious spawn issues. Half of the maps are small (some extremely tiny -- Nuketown). In these small maps, you might spawn and then move 10 feet off your spawn -- guess what? -- an enemy spawns right where you left and shoots you in the back! Squad-based spawn with bases in safety areas that enemies cannot enter (ala Battlefield/Bad Company) would be nice. But currently, the game suffers from several issues that simply shouldn&apos;t have been present at launch. Thus the incredibly low rating. If these issues are rectified with patches, I will adjust my rating accordingly. (P.S., we prefer to get several small patches as soon as they are tested rather than one large unweildy patch that has too many things for Treyarch to test.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1424714">Expand</a></span>

Graphics below par, gameplay below par, shoddy multiplayer. Biggest disappointment of the year. Medal of Honor Tier 1 is far superior game and even that was lacking in comparison with BFC:2. This game would be a fantastic game had it been released 3-4 years ago. Terrible waste of money.</span>

Even www.callofduty.com crapped out when I tried to post in their forums by redirecting you to the USA Today hompage and did so for a few hours afterward. Apparently nobody cares about their product or us lowly consumers anymore, just their revenue streams. This is far worse than the Fallout:New Vegas release, and I almost threw my Xbox 360 version of that in the garbage disposal. Too bad I got the digital download, I won&apos;t be tossing my comp out the window but COME THE F@#K ONNNN!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1406191">Expand</a></span>

My computer far exceeds the minimum requirements, but the game is an unplayable mess of problems at the moment. Activision&apos;s current response to widepsread problems is a claim that no on meets the minimum specs. The main campaign is a stuttering, crashing mess with an okay plot. Zombie mode is nothing new, but the special map with JFK, Nixon, Castro, and McNamara was funny. Multiplayer gamplay wise is pretty much the same MW2&apos;s, but suffers from a much smaller and unbalanced weapon count. Multiplayer at the moment is a godawful mess if bugs that will be impossible for Treyarch to ever fix. Whether it&apos;s getting a error that steam must be running to play the game when you&apos;re launching the damn game from steam, getting a connection error on a bot match you&apos;re playing by yourself,  never having your proper name appear ingame, or just stuttering around the map getting killed by the magical 1% of people with no problems. Dedicated servers are provided ONLY by paying gameservers to host your server for you. I could not honestly recommend this game to anyone t the moment. Stay away for at least one year, and maybe by then Treyarch will have patched it to a barely playable state. The only thing stopping it from getting a 0 is the glorious voice acting in the zombie level with presidents.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1423831">Expand</a></span>

So much lag, and that is even if you are able to get in the game unlike the black load screen many people are dealing with.  This might be a great game several patches from now, but at the moment it is unplayable.  I really question if they even bothered to test this at all before release, because with the current issues there is no way in hell this stuff would not have been noticed had it been tested.  I guess all my ranting comes down to this for game companies, stop worrying about the quick cash grab and release a good game.  If your game doesn&apos;t work, delay it and make it work then release it.  Instead of us paying $60 to &quot;play&quot; this game, Activision should be paying us $60 to beta test their game, especially when Treyarch is doing the game and they&apos;re known to release garbage.  The only reason I am giving this a 1 is I have a little hope that if they fix it, that it could be a decent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1406052">Expand</a></span>

Its a shame that every COD fan wanted this game, because of the dedicated server and then its unplayable, because it lags much more, than MW2 did!<br><br>A really bad start. If you want to buy it because of the Multiplayer, dont do it, unitl this problems are solved!</span>

This is which breaks the flow of the game and cant really get into it no matter how hard i try. Same problems still exist to every cod game after COD2. Teammates keep emptying clips at visible opponents without actually killing anything until player finds the trigger which gets the teammates to move forward.<br><br>Multiplayer is very normal cod quality though making snipers unusable makes the game faster which is better in arcade shooter like this. The new game modes are fun but not enough to merit buying this if you already own mw1, bc2 or even mw2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1405956">Expand</a></span>

Looking at critic reviews is essentially a waste of time because they are paid to say swell things about the game. However Black ops for pc is absolutely broken, it has been designed very fast and made very scruffy. The graphics are the same as World at war and the engine hasn&apos;t been updated properly so a lot of the graphics are very shaggy or dull. Game play wise this game is pretty decent because COD has always had great single players, as for online it is an abomination. Even having the best Internet cannot overthrow how slow and terrible the servers are for this game. There are also rarely any updates and that leads to many hardware/compatibility issues. Zombies is a pretty decent aspect but lacks anything new, it&apos;s almost a copy pasted version of the COD world at war one just on different maps. Overall I would avoid buying this game until it is fixed, it&apos;s been three months since the release and is still a pain to play on the pc due to lags and constant errors. Spend your money on something better instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1466198">Expand</a></span>

Game not so good as Mw2. It&apos;s not optimized for PS. graphic is worse than it was in mw2.
<br>I think only good thing is customization of guns and player.
<br>So if they would took mw2 + new story+ customization+ infinity ward team t would be so much better. Yea, zombies is cool but even there they screw up.
<br>And in SP it&apos;s look like they took old script&apos;s and just add it in new engine.

The main menu looks like it was tailored a console game as you have to use your wasd keys to navigate threw it.   Single player isn&apos;t horrible if your into that sort of thing. But for i&apos;d say 80% of the online FPS community we want to be playing online.  Overall this game is bad SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!

The graphics are childish, and hardly an improvement not to mention that it uses way too much computer to achieve them. Browsing for servers is not amazingly easy. The campaign was boring compared to mw2.</span>

I can run Crysis on full settings and get a solid 80 FPS whilst on this POS I get 30-50. The singleplayer was a laugh like any COD and the multiplayer balance was stupid. Not to mention the joy os using an L96A1 AWM was ruined because the nerfed it to the point where I would get a hit marker to the face almost every time. This game wasn&apos;t even worth $20 with so much problems occurring. the nutshell: An over all POS shooter that will only interest n00bs and 12 year olds on xbox.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1484387">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>With the campaign there are far too many cut scenes. Although the cut scenes have some nice effects and are quite well done i think they are a bit over done with the effects as the white flashes across the screen every two seconds give me a headache and it becomes very difficult to concentrate on the story when your having an epileptic fit from all the flashes.
<br>
<br>On the multiplayer mode it is a lot less balanced then on Modern Warfare 2 (MW2), on MW2 the default classes gave decent weapons to give new players a chance to get into the game, this is not the case with Black Ops as you start of with the most basic of weaponry giving you no chance against players who have been playing for a while longer and have unlocked better weaponry.
<br>
<br>As for graphics, MW2 had some pretty sweet graphics while Black Ops made no attempt to best those graphics, the graphics in Black Ops are similar to those seen in World at War, which weren&apos;t bad at the time World at War was released but for a game with such a hefty price tag and that came out 2 years later it&apos;s not very impressive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488466">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and sound are top notch, with environments and characters looking great, an excellent soundtrack, Hollywood-quality voice work and fantastic sound effects for weapons and explosions.

Local bot AI is horrendous: I can run up in front of them, knife them in the face, and they won&apos;t make any attempt to shoot me. Graphics quality took a step down from MW2, so that the game looks like it was made in 2006.

The singleplayer story was enough to distract me for a few hours, but I can&apos;t recall any highly memorable scenes, so I&apos;ll be focusing on multiplayer and general playability. While the reintroduction of lean and dedicated servers is wonderful, the game is essentially unplayable for me.  I average about 26 frames per second on any settings I choose, from all low and 800x600 resolution, to all high on my native 1680x1050, it seems to make no difference.  This was a surprise to me, as I was able to run all the previous Call of Duty games at 60+ frames per second, in addition to Crysis (and recently, even the Crysis 2 demo) on medium-to-high settings.  It has been more than 3 months since release and, in its current state, I do not see myself buying the DLC for a game I cannot enjoy.  As for weapons, it seems that in an effort to combat modded controllers from consoles, firing a semi-auto weapon on PC may lock up and prevent you from firing.  Many weapons share the same generic sights, which in my opinion should have been an attachment so everything didn&apos;t look cookie-cutter&apos;d.  For visual nitpicking/inaccuracies, the AK47 in the game uses the same magazine as the AKs74u, which doesn&apos;t make sense due to different caliber.  The AK47 also seems to be no different than the Colt Commando other than &quot;visual&quot; recoil and slower reload speed, despite Commando having the same ammunition as the M16.   The M16 and Commando in game use incorrectly sized magazines, and the M16 possibly uses incorrect firing mode.  Two of the assault rifles in the game (if you&apos;ve played it, you probably know which two I&apos;m talking about) essentially out-class the entire submachine gun category.  On a good note, the server browser is kinda nice and slick.<br>Fun fact:  I originally started this review at a 6, but it dropped and dropped the more I remembered and reviewed how it played.  TL;DR?:   Machine that can run Crysis on High, barely manages to run BlOps on Low.  Unplayable.  Weapons/Perks could use a little tweaking, visually and performance-wise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557586">Expand</a></span>

Would I play Cod 4 four years from now? Probably yes. &#xC2;&#xA3;12 DLC that gives you only 4 extra maps and not much else?!!!! Appalling - I was going to give it a five when I remembered about this. 4 for adding the lean/peak back.

Tried it the other day after reinstalling for the first time since Novemeber, it still crashes. I will never buy a Treyarch or Activision PC Game again. Especially COD as from MW2 it was also obvious the PC version had been crapped on.</span>

To start off, even the menu was buggy as hell on my gaming PC which is way over the requirements for this game. a few of my friends were asking if my main menu was working properly, as many of theirs only had black screens. The multpilayer wasn&apos;t playable at best, as every single server in the world was american run, we&apos;re talking 400+ ping minimum. it took another 2 days for the serveres to become local. The Campaign was forgettable and utterly disappointing. It wasn&apos;t a twist, it was a WTF?! my first thought was &quot;REFUND!&quot; even after the local servers came online, game play was still extremely buggy. guess thats what you get for not beta testing hey? only the promise 0f patches and updates kept me from returning to the store, alas, they only proved to be further disappointments. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC!!!

You would think that being afforded close to two years of development time, Treyarch would be able to expand on a winning formula and create a worthy follow up to Modern Warfare 2. Don&apos;t fix it if it isn&apos;t broke, right?<br>Not Treyarch. Unfortunately, Treyarch do things Treyarch&apos;s way for the sake of being different, and Treyarch, and not because it&apos;s good.<br>What do I mean exactly? Let&apos;s take the sound for starters. The directional sound is completely muffled to the point where you will not be able to gauge the distance of gunfire. According to the developers, this is called &quot;sound whoring&quot;. I call it listening, but Treyarch don&apos;t follow any pattern of logic when it comes to games development.<br>In previous Call of Duty games, you would be able to detect an enemy by his movement - by the sound of his footsteps. Well, not in Ersatz Call of Duty: Black Ops. Footsteps are muted to the point where you will only hear an opponent when he is within knifing distance. What&apos;s even more puzzling is that there is a tooltip that sometimes appears on the loading screen that tells you that the sound of an enemy&apos;s footsteps will often give away their position. I should add that there is a Ninja perk in the game that reduces the sound of your footsteps, but you won&apos;t need it here. It&apos;s built in.<br>Other bizarre sound design decisions include having your character shout out that he is placing a claymore (the enemy team can hear these call outs), completely defeating the purpose of your intention to set a trap.<br>As for the balance, this is the worst balanced Call of Duty game to date. Many weapons are statistically the same in every way, with the only difference being the weapon model. Even then, that isn&apos;t much of a distinction as seven weapons use a negligibly different FAMAS sight from Modern Warfare 2.<br>If you like to use sniper rifles in other games, you won&apos;t find much here. The damage view kick (the flinch when you are hit) is so strong in Black Ops that you will often find yourself damage view kicked to death from across the map at the very distance your weapon is supposed to excel at.<br>Treyarch also copied many of Infinity Ward&apos;s perk ideas from Modern Warfare 2 and gave them a new name, while also bringing back the same redundant perks from Call of Duty 4, like Deep Impact (renamed to Hardened), which have really little function at times when it really matters. I have not begun to address the crippling lag on the game&apos;s multiplayer. More often than not you will find yourself staring in disbelief as your well aimed shots pass through enemies, who in turn will kill you in miliseconds with their FAMAS. These problems are exacerbated when you use a sniper rifle. A weapon that fires a lot of bullets quickly has much greater odds of overcoming the poor hit registration than one that demands precision.<br>There is really so much wrong with Black Ops that I could easily fill two review sections writing about it. If it&apos;s any indication, the game had 150,000 players at its peak on its multiplayer on the first day. Fast forward six months later and player numbers have dropped to around 25,000 at its peak per day. Modern Warfare 2 has more people playing. I would recommend that game instead, or just hold on for more news of Modern Warfare 3.<br>If you&apos;re looking for a game that has a variety of things to do, you won&apos;t find it here. The new CoD Points system makes everything accessible so you don&apos;t have to complete challenges to unlock attachments. Even if the traditional unlock system from previous games was present here, I don&apos;t think it would be enough to keep me interested. Black Ops is dull and uninspiring. Treyarch have proven why they are referred to as the Call of Duty B-Team with this pathetic offering.<br>I give this game a 4 because features like Combat Training and the few good tracks within are its saving grace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1627688">Expand</a></span>

Single player, which might be the best on the call of duty series. Multi player, is nothing but boring and annoying, nothing new. World at War was something I enjoyed a little, but after MW2 I didn&apos;t really expect anything from the call of duty franchise, and I wasn&apos;t surprised.</span>

The maps have been expanded a decent bit, there are very cool customization options that help you give a personal touch to virtually every bit of gear right down to the totally unimportant player cards. Graphics are really good but only due to the excellent art design, if you start looking you will find signs of serious graphical fidelity the engine has experienced over the years. Sounds are also a definite improvement over previous cods as well as animation, all together these help to make the campaign quite memorable, no matter how confusing it gets at times. One downside of the multiple characters thing is that  you don&apos;t leave hating the antagonists enough, otherwise as a whole it is quite varied and fast paced with some welcomed breaks in between stages. Camp-fests are virtually none-existent now and the killstreak rewards aren&apos;t particularly overused and OP either, leaving much of the fighting in infantry CQC form. Unfortunately Treyarch has yet to nerf the two most OP guns in the game (roughly a year after release o.O), which has put me off for a bit due to recent overuse by the community. The MP as a whole I prefer outright over MW2, and it&apos;s minor issues are overshadowed by this fact.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1812762">Expand</a></span>

And if you are able to run it what you will get is a pretty average first person shooter. The campaign is as linear, scripted and braindead as you would expect from the genre. Decide for yourself if that is a bad thing or not. Gameplay wise has the series stood still for a while and black ops continues on that path by not changing a single thing. The shooting is still alright but everything from the bad visuals, forced turret sections, endlessly respawning enemies, linear maps and scripted events starts to feel dated and if you have played a military shooter or two you will definitely have seen this before. That the campaign is rather short for the games price doesn&apos;t help either. You do get to visit some interesting places in the campaign which is always nice and the story is better than you would expect from this genre even if its a bit cliche. The multiplayer will compensate for this for some. Personally i didn&apos;t get much fun out of the multiplayer. The reason was technical problems and lack of interest. I would give the game a 5 in score since i believe that the game is quite average but the technical problems manages to bring it down a score. If this is your thing and if you are a fan of the games multiplayer i would recommend buying the game for a cheap buck. Just be aware that you might have to deal with some technical problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802557">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t say i love the graphics, they&apos;re a bit odd looking, but you will get used to them and they won&apos;t distract you from the game. I used to play this game for hours and hours. If you like the COD series, this is a must.</span>

However Treyarch disappointed me, because NOTHING changed since that time. I was even shocked, when i someone told me that this game was patched. But without any more words lets come to pros and cons of this game.
<br>Pros:
<br>Campaign - One of the best in CoD universe, very interesting from the beginning till the end.
<br>Main protagonist - Very interesting person with unusual history
<br>Side protagonists - Also charming people, just like main hero.
<br>Graphic - Not beautiful, but not scary also. ;)
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>Weapon balance - If someone says that weapon balance exists in game, there are 3 options: paid to say so, have not seen multiplayer for longer than 5 minutes or literally stupid. AK-74u, FAMAS, AUG - no recoil, high damage, high ROF, high accuracy, huge clip size. Most of the players use at least one of these guns.
<br>Weapon realism - Sorry, but if we talk about weapons this game cant be classified as from period 1961-1975. With stuff from 90 &apos;s (AGS-30, AUG A2, FAMAS), 80 &apos;s (KS-23, PSG-1, AKS-74u) and many many more. Counted at least 20 weapons which went into prototype after 1968, when last mission occurs. Counted at least 25 weapons, which should be removed only because of it. If we are strict, this game doesnt count as something from Cold War because of AGS-30, which was introduced in 1999. Most weapon accessories like silencer or red dot sights also are also wrongly put.
<br>Price - Sorry, but paying that amount of money for full product is ridiculous.
<br>Bugs - From missing texture to permeation a part of soldier leg through wall or smoke throught wall. Sorry, but it is unacceptable in ANY game.
<br>Optimization - Anyone heard about it in this game? Because i didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Game should be MUCH MUCH cheaper when new (at least 30-40 %). And this stupidity still continues. :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=5746860">Expand</a></span>

I played most of the Call of Duty games, including MW2. I was really looking forward to Black Ops, thinking it could only improve on previous titles. If it was just MW2 with dedicated servers and a better use of the VAC anti-cheat system, it couldn&apos;t fail! I preordered the first day it was possible to do so. After an endless wait, I finally played the game, and within the first few minutes, I was hugely dissapointed. The game released with major technical problems, including constant studdering on even the best machines, major lag issues for random people at random times, freezing for 5-10 seconds during gameplay, and random crashing. Those issues can eventually be fixed, though they already have my money and since I can&apos;t get a refund, there is nothing forcing them to do so. But, it was far worse than that. The rank system, using a combination of money and exp seems to trip over itself. Eventually the money becomes totally worthless and just builds up forever, as there is nothing to spend money on once everything is unlocked. The dedicated servers all have their own rules, such as &quot;no claymores&quot; (which is the only usefull equipment), &quot;no rc cars&quot;, &quot;no second chance perk&quot;, etc. You can&apos;t change your class once you get in a server, so if you use any of these things you basically have to find another place to play. There is no way to play with your friends. Almost every COD game in the past had this. Even if a friend joins the server you are in, there is no way to change teams, so you often end up opposing eachother. Many players, including myself, play with friends over Vent or other voice programs and like to play together tactically, which is impossible in this game. There is no co-op for the campaign. The single-player is far too short. The only thing I like about the multiplayer over other COD games is the face paint. There are many, many other things that seem to go back in time for PC gamers. We lost so much that we have gained over the years. I have since went back to MW2, which is full of hackers and noob tubers, but is still far better than Black Ops.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1441773">Expand</a></span>

<br>Much to the gamers delight, .....

<br>It&apos;s what every gamer want from a $60 investment.
<br>But wait, there&apos;s more,...
<br>how about a menu that doesnt show your friends in game, or an invite menu that doesnt work until you press it 20 times.
<br>Can&apos;t find your favorite server? Simple solution
<br>Press the refresh button 50 times, it&apos;s bound to appear sooner or later (maybe)
<br>Better yet, just click on browsing servers and watch your computer freeze for about 90 seconds.
<br>Just the thrill of not being able to control your computer is enough to make you want to

<br>how can I say this....

When Treyarch released the PC version of Black Ops with NO, read it, NO BETA TESTING being done for the PC version, you knew there would be trouble.  Lo and behold, framerate issues, and lag issues not only in the MP facet but also in the SP, Zombie mode, AND on the menus caused such a great stir in the community that I nearly returned the game.  But after seeing Treyarch was working on a patch (one redeeming quality they have - they listen to the community), I decided to hold onto it.  What resulted was a game that was solid.  Not great, but solid.<br><br>The SP story was forgettable and really...just too much.  It was hard to get a grasp on what was going on so often because there was just way too much going on on the screen at once.  Too many explosions, to many expletive laced, non-witty comments, forgettable squad-mates (yes even Reznov was forgettable in this story), disjointed story (I know they intended that, but it worked against them), and overall just too claustrophobic.  The ending had a twist, but I could have cared less about it.  The campaign honestly was about a 3 or 4 out of 10 for me.<br><br>The MP is fun for the most part, and I have much more fun playing in the HC modes, and being on the PC, server customization really is a huge plus.  The level of customization for your guns, character, emblem and what have you, is a really enjoyable feature Treyarch put a lot of effort into.  But despite the balance, and the deep customization system built in the MP, the replay/fun factor for me is quite low.  I feel I get bored too often in the MP.  I honestly had more fun in MW2 - yes with OMA + Danger Close noob tubers and all.  Zombie mode is the true redeeming quality for me with Black Ops.  Everything is is either blandly average, or well-below average.  No matter how you cut it, there is just no way you cannot help but have a blast in zombie mode.  Plain in simple it is the reason why I&apos;m giving this game a 5/10.  The graphics are dated, the SP campaign and story is confusing and laughable, the MP is good but just plain Jane good and not fun, the sound effects are rather poor (too many explosions and LOUD white noise) and the musical score is blandly average.  Zombie mode?  Awesome.<br><br>Overall this is a game I would have much rather waited for in the bargain bin, but it is still a somewhat enjoyable experience.  If you truly want well-thought out stories, stick to RPG&apos;s and adventure games (ME 2, RDR, Bioshock, Fallout, TES).  Solid and replayable MP?  BC2.  Fun and frantic MP?  MW2 (despite the bugs).  But Black Ops unfortunately does not stand out and is blandly middle of the road.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-black-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1457943">Expand</a></span>

I still have DirectX error, freeze when I play neither single or multiplayer (DX and driver already update). I CAN&apos;T BELIEVE Treyarch create a 60$ TRASH! I&apos;ll never buy any series of Call of Duty. For those who is considering buying this game, DON&apos;T BUY IT !! Save your money!!</span>
