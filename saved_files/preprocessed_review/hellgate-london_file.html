But I blame the publishers, which forced the game to be released on Halloween to try and get sales money coming in. With extra time, the game would&apos;ve been more complete and polished. But it&apos;s years ahead of Diablo in gameplay elements. NPCs are more strange than funny, and quests are pretty simple, but the game works well for fighting enemies and building great loot. Being able to build and upgrade items makes for a great experience, and helps create lasting equipment that you don&apos;t sell once you find a better version. It&apos;s not perfect, but it is what Diablo 3 and Torchlight should&apos;ve been aiming for, instead of the same old kill grind in random areas. I&apos;d give it 8.5 but I&apos;ll round up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=1607557">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve been trying to figure out just why I dislike it so much, and I think it comes down to the appalingly bad voice acting (these are the guys who gave us &quot;I sense a soul in search of answers&quot;? Purleeze!) and the monsters have no character. My 9-year-old is playing D2 at the moment and the monster animations and sounds have real character - in H:L they just don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Just dull dull dull. I don&apos;t know how long it took Flagship to make this but it was time wasted. As for subscribing - I don&apos;t feel like I even got my money&apos;s worth from the boxed version.

However, after MANY patches, performance upgrades, and soon to be released, patch 2.0 and 2.1, removed game bugs and is now enjoyable. 
<br>
With the rebalancing and New features the game has fully evolved, similar to that of other role playing games. You know what one I&apos;m thinking about. cough d2 cough.
<br>
<br>Given that this game suits both semi MMO and FPS games, I find it addictive and very replayable. 
<br>
But due to the repeatativeness of the game, I will only give it an 8/10. But I am addicted!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=72135">Expand</a></span>

Hellgate London is another Action RPG from the makers of Diablo. The best part of this game was the looting system and the resulting fabulous items, which was the same as Diablo II&apos;s. The original cut scene was great. I&apos;m guessing the corporate juggernaut, Electronic Arts saved more money by making the cut scenes between Acts -another Diablo II feature - only about 5 seconds long.  I didn&apos;t notice too many bugs (my computer crashed once and the game got laggier as it progressed), I stopped playing by the time I got to Act III. Hellgate London is a really disappointing, unpolished product. In fact the worst part of the game was also an attractive selling point for me: &quot;Dramatically generated levels for a unique experience every time&quot;. After playing, this seemed a lot more like a time saver on EA&apos;s part than a unique experience. For example, I kept playing the same levels over and over, like I&apos;d do the street level again and there&apos;d be the one house you can go up to the 3rd level on and the one place where you can go down a level - all placed in different sequence of course - but relatively exactly the same..  The story, NPC banter and side quests are lazily thrown together: &quot;Kill this many monsters on this level&quot;... &quot;Touch this many telephone poles&quot; or &quot;Touch this many reactors&quot; whatever it was.. I just wanted to blaze through, but then fighting and looting IS the whole game. Save your money and check out Titan Quest instead. It&apos;s much better and about as close to Diablo II as you can get.. Oh and Diablo III was recently announced so TQ and it&apos;s expansion pack should tide you over for a while.See you in Nov. &apos;09</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=73543">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t see how you guys are so disappointed with this game. I mean, I am completely hooked, there are some flaws, but they are basic things that can be fixed. The camera views are great in third person and can be moved anywhere that suits your liking, almost completely overhead even. The first person needs a little tweaking however, but is still fun. The core gameplay is, almost exactly, like diablo 2. So many things are borrowed and for me that is great. The guns don&apos;t really take away from the diablo 2 feel because they do not work like guns in a normal fps. It is still about the loot and the build. If you liked D2 and you want a great action mmo, get this and play it for a few hours and you will be hooked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404552">Expand</a></span>

Those who enjoyed Diablo II, will find some things to enjoiy here, but don&apos;t expect much. The weapon upgrade system is interesting and there are some humerous moments. The final kicker to the score is the subscription cost, I can not see a reason to play the subscription cost at this time, the game just needed more work. There are a few bugs, but in the single-player(I have not tried the multi-player), they are fairly minor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=406770">Expand</a></span>

Definitely worth getting, some say it&apos;s a Diablo 3. I have to disagree, it has similar features but it&apos;s not the same game at all. Furthermore, who cares if it is a Diablo 3? Diablo 1/2 were amazing.</span>

Also, although nobody likes to pay, I feel that the monthly fee is justified. I look back at Diablo 1 and 2, and you know what ruined those games? Cheaters. If I had the option to pay monthly for those games, I would, as long as it provides a secure online community. All in all, this is an excellent game, and I feel that you should play every class before judging the game. Once you find the playstyle that fits you, then this game will grow on you and you will love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404350">Expand</a></span>

With that aside this game is terrible. The dialouge is decent but the wa it is presented with endless clicking just to view 1 sentence is ridiculous. This game has more bugs then a antfarm. I have a awesome gaming rig i bought expressly to play this game because pc gamer was all over this title until it came out. I was hyped for almost a year. This piece of junk is going directly to ebay. ill sell it for 5.00 if someone will take it. Dont buy into the hype. To many bugs,high system specs,lots of tweaking to get it to work and it will still terminate the application after 30 minutes of play. Also there are areas of the game that you just get physically stuck in. As in cant move. Also EA has terrible support as well afor most of their new releases. I am hesitant to play crysis now because of this steamy turd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=405761">Expand</a></span>

So many core gameplay issues from not knowing how much damage your character causes to not being able to split stacks to one of the worst UIs I&apos;ve ever seen to absolutely no story whatsoever. Expected this to be the next Diablo 2. Now I think it has a ways to go before it becomes the next Titan Quest.</span>

I have never seen such horrible graphics for a video game for this time. .I was all hyped when i saw the starting video but once I played the game, the graphics reminded me of Doom, so linear, the character details are horrible. . . Then again I just started playing Clive Barker Jericho. . I cant compare . See for your self.</span>

Sure, sometimes in a station you get randomly teleported to the center. So what? The station is small and it takes you all of, literally, 5 seconds to get back to where you were. Sometimes you get stuck between objects during adventures. There&apos;s an unstuck command, use it. It happens. It happened in WoW and other games, it&apos;ll happen here, too. Other than that, the game is just mindless fun, much like D1 and D2. The story could use improvement, but there&apos;s good times there as well. Techsmith 314&apos;s dialogue was extremely funny, for example. This game was rushed, there&apos;s no doubting that, but Hellgate London restores something to video games that hasn&apos;t been there for awhile now: Simple, bloody fun. Do you remember how much honest to goodness fun it was to crawl through a dungeon with your buddies on D2? It&apos;s the same thing here, and despite all the flaws that marr this wonderful game&apos;s visage, I give it a 10. I give it a 10 because I enjoy myself when I play this game. I give it a 10 because despite the flaws, the game still shines. I give it a 10 because it&apos;s something new and innovative, something we haven&apos;t seen rehashed a hundred times already. Hellgate London is worth your time, whether you plan to be a Founder or not, it&apos;s worth a buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404539">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve personnaly never see this in any game, and I&apos;ve never been stuck and forced to wait a patch to continue a game, which is , finally, very frustrating. It can be a good game, but the bugs, that seem to extend in time with no fix, will kill it very fast.</span>

The only thing this game lacks is a persistent world like a mmo. but you get an awesome single player and multiplayer game. You can play online for free. Think about it this way. Buy the game. Play for three months online without paying and when you want to subscribe you can get all of the subscriber additions for just $10. It is basically a replacement to expansion pacts since they will be updating the game constantly. Diablo 2 never got any major content updates for free until several years after release in the form of patch 1.10 now just imagine awesome content updates constantly streaming in that makes the $10 a month worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404265">Expand</a></span>

You cant expect a game to be 100% perfect at launch and things like multiplayer will only be seen when users cant connect. So I dont hold that against them. However, it is a BASE GAME. By this I mean it contains the basis of an RPG without much fluff. Follow the main quest and you will do fine. It is not a challenging game unless you play hardcore. It was somewhat dissapointing but its not a horrible game in my opinion.

After you blast through the standard level so easily you fall asleep you will look forward to a harder experience on Elite. Prepare to be disappointed. Even on Elite it isnt hard as I would define hard (ie requires skill, concentration and practice to master). When players tell you its &quot;harder&quot; they just mean it takes longer. You die more often and instead of resurrecting you have to wade through the last hours worth of maps to get back to where you were to do the same old fight again, and again, and again. And if you are tempted to try to run right through and try to ignore the yard trash? Well not with an evoker. You can be mobbed and killed in less than a second. Nope, you have to work your way back killing everything in your path with the same fairly easy but time consuming techniques that killed the last 1000 monsters. On top of that the graphics are so so, the story line weakly presented, the immersion non existant and there a million and one annoying features (like if you die or log off your minimap closes .... why would you do this ffs? Just leave the gui as I set it up thanks ...). I played it because I was hoping there would be something more to it in Elite. But there isnt. If you liked diablo or wow or eq you may like this IF you play with a dedicated group of friends. But by yourself?

Devs are money mongers and will censor anything related to their crooked billing practices on their forums, so you don&apos;t even get a warning, you cant read it on the forums.

<br>
<br>So I read on the official boards that many beta testers are still very angry with what FSS delivered, the slow pace at which they seem to fix/better things, how they completely dropped the ball on everyone. Since I wasn&apos;t in beta, I have no idea what the game was expected to be at launch; I do however remember the shiny screenshots that went around the Web some months before HG:L came out, frankly I too was wondering where those awesome graphics and lighting effects went.
<br>
<br>So back to gist of the review; I like HG:L. Not love, not hate, it&apos;s *ok*. If it feels very half-baked in some areas (skills, character progression as a whole), the action and different styles of gameplay for each of the factions is actually well done. The action is well paced, but it soon feels *very* repetitive even for a RPG grinder. One really overhyped feature is the random map generator to improve replayability; it sounds much nicer than it actually is, the corridors still look the same, the only difference is you may need to turn left instead of right (but your directional goal is still the same, so who cares).
<br>
<br>Graphics in DX9 mode look good, but dated; as said before, it looks and feel like a 2004-05 game (for the very picky, at least); I haven&apos;t had the chance to try out DX10 graphics personally, I heard they look much nicer, but there are some pretty bad lag problems even for those with very high-end gaming systems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=70276">Expand</a></span>

I admit that there probably were more environments but still very monotonous.  And dont even get me started on the optional monthly fee.  Think of fast food putting all the leftovers from a cow into your burger thats pretty much what the players who didn&apos;t pay the monthly fee got.

It&apos;s just a bunch of boiler plate environment templates spliced together and populated with things to kill. You start seeing through the system almost immediately, and it becomes a boring stats game with lame pay offs. A good story might have somewhat rescued it, but there isn&apos;t one. The lack of voice acting is pathetic. Must be nice to just pocket the money you should have spent on voice talent and go with text windows instead. A $60 game with endless TEXT BOXES in 2007? WTF? Some official reviewers need to be canned for not mentioning that glaring issue. All the side quests are one-offs and don&apos;t play into any larger story (saves on programming), and rewards are just crappy items like the ones you find in droves just walking around (more effort saved). A lot of people saying it&apos;s a 3D Diablo or even &quot;Diablo 3&quot;. NOT EVEN CLOSE! Hellgate is like a raw Diablo stats engine stripped of everything else that Made Diablo interesting--a story, thriving towns, engaging NPCs with the illusion of lives. The Hellgate NPCs just stand there like mannequins--they might as well be replaced by a quest headings. I really thought the guys rating this game low were full of it, but now I wish I&apos;d listened. Too many good games out right now to waste time or money on this POS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404872">Expand</a></span>

It has a good mix of character options and an interesting storyline with lots of options to play the game your way. My only complaints are the lack of LAN functionality and some online only pay for use features that leave people who spent the money for two copies (like me) so that you can play two people at once. The manual is not very good but they never are nowadays. (Fallout 3 manual better be good Bethesda!)
<br>
<br>The system requirements are pretty low and the graphics are DX10 but not at the Crysis level, not even close. But the game isn&apos;t a FPS its a hack and slash and shoot and whatever your character class may be.

Many levels/locations look alike - randomization is not a substitute for good level design.

The graphics, in my opinion, are very good. The armor could use a bit of an update though. I also like the storyline. The dialog was awesome in the beta, but since so many complained about it FSS changed the dialog to the rather boring dialog that is there now. Some of the problems that weren&apos;t fixed in the beta and are alive and well in game now (as of 11/3/07) are: The engineer class bots lose all items you equip them with Random crashes that occur frequently require a hard restart The sound is glitchy (for lack of a better term) at times I&apos;m sure there are more things that could go up there, but these are the main complaints I have seen or have had. Some of these are supposed to be addressed and fixed in the November 5th patch (also the &quot;Guy Fox&quot; in game event for subscribers). There is a subscription plan, but ONLY if you want to pay it. You don&apos;t have to pay it, but you don&apos;t get any extra content updates. You do get the patches and all other game updates. Yes, the game is hack-n-slash and can be very action oriented if you enjoy killing huge groups of demons alone or with friends. It can also be boring and slow at times, but that&apos;s the nature of the beast. It is a MMO, but not a typical kill this many bad guys and get this many items MMO. It is a MMO game just because of what MMO actually stands for; Massive Multi-player Online game. Are the &quot;worlds&quot; persistant? No. Do you see everyone else running around farming all the bad guys you need to kill? No. You only see other players if you are grouped with them. The chat interface needs a lot of work although right now it is 300 times better than what was in the beta. The chat interface is either right in the way when it is open or you completely forget about it when it is hidden. In my opinion, the gameplay is good and fluid except as one of the Templar classes. This is because many people complained that the original Templar class movements were too fluid and made the players feel like their characters were floating on air instead of standing and swinging swords. Right now the Templar classes stand still while swinging swords except for the first normal attack and when using certain skills. Many people need to realize that this is not another Diablo game. Some of the features are the same, but it has the name of Hellgate: London and NOT Diablo 3 for a reason other than copyright and legal problems. The game is lots of fun if you like hack-n-slash. If you don&apos;t like hack-n-slash games don&apos;t buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404493">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not a graphics whore, but DX10 mode is hardly an improvement and runs very slowly because it defaults to 16x AA due to a bug. There are far too few environments, making things look very repetitive. The &apos;random&apos; levels fail to impress; mazelike dungeons worked well in D2, but London isn&apos;t laid out along grid lines. Multiplayer is a ghost town because almost everyone has the clunky chat interface turned off, autoparty doesn&apos;t work and grouping scales up the monsters to such a degree that you are better off going solo. And the subscription service is a scam; thank god Elite difficulty will soon be available to all, because the game isn&apos;t worth playing without Elite difficulty, which would have made this a forced subscription game. Yet, for all its flaws, this is the first and only game so far that captures the spirit of Diablo 2, unlike other technically much better but uninteresting games like Titan Quest. The important thing is that it is FUN.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404508">Expand</a></span>

Right off the bat, this game chugs like a frat boy on my low end machine, especially when i look at fire effects, and the whole world is practically on fire. Secondly, the critters are used over and over again, and their animations are horrid. Whenever one of those monkey rat demon things leaps at me, they freeze in the air in the exact same pose, and about one out of three times they blink back to where they leapt from. All of the creeps in this game have the same or similar derivative and unfinished feel. A lot of it reminds me of the creatures in the first DOOM. The quests often have fun dialogue, but only in text form. You can see the whole game reeking of potential greatness, but often run flat into disappointment. The environments are very small, but the game tries to make up for it by having the player run around stuck in molasses, and having the camera be a fish-eye lens. I&apos;m giving this a low score because of what was promised, and what was actually delivered. If they had taken more time to make the game live up to its potential, it would have been great, but because it feels like they took shortcuts in delivering the game, then i feel like they lied to me, so instead of a 6 I&apos;m giving the game a 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404598">Expand</a></span>

The true game begins after you advance, Nightmare difficulty is insane and the drops are INSANER! (yeah gfym) I love this game, I gaurantee you the naysayers never did a Mephisto run or a Ball run and therefore will never get this game, ever! A cult classic is born, thank you Flagship.</span>

The game is really as you see in gametrailers.com etc. Suspension, thrills, scares and atmosphere galore!

The release day Patch 0 helped out by improving stability and performance and fixing several bugs, but several major problems remained (including one which could make it impossible to continue the main quest) forcing Flagship to push out a second patch a few days later. And even then there&apos;s still a general feeling that this game is very much a work in progress and probably will be for some time. The first clue that the release was rushed is the fact that the manual that comes in the box is outdated and inaccurate as there were countless changes made to the game between the gold announcement and the actual release (and don&apos;t bother with the official strategy guide, either, as it&apos;s positively obsolete). There is also vital information missing from the manual such as an explanation of the mini-game (the three icons you see in the lower-right of screenshots) and what the big, obvious rating number of weapons actually means (it&apos;s not damage output, as one would naturally assume). Your best best is to ditch the manual and find yourself an up-to-date and comprehensive online guide. But having said all that, I actually do enjoy the game. Despite the innumerable problems, I find myself drawn back time and time again, and I can easily blow several hours at a stretch without really noticing the time going by. If you&apos;re on the fence, take a look at the demo to see if the core gameplay hooks you (bearing in the mind that the demo at the time of this writing is actually a stripped down version of the beta and doesn&apos;t necessarily represent the game&apos;s current state). If it does then you&apos;ll probably enjoy the full game. Here&apos;s hoping Flagship is able to perfect this diamond in the rough. In six-months we could have a bona-fide classic, but now, not so much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404572">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a poor-man&apos;s Diablo 2 (which was released many years ago) and a mix of FPS, RPG, Hack N&apos; Slash which fails to capture any of the genres it mixes well. The only reason I say it&apos;s not a 5 is because some Diablo 2 dreamers may like this game.

After, hopefully, numerous graphical and technical bugs are fixed (that consistently destroy the atmosphere of the game), I may once again give it a try. I was really looking forward to this game to recapture the Diablo experience, but it has not and it has fallen victim to its unattained self-promoting hype. Even if fixed, the game at it&apos;s core will be only a decent dungeon crawler, and not the classic Diablo-like RPG that was promised. The developers may have been from Blizzard at one time, but they forgot that Blizzard&apos;s strength has always been strong game play and uncompromising quality control.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=66903">Expand</a></span>

What where you people expecting ?! This game was develeloped by a major part of the team that made the Diablo series and it never was intended to be anything but a spiritual successor to those games - and unlike certain other games (hello, Bioshock !) it does that job extremely well, despite many flaws. Having played virtually all so-called &quot;diablo-killers&quot; from the last seven years I can safely say that HGL is the ONLY game that lives up to that premise. As far as I&apos;m concerned, the graphics are beautiful - some might not be able to see this as they are blinded by the &quot;zomg-look-at-that-water!!!1112&quot;-SM4.0 fireworks applied by other games, but after all, at least in this case art &gt; technology. The musical score is plainly phantastic, sadly, you rarely get to enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=404781">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First things first: the game really is a blast to play! It&apos;s an Action RPG par excellence made by the makers of Diablo and Diablo II that have left Blizzard and founded Flagship Studios.
<br>The game has 6 classes, each with its own Skill tree and its own pacing. Me and a buddy have played three characters up to lvl 22 (lvl cap in beta), the one was a Blademaster, which is basically the dual-sword-wielding damage dealer, often charging head first into battle. 
<br>Secondly, I played a Marksman which really could be described as a traditional FPS shooter class. You can crauch, you can sniper your enemies or you can specialize in being a rapid-firing, ricocheting damage machine. 
<br>The third one was an Evoker, which is a battle mage having different elemental damage skills at hand. With this one the pacing is hugely different, you always have to keep moving, keeping at least a little distance between you and the hordes of demons that have invaded London in 2038 to drop lots of &quot;phat lewt&quot; just for you!
<br>
<br>Maybe you have read about technical problems occuring during the beta phase, which definitely cannot be denied. There have been bugs and for some days it was quite impossible to play at all, but to me it seems that Flagship studios are doing a great job, since there have been HUGE improvements on both stability and performance in the 4 weeks I have been in the beta.
<br>
<br>So, wisely looking into the future ;) this game earns 10 points, if they won&apos;t be doing any capital mistakes  in the future. It&apos;s just too damn addictive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=66323">Expand</a></span>

<br>
While I like the facade of different play-styles between the classes (hack and slash, FPS, RPG) it&apos;s all really the same when you zoom out and think about it, for better or for worse. I think the most glaring problem was the graphics. 
<br>
Now, graphics don&apos;t make the game, but the presentation I witnessed was rather sad. My hardware can handle Doom 3 at maximum settings with ease, but for some reason this game limited my settings to &quot;medium&quot; (note to designers: limiting player choice on how they can adjust their settings is generally a bad idea, even if you think it&apos;s for their own good). 
<br>
&quot;Medium&quot; doesn&apos;t sound too bad, but even with the maximum settings in this range, the environmental textures were blurry and indistinguishable. The character textures fared slightly better, but more so in the case of the Marksman- the Blademaster was an ugly mess. On that note, the customization features felt somewhat lacking. Some freedom in dress would be appreciated, but I think its the cartoonish faces that really disappoint (although I think it&apos;s interesting that they included a Jude Law lookalike). There&apos;s fun to be had, but I wouldn&apos;t expect graphical entertainment if your system is from the low-to-medium-high range (seriously, I was startled by the limitations).
<br>
<br>The graphics and design seem too dull and are of very poor quality; the nearly 3-year-old Guild Wars far outshines this games in terms of graphics. I have a burning feeling that it&apos;s the unnecessary graphics limitation that really hammers the nail into the graphical coffin.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, it would seem that the looks of the game seemed to be one of the major selling points. If this demo is truly an indication of how it looks and plays, than I&apos;d expect nothing but lower-end mediocrity with the full version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=66369">Expand</a></span>

Unlike some other game creators, FSS has kept its customers &quot;in the loop&quot; regarding what to expect and when to expect it, and while the game itself could still use improvement, based on how I have seen FSS step up to the plate on these issues, I have every confidence that they will bring this game to where it needs to be for online gamers. Not everyone will enjoy this game; no game can claim universal appeal, but the action is fast-paced, the character creation and development is appealing, and the game&apos;s system of random foes, areas, and item generation is addicitive. After a session of play, I don&apos;t leave this game feeling unfulfilled. I also would like to make a suggestion to the administrators of metacritic.com. Because games such as this undergo development continuously after release, it would be immensely helpful to viewers if you would date stamp all reviews. If we look at a lousy review for a game followed by a complimentary one, it would be nice to know when each of these was posted. A damning review over 6 months old is much less valuable to us than one which is only a week old, but on your site, we can&apos;t tell which is which. As you noticed, I included the date of my review at the beginning of my post, but it would be helpful if this were included in your database when the review listing is generated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=407799">Expand</a></span>

<br>After completing normal, the curve into nightmare mode is insane, unreasonably hard, the mobs are over 8 levels higher than you, so you must go back into normal mode and grind 5+ levels to play even in nightmare.
<br>
<br>The game has some fun element, but overall it becomes repetitive and boring.  I killed about a week with this game, and haven&apos;t run it in over a month, if not more. 
<br>
It has potential for sure, but I feel like the initial suckage of the game has condemned them and they may not even make it to the point where the came can live up to what it could be.
<br>
<br>I am not sure if Flagship is to blame for poor development, or EA is to blame for putting pressure to release an incomplete game, so, I am going to blame both. This game did not live up to the hype what-so-ever. If you are looking to throw away 50 dollars, go buy it, have fun for a couple days then quit due to frustration, go for it, though, if you are looking for something to play for a long period of time, this is not it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hellgate-london/user-reviews?user_review_id=68060">Expand</a></span>
