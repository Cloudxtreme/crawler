Thought it might tide me over a bit until Star Citizen is released... it has failed to do so even in the first 2 days.
<br>
<br>I come from the Wing Commander / X-Wing / Tie-Fighter / Freespace 2 ilk. I know what a difficult game is. I used to get so frustrated with X-Wings save game system, where my character&apos;s progression would be permanently lost on a failed mission (and being picked up by the empire), that I used to &quot;backup&quot; my saved game file at the end of each mission to a floppy to keep it safe! The difficulty of those games, introduced some frustration, but when you actually passed the missions, you knew that it was mainly down to your improved skill as a space fighter pilot and it was immensely satisfying. Strike Suit Zero is difficult... stupidly difficult... &quot;I want to chainsaw my PC in two kinda difficult&quot;. When I do eventually pass some of the tougher missions... I don&apos;t feel a sense of progression and achievement... I feel like I just want to get the game over with so I can see the probable disappointing ending and just be done with the game!
<br>
<br>I feel so deflated, as this game really had the potential to be incredible, but ended up falling way short. The graphics are pretty decent, in terms of the ship models at least. The space background &quot;vista&apos;s&quot; are indeed pretty, but they&apos;re absolutely STATIC! I thought that Born Ready Games wanted our KickStarter money to apply all the necessary layers of polish to really make the game shine!? The menu UI feels lacklustre, the HUD elements look tacked on, like some ASCII / ASSEMBLER developer designed them in his spare time. The upgrades are attained by very &quot;arcadey&quot; means... i.e. &quot;Kill x frigates&quot; to get energy upgrade. I don&apos;t think I suck at the game, but I&apos;m on level 10 and I have only achieved 2 of the upgrades so far. I&apos;m beginning to think that the upgrades are essential for later levels, as I&apos;m on mission 10 and hopelessly stuck... having tried it over 10 times! The mission designs are HORRIBLE! They&apos;re BASED on the assumption that you WILL die, and therefore at those check points you will be restored with full health and full missiles to have a better attempt at making it through the mission. What a terribly lazy mechanic for mission progression, either that or I just suck at the game... but I don&apos;t think so, I&apos;m no Luke Skywalker, but I&apos;ve shot my fair share of Womp Rats with my T-16 back home. I simply have no more motivation to continue playing the game. It has beaten me into submission like a cotton-field slave master and I&apos;ve simply had enough...
<br>
<br>Argh... I&apos;m ranting now, I&apos;ll leave it there. Born Ready Games? Strike Suit Zero is more reminiscent of  something stillborn. So much hope and expectation for it&apos;s entry into the world, but unfortunately all it brought with it, is heartache and tears.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2917046">Expand</a></span>

Pros: Pretty visuals (after you manually fix broken files to get the textures working), interesting concept, nice sound track. Cons: Default controls unplayable, control remapping only half works and most cannot be remapped, downloads with broken textures, settings randomly reset themselves to defaults, dry uninteresting voice acting, bland mission objectives are always &quot;kill X of this or Y of that&quot; counters, AI copilots accomplish most objectives for you so there&apos;s no sense of involvement, buggy, unresponsive menus, need I go on? Maybe the game could be good if they did some QA and got it working, but there&apos;s just too much work required to get it in a playable state to have any fun with the monotone voice telling me to kill 20 more identical fighters for the umpteenth time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3448400">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game takes a while to ramp up and is enjoyable-ish at first, to the point that you almost don&apos;t notice it. And then there&apos;s level 10. You and your &quot;wing&quot; are tasked with taking out 4 corvettes and then a squad of fighters. Your &quot;wingmen&quot; go off charting interstellar phenomena and testing how well their ships fly in circles while you do the work. If you survive that, you then get to test those same mad skills against a carrier, that brings along escorts and has at least two banks of plasma cannons fitted with InstantHit(TM) and NeverMiss(TM) technology (pioneered by the equally incompetent devs at LucasArts), regardless of range, your maneuvering, other things to shoot at, or anything else.

<br>These guys are indie because no real game house would hire any of them.

The soundtrack is great and I&apos;ve spent quite the time listening to it.
<br>
<br>But the game itself. There are so many tiny problems in it  that it makes me think that the dev team didn&apos;t even make a test on the gameplay itself because it&apos;s very VERY annoying at times. I&apos;ll try to list some:
<br>
<br>Your allies are incompetent. If you get a mission to destroy a cruiser, your allies are incompetent of making it possible for you to do it. Meaning that there&apos;s a swarm of interceptors flying around you at all times. You cannot target them using the &quot;Target Closest&quot; -keybind because that bind ALLWAYS targets mission objectives first.
<br>
<br>The camera thrashes and crashes around every time you get shot. That means it thrashes and crashes around all the time! If you ask me, it would had been better if your vision wasn&apos;t obstructed by this when you still have any shield left.
<br>
<br>Enemy accuracy is pinpoint. The guys on these railguns sure did play alot of instagib Q3 judging by the way how good shots they are. This doesn&apos;t apply only on capital ship guns but regular enemies as well.
<br>
<br>Line of sight is VERY limited. You can&apos;t see **** The game doesn&apos;t tell you from what direction you are shot at from or who is shooting at you. These small pieces of information would make it much less frustrating. I would also like a small flashing light in the UI if someone is targetting me.
<br>
<br>Checkpoint placing is horrible. There is a mission where you first have to destroy multiple corvettes, then wipe off interceptors, then defend your capital ship from two cruisers and destroy them and THEN go against a huge carrier. This all takes some time and if you die in the last part you gotta do the whole thing again.
<br>
<br>Strike Mode is useful when you need firepower but it&apos;s slow as hell and the dashing doesn&apos;t help you evade anything except missiles. In Strike Mode you can hover still in the air, but in Pursuit Mode you can&apos;t stay put. Ship handling is horrible. Your craft turns as if it was a tank and the enemy craft seem to be alot more agile than you are.
<br>
<br>You are constantly moving forward. You have brakes though but they don&apos;t stop you. I thought it would be possible to turn off your engines and let your craft hover onward while you are targetting something else but no. You are allways moving into the direction you are aming which usually makes destroying stationary objects impossible
<br>
<br>I like the game. The setting, the crafts, the graphics.. It&apos;s just these things that make me lose my mind. I really REALLY want to play this game alot and I do but I allways end up being angry.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: Lots of good ideas but just as many bad parts. I&apos;ve played worse games with higher price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2921568">Expand</a></span>

I am at a loss of words at how much I couldn&apos;t even like this game. And really, I just tried so hard. To be honest, I couldn&apos;t even finish the darn thing. Yes, it is indeed difficult. But I can handle difficulty. It just wasn&apos;t fun. I got to about the 10th mission, died twice and said I was done. This was of course after a long series of deaths and persistence. As previous reviewers mentioned before, I just couldn&apos;t feel that sense of accomplishment. Not to mention it is indeed about 90% escort missions. It&apos;s hard enough killing so many large fleets without having to worry about them shooting at other things besides yourself. The true point of missing game play here is the fact that you&apos;re required to hit so many targets at once, in such a quick manner, and without enough firepower. The strike suit does indeed have capabilities of putting a large number of targets down quickly, if you are skilled. But even with that, I just couldn&apos;t get to the point of being &quot;AWESOME&quot; at this game. No matter what tactics I used, or however many tricks I had up my sleeve, I just couldn&apos;t best this game. The only way I could win was persistence to the end. Trying the same thing over and over a little different each time. It got really old, really fast.
<br>
<br>In the way of graphics I couldn&apos;t say the visuals were stunning. They were about mediocre to me. Perhaps my expectations were high but I just didn&apos;t see what all the fuss is about. On another point people mentioned that the audio was really something. Now I don&apos;t know if we were listening to the same game but I couldn&apos;t handle the audio. The songs were short, looped constantly, and overall rather distasteful. Someone mentioned when you actually get play the strike suit for the first time the music is awesome. I&apos;m not hearing it really. It was one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard in an epic moment like that. So once again, disappointed. And finally the story line is so terribly put together, that I&apos;m not even drawn into it. It has a really bland flavor that feels like a cheap knock off to so many others. There are gaps in the logic of it as well. Especially if you die, some of the death &quot;debrief&quot; messages give away some key points in the game before you even reach that point in the story. Fail.
<br>
<br>Although this game isn&apos;t a total failure, it had some key points that made me say &quot;hey that&apos;s pretty neat.&quot; (which was 90% firepower capability based) But even then, it wasn&apos;t enough to really make me go head over heels with it. It&apos;s my kinda game, my kinda genre, and my kinda style. But I wasn&apos;t amused at all. I hate to be so negative to this game but honestly I can&apos;t say otherwise. If I were given this game for free, I would&apos;ve been disappointed in the end. I really found it that distasteful. I walk away, ashamed, frustrated, and not even the slightest interested in it at all. This game has actually been one of the only games ever that I never even wanted to finish. It&apos;s probably 1 of 2.

When I first installed it I thought great a decent space combat sim (bearing in mind the last decent one I played was X-Wing Alliance). First mission went smoothly, not much going on, getting used to everything... come the 2nd and 3rd missions though, all hell breaks loose. I&apos;ve been through the 3rd mission 7 times now, of those, I&apos;ve died 4 times. This game has great promise, but the controls are really sloppy. When I point at a target I want to shoot there, not 30 degrees up from it. My other gripe is the way the screen more or less blacks out when you come under heavy fire... how are you supposed to get out of it if you cant see what&apos;s happening?
<br>
<br>This is a fun game, but if you want something where you can shoot things and not have to think... look elsewhere. If you do things wrong I find that the game promptly drops a brick on your head and you die... alot....
<br>
<br>Overall, good for a Kickstarter game, but the controls need some serious work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2955672">Expand</a></span>

<br>Chances are that if you enjoyed any of the Ace Combat series or  had fun watching mecha anime, you&apos;ll lap this up. The first thing that will strike you is the graphics; for an indie offering they are excellent and really lend themselves to the game and it&apos;s mechanics. The gameplay is generally good although the difficulty curve will be very sharp for players not used to flight games, but after you clear that initial fence you&apos;ll be having a whale of a time blasting down those darn colonists. The story is the usual objective based bibble, &quot;Save /destroy the X to defeat/save the Y&quot;, but you can forgive it as the game would suffer if it were dialogue heavy
<br>That said the game otherwise is an excellent indie offering that deserves your consideration for being fun, challenging and the only one of it&apos;s kind for long time.

Every mission is a &quot;protect fat idiot&quot; mission, every battle is a cluster*k, visual effects are too bright/dense and are messing with visibility, upgrade system is idiotic (considering how unhandy controls are), inadequate checkpoints.

I&apos;ll tell you now, if you are hoping for something on the level of Freespace 2 (Also there is no open world gameplay, all linear missions, so don&apos;t come here looking for that), Strike Suit Zero comes up far short. The game presents an adequate aesthetic visually and musically, though the voice acting is clearly phoned in, the story is completely generic and forgettable, and missions are repetitive. There is no multiplayer to speak of and the modding tools are yet to be released, through have been promised. The difficulty varies from a complete joke to insanely frustrating. The frustration of the game stems not from the AI being challenging, or even challenging objectives, it comes often from the fact your AI allies are almost always useless,that the enemy has a habit of focusing most of its fire on you (With almost pinpoint accuracy and projectiles that often cause your screen to shake wildly), and your given extremely time limited objectives to kill enemies or protect something at the drop of a hat, with failure resulting in mission failure. You&apos;ll be faced with infinitely spawning enemies that appear just out of your sight but already in range to fire on you, objectives that are far out of range and place you in a position without what little support allies offer, and objectives that your current ship or weapons leave you woefully unprepared for (This isn&apos;t Freespace 2, no detailed tactical briefs before missions, just trial and error). Another issue is that you have such a limited supply of rockets or missiles (No resupply besides a new mission or dying) for certain missions you can&apos;t use them for anything except for objectives that are time sensitive. Of course, you could always die and go back to the checkpoint, for a full refill on ammo and health (Probably because balance and pacing was not tweaked properly so this was the developers answer to make sure you can make progress). Often in cases where the enemies never end, you&apos;ll have access to your Strike Suit, which is pretty much a requirement to even hope to beat such missions. It unfortunately fails to make you feel powerful when you realize you have to use it and it only lets you keep up with the pace of the infinitely spawning enemies, who can still tear you to pieces while in Strike Suit mode. While Strike suit mode sounds cool on paper, this implementation leaves much to be desired. The checkpoint system is also flawed, placing checkpoints far back, often up to a quarter of an hour back in the mission, making the game feel more repetitive. While a fair attempt on the part of the developers, Strike Suit Zero doesn&apos;t present anything that hasn&apos;t been done before and done better by older games. Maybe some patches or DLC can fix some of the issues, but as it stands I would not recommend this game to anyone. Instead, I recommend acquiring a copy of Freespace 2, updating it with the Freespace 2 Source Code Project (Which greatly improves and already great game), and enjoying the rich experience offered by the game and its mods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2916282">Expand</a></span>

There are too many missions in which you need to mop up torpedoes that are once again sailing for your capital ship, and when &quot;Target nearest in front&quot; instead targets the interceptor about 1000 meters behind the torpedo I need to destroy before it hits said ship, I&apos;m not longer failing a mission objective to the game difficulty so much as poor design.  The missions are also very repetitive, as many have mentioned, and I don&apos;t think a difficulty curve should be represented by giving you the same objectives in mission 10 as you were getting in mission 3, but instead dropping an entire fleet with insanely accurate and powerful weaponry into the fray.  It&apos;s very short-sighted design, and it was honestly disappointing.  I wasn&apos;t having much difficulty with the normal objectives, mind you, just some of the special objectives that each mission has.  These are essentially necessary to progress, however, as I&apos;m not sure how you can take on the suped-up ships in the later game without the upgrades.  Again, it seems poorly laid out overall, and I sorely wish the game was more satisfying than some cheaper games I&apos;ve also picked up on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2936380">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t listen to the haters who can&apos;t handle the difficulty curve. The game isn&apos;t buggy, it&apos;s not unpolished, the UI isn&apos;t terrible (in fact, it&apos;s REALLY good!), these people are just spoiled by all the newschool games out there. This game is hard as nails and it harkens back to a time when games were meant to take more than a handful of tries to advance. If you loved Asteroids back in the day, played Descent like a crackhead, and loved spending pockets worth of quarters in the arcade--then this game is a no-brainer purchase for you. If, instead, you like to **** about how hard games are because they don&apos;t tell you where everything is/exactly how to beat the level, then maybe pass this one up and go buy Hello Kitty: Island Adventure or Smurfs &amp; Co. instead. Strike Suit Zero is for gamers who actually want to be challenged by their games. The game has excellent keyboard/mouse controls, superb gamepad support and (my favorite) outstanding joystick support. I&apos;ve been playing this with my Logitech Extreme Force 3D PRO and the experience is awesome. WARNING: The already hard game gets a lot harder when you use a joystick, but for fly-boys of old who aren&apos;t afraid of that, it&apos;s an awesome experience. If you have a Nostromo/n52/n52te keypad to go along with your joystick, then you&apos;re about to have one sick, specialized peripheral romp in space mecha wonderland. 10/10 best $16 I&apos;ve spent in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2923158">Expand</a></span>

How someone can make a transforming space mecha combat game feel dull and repetitive is beyond me. I think I actually enjoyed the space combat sections of Star Wars:The Old Republic more than this,and that is truly damning it with faint praise. Things that made me uninstall the game after 3 hours-
<br>-Narrow Field of Vision,Between 40 and 57 degrees are something I never want to see as my options. 70-80 make the bare comfortable minimum for me. It also makes space combat feel cramped and confusing .
<br>-Awful handling on the ships. The two birds I got to fly in this game both handled like WWII fighters in space, they seem to lack fine maneuverability and the game gives you few options rather than charging head on at a capital ships guns and then the ships poor handling rakes off all your shields as you scrape along the hull.
<br>-Repetitive mission design. Escort this, Go here kill X amount of fighter or turrets, don&apos;t let your ridiculously incompetent squadron mates die. The missions are boring, and most of the time failure is caused by allied AI incompetence.
<br>-Strike Suit Mode, rather than feeling like a powerful and useful transformation turns you into a sitting duck. The only thing I found it truly useful for was rapidly targeting enemy torpedoes to protect a capital ship and taking out clusters of fighters. Both of which feel like mundane baby-sitting level tasks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2917252">Expand</a></span>

A lot of games these days allow for the resolution and the GUI is usually broken, but this game has an option to constrain hud/gui to the center monitor. It supports using an xbox controller, and it&apos;s highly recommended to do so.
<br>
<br>Targetting and weapons loadout is a bit over-simplistic, and the missions are pretty much only destroy and intercept variety. It has great potential for improvement with dlc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2916632">Expand</a></span>

Weapons feel fantastic and youll love the missiles. Favourite  features include the strike suit mode and the targeting system for your main guns.  Very useful system insuring you hit the target instead of spraying wildly into space.</span>

As a avid space simulator fan this have come as a great surprise since i discovered it on kickstarter. The game has a deep atmospheric value and you got to give kudos to the production crew on bringing us such great graphics, sound and fx! The game puts you as a new pilot that somehow will have a major role on a big galactic war, thanks to the awesome strike suite that you can control in some game missions. Oh that ship is awesome, a type of tranformer that can morph into a mech type mode and deliver great destruction at a short period of time. Also the game is quite challengin, but if you get the hang of ship controls mechanic it will be hours of challenging dogfights that this type of game really needs! Awesome game, Awesome graphics and values! Hope we will get lots of product feedback on this game!

Let&apos;s start with controls: Controls are clunky(I&apos;m playing on keyboard&amp;mouse). I&apos;m not talking about adjusting mouse sensibility etc. controls are clunky in general. Also, something that annoyed me to no end is you can&apos;t come to a complete halt with your ship. You just can&apos;t! Developers didn&apos;t added it to the game. Best you can do is slow down from your speed from &quot;fast&quot; to &quot;moderate&quot;. Because of the lack of a full stop feature you will end up crashing you to bigger ships all the time. Turrets also take a long time to destroy(you end up using your whole energy and it might still be intact) and since YOU CAN&apos;T COME TO A FULL STOP you just have to barrage a turret, move away from the ship, return and attack it again. It gets very boring after a while. Ally AI is horrible. They&apos;re barely cannon fodder worthy. You&apos;ll be fighting alone almost all the time. Especially in some missions when you&apos;ll be flying a bomber where ally ai is suppose to cover you, you&apos;ll tear your own hair apart because while the only bomber is under attack from 8 different fighters, ally pilots are doing god knows what. Missions, missions are pretty generic. I bought this game thinking i was getting something similar to the freespace 2. While there are some similarities, overall, game is falling short. Strike suit is not that fascinating. If i could compare a gun to the strike suit, normal mode would be a pistol and strike mode would be burst fire mode. Targeting has similar problems. There is not a key to target someone that&apos;s shooting you. You end up trying to turn around to find him(while moving, yes no full stop) You can target the ship closest to you but the same key is used for choosing mission objective targets so it&apos;s useless when there is a target objective in the map(which is very common). Also, missions are pretty much &quot;go there blow that&quot; and they sometimes add a time limit, that&apos;s it. Missions start&amp;end briefings are a nice touch but they&apos;re not detailed. There is no rearming while you&apos;re in the mission. Main guns lack the power to take down ships in the allocated time to complete objective so you end up using the missiles as a supplement. If you used those missiles for something else, too bad, restart from checkpoint. On the plus side, music is not bad, visuals are good. For 15$ this game is not bad, but approach it knowing its bad sides.  about this game are pretty much true. It&apos;s pretty meh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2922121">Expand</a></span>

It needs a bit of polish and there are some serious difficulty spikes, but once you get a feel for it there is a ton of fun to be had.  For $20 you really cannot go wrong and I hope that going forward they can tune this solid 8.0 into a 10.0</span>

This is in no way a realistic space game, arguably having more in common with side scrolling shoot &apos;em ups than slower paced games in the space genre such as the X-Wing or Wing Commander series.
<br>
<br>If you are in the mood for some fast paced gameplay and feel like giving Strike Suit Zero a try, you&apos;ll be treated to a decently challenging game with excellent visuals and soundtrack. Graphically the game looks excellent whilst it is being played with the action never affecting the performance. The only slight issue I could complain about is that models and textures do look rather low-res when you stop and stare at them. Fortunately you&apos;ll rarely get to do this as the action keeps coming, leaving you to admire the execution of the design rather than the technical aspects of the texturing. Something that is particularly worth mentioning is the ship designs by Junji Okubo, an artist with an increasingly impressive r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, boasting a career of experience working on both anime and video games with a strong base in the mecha genre. The soundtrack is also above par for what I&apos;d expect, particularly from an indie production. This certainly left my eyes and ears sufficiently entertained by the setting, creating an unusually immersive experience for what most people would shrug off as a mindless action game. The plot leaves a little to be desired but is clearly not the main focus of the game. Frankly there isn&apos;t much plot, but what little there is kept me interested enough to want to see what happens next.
<br>
<br>However... This is where the main negative comes in. The game is extremely repetitive. Remember Those great visuals and soundtrack I just mentioned? Well you&apos;d better get used to them. By the fourth mission (out of 12) you&apos;ll have already seen or heard most of it. This would be a problem if SSZ were a higher budget game created by a larger team, but under the circumstances I think the repetitive nature of this game is something that should be forgiven. Born Ready Games only have one game under their belt, this one, and a relatively small team which has been funded largely through kickstarter.
<br>
<br>One major negative that I found was that the beginning missions were paced rather poorly for my tastes. Despite the name of the game you only obtain the strike suit after completing a few missions, effectively leaving out several important game mechanics for a significant chunk of a first time playthrough. This is fixed when you replay missions, being able to select and fighter available to you but I still found that it made the first 3-4 missions a bit of a chore. I found my enjoyment to increase exponentially after obtaining the strike suit and getting used to the devil-trigger like power up system having access to the suit provides. In fact a lot of the replayability comes from returning to missions to try and up the rank you received, with your average ranking across all missions even having a small effect on the ending of the game.
<br>
<br>Another low point for other people has been the difficulty level, with other people citing bad A.I and frustrating escort missions. I can see how this might be a problem, but I never suffered from it.. Generally I breezed through the missions on the first pass without even using the checkpoint system, however this is very much from the perspective of a core gamer. Despite the fact I had no problems with it, if you were thinking about purchasing SSZ the issues with the &quot;frustrating&quot; difficulty could be something to bear in mind if that is a deal breaker for you personally.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say Strike Suit Zero is easily worth a look if you are interested in a simple space shooter game with a ridiculous amount of action but not much else. If you are unsure or put off by the issues other reviewers have mentioned then it might be best waiting for it to go on sale, making a fairly cheap game even cheaper still. I can only give this game an 8 based mainly upon the technical aspects, which despite being generally excellent tend to be very repetitive. However if I were to rate the game based on the amount of fun that I had while playing it, I&apos;d bump it up to a 9. For the 6-8 hours it took me to complete the main campaign with scores to my satisfaction I can&apos;t say I was bored or frustrated more than a couple of times, something that in my experience has happened much more frequently in most games (including many AAA releases).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3198772">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have first hand experience with this game on the Oculus rift and its spectacular, mind boggling, unbelievable, immersive and unprecedented fun!
<br>It&apos;s easy to get your hands dirty in this game and yes there are spikes of difficulty but who gives a monkeys? Games are not meant to be mindless easy things that any brain dead chimp can complete at the drop of his top hat and monocle. Welcome to something that can only be classed as ground breaking good fun!
<br>
<br>The staff on support were hands down excellent when I was having some issues with my trip screens and flight sim controller, this was a definite plus considering getting info out of most developers support is like getting blood from a stone.
<br>
<br>I say go Indies go! Screw the AAA titles its the same old rubbish being recycled for the mindless drones out there who have no imagination or taste in terms of games. This is an indie dev that has shown us something enjoyable and fun. They should be given a good old pat on the back and commended for such an excellent contribution.

I liked Starfighter. I don&apos;t like this game. Firstly, the reviews make it out to be a lot more action-mech oriented than it is. It&apos;s a dogfighter. Second, the concept art makes it seem like you&apos;ll be a guy in a robot suit fighting a bunch of ships. You only get to be the suit for short bursts, and when you&apos;re in suit mode, you&apos;re frozen in place. Third, tons more stuff is just done wrong. Explosions look boring, the camera gets unstable when shot, even worse when there&apos;s lots going on, there&apos;s a ridiculous lag problem, all ships except the suit are always moving forward, which has killed me at least once after I&apos;d completed a mission and was just waiting for my allies (who don&apos;t help with anything and can&apos;t be commanded to handle a specific task, like covering you or protecting an allied cruiser) to stop talking so the victory cutscene would play. My skippy little spaceship crashed into some stationary debris  because there&apos;s no brakes. Furthermore, I don&apos;t know what everyone else is talking about, but on my end, the soundtrack was horrible. All I heard was some feminine warbling. No pumping, John Williams-esque trumpets and strings like I expected. Just warbling. All in all, this was a severely disappointing game, and I feel extremely sorry for anyone who falls for the ruse the devs are putting up with their misleading art and description. They should be ashamed of themselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3510880">Expand</a></span>

The combat is very clear and the controls are smooth. The graphics are just stunning. To think this game from a small studio is shocking. The game is fantastic and I recommend it to everyone into the space sims type of game.</span>

Let&apos;s start with controls: Controls are clunky(I&apos;m playing on keyboard&amp;mouse). I&apos;m not talking about adjusting mouse sensibility etc. controls are clunky in general. Also, something that annoyed me to no end is you can&apos;t come to a complete halt with your ship. You just can&apos;t! Developers didn&apos;t added it to the game. Best you can do is slow down from your speed from &quot;fast&quot; to &quot;moderate&quot;. Because of the lack of a full stop feature you will end up crashing you to bigger ships all the time. Turrets also take a long time to destroy(you end up using your whole energy and it might still be intact) and since YOU CAN&apos;T COME TO A FULL STOP you just have to barrage a turret, move away from the ship, return and attack it again. It gets very boring after a while. Ally AI is horrible. They&apos;re barely cannon fodder worthy. You&apos;ll be fighting alone almost all the time. Especially in some missions when you&apos;ll be flying a bomber where ally ai is suppose to cover you, you&apos;ll tear your own hair apart because while the only bomber is under attack from 8 different fighters, ally pilots are doing god knows what. Missions, missions are pretty generic. I bought this game thinking i was getting something similar to the freespace 2. While there are some similarities, overall, game is falling short. Strike suit is not that fascinating. If i could compare a gun to the strike suit, normal mode would be a pistol and strike mode would be burst fire mode.  Targeting has similar problems. There is not a key to target someone that&apos;s shooting you. You end up trying to turn around to find him(while moving, yes no full stop) You can target the ship closest to you but the same key is used for choosing mission objective targets so it&apos;s useless when there is a target objective in the map(which is very common). Also, missions are pretty much &quot;go there blow that&quot; and they sometimes add a time limit, that&apos;s it. Missions start&amp;end briefings are a nice touch but they&apos;re not detailed. There is no rearming while you&apos;re in the mission. Main guns lack the power to take down ships in the allocated time to complete objective so you end up using the missiles as a supplement. If you used those missiles for something else, too bad, restart from checkpoint. On the plus side, music is not bad, visuals are good. For 15$ this game is not bad, but approach it knowing its bad sides.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2916309">Expand</a></span>

The negative aspects that I feel are somewhat justified are that the missions are a bit too long and it can be a difficult game at times, but I feel like in Dark Souls that kind of difficulty is what makes this game good in a way. If it was any easier I think people would be crying its too easy, and you can replay the missions with different types of ships so if you want to increase difficulty you could always use a less powerful ship and in turn it would make the mission more difficult. Now having said the negative aspects, I think we can all agree the game looks absolutely gorgeous! It has amazing graphics and I really, really enjoy the game play. I think one of the most accurate video reviews was the one made by Gamespot and how they said it can be somewhat slow until you get your Strike-suit but then it goes full speed and never looks back, I would totally agree with that assessment and would go as far to say the slowness at the beginning is required for learning to play it well. I also think it has a pretty great story line, but maybe that&apos;s just me. I have really missed the good games this genre had been putting out in the past like Wing Commander and if you ever liked any of the Wing Commander-like games then I think you will love this game. I can truly say I am glad I bought this game and will enjoy playing it for many days to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2923303">Expand</a></span>

But it was extremely addicting. There are some &quot;certain missions&quot; (not going to spoil it) that really punish you for not having skill. However, after playing for a week, I finally got the hang of it. I don&apos;t want to brag, but I can proudly say I have unlocked all the upgrades and medals. The checkpoints don&apos;t seem to bother me much anymore.
<br>
<br>So for a casual gamer, this game is extremely difficult and confusing. But if you have the time (in my case, I no-lifed the game), in the long run, you&apos;ll enjoy it a lot.
<br>
<br>Plus, the setting is gorgeous. Unlike most space games, the background isn&apos;t just simply black, stars, the sun, and the occasional planet. No, it is vivid beauty  asteroid fields, nebulas, asteroid fields in nebulas, exotic planets, destroyed planets, etc., and the backdrop isn&apos;t black. Sometimes it&apos;s a neon dark blue, orange, silvery-blue,sometimes with space clouds that glow. Plus, the background is one enormous gif. The developers seem to put stories in the backgrounds. But I&apos;m not going to spoil that for you, you have to see it yourself to find out.
<br>
<br>For those complaining about the brightness, sensitivity, and controls, may I suggest simply going to the menu and changing the settings and keybinds to your preference?
<br>
<br>If I&apos;m not mistaken, this game was developed here in the U.S.? Well I bet it&apos;s making the Japanese jealous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3163504">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I love this game, Is a best space combat simulator in years.   The first missions not reflect the game&apos;s Vertigo and fast attacks. Search and destroy options.  If you buy the DLC &quot;raptor&quot;.
<br>if you buy &quot;raptor&quot; see new opportunities to destroy your enemies.
<br>&#xA0;&#xA0; Strike Suit infinity (expansion) is the best of this game.
<br>Enjoy and don&#xB4;t listen the bads critics, and test for yourself this game</span>

<br>I&apos;ve been playing with an xbox controller and the controls feel easy and intuitive. The graphics are nice and the overall feel of the game captures the mood they are trying to push. Dog fighting in space is as fun as it sounds.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, they are going to support the Oculus Rift, which will be more than I could have ever dreamed for.

The game&apos;s graphics are incredible. Fighters flit about with glowing contrails, lasers light up the sky, and massive capital ships fill your entire screen. The soundtrack is also excellent. It&apos;s extremely reminiscent of Relic&apos;s Homeworld games (by design, I&apos;m sure). The overall effect is very immersive.
<br>
<br>On the down side, the difficulty is very uneven. Some segments (especially escort missions) are almost impossible, while others are a cakewalk. Also, the flight mechanics feel a little loose. You&apos;ll spend much of the game with your thrusters on full reverse, trying like hell to remain stationary so you can shoot straight. At least so far, I&apos;ve found enemy fighters aren&apos;t much of a threat to me. There&apos;s less need to dodge and weave than in some other space sims. Honestly, I&apos;ve died more due to collisions than to enemy fire. The collisions are a killer, especially when you find yourself transitioning from strike to fighter modes. This can rocket you into obstacles with little warning.
<br>
<br>All in all, I definitely recommend you pick up a copy. It&apos;s not an overly long game, and it&apos;s a great trip down memory lane for all the space sim veterans out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3381317">Expand</a></span>

Simply said, Strike Suit Zero is too simple. Other than for a single combat gimmick its gameplay is far below the heights achieved by the genre in games like freespace or the X series. While this can be partially attributed to its indie origins and a substantial difference in budget, it doesn&apos;t excuse the level of monotony encountered throughout the game. Monotony of combat, characterized by few, ever identical ships and, what is most glaring, monotony of narration, which is shallow enough that its total absence would have probably gotten a higher score from me. Add an uneven difficulty curve and a few design mistakes and an otherwise acceptable shooter becomes a trite waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942009">Expand</a></span>

It reminded me very strongly of several space games I had played over the years, most strongly the combat of Freelancer. The game&apos;s presentation is tight, with good visual effects and atmospheric sound design, but is plagued by poor optimization, resulting in increasingly intolerable frame stutter and worse, the video lagging behind my button inputs. In addition, over the course of only a handful of missions in the game total, the difficulty quickly spirals out of hand. The titular Strike Suit is difficult to employ properly, and oftentimes I found myself unable to take full advantage of its multi-target locking missiles. It is not unmanageable for the player to take down numerically superior enemy fighter groups, but multiple times the player is expected to protect flimsy friendly targets, some of which can be destroyed in seconds by withering hails of fire from the aforementioned enemies. If you hate escort missions as much as the average gamer does, as I do, Strike Suit Zero is liable to make you pop a blood vessel. I would be willing to forgive that, since I love space games that much- but here&apos;s where things get ugly. The frame stutter ultimately resulted in my being unable to finish the final level, and that&apos;s why I give this game a thumbs down. I was unable to finish Megabyte Punch simply because I wasn&apos;t good enough at the game, and that&apos;s not enough reason for me to dislike it, but the technical problems foisted on me by SSZ are simply unacceptable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507842">Expand</a></span>

The titular Strike Suit is an absolute joy to fly once mastered, but the somewhat-slippery handling while in Fighter Mode and brutally challenging missions mean you need to be perfect, which isn&apos;t going to happen. The story is nothing worth writing home about, just your generic &quot;War between nations... IN SPACE&quot; story with uninteresting characters with meh voice acting. Mission objectives are tired and some missions drag on past the point where they stop being fun
<br>
<br>However, what the game does wrong with it&apos;s story, it more than makes up for it in style. Strike Suit Zero is home to some of the best visual design I&apos;ve seen in ages. The backdrops are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, and Paul Ruskay&apos;s soundtrack (of Homeworld fame) is stellar. Vocals by KOKIA really add to the feel that you are playing the game equivalent of a 80&apos;s giant robot series.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, Strike Suit Zero is too flawed to reccomend for everyone, much as I&apos;d love to. When everything is firing on all cylinders, the game is one of the best space combat experiences I&apos;ve had in a while. But those moments are fleeting in a game bogged down by long, lackluster missions and slippery controls. It&apos;s not something everyone will love, but if the idea of hopping into a robot dogfighter appeals then I&apos;d definitely check out Strike Suit Zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3665622">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I feel like I want to defend the game against all of the critical reviews.  Wing Commander, X-wing, Tie-Fighter, Freespace, were all big studio titles.  This is not a big studio title and people really should not expect it to have the same scope.  It has clear goals which are obviously limited by budget, and it executes them well.  People cannot demand more from an indie title.
<br>
<br>The game is difficult.  However, it requires multitasking and each time you fail you get better at the game, and you can revisit each mission to improve upon your score.  There are also further ships to unlock.
<br>
<br>The game is fast, loads of fun and well worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3863385">Expand</a></span>

Indeed, SSZ seems to borrow many elements from Tachyon, including most of the mechanics, feel, and weapons. The graphics in the game are a bit underwhelming, looking more like a game from the late 00s, rather than the 2010s. Still, for an independent title that was funded through Kickstarter, SSZ is definitely worth your time. The main draw of the game--the mech transformation--is actually the least fun, in my opinion. I greatly prefer the starfighter mode to the mech mode. But, if you are looking for a no-frills space shooter that calls to mind the golden age of the genre, then this game is certainly worth that money, especially if you can get it on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=3864019">Expand</a></span>

Whoever did the game balance doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing. Maybe they used to make board games? I&apos;m not sure. But the regular ship takes forever to build up one volley of shots. This means taking out 20 fighters (a common objective in the first 3 missions) can take about 20 minutes. Why would they do that? Restrictions are fun! Let&apos;s restrict everything!
<br>
<br>Like the Strike Suit. You&apos;d think, &quot;okay, cool robot form that&apos;s even in the game title: Of course you should be able to change that whenever you like, right?&quot; Wrong. You have to destroy debris and enemy fighters to &apos;power it&apos;. How does that even make sense? Shooting in the Strike Suit turns into Motion Blurr City, which is extremely laggy. There&apos;s also no lead targets in Strike Suit mode, so good luck hitting anything with primary fire. The suit itself seems terribly underwhelming. Its best attack when you first get it is a volley of missiles. Not very exiting, and doesn&apos;t make you feel powerful.
<br>
<br>The game was advertised when it came out as if this was a successor to the Zone of the Enders series. No. Its just a cheap powerup gimmick in a space sim with a standard engine (think Star Wars: Star Fighter on the PS2, but not as easy to control or as intuitive). The balance is abismal. The story seems interesting, but every time you think a level is going to end you get &quot;wait, we&apos;ve got 50 more fighters inbound&quot; and it just makes me sigh. I gave up after 10 minutes of the Strike Suit being seeming utterly useless and unable to kill even one turret on an enemy frigate.
<br>
<br>Maybe I&apos;ll come back to it one day and find out something I missed, but man does this game make me want to cry. I love Gundam and Zone of the Enders stuff, but this is such a poor attempt at copying those games. I feel like the design team got the wing suit idea dumped on them at the last minute while they were making a space sim. They still managed to mess up both aspects of design.

<br>It wasn&apos;t a bad game per se just not very good, it lacked something that would make me think this product is special and deserves higher score.

Seeing it on sale at Steam was the final nudge I needed to pull the trigger and I can now say it is actually cooler than it looks. I&#x2019;m sorry I waited so long to pick up this title.
<br>
<br>SSZ will appeal to anyone who was a fan of games like Rogue Squadron or Colony Wars on the PS One. It&#x2019;s not quite up to level of depth that X-Wing or Wing Commander had since this is more arcade shooter than simulation. If you liked those games, though, I&#x2019;d still recommend SSZ since the whole space dogfighting genre seems dead and you won&#x2019;t find better nowadays. SSZ has fluid and intense gameplay with great graphics &amp; music. Voice acting is spotty but not bad.
<br>
<br>The controls may take a little getting used to but once you master them you&#x2019;ll feel like a boss in the titular Strike Suit. Spamming your swam missiles has a very Robotech/Macross feel and never gets old. I played this with a Xbox 360 controller for PC and found the controls very tight &amp; responsive. No idea what happened to some other reviewers who say the controls are clunky. They may be trying to play with keyboard &amp; mouse but I learned long ago rule #1 of space shooter games is to bring a joystick or gamepad.
<br>
<br>The missions have a nice variety and are thrilling to play through. The narrative is pretty solid, too, and keeps you interested in moving along. You get scored on each sortie and can also unlock a particular upgrade if certain optional goals are met. Once you beat a mission, you can replay it using any new fighter craft or weapons you&#x2019;ve unlocked. Some people complain the missions get repetitive and are impossibly hard. I didn&#x2019;t find them repetitive and they may be too hard if you don&#x2019;t get any ship upgrades. I&#x2019;ll admit I went back &amp; switched the difficulty to easy mode to pick up a few, which is an option for anyone who thinks it&#x2019;s too hard.
<br>
<br>Best of all, there are checkpoints inserted into the sometimes lengthy missions. This is a welcome feature since you don&#x2019;t have to keep replaying the same thirty minutes of a mission over &amp; over again when only the last five minutes are giving you trouble. Checkpoints are frequently placed right at those optional parts required to unlock upgrades which again is very nice since, if you miss the optional goal, you do not have to start the entire mission again from the beginning.
<br>
<br>SSZ isn&#x2019;t a perfect game but some reviewers are going overboard on their criticism of it. This space &amp; sci-fi combat genre is one I miss a lot and I&#x2019;ve had a blast playing this game. If you are a fan of any of the titles I mentioned above, you should definitely pick it up. It feels like a blast from the past &amp; a new experience at the same time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=4018835">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would have liked more a &quot;short&quot; game with easy (read not-that-hard) missions and a better story, with the possibility to replay those missions in hard/maniac difficulty to get my challenge and my many deaths.
<br>
<br>So, would I recommend this game? Probably yes, because it&apos;s indie, graphics and music are good, there&apos;s linux/mac support and overall it&apos;s fun, but 20$ is definitely too much, this game at full price should have been 15ish or even less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=5708125">Expand</a></span>
