Very short base story as well. But none of these even pauses it from being fun, replay in different modes , to get unique maps, Overall a well packaged product worth every penny you pay for it</span>

<br>Imagine X-com meets splinter cell (sort of).
<br>Really quite fun . A solid challenge (hard is not for the faint hearted)  and endlessly re-playable.
<br>If you are stuck for a small game to play between big AAA titles then I would highly recommend it.</span>

Literally the only downside to this game is the length. 72 hours gives you approx 9 missions based on my own experience, which feels a tad short. Since this game throws itself into the roguelike mix, i would have hoped for a longer experience. This didn&apos;t need the length of X-Com or Sword of the Stars: The Pit, but i wish it could have followed on with the ending twist. Luckily it appears to have good replayability.
<br>
<br>Also a surprisingly good lunchtime game. Individual mission play length runs about 5-15 minutes based on difficulty rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5246728">Expand</a></span>

<br>The stealth in this game is awesome fun and I never would have imagined that a turn based game would have such awesome stealth. The game frequently makes my heart race. Depending on which agents you use and which implants  weapons and upgrades you get you will want to handle different situations differently which means there is a lot of replayability.
<br>Customisable difficulty and game modes also really add to the replay value. There are 3 base difficulties and two extra game modes and a super ruthless difficulty (expert+). Endless for people who don&apos;t like things ending and time attack to really put the pressure on by timing your turns. Perhaps the best aspect of this though is the fact you can tweak your difficulty with a myriad of different options.
<br>When I play this game I feel like I have literally nothing to complain about. Its just pure heart attack inducing roguelike fun.

It is a lot tougher to beat than its simplistic look might suggest. What looks at first glance like some simple IOS title for - well.. IOS title players - turns out to be quite a hardcore turn-based strategy game that is uncommonly unforgiving.

Currently have 45 or so hours clocked in the game, which is actually the second highest playtime of any game in my Steam library! It&apos;s also one of the most addictive games I have played in recent memory that keeps drawing you back for more. Those 45 hours were played in under 10 days.
<br>
<br>Anyways, the gist of the game is that it is a punishing &quot;rogue-lite&quot; turn-based strategy game, with a heavy emphasis on stealth. It draws inspiration from XCOM Enemy Unknown and has got similar interface, but the core tactical gameplay is very different.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s campaign can be completed pretty quickly (on your first try on Beginner, you should do it in under 4 hours), but this game has been thoroughly designed with increasing difficulty levels in mind. From Beginner to Experienced, and then to Expert, you should get three complete runs at least, each offering a unique playing experience. Also, you will die a lot, particularly when you get to expert, so the game makes you learn from your mistakes to improve future runs.
<br>
<br>I myself played the game on Beginner first, then after 15 or so tries I got through Expert, after which I played Expert Ironman and finally completed Endless 5/10 days in the same run.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s levels are always randomly generated. Initially, I didn&apos;t like this, cause sometimes you can be dealt an unfair hand and the level generated could be extremely difficult to traverse. But eventually, over time, you learn to deal with it.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s an element of risk vs reward. Do you go slow, at the expense of your alarm tracker increasing quickly...or do you go faster, at the expense of being spotted by the enemy?
<br>
<br>Even though I&apos;ve played for 45 odd hours, there are so many unique combinations of augments, programs, items and weapons that the game has got an incredible room for experimentation. Since all of these are randomly obtained or bought along the way, you always have to adapt your playstyle, and as such, the game doesn&apos;t become boring or repetitive.
<br>
<br>There are 4 different enemy corporations, each of them having a different unique threat, so that adds to keep the game fresh as well. There&apos;s also around 7 or 8 different mission types, and you have to make your choices count on which mission type to select, based on your needs.
<br>
<br>When I played the game on Beginner at first, I liked it. Then moving on to Expert, I found it too frustrating to the point I was almost going to stop playing. However, once I cleared that hurdle and moved on to Ironman and Endless runs, I have grown to absolutely love the game.
<br>
<br>Recommended if you like turb-based strategy like XCOM, and/or if you like stealth games, and/or if you like challenging games that punish and make you learn from your mistakes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5370837">Expand</a></span>

The entire campaign took me about 6 hours, but the difficulty level can be scaled very well, to create adequate challenge.
<br>I liked the permanent death, and that the guards - once on high alert - will not lose your trail, or wander off after you knocked them out. They will keep tracking your agents, by taking random detours, so they will surprise you. Combine that, with no saves, and you got a challenge on your hands.
<br>Bottom line: the game promises a turn-based stealth-game, and it delivers one. It is always clear, what line of sight guards, cameras, or robots have, or where can you advance, what will result in failure - but due to the randomized map and high-alert status of guards, with an ever-increasing alert level, it still gives good value for your money. As a turn-based tactics fan, I was very pleased.
<br>Also there is a good character rotation, somewhat varied skills, Shadow run rip-off augmentations and weapons to give a second run some new flavour.
<br>
<br>But the game falls somewhat short in other areas.  Production value is low: short, repetitive soundtrack, and very few dubing for characters. Missions seemed to be very much alike: you enter building, search for some console, hack it - or a guy&apos;s memory-chip, and flee. I would have liked some variations, like finding different consoles, or bugging a room somewhere, following people - just some new flavour, but it never happened. The graphics are not much, but it is very stylish, so it is pleasing. What is not, is the short campaign. It is more like a prequel, or an episode one - as it has no main enemy, but it sets one up - very off-handed, without any real build-up, or weight behind it. It ended, right when it became interesting, after like 8-9 missions. Expect dlc-s to arrive shortly, I guess...
<br>
<br>In it&apos;s current form, it is not an excellent game - but a solid, above average one, with the potential of expanding significantly in the future. If you like stealth or turn-based games, give it a try.

<br>Pros:
<br>-the graphics while not the best are unique and the art style is top notch
<br>-i like how you can play with 2 characters at the same time. so one might get caught while the other one can complete the objective. it is inovative and fun. But lets get to the cons
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-it forces you to be stealthy. i know its a stealth game but a choice would have been nice
<br>-i hate the turn based combat and this game has a lot of that. But at the end its not enough to discourage me from playing it
<br>
<br>Overall this is a good stealth game. its not mark of the ninja perfect but its not bad. I give it an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5288201">Expand</a></span>

But somehow, it just doesn&apos;t feel right to me. Even in the beginning on beginner difficulty, you have barely time to scout the area before additional cameras fire up, you have to repeatedly hack drones while you barely get any power after each turn, have to spend credits on both attributes and upgrades. Upgrades which get thrown at you in masses (at time literally more than you can carry) but mostly seem useless to me. Things I&apos;d really find useful like more power per turn, having enemies stay KO for longer, extend wireless hacking range and so on I haven&apos;t seen so far.  I gave it a shot twice but I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s no use. I also find it interesting that I had the exact same experience with Shank and Don&apos;t Starve, two other critically acclaimed Klei games. The only Klei game I really loved and played through twice was Mark of the Ninja, oddly enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5465426">Expand</a></span>

You have new agents to unlock, gear for them to look for and buy, as well as a hacking AI you can also upgrade, and which you need to bypass building security and other objects you find while on mission. The levels are randomly generated which gives you quite a lot of replay value. The actual stealth mechanic is very well implemented and it is possible to avoid detection to a remarkable degree, once you learn to trust it. The more invisible you manage to be the longer you can stay on a mission and the more loot you can collect. And sneaking around is great fun as we all know.
<br>
<br>All in all another highly polished title from Klei who once again get the gameplay just right, as they did with Mark of the Ninja. It is a bit on the short side, with the campaign ending after 72 hours; meaning that you will have to finish gearing up etc within ca. 6-8 missions, depending on travel times. The narration manages to be both sparse and slightly annoying by repeating itself every time you restart, which will probably be quite often if you play on the harder difficulties. This is the same problem of roguelike games vs narrative text that plagues Sunless Sea, although it`s not quite as bad here. A volume control for the narration voice might have been nice though.
<br>
<br>Other than these two slight criticisms Invisible Inc. is a great little title, and quite possibly the best (Or the only?) squad based tactical stealth game in existence. So if stealth is your thing and you like tactical turn based action then this game is certainly worth a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5280432">Expand</a></span>

Therefore each mission and each campaign is different, adding to this game a high replayability. You can set the difficulty of the campaign controlling each aspect: number of rooms per mission, number of guards, etc.
<br>I like the way you interact with the enviroment, the aesthetics,  the habilities of each agent, the use of gadgets, very important at the end of the game, and the strategy to overcome the different missions.
<br>If you like short-time strategy high quality games, like FTL, this game can be interesting for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5324047">Expand</a></span>

This choice largely came down to personal taste but, then again, that is how we grade most games anyway. Simply put, I found the artwork and atmosphere to be unbearably childish and naive. It&apos;s not that I dislike cartoonish style as such. But Invisible Inc was just too &quot;Disney&quot; for me. Together with a lack of a good storyline noted by many other reviewers, the game just did not have the backbone to make it worth my time (making it different from something like Militia which never tries to be anything more than what it is). The strategic mechanics, while fun for the first few missions, failed to make up for complete lack of immersion in the game world. For those who remember the oldies, a similar criticism on style could be leveled against  the change that took place between X-Com Terror From the Deep and Apocalypse. Yet the incredibly immersive mechanics of Apocalypse, together with a strong story, helped one look past the catastrophic choice of color scheme (and I admit having completed it countless times on different difficulty settings). The strategic side of Invisible Inc pales in comparison and there is thus little to make up for its lack of style and storyline. Today, I would pick up something like Frozen Synapse over Invisible Inc any day. It is too bad since I really, really wanted to like this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=6720309">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think the game truly shines by the way it manages tension. During a mission, even if you can crawl and hack your way discretely to your objectives, the alarm level still rises and you&apos;re only a turn away from a very stressed situation where guards surrounds you and make you sweat like hell.  In between mission, since you have a time limit, you&apos;ll have to make tough choices between gaining access to facilities, acquiring money, items or improving your agents.
<br>
<br>Depth and replay value comes from the procedural map generation and the multiple improvements for your agents (skills, augments, items) or your IA (programs),
<br>
<br>The art direction is excellent and really contributes to the game&apos;s readability (an important feature since you have to monitor multiple agents, sometimes in different places, and also the Incognita network).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=6523967">Expand</a></span>

In short, if you&apos;re expecting a well-pieced together story, you won&apos;t find it here, but if you&apos;re after a rogue-like turn-based dungeon crawler, then this game will be right up your alley.
<br>
<br>The presentation is probably the game&apos;s biggest strength. It&apos;s put together well in shiny visuals, clean UI, and a fun gameplay concept that takes isometric turn-based combat and makes it stealth-oriented, where you&apos;re better off avoiding the enemies rather than engaging in fights. The game is fun, if you enjoy turn-based tactics that let you plan your every ally&apos;s move.
<br>
<br>The gameplay concept is solid, but some of its execution was a fair bit annoying to me personally. A lot of the challenge presented felt simply artificial and unfair. The raising security level each and every turn forces you to rush each mission. Exploration is simply not rewarded under this system, because the longer you stay on your mission, the more security measures will be added after every few turns, which will eventually put you in a tight spot. I never came across any way for me to freeze or reduce the security level. It&apos;s just a rush against time, but on turn-based basis.
<br>
<br>I was also not fond of the fact that I couldn&apos;t buy any equipment for my party in between missions. The only time I could do it was if I happened to find an automated shop during missions, when I had virtually no money to spend. Of 4 agents I had in my missions, 2 were running about without weapons and just being used to sit on the guards. This brings me to another annoyance. If you don&apos;t have a weapon, you have no way to deal with the guards. No idea what sort of agents these are who can&apos;t even take out a guard from behind unless they have a tazer. Things start to get more complex when you meet enemies in armour, who are invulnerable to most weapons, and your only chance is to play a cat and mouse game where you&apos;re constantly running away.
<br>
<br>But, I really did like being able to improve my agents in between missions by upgrading their stats, even if stats themselves did feel a bit unbalanced. Speed felt like the most useful stat by far, since it gave you more action points, with hacking being a close second, since everything requires hacking. But strength and anarchy felt next to useless. Strength only lets you carry more items, and anarchy makes you steal slightly more money from the guards.
<br>
<br>And lastly the story, well, it was mostly on the background. The most of it you&apos;ll see is in the opening and ending cutscenes. But the rest of the game you&apos;re just dungeon-crawling really. It was pretty neat to get to pick which mission to do from a wide selection. It&apos;s very non-linear and each mission simply increases your assets - either you rescue an extra agent to add to the team, or you find some new shiny gear to use. Though because of that, it also meant that there were no story-related reasons to do any mission. You could expect the same approach in each one and merely doing as many as you can to pass 72 hours in-game before having to do the final one with what you&apos;ve got.
<br>
<br>I was also hoping there&apos;d be some more character development. All the agents in your team were just mute puppets for you to control. They never showed any personality or had anything to say aside from a witty one-liner at the start of each mission.
<br>
<br>Having said this, if you are a dungeon-crawl fanatic and like challenge, you should enjoy this game very much. It has higher difficulty modes, as well as an endless mode too where you have to survive for as long as you can. Overall, it&apos;s a worthy game to try and I have had my fair share of fun with it, even though the main campaign is rather on the short side.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5370170">Expand</a></span>

<br>In detail:
<br>Invisible Inc. is a turn-based, grid-based stealth tactical espionage game which has inspirations from XCOM Enemy Unknown and F.T.L. Gameplay is divided between the world map, where you manage your agents and equipment and choose between the different available missions, and inside the missions themselves, where you control your agents in a similar fashion to XCOM EU.
<br>
<br>Stealth is key, since guards will shoot you if they see you. There are, though, deep and diverse mechanics that make it possible to have different tools and approaches allowing you to dance unnoticed around or divert/kite guards, infiltrate where you need to or even use lethal tactics if necessary, although you should use them as a last resort. Your agents move in an AP point system, you&#x2019;ll constantly be planning how to move, taking care to notice guards&#x2019; movements for the next turn, in order to better place your agents. You can engage sprint in the beginning of the turn to get more AP should you want to risk making more noise&#x2026; Moving around guards unnoticed is best, but you can and will be knocking guards unconscious to make progress. You can even grab and move their bodies across rooms, only they will wake up (more alert) after a few turns if no agent is pinning them to the ground. Other than your agents you have your AI available to you, which uses power you drain from on-site consoles to execute programs in order to break firewalls on other devices such as cameras, security gates, turrets, safes, mainframes, that will allow you to access them. Power is a limited resource, however, so you&#x2019;ll need to plan its use carefully as well. Also each 5 turns the alarm level goes higher introducing some new measure by security: a new guard may spawn, firewalls on enemy devices may increase, previously disabled devices can be rebooted, and even daemons (enemy software) may be implemented. Whatever way you look at it, it&#x2019;s a race against time, and either rushing or extending your stay will make it much more likely to be detected, and a full alert will make it virtually impossible for you to complete your objectives or even exfiltrate your agents alive.
<br>
<br>All this makes for a tense, suspenseful and exciting strategic turn-by-turn gameplay. Will you risk overstaying your welcome to fully explore your surroundings, possibly getting more of the precious loot? It&#x2019;s always on your mind, especially since more loot, be it more credits or finding items, software, gear or augments, will allow you enchance your agents&#x2019; capabilities and since you can also level up your agents&#x2019; attributes with credits.
<br>
<br>The procedural generation is spot on, I could never rely on previous map knowledge, I always had to access the situation I was currently in. And never did I encounter a situation where the level was unbeatable due to bad placement or impossible patrol routines. It&#x2019;s always of question of not getting yourself into too difficult missions if you are not ready (with better gear or software, leveled-up agents, etc), and solving your current puzzle.
<br>
<br>The game is challenging, but it you can tailor the difficulty with the different levels, in particular with regards to the number of &#x201C;rewinds&#x201D; to the previous turn you have. I found that experience, most of all, made me improve my skill from mission to mission and run to run making for a high skill ceiling and a fun game to try and master.
<br>
<br>The presentation is unique and striking, both visually and in the writing, with spot-on hi-tech secret agent jargon. The soundtrack is excellent, featuring suspenseful music that actually progresses as the alarm level goes up, building a crescendo in tension and excitement as you play. All of it is just so engaging I found myself losing track of time as I played.
<br>
<br>My only regret is that the main story isn&#x2019;t a bit lengthier. But since the atmosphere is so right, the mechanics are so well built and balanced, the gameplay is so engaging and addictive, and there are so many different agents and gear/equipment, I find myself on my third playthrough and not even a bit tired of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=5933086">Expand</a></span>

The turn-based stealth blend is refreshing and new. The mechanics are quite deep yet approachable. It would take quite a few paragraph to describe the game&apos;s mechanics but they can be summed up by saying it is a deeper more rewarding take on the Xcom formula from which it borrows heavily; That said, the mechanics are much deeper than Xcoms and ultimately quite a lot more rewarding and thoughtful. The game is capable of putting you in some really challenging situations that will put you on the edge of your seat until the very last turn; The thrill and suspense it is capable of generating, is where lies the true heart and genius of this game. The sustained stream of new gadgets and mechanics combined with the randomly generated levels,  ensures a high replay value. The audio-visual compartment is polished and the overall atmosphere is quite immersive. This game is clever, fun, thrilling and ultimately enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=6238375">Expand</a></span>

You start off with two agents (you can get more as the game progresses) who have limited resources and, quite frankly, are pretty weak. As you infiltrate facilities, you can buy new gear, augments (which are basically power ups) and programs for your AI, Incognita. For a turn based strategy, it is rather fast paced. The alarm level escalates slowly even if you aren&#x2019;t spotted in your turn which adds an extra layer of pressure to the game play.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>The graphics are great. They are cartoony, but the style works perfectly with the darker, ominous, cyberpunk look of the surroundings.
<br>It is challenging, even on the beginner difficulty. This is a pro because it is a lot more rewarding when you complete a mission that you have previously failed.
<br>The controls are easy. It takes a while to adjust to the gameplay, but the controls are very easy to pick up and use.
<br>There is a wide variety of gear. It is not limited to guns and tasers, there is a variety of other gadgets like adrenalin shots, distraction devices and even an EMP.
<br>The gameplay outside the mission is engaging. You have to choose targets around the world, buy/sell items from your contact and manage your agents.
<br>The voice actors are great. There is no shortage of dialogue in this game and it adds a lot the ste personality of some simple animations (my personal favorite is Monst3r)
<br>As you get stronger/faster/more efficient, the guards will to. You will encounter guards with armor and augments of their own. There are even drones that you can hack.
<br>The game is very entertaining/addicting. It&#x2019;s worth the money, you will come back to the game time and time again.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>The gameplay is relatively short. There is plenty to do in the game, but once you complete beginner difficulty, the missions in experienced mode are the same except for the added difficulty. If you buy it with Contingency Plan, you won&#x2019;t have this problem.
<br>Though the worlds are randomly generated, there isn&#x2019;t a huge variety of how your surroundings look. There are four very subtle changes (they vary depending what corporation you&#x2019;re infiltrating) but otherwise, the setting is the same.
<br>
<br>Fundamentally, the game is phenomenal. I would highly recommend it. Put it on your wishlist and get it when it goes on sale. It&#x2019;s thoroughly entertaining and worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/invisible-inc/user-reviews?user_review_id=7089197">Expand</a></span>
