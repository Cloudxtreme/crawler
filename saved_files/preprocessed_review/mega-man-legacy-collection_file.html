<br>
<br>They didn&apos;t put the effort in to make these run as well as MM9 and MM10 did (both games which should be included in this collection, likely to be pieced off later on Steam though). All the slowdown and sprite-flicker you remember is there. They said they left these in for accurate emulation purposes, but let&apos;s face it, they did it because leaving 20+ year-old games as-is is less work than recoding them to make them run at a consistent framerate without sprite flicker, and then making the &quot;legacy&quot; features optional.
<br>
<br>Oh, and there&apos;s a bit of delay with the controls compared to playing on an emulator, the Wii/Wii U VC, or original NES... it&apos;s minimal, but in a Mega Man game, minimal delay is pretty noticeable.
<br>
<br>So glad Steam refunds are here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mega-man-legacy-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5433786">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be fooled by the negative ratings. 5 of the 6 negative reviews come from the same 2 people. Apparently they bought it for the PS4, then went and bought it on the PS4. Then one of them bought it for the PC and surprisingly hated it there also. That&apos;s assuming they bought it at all.
<br>
<br>Also the negative reviews fall into 3 areas, based on unrealistic expectations. Some wanted the 10 bit games. Which they knew weren&apos;t coming in this collection. But might come as a DLC if this does well. The other admitted there were small timing issues only a hardcore Megaman Savant would notice. And then there is the Mixed reviews that wanted the game to be updated for today&apos;s gamers. Which would be a waste of Capcom&apos;s time and resources. Since the original maker of Megaman made &quot;Mighty #9&quot; which is launching next month and is basically a modernized Megaman.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mega-man-legacy-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5440176">Expand</a></span>

But upon playing this collection I must say I&apos;m genuinely impressed the challenges are fun and creative and unique, the art books are a great addition, and the music player does the job well, but none of that matters if the core game has the same problems that the Game Cube collection has. So does it fix those problems?
<br>
<br>Short answer: yes, yes it does. The emulation using the new Eclipse engine is superb, the sound sounds are crisp, the visuals are clean and unlike the collection on Game Cube there is little to no input lag. Also unlike the Game Cube collection this is output into a beautiful 1080p HD signal that looks stellar on modern HD TVs.
<br>
<br>So, is it worth the 14.99 price tag? My answer is a resounding yes it has enough content to keep you playing for months, it looks great, and most of all it PLAYS great. the Mega Man Legacy Collection for PC gets my review of 9.8/10.I might even go so far as to say it&apos;s the best way to play the first 6 games in the series. It&apos;s a nearly perfect example of why I love this series so much amd is fun for both old fans and new fans alike, my only minor gripe is lack of 4:3 aspect ratio support but this is so minor I feel bad even pointing it out</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mega-man-legacy-collection/user-reviews?user_review_id=5437821">Expand</a></span>
