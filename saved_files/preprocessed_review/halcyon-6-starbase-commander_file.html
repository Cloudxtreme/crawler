<br>
<br>Combat is too simplied for my taste. I would have loved to AT LEAST get combat mechanics similar to Disciples 2 (not 3) - With a focus on front row and back row, tanks and glass cannons etc. . Instead i get the usual jrpg combat - which ... do not get me wrong ... works and is fun ... but lacks another layer of complexity.
<br>The combat boils down to setting up your ship types in a way that you can play the &quot;inflict - exploit&quot; game. Which in turn becomes very much routine ... no matter what you fight against.
<br>
<br>And i am quite happy that the devs did not choose a grid based turn based combat (like Heroes VI or so) ... cause that would have made the combat too long. But a little more complexity while maintaining the fast paced turn based combat would have been nice.
<br>
<br>The story is not bad - and the quests run along nicely (although i happened to fulfil most quests without even knowing i had them - just by picking and choosing my targets randomly).
<br>The UI is very well done - avoiding silly submenus/pop-up menus. Music is ok - and FX is beefy enough.
<br>
<br>Now that may have sounded like quite a lot of critizism ... but i still give the game an 8/10. ... why? - because it is fun in short bursts. (kind of like a good mobile game)
<br>
<br>In terms of replayability - well... i am not so sure about it. The tech tree and choices are limited - possibly too limited to make another play through very different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halcyon-6-starbase-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=6716441">Expand</a></span>
