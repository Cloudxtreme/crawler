I agree that this game will appeal more to a niche audience. Vietnam era games/sims are few and far between. MoW Vietnam is the best I&apos;ve played to date. I love the jungle canopy where it is difficult to see and do anything you want. That&apos;s how it is in that environment. Quite a challenge. The smaller unit actions and tactics are what win the day here. No grand battles like Kursk or El Alemain. Vietnam was a war fought by politicians where the generals often had one or sometimes both hands tied behind their backs.<br>Good amount of equipment to be used here. Nice to play as NVA to get a taste of their perspective of things too.<br>The game is challenging. Overall I like it very much.

Comparing to Faces of War or first Men ot War we get improved graphics, some new sounds, and of course new environment, according to the time the Vietnam war took place. New weapons, a lot of jungle locations, new music - for MoW fans it&apos;s just exactly what they need. Personally I love this series, and I can not say anything against. I&apos;m just waiting for some upgrade or DLC which can give us more modes to play in Multiplayer, such as Frontlines, Assault Zones etc. But anyway, my final opinion is: PERFECT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749121">Expand</a></span>

It is a tough game, but when you have a perfect plan in mind and watch it being done by your units, that will be one of the best feelings that you can get in a tactic game, seriously, It&apos;s tiring but it is quite realistic considering how a war in real life situation back then was. For those who can&apos;t seem to complete the missions that requires you to find something, for example, like the fuel can for your boat on the first mission in Viet Nam&apos;s side :<br>- Check the graveyard near the church, press &quot;Tab&quot; to highlight items on the ground.<br>For those who can&apos;t see your units hiding under tall grass or trees, highlight them, there are 2 ways:<br>- Highlight the units being hidden by obstacle, check the lower left section of your screen for the icon.<br>- Group select them, then select each of your unit one by one, this will enables you to see an icon hovering over your unit&apos;s head, good to use on early missions, when you have a small number of units to command.<br>Did i tell you the voices of Vietnamese &apos;s units in this game is the best that I&apos;ve heard so far in games about Viet Nam&apos;s war?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749256">Expand</a></span>

However within my first few minutes of play I was utterly turned off. Today, I decided I would give it another shot. I do feel the game &quot;could&quot; be good. But it is utterly crippled by a very poor control scheme. I mean, you can&apos;t control the camera with the keyboard at all? Say whaaaat? As others mentioned yeah it&apos;s hard to see your squads, but that is entirely caused by the horrid camera controls. The game has it&apos;s charm with the ability to control individual men, almost in a detached 3rd person sort of way. --Again however, the camera does not follow the movements of the soldier, although you can control his direct movements with the arrow keys. Selecting movement modes for your character are worthless unless in prone, as if you have him crouched and attempt to move he just stands up and runs, so there is no stealth movement besides prone. Grenades are not very intuitive and sometimes it takes several clicks through the interface to make anything happen at all, meanwhile your soldier got blasted. Overall -- This game got a 68, and it deserves a 68 or lower. Do not buy this at full value, wait for it in the bargain bin if you must buy it. I very solid, and better alternative would be Company of heroes. It&apos;s missing some of the up close and personal single unit controls like MoW:V, but it out shines it in every aspect including graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-vietnam/user-reviews?user_review_id=2000329">Expand</a></span>
