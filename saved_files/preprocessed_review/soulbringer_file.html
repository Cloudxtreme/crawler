This is one of the BEST RPGs i ever played. The only CRPG which is slightly better is Planescape:Torment. If you can get Soulbringer over Ebay or Budget-pack..do it..take 4-5 Weeks off and you won&apos;t get any sleep! This game is one of the most underrated games in game history.

<br>
<br>When Soulbringer came out, it was one of the first games that let you use the environment intelligently. It&apos;s not only that you can take advantage of height differences, but you can also use furniture and other environment objects to minimize your vulnerability to multiple opponents. Being swarmed by a group of skeletons? Retreat behind a table with your back to a wall and they can attack you only from two sides.
<br>
<br>Using different weapons and targeting different parts of your opponents isn&apos;t all that daunting once you master the combo system. It&apos;s intelligently implemented and it&apos;s easy to record a sequence of moves, then available by the press of a key.
<br>
<br>The magic system that lets you cast spells is ingenious. It&apos;s based on elemental spheres, and while specializing in one sphere can greatly boost your power, you need to be aware that it makes you very vulnerable to its opposite element. You need to balance this.
<br>
<br>Artifacts are more than simple items in your inventory. To my shame I have to admit that I never figured out how to use the Tarot cards properly. Later I learned that these can be invaluable.
<br>
<br>The game features a brilliant magic trap system. These are rare but it&apos;s enormous fun to learn how to deal with it and what triggers or disables them.
<br>
<br>As a game it brings all these elements together to form more than the sum of its parts, and essentially mastering all the disciplines is very rewarding because the plot is superb. It&apos;s well written, with professional voice actors, and greatly adds to the atmosphere. I am still tempted to play the game again because I suspect I haven&apos;t unraveled the best ending yet. It&apos;s still a mystery.
<br>
<br>All things considered, the gameplay, the story and the atmosphere the game builds is incredible and there are many times I wished for a HD remake. So this has yet to do.
<br>
<br>PS
<br>If you run the game, make sure not to have your graphics driver scale to the display resolution, because this creates washed-out textures. The best quality is achieved by the driver displaying the game in its native resolution (with a black frame surrounding it) or a full multiple of it, e.g. 1600x1200 for a native resolution of 800x600. This is also true for a lot of older games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/soulbringer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4048725">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I agree with AlexF and rambooze. The game is amazing, a very good story, nice spell system, balanced overall. I&apos;m so glad I did not overlook it when it came out. The most underrated rpg of its time.</span>
