<br>
<br>The graphics and sound, both the soundtrack and ambient noises, are phenomenal and really paint the picture of the robotic dystopia well. And of course, being Double Fine, there is an element of goofiness and silliness that helps lighten the mood throughout.
<br>
<br>The game is not particularly difficult to play through, so those seeking a frenzied challenge should give it a pass. This game is more about immersion and the story unfolding before the player than gaming skills, and Double Fine really nailed the atmosphere in their unique way.
<br>
<br>Once, the player character got stuck inside the wall/ceiling and a manual restart was required to correct the issue, but this was the only bug encountered and it did not leave any permanent issues after the restart from the last save. The game saves every time the player character enters a new room
<br>
<br>The price point might be a tad high for some folk&apos;s taste, but IMO it is worth it. Definitely pick it up during a sale if you&apos;re on the fence now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/headlander/user-reviews?user_review_id=6576429">Expand</a></span>

While i wait on some projects i kickstarted, Double Fine has provided me with something that tickles my aesthetics.  Retro Future design, tied with clever dialog and animation.
<br>Double Fine&apos;s Artistic team is one of the best in the business.  The environments are well put together and filled in with detail. The effects on the character are great and brought me to the days I saw all of the covers for Activision games on my Atari 2600. Electrical and Plasma looks great, and the color palate choice was appropriate for the setting.  Animation was top notch as well.  I laughed out loud when i got to the chess pieces that you will come across.
<br>The enemies in the game work well, each bot carrying a different weapon, and each functions in the same way, but gives you different results.  Single shot, spread, fractal spread, etc.  I was not expecting the fractal weapon at all.  And strangely, as many shots as you could put into the air, it was not overpowered.  You must still play carefully in certain areas, or you will lose the robot body you worked so hard to keep alive.
<br>Mechanics work well, but felt a bit lacking.  In most metroidvania games, your access to the map is mainly restricted to gaining abilities or equipment.  While that exists, the main means of restricted access is in the robotic body that you happen to be driving at the moment.  Since all your weapons and access is based on which one you have, the search for weapons and doing tricky moves to progress doesn&apos;t feel as satisfying.  For me, discovering the weapons in this genre was half the fun of backtracking the map.
<br>The story and narrative are well done but a bit thin.  When I finished my initial run, I felt a bit let down for some feeling of ending.  It was more of a soft close, like the end of a chapter instead of ending a book.  But they story did have me engaged to see the progress as I played.
<br>In Summary, Headlander is a excellent contribution to Double Fine&#x2019;s library of projects.  I feel the average gamer may complete this in around 9 hours or so.  And I have blown more money on a bad steak from a restaurant.  A worthy buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/headlander/user-reviews?user_review_id=6574464">Expand</a></span>
