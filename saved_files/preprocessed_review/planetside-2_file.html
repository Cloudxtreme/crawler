<br>The game throws you right into battle without teaching you anything about what sort of objectives you should be doing or what options are available to you. All of the basics are exactly what you would expect, but it takes a while to learn how to change classes, or logically pick a spawn point, or spawn a vehicle, etc. A simple legend would have saved me 20 minutes (the amount of time I played before realize that they weren&apos;t about to explain anything about they key in-game systems and I had better look them up).
<br>
<br>After watching a few of their videos I learned what some of the objectives were, although some things (like how to cloak) I never really found out. I&apos;m not particularly inclined to. MMOFPS sounds fun but the problem is that battles are silly and one sided. You&apos;ll spend a bunch of time taking random bases on the front lines with no resistance, and you&apos;ll spend time trying frantically to defend a base from overwhelming resistance. How do 3 guys with rocket launchers stop 50 guys with tanks and engineers and invisible snipers? They don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s boring if you&apos;re on the team with 50 tanks. It&apos;s frustrating if you&apos;re on the team with 3 rocket launchers. After 30 minutes of watching tutorial videos and 3 hours of playing I can say with certainty that they need to rethink the MMOFPS concept before it will be able to create engaging gameplay. There are a lot of low points :airplanes can kill new players with impunity (new players literally have no way to kill aircraft until they unlock heat-seeking rockets by paying real world cash or playing for 10 or 20 hours), spawn points are often humorously far from any objectives you care about (2+ minutes), some of the worst graphical glitches I&apos;ve had in a few years, and long waits for continent switches (you might need to wait 10 minutes to be allowed to spawn on a continent with enemies).
<br>
<br>Despite a lot of sloppy unpolished presentation, I&apos;m not sure the concept itself is even valid. I had a little bit of fun running around doing 1v1 at some remote base or being involved in big team on team battles, but that action is few, far between, and still less compelling than any FPS I have played in this generation or any other.
<br>
<br>This is easily the most boring game I have played in a decade. If they ever make some basic &quot;quality of life&quot; concessions and find a way to create compelling combat in the MMO genre this might be worth another look, but as it stands I think the game is about as compelling as the Pinocchio game on Super Nintendo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868835">Expand</a></span>

The combat is pretty solidly implemented with only minor changes necessary to certain aspects (such as the Infiltrator infantry class). The game looks good and I have had no performance problems on a high end i7 dekstop PC; which I am honestly very impressed with as MMOs traditionally have huge problems with lag at launch.
<br>
<br>The bad parts of this game that I feel worth mentioning are the actual cost if you want all the bells and whistles, minor class problems (as previously mentioned), the continent system and vehicle zergs. Regarding the cost, if you want to buy everything it will cost you a large chunk of money. A lot of items are merely cosmetic, however, I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to say they all are (as SOE has claimed in the past). The continent system often leads to each faction dominating a continent each because people have swapped to the winning location. This means you don&apos;t get epic battles as often as you should, a lot of the time you are either being steamrolled or steamrolling. During peak times vehicles can become a little too numerous, forming massive groups that blow everything to shreds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796099">Expand</a></span>

They are terrifically helpful. Anyway, this game is certainly not for casual gamers. It is intense, complicated, and most importantly, requires strong teamwork skills. Also, a mic is practically a must. The graphics, while colorful, are very low res in the environment, though player models look decent., and the lighting is beautiful at times. The controls are playable, though players seem to have a slower movement speed than in most FPSes out there. This is compensated by vehicular movement and combat, which can take place at blistering speeds, especially air combat. The most stand-out feature of this game is that it is first and foremost a strategy game played at the FPS level. While you can certainly run around aimlessly shooting bad guys, that behavior is very unlikely to aid in victory. I have been in 48-player platoons as the platoon leader, ordering squads around and reading the map while trying to determine the most tactically advantageous strategy for my platoon to take to secure its objective, and had a blast. Most people follow orders well; it is not like Call-of-Duty, where no one works together and mics stay silent. It is closer to Battlefield, but with way more consistency and no time limits or spawn limits - in other words, supremely tactical. It is not about how many kills you get, it&apos;s about whether or not you can successfully attack or defend a position against enemy forces. ******* For those concerned with the micro-transaction method: Of course people who put money into the game are going to have small advantages. The game is free to players, but it certainly was not to the developers. Games don&apos;t come out of thin air, and they have to make their money somewhere. I have no problem ponying up some dough to say thank you to the game studio, and neither should anyone else. Show some gratitude with your wallet. *******</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796141">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m all for pay2play, but not pay2win. Plus, getting team killed by frustrated beginners or douchey vets its a pain in the ass; and don&apos;t even get me started on the lag... It&apos;s not horrible... but it feels like a game thats still in beta.</span>

It is poorly optimized and still has a myriad of bugs, some of which are game-breaking, to put up with. Compounding these issues is the fact that SOE has the gall to charge money for side-grades/ monthly memberships for something that is essentially a COD/Battlefield clone. Also the game-play is repetitive and boring, and as for tactics, the zerg is the meta-game. Its a huge step back from what should have been a huge step forward, especially considering all of Planetside 1&apos;s good points, none of which where improved upon/implemented in Planetside 2. My verdict is that PS2 = fail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873919">Expand</a></span>

<br>ZERGS.... WTF is this ? If you go with zerg it will be boring and easy mode for noobs.... if you go with small group you will be killed by enemy ZERG :D really?.
<br>Less and less people play this game every day and this game is all about mass fights with many people. But if this game doesnt have people, it will not have mass fights and everybody will return to BF3/COD ...
<br>This game will play only fanboys who say as always :&quot; its a great game&quot;... NO IT ISNT.
<br>This game has a great potentional but if devs dont fix all this problems they will lose a lot of people and money of course.
<br>I have played this game many many hours and spend a lot of money on it... and I can give you a advice... try it, have some fun and leave it if they will not fix it...

Which are really either useless or a significant upgrade to give an advantage over new players. With the lack of good item descriptions or a community wiki the stuff you pay for may or may not be what you expected, not too mention most purchases fair greater than $7.00 which is outrageous. If you were to buy everything in this game you would end up spending nearly $350 doing so. The subscription feature at $15 month is barely worth it as well, you get a priority que, 500SC and some xp and resource boosts. Your money would be better spent on blackjack and hookers.
<br>
<br>The game is constantly changing and still feels like a beta. As long as &quot;x&quot; amount of the community complains to Smedley and friends, there tends to be a change in the upcoming patch just for them. The hacking is apparent within the first 10 minutes of jumping into the game. The combination of free-to-play and the ability to simply use throwaway email accounts without the need for any other authentication attracts trolls from all bridges inside the internet.
<br>
<br>The worst part of this game? There is barely any story or character development. It&apos;s almost as if someone spent an hour at most thinking about the lore and story of this game and decided that&apos;s what will be released. There is very little point to the game as well, let me summarize this. Launch game&gt;&gt;pod into somewhere&gt;&gt;farm xp&gt;&gt;farm xp&gt;&gt;farm some more xp&gt;&gt;about a day or two later&gt;&gt;unlock item&gt;&gt;rinse and repeat for months&gt;&gt;unlock all items&gt;&gt; ???. You&apos;ll quickly find out (especially in voice chat) how obsessive people become about unlocking the ultravortexcannon3000 for their hoopty that really the only thing that keeps people playing is the need to unlock more and more just to try and be the &quot;best&quot; or have the higher advantage. The game preys on the player&apos;s materialistic mindset. No one seems to care about base captures or defending, but rather KDR and just plain out kills and XP. Even capturing an entire continent (somehow the community&apos;s self-created climax of the game) feels completely pointless. The developers continue to produce more weapons and items (again &quot;side-grades&quot;) to keep the players into the never-ending gotta catch em all mentality. Outfits, or guilds or clans or whatever you want to call them... Yes they can fix some of the above problems, but they can also create some of their own. Most tend to shy away from fun and get a little too serious. You&apos;ll find that out quickly when 15 old Billy gets home from the school and and logs into his squad leader account only to turn into a complete power-hungry douche. Billy will then give your squad orders to go defend the bottom corner of the map that hasn&apos;t seen action since the release of the game for hours on end. Oh and don&apos;t you dare question his authority or he&apos;ll make sure to start yelling &quot;clear coms&quot; as he&apos;s trying to talk to his dad about what their neglected mother is making for dinner. Who says &quot;clear coms&quot; anyways? &quot;Standby&quot; sounds a million times better and that&apos;s coming from someone who works with communications and radio on a day to day basis.
<br>
<br>The community for the game as a whole really just tends to complain to oblivion. You can see this by logging into any of the popular message boards and half of any given page will start out with the titles &quot;Suggestion&quot;, &quot;Bug&quot;, &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;When&quot; or &quot;PSA&quot;... Hell look at me, I was part of the community for the last three months and all I do is complain now. Prime example. Good day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873392">Expand</a></span>

I disagree however, the game is still an income source and therefore should be revealed as it is, an image different to that shouted out by the masses it would appear.
<br>Positives- The big battles. This, apart from ambition, is the only thing I can find good here. When hundreds of people actually bother to attack a target instead of pretending to be lone rangers the action gets intense, tactical and most importantly, fun. It&apos;s also important to note the technical achievement. Que applause. The Negatives- Where to start? People. They kill this, ironically. The forums are a hotbed of rather pathetic trolls and juvenile kiddies. Ask a question, expect 9 trolls, 6x10-7 flamers and 1 genuine answer. F2PNewbs. In game, team killing is common, and rather annoying. It is a good concept to add, but nobody bothers where they land/drive/walk. They then complain and revenge team kill because they can&apos;t accept their mistake. Coordination is also particularly hard if you aren&apos;t in an outfit, as everybody disappears or gives up halfway through battles. I&apos;m forever suddenly finding myself alone in the middle of an enemy base because nobody can be arsed to drive another few sundy&apos;s up, or spawn a tank. The much hyped big battles are cool, but so rare that anyone who isnt blinded by a shiny new game will instantly realise the game&apos;s main point isn&apos;t so &apos;main&apos;. Flying is dame near impossible. Even if you make it out of the spawn area, good luck mastering the controls before you&apos;re shot down. They make absolutely no sense whatsoever to anyone who&apos;s ever flown a real plane, or a simulator, or even ace combat. Health intrigues me. Countless time in my play testing, both in beta and the 1.0 release I have flanked and shot AFK&apos;s at the enemy rear. One clip later they turn and headshot you. Clearly a bug, but an extremely common one, unfortunately. The same occurs during firefights, I&apos;ve emptied whole clips into individuals (and hit, flamers) and they still kill me with a 1 second burst when I pursue them.  Weapons. Or water pistols, whichever you prefer. They all look the same, sound the same and do puny amounts of damage to the rather large health bars. I haven&apos;t once felt like I&apos;ve been carrying a real weapon, even in a hugely overpowered MAX. Bugs. I couldn&apos;t even begin to list them, there are far to many. Learning curve. Point and shoot isnt hard. Abilities, flying, deploying tactics etc. are never explained and rather backwards in their implementation. Anti-air is useless. You can sit on the crowns top level shooting away all day and probably get only one or two kills. Fighters are too fast to hit, defeating the purpose of anti-air as MAX&apos;s and tanks can hit the galaxy&apos;s better than turrets. Direction. There is none, and as previously said, rarely do people actually attack en masse.
<br>
<br>Conclusion-
<br>Whilst this game has potential, it is killed by these factors:
<br>-People(kiddies) thinking they&apos;re clever ruining the games online rep through immature forum antics
<br>-People not playing properly
<br>-People team killing
<br>-People pretending it&apos;s a solo game
<br>-Endless bugs
<br>-Poor direction
<br>-Poor controls
<br>-Completely atrocious health/damage balance.
<br>-Terrible guns(underpowered, generic etc.)
<br>-A pervading sense of boredom and frustration.
<br>
<br>That last point is most important. You can look over the game&apos;s endless drawback after one good firefight, but its just like a drug, alcohol for example. Once the effect wears off and you realise whats actually going on you&apos;re left feeling crap and swearing never to play again. Especially when you read the sickeningly stupid &apos;critics&apos; reviews. I&apos;ll admit, I see their profession as next to pointless. That&apos;s why I spend my time on this site. People&apos;s opinions are often far more &apos;on Earth&apos; than these strange layabouts. But in this case, both are outrageously pathetic, although some have seen the light and look at the game past its face value, something which the ordinary bullet spamming, COD noob masses fail to do, making this game seem so much better than the failure it actually is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818081">Expand</a></span>

I COULD have poked at the fact that it&apos;s not the most noob friendly at times. But if I did that, i would be forgetting the part where the game has a) an extremely large map for a shooter b) some sense of teamwork that no other multiplayer shooter has and c) pvp battles in a scale that has never before been seen in any game. Really, a few weeks ago i got in a tank battle that had at least 1000 people duking it out across an entire valley. If &apos;modern shooter&apos; means &apos;20 person death match&apos; to you, then you can keep your modern shooter.

<br>
<br>As a new player, the only thing you can do is merely run towards an enemy, kill him if you are lucky, and then die. You rinse and repeat through this process because you mainly can&apos;t even see who is friend and who is foe that early into the game. You die yourself through the game.
<br>Pick a Sniper - you take like 10 shots to kill somebody, while some enemy Sniper just takes one shot to kill you.
<br>Pick Light Assault - Enemy&apos;s Machine Gun is always better and you die like in 2 shots.
<br>Pick Heavy Assault - Fire a Rocket right next to the Enemy, no damage. Enemy&apos;s Rockets are like Atomic Nukes.
<br>
<br>Most negative part about the game is of course, IT IS PAY TO WIN.
<br>All the guns you can get for Cert. Points? Yeah, you can buy them with Cash.
<br>
<br>Planetside 2 is a horrible garbage game that has no intention of ever improving and is just merely a cash-cow for Sony.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2878206">Expand</a></span>

The grind you would need to do as a new player is just ridiculous, and the starting weapons is utter useless, same goes for the tank and plane weapons, wich means not only will you have the disadvantage of not knowing the game, but you will also have your skill removed due to ridicilous spread and weapon recoil, lesser health lower wpn dmg ect. ect. As a guy who normal do average in shooters i ended with a K/D ratio less than 0.3.

You don&apos;t know thrill until you have driven on a shaky ATV 4000 meters to a frontline only to get instantly killed and repeat the process. My framerate has been consistently bad on this game because it has 0 optimization for amd users. They released the game far too early and it is still riddled with strange bugs. I&apos;m afraid this awful piece of crap software is going to melt my computer. I&apos;ve known about this game for a long time and was a supporter of this amazing idea. Then I got into beta and realized that the devs do not know how to make a game and it&apos;s the same pay 2 win style of tribes ascend but with slow agonizing gameplay. At best this game is you charging up a hill and taking out as many of the enemy as you can with a grenade. At worst this is you sitting at a checkpoint trying to capture it for 15 minutes only to get sniped by a sniper who you LITERALLY cannot see because the game hasn&apos;t generated them yet because of some bug or something. No wait the worst moment is walking outside a spawn facility and getting shot by the 20 Vanu that are milking the place for kills and having NO way to stop them. Oh wait no the worst part is walking outside and getting killed by an overpowered tank. NO NO the worst part is that the heavy class that kills you in 2 shots after you fire a whole clip into them. WAIT NO the worst part is this game had such amazing potential and failed so badly. Planetside 2 is literally indescribable, it&apos;s like a whole new category of crap games. My experience in the beta is that the devs didn&apos;t listen and were aiming for a target audience that does not exist. They ignore the veterans, screw the noobs, and pander to the rich. I once stepped on a nail barefoot and had to walk 100 meters over rocky ground. That was a better experience than this game and was more friendly. Maybe if the devs had listened to the intricate 10 page posts some fanatics posted. Maybe if capturing bases wasn&apos;t a pain in the a**. Maybe if performance was good. Maybe if everytime I got killed it didn&apos;t feel completely unfair.
<br>
<br>Listen heres my advice. If you have 10 friends with good gaming rigs and high end processors you should get a hold of them and go play this game with them. Now for the rest of the population. Go play this game to waste your time and see how truly bad it is. If you like getting in a tank dominating for 4 minutes and then waiting 15 minutes to be able to spawn it again than you&apos;ll love this game. I give this game a 1 out of 10 because it is a good way to kill an hour when you first download it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2813186">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, that sweet center is tucked away inside a crispy shell of pure manure: The actual gameplay is thoroughly rotten. With clumsy, awkward movement and dull, bland gunplay, Planetside 2 is only as good as its weakest link: Not good at all. The amazingly lazy visual design that ensures new players won&apos;t have the slightest clue what anything is without looking up in the wiki helps make it even worse. But at least you can buy yourself more hit points and other advantages with cash, right?

This is not a snap decision about the **** interface and ugly graphics - I played for over 30 hours before writing this review. I was a fan of the first Planetside, and I play many other FPS games, so I wasn&apos;t unaware of what I was stepping into, and really wanted to love this game. It failed me, totally. What I found in dropping into this game was a severely unpolished and unbalanced festival of frustration and endless active waiting.
<br>
<br>If you like constantly running through empty expanses of nothing, only to be shot and killed in less than a second upon encountering an enemy (you had no idea was there) only to wait to respawn so you might do the same thing again, and again, and again, you will love Planetside 2. If you want an experience that is fulfilling in any other way, look elsewhere. It&apos;s free, but you get what you pay for. Everything about it is designed to make you want those real-money-guns just so that you might manage a kill or two, and the fun might actually start. They won&apos;t matter, you&apos;re still going to be randomly killed from any angle before you can locate an enemy. Ideally, you could play long enough to buy them with in game points, but in the 30 hours I played waiting for it to get good I only racked up 150 out of the THOUSAND I&apos;d need for ONE GUN. Seriously, save your time, and definitely save your money, because you don&apos;t want to award that to this poor piece of f2p marketing garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2823659">Expand</a></span>

We live in an age where people want to be great at a game from the start, instead of investing time into a game that requires some skill. I wonder what these people would have rated such classic games such as Team Fortress Classic, which had such a high skill curve that beginners would be demolished for a couple of weeks before learning some of the more difficult ways of moving around. When I first started playing I was so happy that the game lacked the super accurate Iron Sights of COD, that the scale of the game was massive, and that each faction was unique. Sure, there isn&apos;t a great tutorial, and at first the game is can be confusing and frustrating. After an hour or two of playing, you will quickly figure out where you should be, and get the gist of the classes. Pay to win exists to an extent in this game, but skill really will triumph in most cases.  With any game of this scale, you can only expect it to improve with time, and SEO has stated mentioned some plans for the future. As it stands now, the game is  a solid 8 and it looks to improve. Don&apos;t listen to the naysayers, the game offers a lot of good reasons to play, and as people get it better, it will only continue to offer a great MMOFPS experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796300">Expand</a></span>

It is made to play with groups of buddies, but fun either way. The Graphics are awesome. The game is not played for story. It is 100% pvp. There are tanks, apcs, atv, and futuristic aircraft you can fly + more. SOE is not amazing, but these devs are funny and put time into what they do.

<br>I give this game a 3 out of 10 only because they created a f2p MMOFPS on a massive scale...but that&apos;s it. The gameplay feels cheap, the controls feel clunky and the combat is not as exciting as they make it out to be. I agree with a lot of the other reviewers here, most people are being blown away by the sheer size of the game and the fact its f2p. Well, just because a big budget game and f2p, does not make it a 10 out 10 blockbuster game. This game has pay2win all over it. It takes a hell of a long time to earn anything in the game and the teams are horribly unbalanced... every time i log in, my team is pushed back to furthest corner on the map and we have no chance of pushing back. It seems as if most gamer&apos;s jump ship to the winning faction and call it a day. For the last two weeks, we have been stuck in the same corner trying to fight our way out and we are not making any progress. If your looking for that next mmo/fps hybrid, look past this one. Great idea, poorly executed. Hey SOE, maybe you should of created some sort of cap or auto balance for the teams. The fact that anybody can join the wining and steam roll the entire map is BS. And why on earth would you make it so hard to actually earn better weapons?? It does not sucker people into buying your premium crap, it turns people away from the game. Look at what GW2 did right and learn from them. I suspect this community if going to die real quick. Especially with the release of Firefall coming soon. You guys need to get over the fact that you can create huge worlds, you need to work on balancing, gameplay mechanics, combat, and..well...just about everything else in the game. Huge worlds do not cut it anymore. The game is boring...

<br>I love big, class based FPS games, I even loved MAG, but its pretty difficult to love PS2. Its scale is awesome, but you are unlikely to see most of the map given the spawns and hotpoints tend to be at small locations many Km apart. Its gunplay is pretty poor, guns are uninspiring and bland with no impactful feel.
<br>
<br>There are youtube guides out there that state that the most important aspect of this game is logistics. This is true, the most useful people are usually the ones flying mobile spawn points but they are far above the action. As such, people rarely fly the mobile spawn points because the most useful part of the game is also incredibly boring.
<br>
<br>The other problem this game suffers from is that there is no sense of achievement, even when you capture an entire region of the map.
<br>
<br>The community at the minute is still adjusting, so while it may get better in the future at the minute the 10% of people that arent playing snipers are running round wildly with LMGs.
<br>
<br>The game is incredibly demanding on PCs due to its scale, and still has a lot of lag and bugs in the EU servers. The concept behind the game is excellent, the execution at the moment is just incredibly bland. In addition, for a game with this much stuff and scale, there is no real tutorial to speak of. A few notes exist in the in the pause/map screen but at the start of the game you are pretty much dropped in a warzone and told &apos;GO!&apos; leaving you puzzled asking &quot;go where? do what?&quot; until you die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786210">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m changing my score to 2: and adding more issues: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Can&apos;t get out of vechicle, magically disappearing vechicles, vechicles and soldiers falling through the ground, the game breaking bug - sunderer spawning doesn&apos;t work or works at random. Reviving doesn&apos;t work. Heavy assault shield not working. Poor explanation of anything for e.g. most people don&apos;t know that engeneer have 2 ammo pack, the second one is when you press &apos;B&apos; befor deploying your turret. Fps dropping to 0.5 ( my computer isn&apos;t strong but i get the avarage of 30, 0.5 fps after loading the game is a bug). Poor performance on better computers. Spawns placed in a way that encourages spawn camping (with tanks.... pointing at the spawn.. usually there are about 50 tanks in such place... yes you shouldn&apos;t spawn there, that doesn&apos;t change the fact that 90% of spawns are located in such places that -&gt;encourageleft arrow-&gt;backspaces(to erase /say command)-&gt;write /platoonsay, but that&apos;s not the case for for e.g. /squadsay that&apos;s sticky after typing it once. Whole text chat (e.g. channel switching) is counter-intuitive. If your teammate spots something (Q) most of the time it won&apos;t pop on neither your minimap nor HUD which makes the most important aspect of that feature broken, most of the time you don&apos;t know exactly where is enemy even everyone is spotting them. Infiltrating enemy base and spotting targets is useless for your teammates but will get you killed as enemy can hear you shouting. Only thing that spotting can be used for is spamming it in every direction to find a well hidden sniper. Deploy and redeploy button sometimes doesn&apos;t work. Drawing distance is different for infantry and vehicles thus most of the time when flying you&apos;re being shot by enemies your not even close to seeing. And that&apos;s just a peak of the mountain. (no longer valid score: Why 5 and not less?) If you want to know what are the good sides of this game read any other review. Just forget about the &quot;so much teamplay&quot; arguments because there is none. Just mindless zerg rush one spawnpoint -&gt; one cover (so much people helping me, so much teamwork aka 30 snipers at the only hill that&apos;s not outside the drawing distance, that are most of the time killed by other clases or driven over by their own tanks). Ps. I think that metacritic should allow for at least some text formating... enters and such... you know</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2814844">Expand</a></span>

In Planetside 2&apos;s case, this is the controls, gun accuracy, SoE&apos;s illegal billing department, laughable iron crosshairs that miss like the gun of your barrel is bent, abundant vehicle HP and overall balance between the three different factions. As it was with P1, Terran is still the most overplayed faction to date with no  xp consequences, allowing the one with an advantage achieve even greater boosts through zerging tactics. But one of the flaws that stands out the most to me is the Terran guns. All of them have an insane rate of fire which either brings out two frequent scenarios: 1. Your gun shoots so fast to the point that the server cannot keep up and 2-4 of your bullets will not be affected by the initial recoil, leaving a gun that would normally not be able to hit anything past 3 yards suddenly gain the accuracy of a sniper rifle. Or. 2. Your gun shoots so fast that the proper amount of bullets is either increased or lessened, often with a rubber-band effect, causing a yoyo effect in one&apos;s DPS. Stack these along with the constant overall lag with hitboxes and hackers (which is to be expected in a game such as PS2) and your shooting experience will be ruined most of the time. Going back to balancement, in the beta, MAX units could effectively take down aircrafts with dual AA gun attachments if they came too close or didn&apos;t spontaneously move. What did they do to resort this? Remove the weapon completely from the entire beta, relaunch a 80% hamstered version into the release and only allow 1 per arm which you&apos;ll now have to purchase for an insane amount of in-game money. All because of a whining community on the forums, crying that their ultralight scouting airplane got shot down as it was flying a few meters above enemy towers. The situation is currently much the same, Sunderers for example, a transport/spawn vehicle require roughly 6-8 rocketlauncher hits before dying and it has no weakspots, be it rear or flank. A heavy assault unit can only carry 4-5 rockets at a time (with upgrades which also require you to pay for) which means if you happen to run into an enemy Sunderer, you will not be able to take it down without an ammo-refill, even with no opposition. The game is poorly thought through&amp;executed and even more poorly managed. Even so I hope one day they will actually confront these issues and iron them out, not just leave them to fester like in P1 but alas, SoE has not gained the reputation of being massive incompetent cu  nts for nothing. R.I.P, PS2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2829587">Expand</a></span>

The hit detection is also remarkable and the gunplay is very tight which would make any FPS fan squeal with joy. But since the game requires a lot of teamwork, i felt that finding friends could&apos;ve been more simpler. Also, the game feels a bit unfinished, for example, the &quot;Basic training&quot; tutorial videos should&apos;ve been part of the game instead of being only on their youtube channel which is inconvenient because the game is very complex and it makes you think that the developers were just lazy and didn&apos;t think about the newcomers for Planetside 2. But overall, Planetside 2 is an uncut diamond, it&apos;s not perfect and it feels a bit unfinished but if the developers shape it and polish it, then everyone will see the real beauty of Planetside 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2791700">Expand</a></span>

First and foremost is the learning curve. from the start you spawn in the middle of a fight with nothing telling you what your objectives are, or even where your teammates are. Should you be unfortunate enough to spawn in the middle of a tank fight (as was my first experience) you feel helpless as you die, respawn, and die again as soon as you respawn. An in-game &quot;Newbie&quot; area, some kind of zone where you go only when you first start a character would be greatly appreciated as throughout my first hour of gameplay I was consistantly pitted against players of level 38 or higher. The extremely large playing area makes snipers and tanks gods on the ground. I have not been able to fly any of the aircraft, yet because everytime I spawn an air vehicle it is destroyed immediately. I&apos;m not an avid FPS player by any stretch of the means- I grew up on Doom, Quake, and UT, and I manage about a 1:1 Kill to death ratio in CoD, and tend to play support roles in TF2. On average I have 2 kills and over 50 deaths in planet side due to spawn camping. spawning at a point that is distant from the battle just means I get to run for 10 minutes to die from a sniper that I can&apos;t see. Playing a supporting role in PS2 is down right rage-inducing. Healing a friendly player may or may not reward XP, and unlike TF2, you cannot heal a heavy to keep them up while they sustain gunfire. Reviving fallen players is fairly pointless unless they died less than 2 seconds in front of you. The Engineer&apos;s turret is too inaccurate for the distances at which forces are regularly engaged in. The tanks are done well- and in many cases are over-powered. many of the bases are designed so you can just snipe away at the enemy generator with your tank and destroy it without worry of being engaged by the defenders. Running over your own teammates results in a suicide for them, and no penalty for yourself- great if you just want to troll your own team, as is often the case. What this game direly needs is level segregation of some form- whether it&apos;s designated levels for zones where as you out level the zone you do less damage, or you cannot respawn into a zone you are out leveled for, something needs to give a new player some fudge-factor to learn how the game works besides dropping you straight into a fight that you are grossly under leveled for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802154">Expand</a></span>

Just 1 of the 3 continents is larger than all the MW3 maps put together.  The small skirmishes in this game tend to be 20 on 20, medium ones can easily be 50 plus.  But where this game really shines is the big battles.  Hundreds of people split up across 3 armies all fighting for control of the same zones with dozens of tanks and aircraft supporting them.  If you are a lone wolf you will probably become easily bored, but if you enjoy team/squad based tactics there is nothing on the market that compares with PS2.
<br>
<br>The big battles when you get lots of particle effects flying around can be a bit of a resource hog.  I have heard of people using AMD builds having more issues but can not testify to that as I run AMD and Nvidia.  You also want a broadband network connection, being a shooter latency is very important.  The good news if you are unsure about what your system can run the game is F2P so there is no reason not to try it.
<br>
<br>The one part we need to keep an eye on is the F2P element.  While it is nice that anyone can try it time will tell if it becomes pay to win.  So far it does not seem to do that.  Mostly you buy XP boosts or cosmetic items.  You can spend money on purchasing weapons also, so far there are not that many weapons to purchase and none of those that I have tried have been ridiculously overpowered.  Most have trade offs like higher rate of fire but greater bullet spread.  In the end they so far seem to balance themselves out.
<br>
<br>In the end it is a great change of pace from most all modern shooters on the market.  As someone who enjoys being another soldier instead of a 1 man army I find the team based game play to be amazing.  If you have the machine to do it the graphics look amazing good at higher settings.  The servers also seem to be well made, even in the largest of battles I do not experience any real lag.  You will occasionally see the random guy blinking across the battlefield but that is them lagging not the server.  I would give it 8.5 if I could but will go with an 8.  It has room to improve but so far so good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2779670">Expand</a></span>

So customization is out the window. There&apos;s nothing really much to the game that&apos;s different from any other fps, other than the fact that you have very big maps, but even Arma easily covers that area. Then, I step back even further from the battles, and I see that basically, there isn&apos;t much chance of a faction winning an entire map, so it&apos;s just an endless war. After playing for approximately 6 hours straight, I&apos;m not really impressed.

This game is definitely the sequel of the original MMOFPS. Planetside 2 is MASSIVE and unique with thousands of players across three factions playing simultaneously on the same server. The Sony developers took on a behemoth of a job to recreate the feelings of warfare on monumental scale all around you, that familiar feeling from Planetside where at any minute you could be walking, driving, or flying into a three-way faction showdown. The gun play has been brought up to date and feels responsive and tight as a modern first person shooter should they also have new realistic vehicle physics. The game is built around customization and has so many options your head will spin; you can upgrade your starting weapons, purchase new side-grades from the Depot, and even customize your unique solider or vehicle with different armor and camouflage. Everything in game is purchasable with certifications that you unlock during game play which is very rare for &apos;Free-to-play&apos; games; you can play the whole game and never spend a penny if you wish. The only thing that you must spend money on is personal customization skins for your solider, vehicles, and weapons; which is not needed for advancement. The developers motto is this game will NEVER be &apos;Pay-to-win&apos; and they have kept their word. The game play mechanics aren&apos;t brand new but they are very coherent and are built from the ground up to support team play. The continents are divided by hexagonal bases that can be captured by any of the three factions. Controlling land is very important because different bases give resources that the factions use to purchase vehicles, grenades, personal med-packs, and other personal items needed for war. Planetside 2 also has a brand new meta game that allows a unified faction to dominate a continent and lock-out the other two factions which gives the winning faction unique passive bonuses for their war machine. There is a lot more that this game has in store for it&apos;s players and all this is just the beginning! Thank you for reading my review of the game and I hope to see you on the battlefield!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2785347">Expand</a></span>

Sure there may be some balance issues especially concerning the infantry vs vehicles part, but in general it plays very nicely. Battles lasting through day and night cycles are something I&apos;ve personally enjoyed the most. But there are some problems not related to the gameplay itself that prevent the game from being truly good. The first one is the last of ANY tutorial, lack of ANY explanation of what all the icons means, lack of ANY objective information for the player which left me simply disoriented for first few hours. Sure, once you figure it out, the game becomes much better, but seriously I&apos;m probably not the only one with this problem considering a very small subset of players who actually follows the objectives rather than mindlessly shoot each other. The second, and in my opinion - much more important - issue is the F2P model. The game was being advertised as not being Pay2Win game, which after a couple of hours becomes an obvious lie. Everything in game starting with abilities, weapons, mods, vehicle stuff, cosmetics, etc. is unlocked with a single currency you gain while playing the game. Now the problem is that on average you make about 25-30 credits per hour (about 1 credit per 4 kills) and upgrading a single perk to max level costs about 1500 credits - that&apos;s about 60 hours of gameplay for one perk on a single class on a single character. New weapon? No problem, 700-1000 credits + 200 credits for the mods. As you can see fully unlocking a single class takes about an eternity. This means that you end up buying weapons for 7-9$ each which is yet another misunderstood implementation of the MICROtransactions model. If this was a $60 priced title it would score at least 8 (because of the lack of initial tutorial and some game balance issues), but thanks to the greedy, falsely advertised payment model the rating does down to 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2794634">Expand</a></span>

Optimization is still a must but my god is this game fun. Solid gun mechanics (nearly perfect ttk), great environments, fun vehicles, and excellent team play. Nothing seems severely imbalanced. The outfit (clan) functionality is excellent and the inbuilt voip makes coordination very easy. First game I&apos;ve seen that people are actually working together efficiently. Once you witness a tank column of 20 rolling through a ravine while you are perched on top looking across the battlefield cloaked as an infiltrator you will realize that no other fps really compares. Landmark achievement. I&apos;m worried that it&apos;s high learning curve might scare some people off so please give it a chance and support the game.

Ok first of all I am aware there are video tutorials for this one, but I&apos;m telling you get ready to suffer because the game is not newbie friendly , so the first time you play you are launched in the middle of the field with nothing more but a small message like &quot;good luck and kill your enemies&quot; thing, so you are in this space pod falling down from above and the first thing that you will face as soon as you touch the ground is death... I thought to myself in disbelief &quot;holly crap are there people camping spawn spots? how is this allowed on first place&quot;, btw something to notice is that I was killed by &quot;generalfart&quot; so that will also give you an idea of the kind of community thye are cooking there, I should have known better...so I started all over again and same bs... once you manage to get into an ally base you are not told what to do and whatsoever so this game sucks, is not fun to play , after all what did you expect from SOE and a freemium game, if you are into that sort of games (cashshop included) maybe this one is for you, otherwise move along and don&apos;t waste your time downloading and hd space installing this piece of crap</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2787181">Expand</a></span>

I have watched PlanetSide 2 grow from the early stages of beta into its release and if there is one thing I am very happy about, is the community side support. The game took huge strides with improvement when it game to game play during some patches. Of course like most betas, the bugs ensued with new patches, but as the last ones came out, most of them were gone. This game really does deliver when it comes to large scale battles and every battle has the decision between brute force or using tactics. Teamwork and a good gun at your side are always a must. Ground or Air Vehicles. Lasers or bullets. Your choice really stands true here.
<br>Keep in mind this is also an MMOFPS so the action is not always a constant, and part of the problem solving in the game is getting from base to base. Although, they did a fantastic job of fixing the problem of logging in and not being able to get to a battle. Now you can spawn on your squad leader at beginning and that makes everyone happy. This really is going to be a great game for a very very long time, especially if the community support is as good as it has been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2778689">Expand</a></span>

<br>1.Very solid shooter mechanics, it&apos;s out there with the best.
<br>2. Massive, epic scale battles. This game actually feels like you&apos;re in a real war.
<br>3.The designers really listen and  interact with the community to constantly make it better. Huge patches with new features every two weeks or so, what other game does this?
<br>4. Teamwork on an unprecedented level for a shooter. You can play it alone but when you&apos;re part of a multiple platoon operation run by your outfit, this is where the game really comes to life.
<br>5. It&apos;s free2play without pay2win.

It looks great, but runs like trash. The scaling in reduction of graphical settings is subpar at best. This leaves anyone with a mid to entry level gaming rig excluded from enjoying this game. The gameplay is a whole different story. The map is a **** giving you so much information you cant process what is going on. There is no clear objective as to where you should be headed or going unless you are in a squad and receiving orders from another player. The scale of the game is questionable at best. The game draws heavily from the Battlefield series, but fails to deliver a controled mechanism for preventing an all out **** to occur. I have found myself kill spawned over and over and over. I have found myself spawning in a group of friendlies only to be pinned down by superior enemy forces. There really is no protection or passive base defenses. Aside from this the battles can last for hours, or dare I say days? This kind of scaling isnt fun for the average gamers, if you cant sit down and accomplish something significant in a 30-60 minute period, than the game development has been designed to accomodate a niche group of hardcore players. All in all Planetside 2 really has some potential for further development. The scale of the game and the sheer rigorous pacing of the game will turn many players off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783848">Expand</a></span>

<br>Planetside 2 has the potential to be a great game marketed as a Freep2Play game there are a huge number of issues and if you really want every weapon you will have to shell out a whopping 400 USD for every weapon + subscription that costs you 15$ a month.
<br>
<br>Air: huge pay2win advantage (People who pay real money get rocket pods and AA rockets which are both overpowered hard)
<br>Tanks: mild pay2win (Regular tanks are hugely competetive and pay2win is almost non existant here.)
<br>Infantry:  mild to high (Free2play guns are super effective but you do gain some advantages with paid guns)
<br>
<br>All in all i won&apos;t be playing this for a long time because it&apos;s based on such a blatant model,I mean seriously 7$ for a gun.
<br>
<br>The GamePlay: Planetside 2 has it&apos;s charm,it&apos;s a fun game I admit but there&apos;s a big number of glitches,none of the game-breaking just annoying at times.The class system is well thought out and the upgrades are reasonable.The maps are huge and it&apos;s fairly balanced with some discrepancies here and there.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>All in all a descent game 7/10 but with the pay2win model it&apos;s really not the game for the intermediate-hardcore gamer this is a game for  9-5 person who has 2-3 hours to play and a lot of spare cash (kids,job people)
<br>As a hardcore gamer I can say this is not a game for me,but I recommend you to try it and if you have an extra 400$ over a year to really enjoy it. I prefer my games in the 50$ area.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2791720">Expand</a></span>

Although in saying this I feel there are too many positive reviews for this game because of people being &quot;wowed&quot; by how dramatically different the game is. The most major downside to this game is not so much that is has a hard learning curve it&apos;s the fact the the development team spent so much time in beta asking the community for input, much of this has been seen and is in the game however the most critical part of a game is getting players actually in to the game and actually caring about the faction they&apos;re fighting for. There is nothing, well, there&apos;s a 2 min into sequence that tells you nothing other that &quot;Alright soldier we need to beat the enemy&quot; and hot drops you onto a random base that has players in it. There is no tutorial on how to play the game, no new players understand what is going on and I&apos;m finding it hard to keep my friends interested because they feel there is no substance to the game. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s a brilliant platform for a game however there is no story that is given to you, no overview of the faction, hell, not even an explanation of why the hell these people are even fighting, it&apos;s a piss poor effort and doesn&apos;t deserve all the high praise it&apos;s been getting. There is a lot they need to fix, this should NOT have been release yet, it&apos;s not ready. They only &quot;just&quot; got the 3rd continent out a few weeks prior to release and has had little testing. There is a myriad of bugs that are inexcusable of a game expecting people the throw money at it for it&apos;s sheer awesomeness.... There is no polish to this game. A game with no story? That is inexcusable for any game.
<br>
<br>On a side note the gun play is frankly crap, you feel disconnected from your weapon because the recoil isn&apos;t smooth, it just bounces around unnaturally. Finally, I need to mention this game just keeps failing in the optimization department, if you&apos;re an AMD user you can practically give up on having good graphics or a decent FPS, you&apos;ll be lucky to get 30FPS in actual &quot;Advertised&quot; fights (more than 40 people in an area) not to mention you won&apos;t be able to get the nice shiny graphics provided by PhysX because it will fry your processor trying to use this. Overall..
<br>
<br>8/10 For the dev&apos;s effort, great so far
<br>5/10 Graphical performance
<br>7/10 Gameplay 0/10 Story/Factions/Lore/Background
<br>2/10 Introduction and training
<br>10/10 for atmosphere (provided you&apos;re not getting horrible FPS)
<br>
<br>Basically SOE need to sort their game out, sure they have a workable &quot;fun&quot; game but that&apos;s expected of a BETA and NOT a fully released game. It feels rushed and at least some effort into a story would have been a massive help to the game. But after a while this game gets very, very bland.
<br>
<br>I have some faith in SOE, I&apos;ve supported them this whole beta and I expect great things from them over them over the next year and hey, maybe this time next year they&apos;ll have a game worthy of being called &quot;complete&quot;.
<br>
<br>I suggest people pick this game up, give it a try and see if you enjoy the concept, even if it&apos;s a bit shoddy now it should be awesome down the track .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780594">Expand</a></span>

However, once past the first impression, you cant really ignore the game&apos;s problems. Unbearable fps (15 fps on a gaming rig, really?) means you will be looking at a slideshow most of the time. Terrible balance,  50 vs 5 players is common here. The spawn rooms seem just thrown on the map, and many times only one exist which means it will be well camped. They also seem to be designed to be easily camped. Sometimes the spawn place will be so far from any place of tactical value, that defending a base is virtually impossible. Even something as simple as the colours can work against you here. The game&apos;s bluish buildings means the blue and  violet teams are well camouflaged compared with the red team, which in addition has a lot of red minimap icons obscuring the (wait for it) red enemy indicators. But ultimately it is the lack of reward that ruins this game for me. When waiting 10 minutes to capture a region with seemingly no enemy players whatsoever , I can&apos;t help to feel bored and useless, because , after all, I am. The game does not reward teamplay, it is not balanced when it comes to vehicles, it is not balanced map-wise,It runs worse then the latest games with much, much worse graphics, it is full of bugs, and it takes a very, very long time to do anything useful, or fun, or, most of the time, neither.  As one PS2 developer put it, when talking about the game&apos;s poor framerate: &quot;If you hear someone saying it&apos;s easy, have them show you their game with hundreds of people and dozens of vehicles within a single 100 meter firefight. I&apos;d happily accept their advice. *grin* &quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2780078">Expand</a></span>

Let me tell you that I had some truly epic moments that immersed me in the world and that I will remember forever. But that&apos;s not the kind of thing the game promotes, you see, SOE has a very unclear goal for this game. It started of as a game that seemed to take itself pretty seriously, there were clearly defined factions, lots of robust lore, and it at least made an attempt to immerse the player in it&apos;s world.
<br>
<br>Since then Planetside 2 has been on a downward spiral. with SOE needing more funding they turned to sillier and sillier ways of milking people for money. It started off fairly tame, a couple hockey masks and a skull mask as cosmetics. But it just kept going and going, eventually ending at to the point where it is today. There are ridiculous camo options ranging from palm tree to zebra stripes, there are fireworks launchers, evil laugh horns, confetti C4, MLG decals, overt promotions, etc.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t expect to get immersed enough to enjoy the game after the novelty of big battles wears off and reveals the abhorrent money grubbing underneath.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3830338">Expand</a></span>

Balance is horrid, updates are nearly always lopsided adding almost absurd advantages/disadvantages for factions, vehicles or weaponry.
<br>
<br>While that&apos;s to be expected perhaps with any SOE game, given that the game relies on a certification point system that is earned over time, it&apos;s infuriating to spend your precious certs on items, vehicles or classes only to have those choices irrevocably nerfed or broken without any way to get a refund on the certification points you spent.
<br>
<br>The ability to refund/re-certify has been on their development plan for far over a year at this point but continues to be pushed off while huge, untested and bug-ridden patches are put out in odd succession.
<br>
<br>Let alone that the game itself has 3 continents, each in a different stage of development making the game lopsided and uneven, the game suffers horribly from a fourth faction issue (where you can make alts for each faction and swap immediately to whatever faction is winning) has been a known issue since launch and unfixed despite that it makes the game a contest of who can swap to the winning side first.
<br>
<br>Avoid at all costs.  The game is now in a stale development cycle as SOE looks to launch it on PS4 and the latest update (PU2) has once again brought the servers down for the last 2-3 days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3870877">Expand</a></span>

Little did I know how right he was. If there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned over the years its that the phrase &quot;If its too good to be true, it probably is.&quot; and this phrase fits PlanetSide 2 PERFECTLY.  Most of the information on the official website is half lies, outdated information, or flat out lies.
<br>
<br>For example:
<br>
<br>&quot;PlanetSide 2 features incredible continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space; every inch of which is hand-crafted, contestable space. With the territorial control meta-game, landmass has intrinsic value.&quot;
<br>
<br>The continents&apos; layouts are about as bland as can be. Yet another victim of &quot;symmetry = balance&quot; as if  planets are supposedly symmetrical in nature. In reality its more of copy pasted a third of a continent then rotated and add some unique name. Literally. The same mountain you just past there&apos;s another two more somewhere. They honestly thought that because of the size you wouldn&apos;t notice it. Its noticeable. Most of the special points (such as biolabs or domes or whatever they call it) are exactly the same as they are on other continents. Just a different tileset. Then there&apos;s the &apos;massive&apos; part of the game. It states there can be up to 1000&apos;s of players in a battle. Remember: the players are spread out over these large continents. So the actual saturation of players is fairly low except at one or two points.
<br>
<br>&quot;...PlanetSide 2 battles can last for days or even weeks, and finally taking control of the base means it&apos;s yours until someone can take it back. Working strategically as a team to capture key tactical positions such as power plants and ammo depots have long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. Victory requires strategic teamwork and a quick trigger finger to survive the massive battles.&quot;
<br>
<br>Do they mean the war for the continent or the battle for a territory? The territorial battles could last anywhere from about 3 minutes (its just  you sitting around waiting praying some resistance) to a couple of hours (very rare). The amp stations (power plants), bio-domes and tank factories (I forget their names) don&apos;t do as much as the site makes you want to believe. The only incentive you have to capturing these are: 1.) you get more experience for capturing it. 2.) Each of these special points gives you a mediocre bonus: the bio-domes add a really minor regeneration to your health, the tank factories allow you to acquire main battle tanks outside of your warpgate and the amp stations increase the time it takes for a turret to overheat by about 1 second or so (when if you pause for a couple of seconds just before you overheat you&apos;ll be fine). I believe they don&apos;t even stack.
<br>
<br>Then we have the supposed &apos;victory&apos;.
<br>
<br>So after running around capping one point after another for some experience and certs, you get the continent capped. Victory right? Wrong. You don&apos;t even get a message let alone any sort of reward. There&apos;s absolutely no reason why you should hold a point or cap a point except for experience for capping it. The only thing you get for completely capturing a continent is a puny cost decrease to aircraft, infantry stuff, or vehicles (a whole 10% or 15%!). That&apos;s it. Not even an anti-climatic &quot;your empire has captured the continent of ___.&quot; No experience reward, no congratulations, no climatic battle. Then as soon as you leave the enemy empire you now warpgated just captures the territory back.
<br>
<br>What they don&apos;t tell you:
<br>
<br>- It takes you an absurdly long time to get any of the 1000 cert weapons (upwards of 1 month) without paying for a subscription. Once you hit battle about rank 37, it takes literally ages to get to the next rank without a subscription.
<br>
<br>- The guns are absurdly overpriced (normal guns are about (US)$5.75 (or is it 7.50) for a 500 or 250 cert one and ~$10.00 for a 1000 cert one. Then for the golden guns they&apos;re $20.00 or so. Remember: 100 SC = $1.00.
<br>
<br>- Everyone says its &quot;Not pay-to-win&quot; they are correct in one way: you pay, but you can&apos;t win (there&apos;s no victory objectives outside of capture a point move on to the next). You start off horribly ill equipped compared to people who&apos;ve been playing and need months to get better equipped.
<br>
<br>- It is horribly optimised. Expect frame rates of less than 15 in big battles or even moderate battles with anything less than a mid-range PC.
<br>
<br>- You WILL be killed every 10 or so deaths by an infiltrator with an SMG that decloaks behind you and kills you in about 3.2 seconds.
<br>
<br>- You CAN/WILL be sniped by an enemy you cant even render!
<br>
<br>-- The verdict --
<br>The fun really dies out after you screw around for a little while then only becomes fun with friends. Just don&apos;t expect to meet many here. The community is full of trolls and immature kids (LOTS of 10yr olds).
<br>
<br>NOTICE:
<br>Player experience will vary greatly. Try it yourself. Just don&apos;t spend a dime until you know you like it and will play it for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986097">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a milking machine, with a bunch of devoted players who constantly buy new decals and membership.

Even back then I knew that this game was going to be very special, the raw potential of the tech SOE was displaying was incredible. 2000 players fighting on one massive continent, battles including hundreds of players at once, aircraft, tanks, infantry! But that&apos;s common knowledge, and those features only make half of a game. It is the development team that truly shoots this game through the roof for me.
<br>
<br>The game receives at least 2 major updates a month, with hotfixes whenever they are needed (and they are usually very quick with those), which all include both new content and game fixes. The devs make regular efforts to join discussions on their forums, on reddit, on twitch livestreams, on podcasts and even on their own internet shows Friday Night Ops. This level of communication really jacks in the developers to the needs and concerns of the community, and coupled with their own limited brand of restraint the decisions being made for PS2&apos;s future have been extremely good. It is constantly evolving, constantly adding new content and constantly surprising me with the user generated shenanigans that a 64 square kilometer map filled with 2000 gun wielding immortals can create.
<br>
<br>The F2P model has been extremely kind to the non paying player, the initial guns that everyone starts with are very often some of the &quot;best&quot; guns available. I put best in quotations because with few exceptions every gun in the game has downsides that counterbalance their upsides. Even the weapons that have been identified as straight upgrades (Around 5 or 6 weapon classes in number if I had to guess) have also caught the attention of the devs, who constantly tweak and change those weapons to bring them to an acceptable level.
<br>
<br>The only downsides that I can think of for this game are the difficulty a new player has in figuring out what to do (a tutorial system is already implemented and is being expanded on as I type), and that many older computers will have difficulty running this game (especially laptops). AMD graphics cards also seem to fare less well than NVidia cards for whatever reason. I do not believe there is much more the devs can do in terms of optimization, as it is quite a demanding game.
<br>
<br>Since those are the only two negative points I can think of, and in the shadow of the myriad of positives I have given, I bestow upon PS2 a 9 out of 10. The game will only get better over time I believe, as the developers really have their heart and soul in the game and have promised to keep working on it for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3195545">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing PS2 since closed beta.
<br>
<br>People who like combined arms tactics and large fights with infantry, vehicles and air will most likely like this game if there computers can handle the stress, that said PS2 is not a light game, to run the game properly with high settings in all fights even those ~2000 player ones at 30fps or more, you&apos;ll need a proper i5/i7 system coupled with a descent graphics card HD7xxx series or GTX6xx series.
<br>
<br>Being a MMOFPS it means the game is in a constant state of development, more content is being added, old content revamped  redone. Stuff removed, or just plain moved around, stats tweaked. Weapons nerfed, others boosted, and so on. This is the stuff that might annoy the non MMO crowd who came for the FPS part and who might not be used to stuff being in a constant state of flux.
<br>
<br>Each update adds, stuff, changes stuff and fixes bugs, adds new ones, changes old bugs into new ones, etc. So yea be in a MMO mindset and don&apos;t expect stuff to be ever constant and you might enjoy the game a lot. And as always in MMO&apos;s the community/players are the true content of the game, no NPC fights (yet) in the game so everyone and every vehicle you fight is another human being somewhere on the globe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3004871">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t help but feel this is still in Beta, there&apos;s a LOT of major features that should have launched with the game. As of right now Planetside 2 is simply an enjoyable FPS and the promised massive emersive metagame is non existant. Some of my biggest gripes are uncapturable warpgates, bases that can be back capped by 1 or 2 people, the ability for anyone to pilot any vehicle at any time (No vehicle certs are required), The total lack of an actual front line, Cutting off enemy the enemy gives no real benefits. No inventory system, no way of picking up enemy equipment off of dead soliders, no way of hacking or capping enemy vehicles. So the entire &quot;Immersive metagame&quot; is missing.    It&apos;s not all bad, the scale of the battles are incredible, but again, with no metagame it still feels like battlefield. You could spend a solid 1-2 hours fighting over a territory and once capped you move on pushing deeper into enemy territory... 20 minutes later you open your map only to find that 2 or 3 enemy troops were able to ghost cap all that hard work you&apos;ve done because nobody is interested in chasing 3 rogue soldiers all over the map at abondoned zones. So what took you and 100 of your buddies 2 hours of hard fighting takes them 3 men and 10 minutes.  Wheres the metagame in that? where&apos;s the feeling of a lasting victory?    However dispite its glaring flaws, PS2 is still a very enjoyable game if played simply as a FPS. If you&apos;re looking for any kind of grand strategy you will only get frustrated and disappointed
<br>Hopefully SOE will change that and fast, because people like me are simply starting to lose interest in the same grind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3012759">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, this is the only thing Planetside 2 does right when compared to Planetside and many other FPS games.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s artwork, models and animation are nothing short of beautiful and their creators deserve a lot of praise for their hard work. The game stays true to it&apos;s predecessor by bringing all three factions with even great stylistic differences that really distinguish the players on the battlefield. These redeeming qualities is why I gave Planetside 2 a 2/10.
<br>
<br>The severe lack of strategy, tactics, vehicles, the jack of all trades character development, the grind for new equipment and weapons being very much the same are just a few of the many flaws in PS2.
<br>
<br>Overall, Planetside 2 is a terrible continuation of the series and would fit better as a Battlefield game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4177682">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you can get past this huge flaw, the game offers a decent amount of customization options, vehicles, guns, and to a slight degree- classes. The last is really only useful if you plan to play full support or are in a large, coordinated squad. Otherwise, all classes- skill being equal, are vastly inferior to heavy assaults. Due to their overshield mechanic, they simply take more bullets to kill, with no mobility loss or disadvantage. In a game where bullets indeed kill, this makes for boring options.
<br>
<br>As for strategy and enjoyable fights, I&apos;d say Planetside 2 ranks last when comparing it to other mainstream games like the BF and COD series. Most fights merely consist of being outnumbered, or doing the outnumbering, to take relatively pointless bases, while 75% of the map is not able to be contested. Due to this, it really removes the ability to harass and annoy larger factions on a continent, as you could in Planetside 1. Again, this simply emphasizes the benefit of players zerging whenever possible. Not my style, but perhaps it&apos;s yours.
<br>

Overall the game is dismal at best, to much killing and pretty much nothing else... Over all i&apos;d give the game a 1 tops.. Not worth the time. can play other games that are far better... a true waste of time!</span>

<br>
<br>cons:
<br>- lots of bugs  dcs  freezes
<br>- server down quite often
<br>- unbalanced vehicle  infantry relation
<br>- realy bad balancing of earned ingame currency (stuf realy expensive)
<br>- really expensive micro-transactions (a gun  10  ???)

The recently incorporated Alert system and test servers should provide a boon of confidence to those who have stuck with the game since alpha. It features (more or less) seamless sandbox exploration/combat on (currently) 3 massive, beautiful 5x5 km landscapes.
<br>
<br>All this combined with a convenient and easy to use platoon interface and a moderate selection of weapons and attachments, this game would be a great game to play with friends and family.... in about 6 months to a year. Right now, despite its massive, ambitious scale and spectacular visuals, the only word that comes to mind is frustration. Pure, unadulterated frustration. Frustration that I can only get 20-25 fps in large scale battles on a high end PC, frustration that bugs that should have been squashed earlier on are still prevalent more than ever, and frustration that no matter how I look at it the ACTUAL METAGAME, the one that should have been at its current state should have been where it is 6 months ago.
<br>
<br>The game as a whole feels very much like a late alpha/early beta state game. It was clearly pushed out the door before it should have been, and it&apos;s clear it still has a good 18 months before I would consider it a &apos;launch ready&apos; title. That said it is a MMO, meaning that it&apos;s development cycle never really ends, unless the game flat out dies. That said, I think this game will have a nice long life, and will absolutely be worth trying out in another 18 months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3107296">Expand</a></span>

If you want to have any other weapons than the standard, you will be spending real money as the grind for cert points to buy new weapons is just too steep.

To actually get any decent weapons in this game you have to pay which is sometimes really annoying when your a low level and the enemy&apos;s are high levels  spending money and having really good weapons. Playing with friends is possible but finding them (even when their in your squad) is quite difficult when your one of those guys that dies allot.
<br>
<br>The good points! This game is one of the most EPICist games i have ever played. Once your whole faction is together on the map you feel unstoppable and feels like your taking part in star wars. Hundreds of tanks, Jets &amp; Carriers overhead and just troops running along side your tanks is a great experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3136210">Expand</a></span>

No real feel of accomplishment, flying is impossible, or using any vehicle really. Everything dies in about 2 seconds, and your respawn timers are 20 seconds for inf, 15+ minutes for vehicles. Its dreadfully boring and you are forced to play infantry. Only the elite get to play with vehicles. And even then the Elites are stopped from playing because pleb guns like lock on rocket launchers literally shoot a rocket out that goes directly to the closest enemy vehicle u were looking at and hits it. People spend about 1000 hours of playtime to be able to fly and brand new players need about an hour to get lock on rockets and ruin everyone&apos;s fun.

<br>It&apos;s interesting at first, but play it for more then a week with at least 2 hours a day playtime and you will realize getting any new weapon from earning certifications is impossibly elongated. This is due to the Free To play model that it has. Which also forces SOE to make weapons/vehicles over powered when they first release them, so that they sell better, which they then nerf to the ground, wasting your money or time you have spent. Everything is about seven dollars each, a gun, a camo, a hat, you name it. And most of the time you will accidentally realize what you bought was a waste, due to not exactly understanding how precisely the weapon or game works.
<br>
<br>In this game you can level up. There is no point in leveling up, you get nothing for it, and when you cap to 100 you still get nothing. People don&apos;t even acknowledge it in the game. Even the people who are lvl 100 don&apos;t really like the game, because they too know all of the above and have just exploited it against other players.

<br>Negatives
<br>-There&apos;s no real tutorial, a friend of mine had to teach me the ropes
<br>-Gun prices are extortionate
<br>- Requires a beefy rig to run on anything more than medium
<br>- Gun balancing is poor, for example the Terran republic first sniper takes 3 body shots or 2 head shots.  a new conglomerate sniper will kill in 1 clean body shot.
<br>- Hackers. They aren&apos;t there much but when they are you know about it.

I still log on once in a while and I find that there are less and less players on the servers, and those that remain are hardcore gamers  with 1000&apos;s of hours played who have already reached the maximum level (makes it hard for noobies to get started). There appear to be a lot of balance issues between factions and vehicles vs infantry. In conclusion, the game has lots of potential but really lacks some very important features that would keep the players interested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3626557">Expand</a></span>

Planetside 2 is massive, as the genre classification would suggest, and offers tons of places to go.  But the glaring problem is that PS2 is completely aimless, cheap, and at times ugly in its presentation.  There is little rhyme or reason to what you&apos;re doing.  There is next to zero help in getting started.  There are several vehicles which are somewhat appealing but anything in the air is tough to control and requires an insanely high level of precision and mastery to be effective with.  PS2 is perhaps the worst FPS experience for newcomers on the market.  The graphics always look like they&apos;re stuck in beta builds no matter how powerful your graphics card is.  I constantly wished for more cohesion amongst players and objectives but was constantly disappointed.  The freedom aspect is a nice IDEA that is entirely left undeveloped.  If you wish to do anything in this game, you MUST go where the hordes are.  Taking bases can be fun but there&apos;s a heavy amount of patience required whether you&apos;re on offense or defense.  PS2 made me long for Guild Wars 2&apos;s World vs World PVP, which I felt was a bit too massive and tough to work with.  There is a pillar or two upon which Planetside 2 can stand on.  It&apos;s a free to play game so there&apos;s no such thing as a waste of money, only time (but time is money, right?).  There is some variation to play styles and classes and, when you finally do get the hang of the game after numerous hours and a terrible learning curve, there is some intense fun that can be had.  But the fun is fleeting - coming and going almost in an instant.  The best moments tend to be when a smaller pocket of resistance is met where you aren&apos;t potentially being targeted by 400 enemies.  MMOFPS is a genre that is guaranteed to work, but titles like Destiny or The Division, which are on their way for PCs and consoles in 2014, find better balances and won&apos;t force you to constantly play with complete strangers or unorganized factions/guilds.  If Planetside 2 could offer some good fun away from the large battles, maybe there would be something special here.  But nothing is special, beautiful, reasonable or interesting about Planetside 2.  Unless Sony completely overhauls a future title and I receive credible word about this franchise evolving into a complete game experience, I won&apos;t even bother with a free-to-play Planetside 3 and beyond.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962662">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Upon launching the game you have little to no idea what anything means.  You are asked to select a faction and a server, then immediately dropped into a complex deployment screen with zero direction.  Given that there&apos;s no single player or tutorial of any sort, it&apos;s nothing other than a blind jump into the action.  There&apos;s a little help icon in the corner that gives you some vague idea of what things mean, but the word &quot;detailed&quot; definitely doesn&apos;t come to mind.
<br>
<br>Now I use the term &quot;action&quot; loosely as you had better have a pretty high end system to run this game at anything other than minimal settings (if you want a half decent frame rate).  I run an AMD quad core system with 4GB of memory and 2 1GB Radeon HD4850s in Crossfire.  Definitely not &quot;new&quot; by any means, but this is the first game I&apos;ve come across that I haven&apos;t been able to run at moderate settings.  Not to mention that even at high settings with a horrible frame rate, the graphics are anything but impressive.  Being a software developer I feel confident in saying: &quot;This game reeks of rushed development and inefficient code&quot;.  There are many game engines out there competing to be the best.  This one gets a participation award and rides the short bus.
<br>
<br>The Gameplay:
<br>
<br>After selecting a class and a spawn point that you&apos;ve convinced yourself is somehow &quot;strategic&quot;, you&apos;re dropped into either: a) the middle of the fight, or b) &quot;I better grab my hiking boots, granola, and a couple of beers for the trip to the fight&quot;.  I would recommend going with option &apos;a&apos; seeing as your n00b level character results in doing it all over again after taking 2 hits (if you&apos;re lucky).  The controls are jerky and unresponsive, and the limited HUD indicators are so small that they might as well not be there....  That&apos;s assuming you know what they mean in the first place.  &quot;Blue friend, red foe&quot;  I got that much.
<br>
<br>The Community:
<br>
<br>This was the kicker...  Seeing as there is no easy in for new players to this game, you would hope that some of the more experienced players would take pity on you and be willing to show you the ropes.  After naming my character &quot;Noob[somethingsomething]&quot;, trying to introduce myself, and asking a few beginner questions on chat (to which I received no response), I determined this was not the case.  I continued to try and figure things out on my own.  After dying a few dozen times, I finally got my first kill!  I was playing as the infiltrator class, as sniper is always my default, and finally got an enemy in my sights (before being obliterated by a tank or some other form of heavy artillery).  I took the shot.  Still not sure if it was the horrible frame rate, the bullet travel delay (which I never determined was actually there or not), or my degraded aim due to my current level of frustration, but I hit and killed... a team mate.  Upon respawning, I was immediately killed by said team mate.
<br>
<br>In Conclusion:
<br>
<br>I say &quot;No thanks&quot;.  If you&apos;re the type that&apos;s excited by the prospect of overcoming the frustration and ostracism that goes along with conquering the mastery of a poorly built, elitist, complex MMO with zero direction, this game is for you.  If you&apos;re looking for a new game to enjoy and play casually; look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4407043">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s almost unreal but then cheating in games has been around for like forever now you just buy the cheats from the source itself; the developers.
<br>This is how simple is really is by the way; Weak wheals will pay big bucks to win! Whoa simply brilliant!
<br>
<br>What makes this business model tasteless tho is that they encourage cheating in games played with other people as a cool thing all while denying that they are in fact selling cheats; anyone making money on this model will jump through hoops telling you that you are not buying the win; this is of course annoying as any fairly sensible person that&apos;s not completely self-deluded will just by the use of there own common sense know better.
<br>
<br>Words you should associate with pay to win games;
<br>caveman, loudmouth, villain, doofus, nut, cheat, birdbrain, dope, half-wit, imbecile, brat, nuisance, pest, rip-off, gimmick, trick, hoax, humbug, phony, charlatan, quack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251870">Expand</a></span>

In the last two months (writing this in June 2013), the development staff has made a ton of stupid decisions that have butchered what could have been a great game.
<br>
<br>The Creative Director, Matt Higby, came out last week talking about why he&apos;s instating these inane &quot;gameplay rules&quot; and the necessity of them, but the changes show nothing but a lack of imagination and  critical thought.
<br>
<br>While in minor cases, they listen to the community at large, they seem to ignore what the playerbase is asking for a majority of the time.  As time goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that this is just a money grab and not even remotely F2P.
<br>
<br>The game becomes more P2W with every update and gets less fun to play every day.  I&apos;m sorry I spent a dime on this game and I hope others will think twice before they do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3236865">Expand</a></span>

The glaring problems with this game though is that there are too many hackers and the communities are full of **** On my server, the TR is the only one with a nice community, and I&apos;m sure it varies from server to server, but the point is that most of the time the communities are full of raging jack-asses, and that&apos;s a serious problem because that will cause two sides to gang up against this one particular side because it&apos;s full of nice people, again, like on my server. I guess it&apos;s because the gaming community, especially for pvp games, has degenerated so much between planetside 1 and 2, because I remember in planetside 1 people had a sense of fairplay and if your outfit/ community acted like jackasses, you would get your ass stomped by everyone else, heck, even your own empire would betray you if you acted like a jackass. But that sense of fairplay and community is gone in this game, just gone, and that&apos;s what made planetside 2 fun, was that everyone played fair and kept everyone else in line. That community is gone, and instead in this game you have fanboys of their respective leaders (Toby (who has the worst fanboys), seananners, and that other british guy who&apos;s name I can&apos;t remember), griefers, hackers, People with severe cases of entitlement or unwarranted self importance, etc. Planetside 2&apos;s community problem is unfixable to be honest, and I don&apos;t play this game anymore because of that problem. I will give this game a 5 because this gameplay is good, but the community is beyond redemption</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2880942">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure where the anger comes with regard to difficulty  yes, if you try to charge out of your spawn room when you&apos;re alone and 2 platoons are capturing your base you are going to have a bad time, that&apos;s how the game works, you&apos;re supposed to spawn elsewhere if you get overrun. Also, the cash shop is very reasonable given that the game is totally free to download and all weapons can be earned through gameplay. Many of the most powerful and widely used weapons, like the CARV and the SAW and MBT HEAT rounds are available by default: the SAW and HEAT Rounds in particlar have only become more popular with successive patches. There&apos;s no conspiracy by SOE to make default guns worthless</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3081700">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The fun idea
<br>A large actively changing map where all three factions fight for total dominance of the planet. With 3 large maps, it fills a niche I&apos;ve yet to experience and thought would be really fun.
<br>
<br>alienation
<br>This game&apos;s tutorial consists of showing you how to play a generic first person shooter then throws you into combat without knowing what objectives are, and how to interact with other players. Hell you don&apos;t even get taught about vehicles. This isn&apos;t a FPS with a campaign mode, if it did It wouldn&apos;t need to tell me a thing. But it does because without any nice tut, I am lost.
<br>
<br>pay to win
<br>striaght forward, pay money, get an advantage. Better armor, better weapons, more upgrades. This is what we call ignoring game balance. The devs obviously just wanted a quick dollar. In the long run they may have money, but I will never play a game from these people, and certainly not this one.
<br>
<br>CONFUSION
<br>Lets have 3 factions: red, blue and purple. Now let us make allies show up blue in the UI and enemies in red... So red team has blue allies who are red and blue enemies who are red. Orange and green and yellow also exist..
<br>
<br>The best part is the spawning system. Instead of having variable induvidual spawn points within a base or outpost, everyone is spawned in safe buildings within those areas. In other words Prime spawn camping material. 2 tanks and a location is ready to spawn camp. Then reinforcements come and the defending side tries to poke their heads out and fire rockets hoping they don&apos;t die and can save their base. While the offensive are simply aiming at the doors hoping to react fast enough to shoot an enemy to death. Not like it matters, you can die inside a safe spawn anyhow or life for a moment outside of it. Then often times the spawn locations are hundreds, sometimes past a thousand Kilometers from any enemy location/combat region. This means(I kid you not) about 5-60 minutes of aimless or monotonous walking and running to actually start playing the game. Good thing is there is an orbital drop spawn! Sadly though, you only get to use it every 15 minutes or so.
<br>
<br>The UI is atrocious, nothing about it makes sense. The minimap only randomly shows you structures and enemies, its not clear at all what causes something to show up on the map. Often snipers or vehicles kill you before you hear, see or detect them on the minimap unless you are scouting ahead with a sniper rifle.
<br>
<br>menus are a joke. These devs seem to think words are a sin. I click on one of several icons without words. You have to hover over them for a few seconds to see what they are. By this time, you forget what one icon was and are constantly searching until you memorize everything.
<br>
<br>No clear objectives. While you see icons in the distance it isn&apos;t clear what you are supposed to do, what it does, or why you might want to go there. Good thing the game doesn&apos;t let you know you can&apos;t capture a point if it is land locked by enemy territory. Why that is a rule is beyond me. This game is nothing like real combat, its just a chaotic mess with no one telling anyone what to do, and the game certainly doesn&apos;t care to tell you what you should do.
<br>
<br>Waste of time
<br>Just plain and simple. When you spend more time traveling than you do fighting, you know you should be spending your time elsewhere. I was hoping to play a game, not walk it.
<br>
<br>If you have $100 you don&apos;t care about and no goals in life, this is the game for you. It will eat your time and money and make you feel right at home. However, like most people, I cherish both my time and money and my dignity. I won&apos;t be fooled by this puke garbage. This is the result of people who wanted money and had no passion at all and who have never played an FPS in their lives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3235349">Expand</a></span>

I love the advancement system and the many options of guns, apparel and accessories.   But the reason I scored this game so low is because in it&apos;s current state, it is broken.    I have a high-end PC that runs the game at a steady 60fps even in really big battles.    But there is this server-lag that happens ALL THE TIME that makes the game unplayable.   First off you have this lag where all players are constantly disappearing and reappearing and popping in and out of the world.   it&apos;s impossible to shoot or kill anyone.    When this isn&apos;t happening there is another sort of server lag where no matter how many times you shoot someone the hit does not register.    They can be 2 feet in front of me and I cannot get a hit marker for anything.    Now, I would be okay with this if it happened once in a while.   This happens ALL THE TIME.   Last night I played for an hour and 45 min. out of the hour these problems existed.    The game was only playable for 1/4 of my time played.    Tonight I also played an hour and it was the SAME THING.   The game would work fine for 5 or 10 minutes but then I would have 30 minutes of this horrible server lag.   Even other people in chat were talking about it so I know it&apos;s not my computer.    Again, I have a high end system that runs more graphic intensive games than planetside just fine.   ARMA 2  and ARMA 3 are two of those games.    I wish I could give this game an 8 or 9 I really do.   But in it&apos;s current state I would stay away from it.    I have only been playing the game for a week but I am very discouraged and do not want to touch it again until it&apos;s fixed because it is a waste of my time.    I&apos;m not going to play a game for hours of my time when only 1/4th of it it&apos;s actually playable.    I advise anyone looking to spend money on it or use HD space to wait until SOE does something about this because the game is literally broken.  I think this game is too big for their britches and there&apos;s too many players for them to handle.   Again, I really wish I could give it a better score because it is a great game but in it&apos;s current state... BROKEN!    This is my honest review and opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3352548">Expand</a></span>

The reason being is grab lock ons against vehicles. The client side programming means two major league bad things should you have a really bad connection you can go to town on people and they cant even see you. Also like 90% of the games files are on your pc thus making it extremely easy to patch and modify your game files; hence all the hackers found it the game(many are sneaky about it now however its still a huge problem).  While your at it why not just buff one faction above the others time and time again without any consideration of balance or skill based weaponry. Oh and just to put the cherry on top of the cake they will ban you should you do good, don&apos;t believe me get a K/D of 20+ and you will shortly. As for the bugs planetside 2 is FULL of them LITERALLY most of which have been around since the alpha days. such as; falling through the ground being killed but being able to move around and look at people but not die when shot, graphical errors, floating buildings. And then the bugs that they think helps balance the game such as lock ons going right through walls, infantry not even rendering in many cases, huge de-sync problems when in a harasser. As for the content added--I don&apos;t think SOE knows the meaning of that because all they do is add generic guns and buff lock on rockets consistently. If you don&apos;t believe me look at the patch notes since the beta all they added was change around the warpgates(new only two times) the latus system(Which is horrendously worse then the system before) the harasser that is riddled with bugs and glitches to this day. Now speaking from a knowledgeable programmers perspective you know that SOE could not be dumber in using dx9 vs dx11 and also trying to make they&apos;re own engines just to save a little amount of money. Just to top it all off they released a TESTING server that what do you know they don&apos;t even USE TO TEST THINGS BEFORE RELEASE! I give this game a rating of 1 just for the sake that they tried to make the first game of its kind but they blew it so hard that I regret playing in the alpha/beta testing phase because that game was better when it was in testing phase otherwise it would be a solid zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3408060">Expand</a></span>
