I worry that nobody will ever see a review of the game 5 months from launch, which I think would have a much better score.  The game is pretty good, and it does have some wrinkes, like all MMOs do.  The combat is cool, with enemy specific animations for some special moves.  Its not always just an animation with a spark on the end.  The story is refreshing, given that we don&apos;t see many non-fantasy style MMOs.  The minion system is awesome.  Its sort of Final Fantasy 12-ish the way you basically play a group rather than just your main (but with a bit less control over the party) .  The plans that Heatwave have announced to the community involve some pretty cool stuff, from the way your home estate works and evolves, to PvP, new content, and new character<br>classes.  In fact, take one look around the game&apos;s forums and you&apos;ll probably notice that the dev team themselves are one of the best things about it too.  They&apos;re very open about what they&apos;re doing and incredibly helpful if you need something.  The community around the game is currently small, but also skews older, and are far more mature than you&apos;ll find elsewhere.  Its so refreshing to be apart of it.  I find a lot of the bugs that were pointed out in a some of the professional reviews were actually ironed out about the same time that those reviews actually went up.  Again, a little frustrating with the way we review MMOs.  There&apos;s a lot to like here, but unfortunately it you just couldn&apos;t say that at launch, and hopefully some people will give it a shot now that things are getting smoothed out and improved.  If you&apos;re the kind of person who has ever enjoyed a game that wasn&apos;t the technical marvel of it&apos;s kind, then you should really consider giving<br>G+H a shot.  It has some great ideas, as I&apos;ve mentioned, and the ones coming down the pipe sound like they&apos;ll really help push the game even further.  Again, at launch, the aggregate review score isn&apos;t terribly unfair, but as things go on, they&apos;re getting much better and I hope the game finds its way into people&apos;s eyes again, because it deserves a look.  At the time of this writing, I&apos;ll honestly give the game a 7.  I&apos;m telling you, by the time most people read this, it will be even better than that.  The dev team is cranking away on it and right now, I think they&apos;re doing an excellent job fixing up a game that was probably very broken when they got it from Perpetual, the original developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gods-heroes-rome-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=1702961">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s unpolished, there are bugs and (even though I don&apos;t feel this way), many people think it&apos;s too short.  Now for the good stuff: it has an amazing team behind it who communicates with the community and makes them a part of the game&apos;s growth.  It has great writing, decent graphics, but most importantly, it&apos;s simply a lot of fun.  All told, there&apos;s something about this game that grabbed me and made me want to keep playing.  I would definitely give it a shot, especially if you like MMO&apos;s that bring a little bit of challenge to your questing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gods-heroes-rome-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=1702984">Expand</a></span>
