<br>IGN bushes the game for being a mindless button musher - which is not at all, for not being able to use the mouse - which wouldn&apos;t work nice anyway in this game, for not having the option of using higher resolutions - another useless feature for a hardcore gamer which in such a game wants the best possible frame rate, and for out of sync voice overs - yes they are out of sync but who really cares, if we wanted to see a movie we would buy a movie not a GAME.
<br>Now some true facts about this game: Its not a button musher. Button mushing can get you started but it won&apos;t get you any further. You have to learn each character&apos;s combos and use them accordingly if you want to go any far into this game. The overall difficulty of the game is pretty hard but there is scaling there, so that&apos;s why button mushing can get you through the very first missions. Also another very good thing is that each character is unique in its playstyle. Its not just another graphic model with a different weapon.
<br>Graphics are as good as they should. They are not bad, there is enough detail in the characters, enemies and the world. More detail would just clutter the game and drop the player-&gt;PC reaction time which is fundamental in this type of game. An ARCADE game. Not an FPS, not an &quot;action&quot; game, not an RPG/whatever hybrid. Its an arcade game. And i think that&apos;s the point both reviewers had missed.
<br>Also another thing that both reviews really missed: The music. Its very nice and cooperates with the atmosphere of the game. Both arcade and japanese-chinese sounds mixed together filling the background, without getting repetitive or give you the feeling that you have a mp3 player doing it. Now seriously you IGN and CCC: you &apos;re bushing the game&apos;s voice-overs that easily while you have NO comment at all for its music? Do you guys have someone there that likes this type of games or you are all playing Halo?
<br>I rated it 9 cause this is one of the rare games that are FUN to play. Also it is a fine representation of its genre, reminding us what arcade games are about. Not a 10 cause the instructions you get in game, about where you should go and which officer you should assist could be a bit clearer at some points. Especially when playing a mission first time it could be a bit confusing. If you want a challenging and fun experience, believe you are a good player and want to test your skill, i think Warriors Orochi won&apos;t leave you disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warriors-orochi/user-reviews?user_review_id=70954">Expand</a></span>
