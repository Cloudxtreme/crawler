I think this year&apos;s Pes2013 is an exceptionally big step forward compared to the editions that came out after the legendary Pes6 (in 2006).. The new Pes game is much more challenging due to the possibility to use 100% manual controls.You can now choose movement in a pass  or tackle urself (like every cm to the left or right and 10000 options from soft to hard) ... this is very challenging and sometimes frustrating but if the ball is given a correct kick it gives often harder and more extreme goals that are very beautiful, satisfying and always unique!! ...... To get this you must first change all controll settings to manual though!.. Pes is the best football game for PC gamers if you ask me. Fifa appears on the console very well the paint to come. The reason why Pes is primarily a PC game is easy to explain: On the PC you can use the patch from the website patchedit.com so the game is absolutely perfect in every detail ... f.e. the hairstyles of footballers are the same as they were this week in the Champions League league... .. and last but maybe most important of all: The graphics get an extreme makeover leaving out the blur and the low detail graphic settings that Konami chooses by default assuming everybody still has a Pentium 4 pc..believe me..the visuals are stunning... when will Konami wake up and open the available eyecandy for the main audience??</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2686180">Expand</a></span>

<br>One moment, I am totally besotted in wonder at the game, the next minute I am wanting to put my fist through some Konami rep&apos;s face.
<br>
<br>PES 2013 offers unrivalled playability and heart stopping action, albeit via an engine with some brutal flaws. However, with the super improved defending, it is for the most part possible to block repetative lame exploit gameplay as is common when playing against rat-boys online (I have turned into a rat-boy as well when playing strangers online..PES does that to people). However, due to the scripted nature of PES, sometimes it will be very hard, if not utterly impossible to defend the lame exploit attempts. Furthermore, as soon as one realises how much of a hand the AI has in influencing the flow of the game, rage induced panic attacks can occur, especially in situations where some rat boy is exploiting my ass whilst the AI is simulataneously beating me with a faeces covered stick. As much as my PES induced rage would could drive me to hitting sites all across the internet spreading lots of hate about the game. Since PES 2013 came out. I have been totally uninterested in playing any other game. I own a high end PC and can play any title you care to name totally maxed. But all I want is my daily and rather large, intense hit of PES 2013. For that reason, even though I hate PES and want to stamp out Konami&apos;s guts, I have to give the game a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2655193">Expand</a></span>

<br>People also keep talking about how the PS2 editions were so much better, but I myself have been playing 2013 and then the PS2 ones... the new game feels so much realistic in every possible way. It&apos;s really really fun to play with friends, and even though it&apos;s better than PES 2012, I have to admit that the changes aren&apos;t as many or as important as I expected. But the game is still good, and I think it&apos;s on the same level as this year&apos;s FIFA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2893965">Expand</a></span>

Their attempt for providing full manual control is fine PS3, but horrible synergy with PC. However, this minor setback is a tribute for a better soccer gaming future. This is not with what I&apos;m concerned. This game has the worst AI ever generated on PES. The game from beginner to regular looks like the AI is retarded. AI constantly kicks out balls from his part of the field while doing to nothing to provide fun gameplay, challenge, or some kind of learning experience for new players. From professional to superstar, AI cannot miss from inside penalty area (you have possession 70%, shots 15; he simply shoots once and scores), and players from better clubs simply cannot miss. This completely destroys gameplay and fun. Next thing I encountered is heavily disturbed controls while defending. It seems that  &quot;the player you want to pick&quot; while defending with q (L1) is far less precise and slower than in former PES. What I mean is that while you are trying to pick the target defender, the opponent already scores. While other PES-es had adjustable support (how much assist), this has only full assist, semi-assist (retarded like hell), no assist. This was the largest impact I felt as I am unable to defend or do anything in 20% of the times (which is too much failures). Oh, and if your defender makes a slight mistake, he drops out and doesn&apos;t return to a position which you would expect him to, but rather does improbable, stupid things. So, yes, even AI of your team is retarded. Buy or download older PES-es as they are much more playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3845474">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s slightly difficult to customize your controls and certain teams and players don&apos;t have real life names but don&apos;t let that stop you - if you actually want to play a football game that feels alive, unpredictable and dynamic, there&apos;s nowhere else to go. The AI plays well without doing typical FIFA scripted goals and it feels as if each player on the field is constantly thinking for themselves which leads to the interesting point that the AI also makes mistakes. Not scripted mistakes, just mistakes because two of its players misunderstood each other. It makes the game feel alive. Because the AI is so good and alive, the game only really works well on the hardest difficulty. Attempts at reducing the AI make the game feel strange. So, learn the mechanics on a low level, then play a single player career on the highest and then you&apos;ll master it in time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=4054596">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Really great game! The master league and become a legend mode is the best and the stadium creator and player creator is even better. I suggest everyone to try this game instead of FIFA.</span>
