Amazing and unique game.This game is still active on some servers, but mainly on the Discovery server through the awesome mod of Discovery Freelancer. It is a whole new game within itself created for the purpose of roleplay on multiplayer servers and which is by far one of the best games I&apos;ve played so far. It&apos;s a mod of the entire Sirius sector filled with awesome systems and factions. Excellently balanced in ships, strategic position with resources, commodities on the market and weapons. It is amazing. Not many people are playing it but there is always at least 100 people constantly online.  If you ever try it then you must visit Gallia space, and then Nomad space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=3580897">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Brilliant from the sci-fi perspective, it delivered great space effects and battles. The visiting stations was a little simple, when you chatted to quest-givers. E.g if you meet someone in a bar that wants some salvage collecting.
<br>
<br>Other than that it&apos;s a great game. The ships, and upgrading ships is all cool. Buying new ship weapons and trying them out is always fun. If they re-made this I would buy it again without hesitation. Having said that I think it is perfectly playable in its original release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=5174607">Expand</a></span>

<br>There&apos;s mods to update the drivers and screen sizes as well to wide screen which is really nice.
<br>On top of that updated textures and all sorts of stuff.
<br>It&apos;s still a worthy purchase all these years later.

Massive universe, great story, seamless controls, fantastic soundtrack.<br><br>I&apos;m yet to get anywhere near as much enjoyment out of a game of the same genre as Freelancer.

<br>The only little mistake is the game outside the main campaign, the kill quests are a bit boring. Trading with a freighter is good, but it is a bit circumstantial to connect a freighter in your campaign, because you need only a fighter. If you could have 2 ships in the same time, this problem would be solved. It should be more like Morrowind for example, where you have interesting quests and get a range in a guild.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=5479618">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphically the game still looks polished - I remember being blown away when I first saw it and they still look crisp and clear today - albeit with fewer effects you would expect of games today. Let&apos;s remember it&apos;s over 10 years old.
<br>
<br>I recently saw star citizen and thought I&apos;d dust my old copy of Freelancer down. I&apos;ve just completed the single player campaign (for the third time) and am very pleased there&apos;s a handful of mods that take this further.
<br>
<br>In short one of my favourites overall and by far the best for this genre in my opinion. Can&apos;t wait for Star Citizen!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=4143153">Expand</a></span>

The lack of variety for such a game is rather amazing, which really becomes noticeable in both singleplayer and multiplayer missions, which are exactly a handful of Go-There-And-Kill-Target sequences. However, this is a very targeted game for third party modders, and with titles like the Discovery Mod, Shattered worlds, Monkey Universe, Flack and others, one might wonder if the Microsoft corp would finally make the game&apos;s source code public to enhance the experience of a 2003 game, which is still favored by a wide variety of players even now.<br><br>The game&apos;s best features is it&apos;s very simple, arcade-like control system, which allows new players to quickly master the movement of their ships, something not a lot of arcade games can boast about. Obviously calling Freelancer a space sim is rather odd, the odd scaling of ships and stations vs planets, lack of gravity, very odd distance measurement and broken physics give this game a clear arcade feel to it. An arcade game, which can keep you amused for a very long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=1400703">Expand</a></span>

While a novice gamer might enjoy Freelancer a great deal for a time before moving on to another game, longtime fans of the genre had much higher hopes for the evolution of the space trading sim. While not game has quite come close to the magic of the legendary Elite that started it all with huge areas of space to explore, a variety of mission types, and a relatively high level of ship customization. Since we&apos;ve seen Privateer, quite similiar to Freelancer, created by the same legendary designer of Wing Commander. Most notably were Terminus which featured detailed ship creation and modification, a dynamic economy and advanced, persistant, ship AI that could form ad hoc alliances or emnities with other vessels even to the point of posting bounties on each other or the player. X: Beyond The Frontier allowed the lone trader to create his own supply and distribution chains in space to the point of creating his own factories, stations and fleets while competing with other factions for resources. Freelancer brings us, once you step around the fairly interesting if rehashed linear storyline, a very static universe if a stunningly beautiful and visually varied one. While ships fly in formations and chat with each other and the station the economy they supposedly ply is static - prices never change. Hence once you learn a good route you&apos;re set for life. There are many factions but they&apos;re all but interchangable as they offer identical mission types (go there - blow that or them up). The relationships between them are as unchanging and void of surprises as the economy is. A player can never really get attached to his ship either as the &apos;rpg&apos; based levelling system compels the player to buy a more powerful ship as soon as he gets to a high enough &apos;level&apos;. Ship customization is woefully superficial and limited. Also, while there is a small variety of ship classes (Light Fighter, Heavy Fighter and Freighter) ultimately all players will end up with Heavy Fighters as all missions involve intense combat - even trade. Light Fighter and Freighter variants are unavailable at all for the highest levels of play. Multiplayer, while admittedly fun, does have many shortcomings. First, the static nature of the universe makes the natural tendancy of players to offer each other help a losing proposition. If the entire point of playing this style of game is exploration and discovery having that all handed to you on a silver platter ruins the game. Players have reported that, running the best routes, they can max out in power in a matter of hours. Once you&apos;re at the top of the food chain what&apos;s left to do? Static factions dictate you can&apos;t effect the various conflicts brewing. Ship vs. ship combat works much better in true sims than in arcade games in which turn, burn, and shoot are the only tactics available. There&apos;s not much of dogfight to be had. All this said, Freelancer still gets 6 out of 10 because there will be folks who will enjoy it. There&apos;s beauty and some crunchy gameplay in an evocative setting. Now, if only something this pretty had brains too. Wouldn&apos;t that be something?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=369290">Expand</a></span>

The motivation for playing them starts to fade away when u realize that all the credits u earn is only used to get urself a better reputation and ship which is in turn used to make ur freelance missions easier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=369942">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are very well done, but the repetitive bar scenes are annoying. Upgrading your ship is very simple and could be more elaborate (eg. colors, decals). This is a game like Max Payne, where the best of the game is brought out in modifications. I strongly recommend getting the demo to this game and going from there. Didn&apos;t care much for multiplayer since it was very easy for people to cheat and alter their ships. All in all, a solid game with a fairly good storyline and an exceptionally well done in the cockpit (easy to use, change radar, etc.).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=366649">Expand</a></span>

One of my all time favorites, because I can always come back to it. It has an engagin storyline for a great single player, and then there&apos;s the same universe, without the story, online for anyone to play, and it is fantastic to join up with freinds to play. Compat is fun, there is nice progression and variety of ships and weapons. The missions you can pick up for cash can be repetitive, but they&apos;re still fun, and they&apos;re not the only way to pick fights or make money. The galaxy is huge, and there is a lot of space to explore. It&apos;s really fascinating and great how you can go anywhere and know that you&apos;ll find something unique. There could be more detail, but to ask anything beyond the massive amount of space and locations provided is ridiculous. There is so much to do. And just flying around planets really gives you the feeling of existing in a world where interstellar travel is routine, and the dull repetitive communicatons you here turn out to be more realistic than repetitive. This is really a fantastic, expansive, immersive game.

The depth of the story and quality of the game was unrivaled for years and still is. Ladies and gentlemen, you can&apos;t find another game like this, and you probably won&apos;t, ever. That being said, when you beat the game you get the excitement of exploring the galaxy and uncovering the mysteries of the outer factions, but sadly, after the hours and hours of entertaining play are over and you&apos;ve done all that is able to be done, the game does get repetitive, praise the Lord there is a big modding community out there so the fun never stops! Microsoft really needed to make a sequel to one of the greatest games of all time. Did I mention the amazing voice talent?

There are a ton of different systems which all have different flavours to it to which makes them stand out. The graphics for the time were sensational and has aged well. Trading and doing side quests to gain credits can get repetitive depending on how many times you&apos;ve done it. The story is pretty interesting and some of the voice acting is pretty solid, but some of it is also mediocre at best. Exploring the game never gets old to me and I can play it for hours on end. personally it&apos;s more enjoyable if you&apos;ve got a criminal reputation due to you having more opposing factions. The controls are almost perfect and they&apos;re also simple for rookies to this genre. It really is sad this game didn&apos;t get the amount of attention it deserves. Not to mention if you&apos;ve played the main game already go out and install the Discovery Mod. one of the greatest games I&apos;ve ever played to date!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freelancer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7397176">Expand</a></span>
