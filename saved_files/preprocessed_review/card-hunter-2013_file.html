<br>
<br>The art style and story of the game are spectacular and evoke a great deal of nostalgia for anyone who remembers the halcyon days of tabletop gaming in the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s. This was obviously a labor of love on the part of the developers and it shows.
<br>
<br>The addition of more content and game modes will eventually make this game a 10/10 in my opinion. Well worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/card-hunter-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3605918">Expand</a></span>

<br>Card Hunter is completely free, you can buy a &quot;club membership&quot; to receive 1 extra item after each battle, but you won&apos;t  need those at all.
<br>The game itself is a superb grid-based tactical rpg with a lot of focus on deck-building through looting.
<br>Many different enemies, item combinations, strategies and a huge list of cards make sure it never becomes repetitive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/card-hunter-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3583324">Expand</a></span>

You control three characters with their own decks, of which the cards have very standard CCG effects. Battles work in a standard CCG way, where you lay one card per turn, then the other person lays a card.  At the end of battles you loot new equipment (rather, in a roundabout way, new &quot;coupled card packs&quot;). The p2w aspect is definitely there, but the pay part isn&apos;t too horribly in-your-face after the hand-holding initial section of the single-player campaign (though they definitely sell it), and the singleplayer campaign can be easily played through without needing to buy anything (at least as far as I went before quitting). This is pretty much the game  if you&apos;ve played a CCG, you&apos;ve pretty much played this. I didn&apos;t find anything particularly exciting about it, and it didn&apos;t hold my attention. I&apos;ve never had much interest in CCG, so I&apos;ll beg pardon for the negative rating, but this game did nothing to turn me into a fan of the genre, as someone who very much enjoys other subgenres of strategy games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/card-hunter-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3613797">Expand</a></span>

The overall  &apos;story&apos; of the game is kind of hilarious, as you find yourself a player to a DM (Dungeon Master) controlled by the computer.  This DM is about as geeky as they come, but combined with the graphical style of literally looking down at a &apos;table top&apos;, complete with grid-based dungeons  the whole thing just totally works.  Yes, the game is free to play.  Yes, you can buy much more uber gear with real money, but even if you only run through the campaign without spending a dime, you will have had a blast, and for free.  This one&apos;s a must.  A gem that is truly unique.  I can&apos;t believe this is a browser game.  Play it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/card-hunter-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3856985">Expand</a></span>
