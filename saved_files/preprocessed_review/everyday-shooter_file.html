Not the most challenging game ever, but with it&apos;s art style and varied gameplay, it comes highly recommended from me.</span>

It&apos;s not a game for everyone; if you like synaesthetic shmups with a guitar instrumental soundtrack you&apos;ll like this. I think. My one gripe with this game is the point collecting; you get points by collecting dots from fallen enemies but these disappear too fast to collect them all.</span>
