Artifacts, sword fighting, special finds (steam powered sailing ship), loan sharks, character avatars, even the wealth of flags and the option to import your own flag, are all gone.  You can&apos;t even defend towns you conquer, even with a huge fleet and crew in town.  See Kalypso forum entry: http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=14838   There is not even a paper or down loadable map that comes with the US game version, only the German release.  Kalypso rudely REFUSED to add one in their forum post, and basically told players to make their own.  So many bugs!  All of which could have easily been beta tester identified, and corrected prior to release. This game honestly feels like it is still in Alpha!  Today&apos;s game developer mentality of  Release Now, and then try to patch fix lazy programming is inexcusable and a Pre-order ripoff.
<br>
<br>Keep the new graphics upgrades and give me More options, not Less than the last game in the series!  Building wealth is so tedious, it hurts to play.  Trade, Trade, Trade, Trade, small amounts for hours trying to acquire enough revenue to buy and outfit a fleet, that will end up half in ruins if you attempt to manually fight a sea battle.  Mechanics are very poor. I was really looking forward to the PR3 release after reading so many deeply positive pre-reviews.  This was one of the few times I have ever pre-ordered a game, and the taste of bile at wasting my money doesn&apos;t seem to be fading.  Sad release Kalypso.  Makes me sick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/port-royale-3-pirates-and-merchants/user-reviews?user_review_id=2422894">Expand</a></span>

There is this slider bar to buy or sell and it likes to go off as im still choosing, or when I click on a item it takes a couple of clicks for the slider bar to appear and stay open so I have made some accidental purchases. Another thing that kind of upsets me... Its nothing big, just the lack of flags to choose from. Combat does take getting used to since at the moment I can use 3 (instead of 5) warships on the map...AT THE SAME TIME. weird right? haven&apos;t seen that for a while. (Since Port Royale) I kind of liked the 1 VS 5 combat. take a sloop of war and run circles around galleons shooting chain shot at each one until they cant move then switch to grape shot, kill the crew board and voila i have 5 ships to sell/ give to viceroy.. and you could call in your ships when health got low. this combat is very different but soon i will adapt<br><br>Another thing so far i miss, is TREASURE HUNTING. you still get map pieces, but no disembarking and wandering the countryside looking for the treasure.. THAT I MISS SO FAR. Why did they have to take that..... WAHHHHHH, oh well i guess i can get used to it. but the combat, lack of disembarking on land, and lack of flags is why I can&apos;t give it a 10.  the thing though is i have battled a pirate town and.... it is pretty lame, nothing like PR2 in combat, you land and your troops fight kind of like boarding a ship... and i have yet to have a sword fight, i seriously doubt it is in the game.<br><br>The Devs should really think about putting those things into the game.  as it stands for me right now, I will continue to play PR2 for those certian aspects. This game will grow on me but it is not the classic of PR2. i am semi-dissapointed so far will update as i go along.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/port-royale-3-pirates-and-merchants/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326943">Expand</a></span>

Boarding ships is nearly impossible. There is no defending towns. The economy seems to be really imbalanced. Overall I wouldn&apos;t bother. I was dissapointed. The graphics are nice.</span>

The graphics and sound are exactly what this sort of game needed - though quests get a little repetitive. I found myself just trading non stop - setting up industries in other towns- overall a great game to fill in some time with if anything</span>

I have no idea how a &quot;tiny fleet&quot; killed those two towers.
<br>
<br>The critic:
<br>
<br>PR3 has a very solid trading system. It seems you influence everything with what you do. Towns have a certain prosperity depending on the wares that are available there - they grow if they have abundant goods, and they have bad times if you keep buying everything up completely. Towns will dislike you if you buy goods they need for themselves (like all food), and they will like you if you sell goods they require. So if you don&apos;t want to be disliked everywhere (towns which really dislike you don&apos;t let you enter peacefully), you will have to buy and sell carefully. You can even starve out towns by buying all food over a few weeks.
<br>
<br>Every town produces five things and requires ressources (from other towns) for some. You can transport those ressources for them, and even build own businesses on different islands, transporting the raw materials for yourself only. You can also buy houses and rent them out, as well as a few buildings beneficial to the towns themselves (like a hospital)
<br>
<br>Trading between towns can be fully automatized. You set up a route, then you can select a behaviour from profit, transporting material for your own businesses, doing trade beneficial to the towns (providing what they need most) and a few others - and the convoys will decide for themselves what exactly to buy and sell.
<br>
<br>You can also set up a merchant at your storehouses, who automatically sells wares, keeps raw materials back and more.
<br>
<br>Convoys can have up to 3 fighting ships, which you can manually control or automatize. In combat you can either shoot cannonballs to destroy enemy ships, or projectiles to destroy their sails (slow down), or even decimate their crew so you can board them and take over the ships. It&apos;s easier said than done, since you need to reef sails in the right moment and stay long enough in the enemy ships vicinity for the boarding to take place.
<br>
<br>Further you can take over cities by force, or by peaceful manners. You can also get a &quot;letter of marque&quot; from one of the four nations and attack their convoys during times of war, without consequences from the other nations.
<br>
<br>The two campaigns you can play are more like tutorials, and the games turn into &quot;free play&quot; ones once you&apos;re done. There&apos;s not much there, and the whole game is more of the Sandbox concept.
<br>
<br>There is also a multiplayer, but there aren&apos;t any additional trading or coop options. Also the game has basically no diplomacy at all.
<br>
<br>Could&apos;ve done better, but so far if you enjoy a beautiful trading game, this one certainly has a beautiful oeconomy. Ship combat isn&apos;t really somethnig that sucked me in, but it&apos;s fun once a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/port-royale-3-pirates-and-merchants/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334717">Expand</a></span>

The campaigns are ok, but they are more to see as tutorials. The most lovely thing for me is that you can annex the towns now for you self, and the town assault is also better now as in port royale 2, where you had to destroy this stupid towers in the water. But there also a lot of features in the game that I&apos;am missing a little bit from the second part of the game. The combat is a little bit different to port royale 2 and in the beginning a little bit confusing, but after 2-3 times it&apos;s also ok. But in whole it&apos;s the money worth!

Despite starting to play a buggy and unstable release, I really enjoyed it. The gameplay is amazing, in my opinion, and by now all the bugs are gone (as far as I can tell, at least).
<br>
<br>The main idea in the game is to either be a pirate and build your own naval empire, or be a trader (my personal preferred choice) and build a huge merchant fleet, and later on gain control over cities. The game takes place in the Caribbeans, during the European colonization in America. Therefore, you can choose to be either Spanish, English, French or Dutch, but you&apos;re not limited to trading with just within your country&apos;s colonies. Also, even for people like me, who aren&apos;t die-hard fans of &quot;Pirates Of The Caribbeans&quot;, it&apos;s impossible to miss the connection. :)
<br>
<br>The trading mechanism is quite realistic, and is a lot of fun, as you need to start small, trading stuff yourself, until you get rich and famous enough to buy more ships and more goods, so you can buy more ships and build businesses in cities, so you can manufacture goods yourself, which is obviously cheaper than buying them from someone else.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re into trading simulation, get this game, it&apos;s definitely one of the best of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/port-royale-3-pirates-and-merchants/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801784">Expand</a></span>
