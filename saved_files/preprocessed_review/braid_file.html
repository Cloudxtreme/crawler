Yes, there is trial and error, and you have to rewind many times, but the game made it so easy and seamless that the payoff and satisfaction you get when you finally nail it at the end is immense and genuine. I think the only way your gaming experience will be hurt is if you consult gamefaqs or some other guide, and rob youself of that satisfaction. Some of the hardest puzzles in the game had the easiest answers, none of them were &quot;vague,&quot; it was just a matter of looking at it in a different light (except for the stars, but those are not integral to finishing the game (wait, can the game be finished?)). The only flaw I saw with the game is its short length and nil replay value,,,,but that has changed with the implementation of the level editor, which I hope will create a thriving Braid level-making community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423686">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now that is in reference to the game play and mechanics. The story and characters leave a lot to be asked for. While neither are big enough issues to take away from the general fun of the game  the story reads like an one-star-highschool-emo-fantasy-novella (poorly) translated from german. The characters look exactly like what they are  an overlooked element of the game.

<br>Music and backgrounds are beautiful. But they are sorely undeserved by the sprites.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967581">Expand</a></span>

There are a few places where quick reflexes are required, but for the most part solving the puzzles just requires figuring out the right sequence of actions. Most of the puzzles are intuitive yet difficult and require a lot of thought to solve. A few puzzles were so difficult that I had to consult a video walkthrough. The goal of the game is to collect puzzle pieces, and then assemble the puzzle on a canvas. The puzzles are artsy-fartsty paintings which are pretty decent, and it is trivial yet fun to put the puzzle together. There are also books in the game that contain pieces of a story. Just like the paintings, the developer is trying to get artsy-fartsy with this story as well. For me the story was too disjointed and &quot;out there&quot; for me, but this does not really detract from the game. The art and music for the game are very good. I played this game with a game controller on my PC, it is probably a bit harder to play in on a keyboard. Overall it is an excellent game that I can strongly recommend. If you like this game, you might like these 2-d puzzle games: Limbo, Vessel, The Swapper. You might also try 3-d puzzle games Portal, Portal 2, and Antichamber.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=3883598">Expand</a></span>

<br>I purchased this game having gotten somewhat tired of the same old games I have been playing of late. Looking forward to a game that has achieved such formidable critical acclaim and what can only be described as one of the greatest, most innovative indie games to have surfaced in recent years. All I can say is what a huge disappointment this was and I would quite simply like to have my money back. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I loved the concept of time manipulation included in the game as a core mechanic... It mightn&#x2019;t be the most original of concepts but still it was a nice core mechanic to fool around and play with. As I eagerly encompassed my very first (and last) play through I quickly became mesmerised by the stunning visuals and the painterly stylistic design. Its touching (if not a little clich&#xE9;d and pretentious) plot leaves much to be desired but is thankfully saved by its storytelling execution as it slowly unfolds and is told in such a captivating and beautiful manner. What I did take away from Braid that will undoubtedly leave its mark is of course its enchanting score. This however for me didn&apos;t save it from the puzzle based platforming tediousness and repetitiveness that soon followed and engulfed my enjoyable (at first) play through. For me the monotonous challenge invoked in this game soon lead to frustration which in turn created an unwillingness and lack of desire to continue and carry on with my progress. Who would have guessed trial and error could cause such anguish and misery. It is a wonderful accomplishment in some respects and I applaud the game&#x2019;s developer for what he has created, but to blindly call this overhyped and incredibly overrated game a masterpiece is to insult the many other praiseworthy indie titles out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=3802806">Expand</a></span>

This is a good game. A great game, actually. The gameplay is smooth, the artstyle is brilliant and the character design is interesting. The puzzles are each unique and fun to figure out. The story is, well, its there, somewhere. My only real problem with Braid is the fact that the creator deliberately made the game without any discernible story. The creator himself has stated that their is more than one interpretation of the story and that he &quot;would not be capable&quot; of explaining it. So, the game has no story. It&apos;s just a bucketful of theories and ideas. But, don&apos;t give up on it, the game does have moral lessons embedded within the gameplay and &quot;story&quot;. The most obvious theme is that the past cannot be reversed. What&apos;s done is done. While the story is different than normal games, and can turn many people away due to its vague nature, it&apos;s still interesting and a fresh take on both platformers and modern story-driven games. In my opinion, Braid shines due to its artistic aspect. The backgrounds in this game are amazing. Everything is, or at least seems to be, painted by hand. If not by hand, then in a &quot;painterly&quot; style, as the summary states. The character designs are simple, but very different and interesting when compared to other modern platformers. In conclusion, I would say that Braid is a unique game with a very vague, poignant and atypical story that will evoke a different theory from every individual that plays. While not a bad thing, it does not follow the traditional building blocks or plot outline that most games go by, and this can make it an unenjoyable experience for some. I give Braid a 7.5/10. Mostly because of how short the game is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2443952">Expand</a></span>

There is not a single thing I can complain about. The story is amazing and creative. In the same manner as Inception and Donnie Darko it really makes you think and leaves a lot of details to your mind. However; I&apos;m positive that more than 50% of the people who play this game will miss the story totally which is sad seeing it is the best story, by far, delivered by a game to this date in gaming history. Some people compare this game to Portal, this is however a very bad comparison. This game is way more. Portal was a fresh game but it was not a masterpiece in the sense Braid is. Portal will be remembered as creative and witty. This game will be remebered as so much more with amazing music, graphics, gameplay mechanics AND story. The game can be too hard for a lot of people seeing it requires A LOT of abstract thinking, problem solving and independent mind. This is because the gameplay depends on your mind and the story depends so much on your imagination. Even more so in the later levels of the game. This game can also be very hard at first try because it gives very little information to the player to why the player should solve all these amazing puzzles. And for someone like me who really wants to be &quot;paid&quot; for doing work in a game it was really hard getting the motivation. However I was so wrong. This game rewards the player so much when he finishes the game by revealing story parts and things that have been so apparent all the way but so well hidden. Thanks Jonathan Blow for making the most amazing game ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2083525">Expand</a></span>

One of the best, if not the best, indie game I&apos;ve ever played. It&apos;s not a superproduction but it&apos;s what a video game should be. In this age of clones of remakes of copies, originality and imagination is not dead yet thanks to games like this one.</span>

And to be honest, I realized something: every person who gave this game a negative or even mixed review is just not getting the concept of the game or too simple to solve it&apos;s puzzles. But let me talk about the game itself. The graphics are real simple yet so beautiful. It really is a soothing game to look at. As for the music, it makes me feel lost in the game. Famous developers now a days don&apos;t concentrate on music and forget that music is part of the whole experience (Not all though, Music in Skyrim is awesome). The music in Braid just makes me feel like I&apos;m in a different plain all together. Honestly, even if the gameplay was crap I&apos;d still give it a 9 just because of the music (sorry for the exaggeration). But, fortunately, the gameplay is anything BUT crap. I found some people referring to it as a Super Mario clone. That is just WRONG. Some other people say that the game lacks fun. Have fun playing Call Of Duty because this game is not for simpletons like you. I had immense fun playing this game and challenging my brain. And I will be honest. THIS GAME IS HARD. I found myself pounding my head and screaming at the screen at some points of the game where the puzzles get so crazy. But did that ever make me quit? Never. I didn&apos;t quit any Point and Click adventure in my life so I am not quiting this. The gameplay is mostly platforming and jumping on enemies. Then it introduces Time Manipulation in a brilliant way. And every world has a theme to it, like one world is all about rewinding time, the other is about stopping and forwarding...etc. The game is beautiful to say the least. As for the story, it feels more or less like a poem. It was MEANT to be misleading and hard to get. Although I still don&apos;t fully grasp the story, It still is an interesting one. But If I wanted to rate a story I would review a Point And Click adventure not Braid. Did Limbo have an amazing story? Exactly. I gave this game a 10 because it deserves it. And it is not over-rated at all. This game deserves the support of everyone and to rate it lower than a 9 is saying that you are a Call Of Duty fan. Which means: Don&apos;t rate our games you gamer wanna-bes.

<br>The trick is the first glance of simplicity wears off quite fast and you are going to get stuck. Often. Braid is by far the hardest puzzle game I&apos;ve ever played. This is truly going to test how patient and clever you are. You are going to be frustrated at times, but at the same time each puzzle is going to give you a great feeling of accomplishment if you are patient enough to solve it on your own. None of the puzzles are dumb or repetitive and each brings a new pattern to uncover and understand.
<br>About the story - I must say I enjoyed the sentimental style and slow uncovering of it, but most of the time I was quite confused and had no idea what it was all about. Well, I definitely experienced better storytelling in games, but this game won my gaming soul just by its crisp gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=4171702">Expand</a></span>

The puzzle mechanic is one of the most innovative I have seen. It involves time manipulation and challenges you to think in new ways to predict the consequences of manipulating time in various ways and use this ability to achieve your goals. It starts out easy and the difficulty ramps up at a good pace. Towards the end the game is challenging even for experienced puzzle solvers. The game is also non-linear in that you don&apos;t need to solve everything in one part of the game to progress to later parts, if you get stuck on a puzzle you can go somewhere else and come back to tackle that puzzle later.

<br>The game has an artistic style that feels completely natural and fits well with the unique style of the gameplay. Graphics and sound contribute further to make the game atmospheric. The story is told in various ways, including texts you can read at the start of each level but also, in a way, through the pictures that you need to assemble to complete a level.
<br>
<br>All in all this is the best puzzle platformer I have played (unless you count Portal as a 3D puzzle platformer) and highly recommended to anyone who likes puzzle games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498124">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This may lead you to think Braid is designed for the casual non-gamer market, but don&apos;t let it&apos;s initial impressions fool you for beneath is a series of devilishly constructed brainteasing contraptions that will have even the most experienced of problem solvers doing a double-take.
<br>
<br>The unique twist of Braid is the puzzles are based around time-travel or in this case time-reversal. Which means there is no fear of death or level restarts. Make a mistake? No problem, just reverse time for as long as you need and correct it. You&apos;d think this might make the puzzles easy, but in fact it screws with your normal way of thinking and actually makes the puzzles more challenging.
<br>
<br>Its probably safe to say you&apos;ve never experienced any puzzle solving like this before and you probably will never again. Creative, ingenious, satisfying, and one-of-a-kind. A must try. 9/10
<br>
<br>P.S. The puzzles might not require a walk through to complete, but the storyline sure did. In the end that might be Braid&apos;s biggest puzzle of them all. Good luck solving that one. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=3455154">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game overall is so laughably bad that I&apos;m ashamed that it got a 90. The design is so bad it rivals Bubsy 3D. The concept of rewinding time is ruined by un-rewindable objects, and you never really truly need it unless you die. Yes there is a good puzzle in world 3, but that&apos;s it.

Although somewhat innovative in its much-hyped time-manipulation mechanic, even though this was merely an elaboration on Prince of Persia&apos;s system, the rest of the gameplay falls woefully short. Much of the game&apos;s challenge comes not from the puzzles, most of which are blatantly apparent; but instead from the extremely fiddly nature of how your character controls, and the nigh-on unavoidable trial-and-error nature of both solving puzzles and fighting enemies. As such, the central mechanic of the game becomes its greatest hindrance - as the game is designed around time manipulation, and the ability to go back and fix errors, it also becomes a nightmare of micro-managing the character&apos;s actions, to the point where in some cases if the character is more than a few pixels off the intended route, or strays just a bit too far in a given direction, he is killed, forcing a rewind. Despite the easily solvable nature of most of the puzzles, several are far too vague, and at least for myself, required consulting GameFAQs.com more than once. The purpose of the jigsaw puzzles is not explained during the game, and neither is the fact that completing certain portions actually makes certain parts of the game inaccessible, necessitating a restart of the game from scratch if the player wishes to see these parts. Also, the plot of the game is deliberately vague, misleading and utterly pretentious and overblown - totally out of place, considering the game&apos;s rather cutesy, whimsical style and direction. Although great care has obviously been lavished on the graphics and music, both of which are a joy to behold, they feel lost on such a teeth-grindingly irritating core game. There are many better examples of progressive platforming/puzzle games with deep and innovative gameplay and great graphics and sound, most of which don&apos;t cost a penny, such as Iji, Within a Deep Forest, Knytt, Knytt Stories, Fancy Pants Adventure, Nevermore 3, Eternal Daughter and many more. I realize most will not agree with my take on the game, but I honestly could not believe there&apos;s a single negative review of it anywhere with what to me seem like such apparent and fundamental flaws in how the game plays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423416">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is regular platform, jump here, jump there, Jump on the evil guys, watch out for the man eating flowers from the pipes. We seen it done before and I could say Braid improved on it, if there was anything to improve on. Braid is just like super mario on this part. So here comes the part that Braid tried to make new, the time concept, which in itself is a great concept but in practice means you do the same thing over and over again till you get it right. The puzzles aren&apos;t so much puzzles as &quot;what am I thinking about&quot; questions, where there is only one right answer that doesn&apos;t have to be logical at all. The game is nice with its strange atmosphere and time modifying parts, but never do you get the feeling you actually accomplished anything, In fact you don&apos;t actually have to accomplish anything at all, if you didn&apos;t menage to get that piece of the puzzle you can just skip it. No strings attached for you to actually finish getting that last part of the puzzle unless you want to play the last 6th world, at which point my patience was well over already. I think Ill just stick to I Wanna Be the Guy, a game which at least doesn&apos;t try to hide you will get annoyed as hell on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423898">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a few things you have to realize before going in, and that it&apos;s a deep puzzle game first of all. Don&apos;t think it&apos;s purely a platformer, because if you do and don&apos;t expect to really use your brain and have good patience with the game then you won&apos;t like the game (as some of the puzzles are absolutely clever in their design with intricately simple solutions even if it seems complex). Also the story, while brilliant and more meaningful than many classic 20th century novels for me, is extremely ambiguous in it&apos;s presentation and slightly pretentious. It is a story that REQUIRES afterthought and &quot;watercooler discussion&quot; with others to really get anything out of it. If you can deal with the above, then you have probably come across one of the greatest games ever made. No one&apos;s seen a progression in game design ideals done so well in a game before since Braid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423896">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s guaranteed to make you think, and while the last level is a bit ambiguous in how it works, it is still a genius twist that really questions the heroics of every game character out there.<br>The puzzles are absolutely genius, must&apos;ve taken so long to come up with, but they provide you with much head-scratching, and a cheeky grin once you&apos;ve solved them. If you can&apos;t, you might eventually feel like beating someone, since the last level requires you beat every puzzle, but if you&apos;re anything like me you&apos;ll just use an FAQ if something eludes you for so long it frustrates you. An in-game guide wouldn&apos;t have gone amiss really.<br>But this game is still exceedingly clever, and very satisfying to play as long as you can work out the puzzles fairly competently, thus I dub it &apos;Best Indie Game Evar&apos;.<br>Oh, and I&apos;d give it a 9.5 except I can&apos;t and I didn&apos;t think 9 was ample justice, so I rounded it up to 10 :).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=1364344">Expand</a></span>

Progressing through the game &amp; solving the variety of diverse puzzles is certainly brain-teasing, &amp; while some may leave you totally stumped at times, Braid is the type of game where as you are running around experimenting the answer will hit you all of a sudden &amp; keeps you coming back for more. You can&apos;t exactly &quot;die&quot; in Braid, but don&apos;t let that fool you into thinking this game is somehow lacking in difficulty. It&apos;s definitely quite challenging &amp; just when you think you have solved it all there are secrets hidden throughout the game. While the game is not that long the experience will certainly leave its mark upon you. Thanks to Braid I now pay a lot more attention to indie games because there are some real gems out there. Can&apos;t wait for a sequel!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=1849322">Expand</a></span>

The plot is a bit vague and confusing at first but the outcome is simply brilliant and well executed, exploiting the capabilities of the medium it&apos;s in. The visuals are aesthetically pleasing and the soundtrack is glorious.

The rewarding feeling of solving the puzzles is comparable, if not greater than the portal series. The different themes of power in each world makes it so that a specific power doesn&apos;t get overused. I loved the songs &quot;Downstream&quot;, &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Romanesca&quot; which I still listen to after finishing the game. My complaints are that the game controls menu or &quot;How to play&quot; menu doesn&apos;t tell you how to speed the rate of rewinding time, which made one of the puzzles impossible to do without finding that out first. Secondly, to get the &quot;proper&quot; ending, you are supposed to collect 8 stars. The first star takes almost 2 hours of waiting around doing nothing, which is pretty tedious and the second star requires you to not complete world 3, which would have been good to know. I think the game should have had arrows pointing to the star in the rooms that contained them, as I find it hard to believe that people don&apos;t use guides to find them. Finally, the story ends by throwing loads of text at you, which left me feeling cold. That said, this was my first indie game and I loved it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705866">Expand</a></span>

I see the resemblance to mario,, and while it has soothing music the whole &quot;forgiveness...princess...non-manipulable&quot; rubbish wehre it tries to be deep, is preposterous, annoying, silly, and stupid. The character looks EXTREMELY odd, his skull is 1/3 the size of his body. That&apos;s not a problem, just odd. The trying to be deep and philosophical part was rubbish and quite annoying. Played a few levels for like 20 minutes. I&apos;ll remember to always check the demo on games as I most likely won&apos;t be wasting my time with this odd game. HOW this got 10/10 on eurogamer I HAVE ZERO idea. people are probably idiotic stoners or into pseudo-philosphical games. The weirdness I don&apos;t mind. It just isn&apos;t something really fancy tha tmuch. couldn&apos;t get into ti. maybe the days of me playing the rubbish &quot;save the princess&quot; games are over.<br>All I could think about was how BAD of a case of One-itis this programmer probably had for some chick that dumped him or that he got dumped by!  The whole intro of the game wreaked of &quot;forgiveness and getting back some princess and manipuable blah blah&quot; the main character even looks like a chump.  Blegh.  Didn&apos;t like this much at all.<br>One thing I noticed and really would like to remedy is it&apos;s CHALLENGING for me buy games I actually really want to play (like portal 2 and assass 2 have been on my top wishlist for AGES).  Granted they&apos;re more expensive, but it&apos;s useless to me to waste money on crap titles like this.  I may revisit this game later but highly doubt ever getting into it because it wreaks of some programmer getting dumped and then making an entire mopy game out of it! WTF!! How eurogamer gave this piece of slinky odd crap a 10???!!I have no idea.  My respect for eurogamer plummetted upon hearing that.  If you&apos;re into the extremely odd graphics, zen-elevator-muzak, and a game coded by some programmer who obviously had serious one-itis, well, then buy this game! If those aren&apos;t your preferences (and they aren&apos;t mine), then don&apos;t.  I think I&apos;m also realizing that if I put time into playing and beating a game these days I want to be a REALLY quality top-notch game, a to-be-classic game (portal series DEF falls in that category) and bioshock 1 did as well, assass sort of did.

Braid is one of those complex puzzles. It started out fun and intriguing, but soon, I lost patience as the puzzles became more unreasonable. The platforming is minimal and only actually found in the last five minutes of the experience. In Braid, you will be able to rewind and fast forward time in order to engineer your way through platforms, locks, and barriers. This appealing mechanic is used in a novel manner, and is implemented elaborately. The artwork is colorful and vivid, providing the player with a well developed background. Even if one does not enjoy the genre of music used in the soundtrack, the songs are fitting of the setting. Braid&apos;s plot is mildly interesting, even though it doesn&apos;t make much sense, nor does it provide much detail. You must appreciate and love puzzles in order to proceed and enjoy Braid thoroughly. I found the majority of the puzzles too complicated and impossible to solve without help. The overall experience is convoluted, jumbled, pretentious, and frustratingly complicated. This is a series of puzzles for puzzle lovers only. Even though the atmosphere of the puzzles along with their storyline are done well, it leaves me with an ultimate feeling of incoherence in the end. It&apos;s not that the puzzles are illogical, it&apos;s that they are overly complicated without needing to be. The process of solving these puzzles is not enjoyable nor satisfactory, and the ending is nearly pointless, being more of a continuation of loose fragments thrown together for no real reason. Braid is also very short and offers zero replay value. If you absolutely love puzzles or puzzles in games, give Braid a try. You might find it tolerable or even enjoy it. Personally, I feel that it is massively overrated and trite. Braid is about absolutely nothing at all. Its only purpose is to be self-important and pompous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2071571">Expand</a></span>

There are only artists.-  Not a bad way to describe what u become in Braid. With the use of the senses a computer can reach, you become the artist. The moment of inspiration triggers intellect and it is provoked by beautiful music and nice graphics. It could be intellectually challenging, but most important... it is creatively challenging. The tools you get may seem like a 2D platform game on the outside to the short of sight, but it wraps a use of thought to peel through the profound dimensional bending to create the enigmatic puzzles with thought provoking mechanics. It is certainly not for everyone, since it requires a creative and highly logical mind with enough space for a theoretical ruled world that lets you dream. It is not as difficult as it may sound, it should suffice to have a deep moment of though, but will stretch your common daily thinking to order events in a non continuous manner with the use of your ingenuity, logic and creativity, so much it seems you design the answer and not the developer. All in a beautiful metaphor of a story, as someone else said, -it is poetry.-  But the poem needs a reader to understand it and feel it to be then considered great and not everyone is sensitive or sensible enough to grasp the essence always. You become the artist that completes the art cycle. So it comes down to preference, but from someone like me that has gone through a plethora of &quot;big name&quot; games, mmos and classic games, i recommend it as one fine jewel with emotional meaning in your drawer. The only problems this game has are; the non appealing art style to some (taste here), the idea that  the way it looks could deceive you and make you believe it is a platform/ puzzle game and that it&apos;s -to my personal opinion-... way too short. It really makes you wanting more challenges and to feel that inspirational moment again over and over. As a puzzler... not the best, as a platform game... not great, as an art gallery, not good. The reason is that it is non, those are the just the mediums used... but not the object of art. So it may not be the most innovative, but it is surely the best at packing the characteristics that it offers... for you to unveil.  As a conclusion, a $9.99 game that sometimes goes on sale for less than $3, that offers such an intimate connection to those that have the plugs is just ridiculous. Most +$60 dollar games haven&apos;t been able to scratch a bit of the itch that Braid cures. It is very much like comparing a great great poem to an long entertaining book in some cases. And... as a poem, it leaves you dreaming, thinking and understanding a little bit more of yourself... with few words, short and not hard to swallow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2026455">Expand</a></span>

The levels can be played sequentially or not, and you are not blocked if you can&apos;t complete a level. What makes Braid excellent is the non-repetitive nature of puzzle: each is unique and non-trivial. Some puzzle can be solved by speculation, others by trial-and-error. You will be coming back to starting levels to find out that what you&apos;ve been playing just taught you how to progress further and solve puzzles you couldn&apos;t tackle before. Puzzle layout is in general very ingenious, and the possibility of going ahead without completing all previous puzzles helps to keep interest high; with experience, you will get back and solve everything missing. All the puzzles are organized along an inspiring narration. From the beginning, you get the feeling you&apos;re helping the character, not just playing him. All texts are well written, style is consistent and the whole storyline is very emotional. The ending was unique, in terms of gameplay and narration. Graphics are absolutely lovely: from Braid&apos;s official site you can even download the original spritesheets and some game assets. Music is very good, different for each world and well matched to the world&apos;s features. Playing Braid has been a very rewarding experience, from the start to the end. I would advise to play it to anyone who love videogames. Braid raised the bar for any game to come, thus I give it a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2073948">Expand</a></span>

<br>In the beautifully created world of Braid you have to solve puzzles, which are built around the main characters ability to rewind time. I never was a big fan of puzzle game, but the level design of Braid is so great, that I did not even peek into a walkthrough, because I just wanted to figure out all the puzzles by myself. Every puzzle is unique, short and builds upon the skills and knowledge aquired in previous ones  every puzzle is perfect.<p></p>
<br>The sound quality of some sound effects is not good, but most people won&apos;t notice. Apart from that, the whole sound design works great, the music is very very well chosen, and I love how the audio engine responds &quot;correctly&quot; when you go back and forth in time.<p></p>
<br>Braid is a unique experience. Everybody  really everybody  should get Braid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942289">Expand</a></span>

Not to mention its brilliant merge of gameplay and story telling, I certainly receive some important messages from the subtle but eloquent story that could direct my life into better way. I really appreciate the authors&apos; sensitive insight into the very minutiae of life, vivid and inspiring. Thanks. For me, the story, the truth and the philosophy it reveals achieve the game maybe because I have similar experience as the author as I am always doing sth I think are more important than others, but maybe I am wrong. Time and young never stop elapsing, sth missed and abandoned because of my inexperience and stubbornness will never come back again, but I have to grow from that. Do right thing in right time, you will live longer and happier. And remember those minorities devote their whole life doing the &apos;WRONG &apos; things for a better future of all of us.

The story had hidden depth that you may not realize until you examine it forwards and backwards, with interpretation left largely to the reader. In a word, this game is poetic. The only reason this does not receive a 10 is the amount of challenge presented in some areas. I ultimately had to look up hints for some areas -- and if you must get help, search for HINTS, not a walkthrough. You will enjoy it better that way. This game will NOT be rewarding for the impatient. If you can&apos;t slow down enough to think deeply, there are many aspects of this game that you simply won&apos;t enjoy. But if you can calm yourself and let your mind relax, especially when things get too hard, you can find a way through and feel a sense of pride for it. You know, kind of like life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=742727">Expand</a></span>

I can honestly say that I have not experienced any of the negative effects that Seamus B. describes. The time manipulation is a joy, getting killed or messing up never was a problem to me as you can easily rewind back to where you were a second ago, you dont have to rewind all the way back to the beginning of the level or anything, you can rewind to the precise moment before you were killed and then adjust your movement so you can continue. Once you get in the flow of the game the rewinding becomes second nature, I wasn&apos;t even thinking about it at all. The puzzles are very good in my opinion, I just wish there were more worlds in the game and more content overall, but the graphics, music, sound, and overall presentation is excellent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423723">Expand</a></span>

I loved it from the very moment I started playing it. The graphics are beautiful, the music fits totally into the atmosphere of the game. The game-idea itself is awesome. Every riddle you have to solve is unique and so cleverly done. There have been so many moments where I just though, &quot;Ingenious!&quot; Especially the star-hunting was very nice - even if I woulndt have found all stars on my own. This game is a very rare piece of art and for now, it&apos;s the best game I&apos;ve ever played. Thank you for creating it! You did a fantastic job!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423757">Expand</a></span>

This game was very lovingly created, with the art, music, play-control and game mechanics being of high quality. I really love the way the game requires exploration and interaction to learn the way it works. The only reason this is pleasurable, however, is because it is done correctly. The puzzles are each an exercise in understanding game mechanics. Once you see how it works, the solution naturally develops. Both the &apos;story&apos; and game mechanics are &apos;explained&apos; in the same fashion by trend and example with moderate ambiguity. I personally did derive something from some portions of the accompanying &apos;story&apos; text, but really the author should be more clear since he was obviously trying to make a philosophical statement. It feels like he was driving at something, then just gave up on making it concrete, in the hopes that someone else would fill in the blanks. Don&apos;t toil too hard on understanding the text. ***SPOILER: Here&apos;s my take: The way I interpret this is that the &apos;princess&apos; is any ambiguous objective. Several stories are told at once to show how people&apos;s personal &apos;princess&apos; can create outcomes which appear ironically different in outcome than in pursuit. Neat game though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=425484">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s amazing how well the developer has done all of the aspects of this game perfectly, with no assistance of a big-name publisher.

That would have been really satisfying. The story in it, almost makes no since whatsoever, and i feel as if some of it was just thrown in at random. another thing I have to complain about is that it was uber short. I beat the game in an afternoon, which i feel makes the game slightly overpriced. Despite my gripes, this is a very fun indi game that should not be overlooked. It way by far the most fun I have had in a while. I eagerly look forward to a (hopefully longer) sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423571">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an artpiece and as anything worthy to be so called, it can be read at different levels: 1) a great puzzle game, build around a strong platform gameplay. What the author says it&apos;s real: there is no filler, every single stage adds something new to the game. Most jigsaw pieces are very easy to pick, but anyway they give you an insight on the game mechanics, so that when facing the hard ones, you have just to figure out how to use the skill you&apos;ve learned. I can&apos;t but applaud the level design. It&apos;s very strange how the game develops: nothing seems to be compulsory, no one says you what to do, and the story content is only between a stage and the others written on books that are about glimpses of someone&apos;s life, not a real story. 2) A great puzzle game, with a very interesting story, with a shocking ending. In the whole game you read books about a love story between Tim (who it&apos;s obviously you) and a misterious princess. It&apos;s looks like a very strong, overwhelming love, that confuses both. But somehow it must be true, because you are going to save the princess... what else can a videogame be about? The whole story is oneiric for sure, the impressionist painting, you are in a suit but in a fantasy world, you assemble puzzle pieces togheter and every time you find out something more about this love story...every room is a metaphore of some aspect of life, and both the gameplay and the looks of the rooms reflect this... for sure it&apos;s a dream. So what is that about? You live it all just like you are saving the princess but in the end... you find out the real truth: you&apos;ve lived the whole story backwards. You tough that you were running to save the princess, but the truth is that she was escaping from you. So you a madman whose love was not returned, and you&apos;ve hidden the truth in the most remote part of your brain (the end of the game). As you arrive in the final stage indeed the last books reveal both the faces of the story: your point of view, and the point of view of the princess. But the story doesn&apos;t goes on, you remain in the loneliness of your solitude, the princess out of your reach. 3) At this point it was already a piece of art for me, but then I&apos;ve played it again from the start, reread all the books with the new knowledge I&apos;ve had about the story, found all but one of the stars, and noticed more details. For example the flags at the end of every stage are in naval flag laguage and say Tim that he should not go on. And there is some reference about the nuclear bomb, and the outside background seems like a great sunset, but maybe it&apos;s a bombed city... and some books describe Tim as a scientist... then I&apos;ve reached the princess, and the nuclear bomb exploded. After that Tim is really alone in his dream/nighter, realising what he has done, learnt that in life some mistakes can be undone... but some can be not. You are one of those responsible of making the first nuclear warhead, you&apos;ve lived an experience that can&apos;t be described. Maybe music could grasp the mood of this experience, maybe some painting could hint the feelings of it, maybe a movie or a book could tell the story... but Jonathan Blow tried to render the whole oneiric experience with an ambixious videogame. That&apos;s a great job, I&apos;m really impressed... and I still had a lot of fun playing with it, as a lot of people who stopped and enjoyed with the first aspect of the game. hooray for Braid!!! p.s. sorry for my english, I&apos;m waiting to emigrate from Italy to improve it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=423649">Expand</a></span>

Braid was one of the first games I&apos;d actually give a 10 to. The story was poetic and compelling, the graphics are spot on, the gameplay is incredible, and the puzzles are some of the most well designed I&apos;d ever seen. My actual score would be something like 9.6 or something. The only flaws were minor. First, there are some puzzles (2) where you will lose a key and there is no way to know which door will work so you have to try it all over again. These puzzles are early on so when the tough challenges come around you are going to be annoyed so much. Secondly, the story although incredible is much too abstract and empty. Even through all the bonus puzzles in the final level you still don&apos;t get any clear picture of the metaphors presented. Thirdly, the hidden stars which are the hardest in the game to find are only there for the experts of the game. There is very little chance that you&apos;ll find one unless you look EVERYWHERE and even then prepare to try EVERYTHING to find them, they are very hard to find. I disliked there design because they were put in places which are just ridiculous. (Watch videos on youtube to find out) Aside from those minor problems the game is a treasure. The demo doesn&apos;t do justice to the rest of the game though, so I do recommend buying it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=83232">Expand</a></span>

The unique controls make it challenging without the frustrating exact timing requirements of many games. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 simple because it was a little short. This game is money well spent.</span>

(A-)<br><br>Braid is a game that appears to be a Mario style platformer. The art/depth/challenge factor of this game is extremely high, so it&apos;s like Mario for geniuses. One of the most challenging games I&apos;ve ever played with a very interesting visual style and backstory, Braid is a relatively short but intense affair that will keep you playing until you solve it or want to toss your machine out the window. The main gameplay gimmick involves your ability to manipulate time, and this mechanic is used throughout the game to solve its puzzles. The impressionist art style, the highly debated story, and the incredibly soundtrack add a lot of extras. There are challenge modes and &quot;hidden stars&quot; for those who enjoy pain and punishment and want to get replayability. Game costs about $10 and is available on the 360 or on the PC Via Steam. Well worth it.<br><br>Here&apos;s the 1UP Review on the 360 version.<br><br>http://www.1up.com/do/gameOverview?cId=3165777</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/braid/user-reviews?user_review_id=2073598">Expand</a></span>
