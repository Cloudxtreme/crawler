A shame, considering much of the marketing for the game seemed to go out of its way to make the DK comparison ... which is quite misleading. Dungeons plays like a Tower defense and RPG mix, but doesn&apos;t do either very well. Your &quot;towers&quot; are split into three main types: creature spawners, gold piles and prestige decorations. Prestige decorations help pull heroes (bad guys) through your dungeon in your intended route, gold piles satisfy heroes need for gold and creature spawners satisfy a heroes need for combat ... while not doing a very good job of actually killing heroes. This is where the problems start to occur. In order to kill heroes after their needs have been fulfilled (the game mechanics reward letting heroes explore until their need bar is full, allowing you to harvest more soul energy from them) your dungeon master must personally seek out and slay the hero before he leaves your dungeon. The level of micromanagement required to keep a steady supply of resources, expand your dungeon as necessary and personally chase down satisfied heroes quickly becomes tedious and overly difficult. The are some interesting ideas here. The interplay between the resource types (gold from expanding your dungeon by mining and killing heroes, soul power by torturing satisfied heroes and prestige point by placing decorative items throughout your dungeon) makes for a intriguing balancing act, but is quite often ruined by side quests the drain your resources for no reason or scenario mechanics that cause a steady loss of resources. The developers seem to have misunderstood what makes for a fun management game. You are too often forced to forgo developing the dungeon *you* would want in order to make the dungeon that is quickest to build. A pace controlled more by user decisions and less by predetermined timers would have been a step in the right direction. The game tries too hard to be challenging (mostly challenging your ability to micromanage) while forgetting to let the player have fun and appreciate what he has built. Hopefully a good modding community will get their hands on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1484274">Expand</a></span>

After downloading the Demo for this game, I must say I was quite impressed at first.  All graphical options were maximized and ran decent on my 2.2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, Win 7 64-bit, NVIDIA GeForce GT 130M laptop.  I expected a throwback to Dungeon Keeper but was joyfully disappointed.<br><br>One is supposed to be able to &quot;funnel heroes&quot; to different objectives based on their needs, but this doesn&apos;t work at all.  If there&apos;s a monster, all types of heroes will converge on it.  A hero who wants only treasure will prefer monsters over treasure.  Heroes who need to &quot;take damage&quot; and &quot;find treasure&quot; seem to fill up soul energy at a fraction of the rate of &quot;find treasure&quot; only heroes.  On top of it all, heroes will usually plow through your monsters, loot all your treasure, and then head straight for your dungeonheart before the monsters can respawn and the goblins can refill the treasure.<br><br>In the end, the heroes don&apos;t do what they&apos;re supposed to thereby leading to a LOT more micromanaging than I believe should be intended.  If the micromanaging really is intended, the interface should accommodate it better.  One is left stuffing prestige gimmicks wherever there is free space because heroes tend to get more distracted by them than they should.  Monsters do a great job of distracting heroes, but often prevent hero soul energy accumulation.  Without soul energy, there is no gain of prestige through prestige item placement.  No prestige item placement means heroes gain levels and get bored of your dungeon quick.  Boredom leads to dungeonheart attacks from soul-energy-less heroes and your unhappiness as a dungeon lord.<br><br>Quickbars make for some helpful interaction, but the game does not pause when you&apos;re trying to setup your quickbars, pick up your talents, view your questlog, or manage your goblins.  This turns a fun game into a frustrating one.  Granted I only downloaded the demo, which is missing more monsters, more hero types (like Champions) and torture chambers, and possible patch updates, but unless this one gets really discounted, I&apos;m going to pass for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1483208">Expand</a></span>

I grew bored quickly with the game, as it&apos;s just a bunch of &apos;hurry up and wait&apos; style playing, and wasn&apos;t quite what the game commercials lead me to believe. Kalypso makes wonderful, offbeat games that are fun to play in their own quirky way, but Dungeons missed the mark a bit for me.  For those that like to spend hours building up power and money per dungeon (and that is why we play games, right?  To spend hours playing them), this is an amazing game.  For me, it just doesn&apos;t quite work, and left me disappointed, wanting to play other, faster paced games. The slow build up has to quick of a payoff before moving to the next level for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1568924">Expand</a></span>

Dungeons is not a bad game for those who aren&apos;t familiar with this type of category. It is actually quite fun. For the Dungeon Keeper veterans among us, there&apos;s is nothing new to see here.</span>

My rig transcends recommended requirements but the game runs so slow that it is almost unplayable.  Even when my patience is high and I spend time with this game I find it lacking in almost all elements.  There is no depth here to keep me interested for too long.  Kalypso needs to take this one back to the drawing board- I think the premise alone is worth another try.  Like with Elemental War of Magic in it&apos;s early releases, the game fails to deliver the promised experience.  At least Stardock admitted to their failure and offered incentive for players to try their 2nd attempt which they are following through with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=2327726">Expand</a></span>

The best part about a dungeon creation type game is flexibility and the ability for you to be creative, but I got very bored with it because it was very linear to start and hard to get in to.  They missed the mark on this game, so much potential.</span>

I didn&apos;t play any dungeon keeper, so I&apos;m not going to make that comparison. The &quot;action&quot; component is still tedious, both for your dungeon lord occupying most of the screen and for the graphics not looking so good up close. You will spend most of the time rushing about from one point of the map to another, preventing you from actually enjoying building a neat dungeon, getting some breath only if you decide to just flood your heroes with monsters and disregard a lot of soul points. To all that, add some random bugs and crashes that keep being annoying. The idea behind it isn&apos;t too bad toh, and it still manages to be amusing at first, it just isn&apos;t a 45 &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1482441">Expand</a></span>

(Its not, apparently.)
<br>
<br>Before I start about the game play I must mention there are some stability issues. There were two patches to apply before I could start playing. I still crash regularly when booting the game up. OK the nity gritty: You are immediately hit with the devs sense of humor. Sometimes a good thing, in this case it is just irritating. I have not found one passage amusing yet. Even in the instruction book they force there humour on you. Even going as far as begging for money, in a joking way naturally.
<br>
<br>The interface and controls are very clumsy and do not feel intuitve at all. It takes a good few games to get to grips with. The voice acting for your gobln minion and the other &apos;bad guys&apos;  drives me up the wall. However you cant skip what they say otherwise you will have no idea what is going on. Not that it matters.  The idea is that you control a dungeon on every new level. (there is a story behind it, however unless your about ten you will find it tedious.)
<br>At the centre of your dungeon is your dungeon heart. If this is killed it is game over. You directly control the dungeon lord. Each level is already set out for you. (My biggest disappointment.) Although you can order a workforce of goblins to dig out more rooms in the rock. heroes enter at timed intervals. There are three resources to collect: Gold, souls, prestige. These are the things you need to make your dungeon better. The general idea is to keep the heros happy, then kill them before they leave your dungeon. They each have a &apos;sims&apos; like happyness bar. Each class has its own needs to fill that bar up. Fighters for example want gold, fighting (taking dammage) and new equipment to keep them happy.
<br>
<br>You then need to strike them down before they leave the dungeon. Upon doing so you are rewarded with the gold they took from you, the gold they were carrying with them and the amount of soul points they have ie. how &apos;sims&apos; happy they are. Each level has ceritain criteria for you to fullfill to gain extra points to level up you dungeon lord or gain extra spells / scrolls. This I feel is the whole driving force behind the game. That is the game in a nut shell. There are a few more side missions ect but I wont give out spoilers on those. There is a campaign type map between games. You cant do anything on it but re-look at areas you have already covered. Just in case you didnt collect all the bonuses. It is surplus to requirement to be honest.
<br>
<br>Over all though it has some strangely addictive qualities. I just struggle to pin point them. Each level takes just over an hour, especialy if your trying to make your dungeon the best one possible. As a side note: for all you dnd guys who loved designing your own dungeon, this will only disappoint. For every one else i&apos;d say wait for a demo.

Whatever greatness this game could&apos;ve attained was lost when it was decided that the most fun could be had by feeding and burping heroes.<br><br>If the game company didn&apos;t want Dungeons compared to Dungeon Keeper, they shouldn&apos;t have made a Dungeon Keeper clone in nearly every regard and then turned it into Dungeon Tycoon. Unfortunately, that is the case, but I will do my best to hold my prejudice at the door, even if Kalypso tried to lure DK fans in and then refuse to deliver.<br><br>First, the graphics are nice, and the music meshes well with the atmosphere. Dungeons pleases the senses, but the gameplay soon dulls them. You must choose between constantly monitoring the level of soul energy in every hero in the dungeon and striking when the time is right, or building a wall of braindead monsters in front of your dungeon heart and letting half-full heroes moronically wander into certain death while you go make a snack. Neither method is satisfying.<br><br>And it&apos;s not very often that a game comes along with the chance to play as the evil mastermind. Sadly, we&apos;ll probably have to wait a few more years before our next chance, because here, being evil somehow means catering to a hero&apos;s every need and whim.    The satisfaction of gathering, housing, and training a horde of minions is robbed from you, as monsters are uncontrollable guard dogs whose primary purpose is to die at the hands of a battle-hungry hero.    Even traps, while dangerous by themselves, are ultimately there to please heroes.<br><br>But wait, isn&apos;t this all done to torture heroes and harvest soul energy? Yes. So you can make better libraries, better armories, and bigger piles of gold for heroes. You are not the lord of a dungeon, you are the head employee at a daycare facility, which for whatever reason, happens to take place in a dungeon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479026">Expand</a></span>

They broke it. they broke it baaad. They used to much illegal substances at their brainstorm where they got those ideas implemented in Dungeons and I&apos;m sure they were stoned then because they not even sound fun so what was the point in selecting them? I mean instead of creating space for your minions so that they could train and multiply to create mass capable to destroy other lords and all those crazy heroes attacking you all the time you&apos;re now creating fun place and statue-like minions for those heroes so that you could charge fee when they want to leave. But it&apos;s not those heroes should have fun - I should! And I don&apos;t. And they knew what they were doing - because even if they would only give your minions possibility to move and you to control them it would be totally different game where you could slain every hero just by number advantage - this would kill whole game concept but would also make this game a lot more fun than is now - and a little more like DK. I&apos;m not bashing this game because it&apos;s not DK - dont get me wrong - I&apos;m bashing it because Kalypso made some suggestions this game will have something in common with DK to feed at DK fanbase (like me) when there is almost nothing in common. Except ripoffs like dungeon heart, graphics, dungeon creation method, crazy heroes and so on and so on. All of this wouldn&apos;t be also a problem if this game would be good or at least medium - but it&apos;s no fun to play and because of similarities to DK you just have to compare and this compering just K.O Dungeons</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1644419">Expand</a></span>

Then I must say that I really regret my money wasted.. I first tried the demo (I strongly suggest to all of you out there who ain&apos;t sure about this game, to do so) but, for me, it didn&apos;t help my choice. At first, it did not made me love it more, nor less. But let me tell you..<br><br>*FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO TRIED THE DEMO AND STILL AIN&apos;T SURE, DON&apos;T BUY THIS GAME !*<br><br>It&apos;s really, really repetitive and boring.. On top of all, it&apos;s really bugged, some scripting events are actually not working at all or working at the wrong time ! Plus, late in the campaign, you get to have so much stuff in your dungeons that the game don&apos;t stop lagging (And thrust me, it&apos;s not because of my computer, I have a computer made to do 3D, worth 10k $)<br>Sure you&apos;ll find the parody talking there and there fun, but the game is JUST about that.. Each and single phrase is stolen from a movie or an other game for somewhere, like Diablo, Lotr, warhammer, Dante&apos;s inferno, etc.. At some point one of the character actually says : &quot;Okay we need to stop that or we will get sued.&quot; The game would have been okay for a 20-30$ game, but it&apos;s not worth it&apos;s current price.. Sure, there is 17 mission, but it&apos;s all the same.. Just play the demo 10 times and you&apos;ll have played the full game.. As everybody else is saying, a lot of points in the game mechanics seems incomplete, some stuff do&apos;nt work at all and lack interactive stuff.. The game even have a fast-forward mode, like if they knew it could be boring to play..<br>So, for all amateur of evil-cool-funny-stuff, you can pass this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1486479">Expand</a></span>

While the satisfying heroes thing was initially interesting, it got old fast, and really limits your options as to dungeon construction. Far worse was the games lack of depth, there should have been many more monsters and construction options. All around while it was fun for a little bit it was a big disappointment.</span>

I&apos;d fall asleep playing this game if I didn&apos;t have to constantly scramble to complete timed missions that are only there to keep you from realizing how bored you are. This game resembles nothing more than a poorly made tower defense game that had a freak child with Roller Coaster Tycoon. It&apos;s really sad, because the game looks pretty and had potential, but some genius thought it&apos;d be fun to pamper your enemies...(evil my a**) while they bumped and stumbled their way into my dungeon, to get happy and then wander into a monster pit. Wake me up when it&apos;s over. No freedom to dug my OWN dungeon, no freedom to research stuff, and my minions aren&apos;t so much minions as they are punching bags with about as much personality. Don&apos;t even get me started on how buggy and unstable this game is. Just avoid this game. If you want to take a chance when it&apos;s sitting on the bargain bin for $5 (which will probably be very soon) knock yourself out, but in no way is a tower defense game worth $40.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1482271">Expand</a></span>

But what bothers me most is that they basically lived on the principle that they would get the older DK fans to play this heap of ****.
<br>
<br>Definitely cannot recommend to any DK fan out there.
<br>
<br>Also, someone else mentioned this being hard while DK being &quot;sleep, then wake up to a victory screen&quot;
<br>
<br>NO, JUST NO. SHAME ON YOU.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=2824505">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, with it looking a lot like Dungeon Keeper, a lot of people are buying it thinking it is a clone of dungeon keeper and have been disappointed. Hence some of the low review scores.  Fact is Dungeons is its own unique game which does pay homage to the older DK series but is a vastly different experience. It that will probably appeal more to Dungeon Designers and Theme/Tycoon game fans more than RTSG fans. The biggest shock for most is that in Dungeons you want the heroes to come in to your Dungeons and lay out a welcome mat for them. Then leading them around your dungeon until they get nice and fat on soul energy that rises when they have fun before you finally move in and kill them to harvest that soul energy and recover their gold. So you see, it has a unique feel about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478663">Expand</a></span>

A steep learning curve but the gameplay and maps are varied once you crack the system.  It is a time sink though with each level requiring a good couple of hours to work through.... this is a good thing, if you have a couple of free hours.</span>

Pity everyone keeps comparing it to DK, which seems to be getting it more negative reviews just because it&apos;s not DK, rather than it being judged on it&apos;s own merits. That aside, the game is a large mix of various game styles. If you don&apos;t have a tolerance/liking for wide but *somewhat* shallow mix of game-play and game styles, Dungeons is NOT for you! However, I personally like Tycoon series, FPS&apos;s, RTS&apos;s, and RPG&apos;s. Therefore, I find Dungeons to be a refreshing mix of all the various genres. There are a few things that are a little annoying (lot of micromanagement), but can be quickly looked passed once you sit there giggling at the silly heroes trapped in your jails, supplying you with juicy soul energy (which, by the way, is used to not only decorate your dungeon, but in doing so, increase prestige, which also increases your power. Very important to keep prestige growing!). Also, it&apos;s important to know the first few missions are indeed very boring. I personally feel the developers could have done a better job at introducing the concepts, rather than taking up entire missions to beat it into your head. The later missions, however, can definitely keep you busy. Important points to reiterate: (1) It&apos;s Not DK. (2) It&apos;s Not DK. (3) See 1 &amp; 2 (4) They never said it&apos;s DK III, but it is similar. Of course, &quot;similar&quot; has a wide number of interpretations on what constitutes &quot;similar.&quot; (5) Reviews need to judge the game on it&apos;s own merits instead of continuously comparing it to everything else. Maybe then innovation will return, and we can see an end to the evolutionary stagnation that has a strangle on gaming; we could even see new genres again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1482521">Expand</a></span>

If EG was set in medievil times it would have been slaughtered for not being &quot;DK3&quot;.  It&apos;s about the same as calling Far Cry 1 a dreadful attempt at Doom 3. They&apos;re both first person, they are both set in modern times, they both contain monsters and they both contain guns, that&apos;s it, the rest is their own.  Likewise DK3 and Dungeons are both in medievil times, both have a dungeon lord, both have minions and both have hero&apos;s, but they&apos;re totally different.
<br>
<br>I think the reviewer from Game Spot didn&apos;t get &quot;his&quot; the morning he decided to review Dungeons, that and he was probably high and/or drunk.  I think it&apos;s really unfair how critics so rarely anymore look objectively at a game.  They rate games purely on their own preference of genre and NOT on the games own merits like it should be.  Two quick games that spring to mind are Starcraft 2 and Redfaction 2.  They got reviewed on their genre and not the games merits or they&apos;d both have gotten a 1/100.
<br>
<br>I wasn&apos;t looking for a DK3, I was looking for a game that offered me building a base inside rock, I loved DK, I loved EG and I love Dungeons.  I love what they did with Dungeons too, it&apos;s VERY refreshing and at the same time so very cute and cudly when your dungeon lord rips apart a fat souled hero, love it.
<br>
<br>Currently there are still quite a few bugs, I think they suffered from bad QA rather than budget constraints since the bugs coming out now are the type to come out during QA, gameplay bugs you&apos;d only really get to if you actually played the game from start to finish and not budget constraint bugs.  That said though, the dev&apos;s are doing a great job of patching.  I think both Kalypso (publisher) and RealmForge (developer) have learnt a lot from this game, they&apos;re both small but they&apos;re doing some really interesting things.
<br>
<br>Really looking forward to see how deep into their dungeon these steps will go</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478544">Expand</a></span>

With all the previews indicating this was going to be a copy-paste of Dungeon Keeper 2, I was really worried!  Instead, Dungeons offers a new and fun twist on a sorely neglected genre.  The humor and style are immediately visible and well-polished.  It is going to be hard NOT to compare it to DK2, as I miss the old narrator, and find the new one sounds like gollum from LOTR (at least that is what I keep seeing in my mind..)  Not great, not bad, merely good.
<br>
<br>The fluidity of the game engine is what I&apos;ve come to expect from non-US based developers.  Very sharp, though with some performance jumps.  The good is that it was entirely playable on my machines with good looking graphics and a crisp UI.  The bad was that I did suffer one crash after playing for 2 hours.  The other 10 hours have been bug-free.
<br>
<br>The game itself is a pseudo tower-defense / real-time-strategy / RPG sim.  One on hand you are carefully designing a dungeon using techniques similar to a tower defense game.  Draw the heroes in, provide distractions while addressing his or her needs and make sure none escape.  Each level likely has a few optimal approaches when all is said and done.  One the other hand you have your Dungeon Lord that can book around the level killing enemies, casting spells, and leveling up to learn new abilities.  Finally, you have several resources to balance in your somewhat time-critical goals for each level.  It is a very interesting approach and works well without feeling like they &quot;threw the kitchen sink at it&quot;.  I also appreciate the awards available for each level.  This adds to the re-playability and gives incentive for building the best dungeon possible.
<br>
<br>My criticisms include the hidden manual (though it was helpful once I found it), the lack of personality to the monsters (much less than DK2, and only partially made up for with the personality of each hero), and the difficulty (I didn&apos;t see a way to make the game easier...).  You do have a sandbox mode that could be a better destination for casual gamers, but I&apos;m not sure they would do well there due to the hidden manual and the tutorial being integrated with the campaign.  The tutorial also failed to draw me in, as it does not showcase the many aspects of the game&apos;s strategy.  I was left going, hmm... what is this game about.  Only after a few missions did it make sense and the fun began.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Dungeons has a solid place in my gaming library and I expect to enjoy it thoroughly.  Sequels - be it in books, movies or games, face an uphill battle to satisfy our desires.  Dungeons, while not quite a Dungeon Keeper 3 - does a heckuva lot better than I ever expect was possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479354">Expand</a></span>

At first this game is indeed enjoyable.  The new system of dungeon creation and hero management provides an intrigue that will keep you going, for a while.  As the game progresses, it becomes overly repetitive.  As you advance into the higher levels you find a game with little more than cosmetic changes, along with a ham-fisted modification to the basic &apos;economic&apos; settings that drive the game.  The game doesn&apos;t change, just the numbers and the graphics.  Move into the final levels and these unrefined realities become even more apparent and annoying.  You will find yourself doing the same things over and over, with little impetus for creativity or diversification.  Some of the levels are maddening with their time constraints, while others flow with a free play style that can be enjoyable, while also a bit boring.<br>On a whole this is a good game, but it is the type of game that has little replay value, and while you may be driven to complete the full campaign, you will be bored and sick of the repetitiveness by the end.<br>Some of the free play maps have enjoyment, from a creative aspect.  And the newest mode from the heroes perspective can be fun too.  Altogether a mediocre, mostly enjoyable endeavor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons/user-reviews?user_review_id=1530853">Expand</a></span>

While an enjoyable game, the strange forced details (such as decorating to unlock abilities) grew strained during play. While the game looks stunning, the gameplay lacks the thrill of a normal tower defense styled game.</span>

You&apos;ll have to endlessly drop silly decorations into the world to build any of the &quot;better&quot; (I use the term loosely because none of the features really do anything) structures -- and your reward for all your trouble is to have to restart in another dungeon and begin all over from scratch. If there was some way to save templates of rooms and drop them into the world, or a slider function that could decorate rooms for you reasonably well so you wouldn&apos;t have to fiddle and twist every damn thing in the world it might also have saved it. You have no real control over your minions, but that&apos;s not a problem like it might be in some other games because your monsters often don&apos;t serve as anything but a speedbump for your avatar or worse, (SERIOUSLY) are merely something you put ahead of adventurers to ENTERTAIN THEM.<br><br>Thats right, in a surprise twist which proves to me the most poorly executed and unfun mechanic for a game, EVER -- everything you put in your dungeon is supposed to ENTERTAIN YOUR INVADING ENEMIES. They are supposed to be wowed by your interior decoration skills and get all pumped beating your minions up and ROBBING YOU... you actually have to ENCOURAGE THIS. When you have (OMYGOD SO STUPID) you have done your job and they are HAPPY... THEN you kill them and harvest their soul energy for the the ultimate payoff -- wait for it -- soul energy you can use to make more decorations. Rinse, repeat. The game at numerous junctures could have been so much cooler and close to... well... an actual game. Have facilities grow on their own... make something about treasure worth having/defending (Treasures with bonuses that conferred to you would make them worth protecting, and if your minions had special gear that made them better you might actually feel invested trying to win it back if it got stolen, for examples.) It is JAM PACKED with un-fun mechanics like (gasp!) your monsters killed an invader -- that wastes soul resources!<br><br>All that told -- it&apos;s not a BAD game... it just isn&apos;t any good. You might even enjoy playing with the pieces for a while, before you grow utterly disgusted with how nothing you DO actually really matters... it&apos;s all in how you lay things out, and a million interesting things COULD have been happening while you play the game, but you can&apos;t enjoy them, or participate -- because you&apos;re too busy putting more wall sconces into your hallways to notice.
