                                        <span>I think some of the people are actually rating this game without playing it. I have hit zero bugs, not one. The game is quite fun, not as in depth as Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, but for a military sim it excels at what it does. I have not tried multiplayer yet so I cannot comment, but singleplayer is one of those games where you mean to sit down for an hour, and play for three or four.</span>

The March of Eagle is a lack-luster, passionless and limited attempt to make a Napoleon-light game in order to make some quick money to support one of their more serious projects. This game represents very little effort in recreating the classic Napoleonic wars. A period of highly active militarism that has still not been adequately represented in a game. Paradox dropped the ball badly here. We should condemn this half-hearted effort. CK 2 and EU 4 show that the team can do a hell of a lot better when they commit themselves to a good result
<br>
<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight:  Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.

I only experience minor bugs like text fails and a few graphic ones in between. But the AI is maybe even worse. I played as Denmark a minor nation and joined the french coalition. For a long time a British or Russian ship or two passed by. I had 8 battle ships so that was ok and i often-ly let them pass just because i didn&apos;t want to loose mine. Then i got the idea to transport some of my troops to Norway because i got invaded there. I built 3 ships and in a matter of days A third of the entire english fleet is there, and the whole russian except two transport ships. I had 11 ships where three of them were as good as useless in battle. This is the things that ruins games. I had planned a future of turtle&apos;ing and the english/russians gained absolutely nothing from this. Furthermore they magicly knew when i got these ships and immediatly send as much as they could to ruin my game. Furthermore the mapping isn&apos;t too good. All the good ratings must be people who play as major nations where it would be more obvious of them to hinder you in building ships. I had never attacked any province from the enemy coalition and they had no reason to think so. Rating it 4 is almost a compliment. I know it seems kind of  to rage over this one thing. But i tried waiting and seeing if there would be a different result but the exact same happened. And i am convinced that there will be more like this. Just like in Victoria 2 they made this pretty much impossible or at least impossible to gain almost any land as a smaller nation. Also they made the campaign too short in my opinion. You should at least have the option to have a longer campaign. Probably want buy a war-strategy game from Paradox ever again.Only thing is that the diplomacy is a bit better than in Victoria 2. Not recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/march-of-the-eagles/user-reviews?user_review_id=2977021">Expand</a></span>

<br>Positive : Napoleon Era , Many type of unit , combat description , Combat engine , No bug :) , Great Multiple play
<br>
<br>Negative : Campaign map only in europe ,
<br>cannot recruit Leader you must be boring with same leader or not to get it new for example if you play in some minor nation you can only get one general or not has it that mean you will be total kill by any nation such as Prussia Austria and France in first day of battle and no chance to win
<br>Siege system and control over province Long time siege and not get control any province if not stable troop in it
<br>Ai is very stupid (More than total war easy mode) they run like cat ,
<br>Province system noob development only 3 building Fort , Civilized development and deploy only coastal has port so it wil be 4 !!!  ,
<br>Economic system trade are not here also industrialization you can only get tax ,
<br>Manpower are hardly to get ,
<br>Unit Movement so slow 3 day they can&apos;t go out from one province meanwhile my paris has been siege by little english troop ,
<br>No DLC No development
<br>Mostly of mod are already dead (you know what i mean)
<br>
<br>i am a fan of napoleon era (little fan) i get napoleon campaign , napoleon total war and many of the game I think this game is good in combat engine or you play with France but bad if you want to change history for minor nation and i hope heart of iron 4 will be better</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/march-of-the-eagles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5821080">Expand</a></span>
