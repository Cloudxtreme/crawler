All of the negatives are right, but then... not all games are shooting for exact realism.  Especially when you consider fs15&apos;s price point.  This game is way less disappointing than Watch_Dogs, and many other huge titles from studios with hundreds of millions of dollars to pour into a game.  It isn&apos;t supposed to be a graphical masterpiece.  It isn&apos;t supposed to be a showcase for advanced cutting edge AI.  It&apos;s supposed to be a game where you build communities who are interested in mid sized farming operations.  This is a modder&apos;s playground.  Not many companies are willing to open their games up, and support the modding community the way FS15 has done.  Allowing modders to tow the line with respect to most of the aspects of the game... is kind of the point.  I always loved games where you had a hand in actually improving, or advancing the game somehow.  Plus, the developers actually DO listen to the community.  If you don&apos;t want that experience; a perfectly rounded cutting edge title, then this game isn&apos;t for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4906782">Expand</a></span>

And don&apos;t be mistaken by a word &quot;simulator&quot;. It&apos;s a 100% arcade. This game has nothing to do with reality. It&apos;s really really bad. Just buy the FS 2013 and you&apos;ll get the same experience but 3 times cheaper.</span>

Logging is great, farming is as good as always, maps are great, machines are great, graphics are great and I love the tire marks on the dirt it stays there for ages it&apos;s great. I recommend you buy it and give it a go, if you have played previous versions get this you will love it.</span>

<br>65 Metacritic score seems wholley unfair based on other games rated higher than this that are not as good I would say this is at least a 70 if not a 75 and once mods start getting released it can only get better. Yes this game is not perfect but i think that just adds charm, if you are looking for something relaxing and untaxing this is the perfect game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4694685">Expand</a></span>

<br>The PDA system is gone and westbridge hills doesn&apos;t look much different after the developers have modified it. The tracks tractor&apos;s leave behind is nice but i think putting an actual foot print (sinking into the ground and leaving a round tire hole) is far more realistic but this isn&apos;t possible to do. The settings are the same as in 13. I think the new billboard for job&apos;s is a nice addition, now just need more different job&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4749214">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not a grind-gamer by nature, so it&apos;s a mystery as to why I will sit for hours on end, drinking coffee and grinding away at fields. But sit I do, pot upon pot of coffee, field upon field of wheat, canola, a little corn to fill the bunkers. I can&apos;t really classify it as boring. I guess if you have a technical nature like I do you will find the machinery interesting.
<br>I live in a farm county and never payed much attention to the tractors and such roaming the fields nearby, mainly because I&apos;m not a farmer. But now I notice all of them as I drive by. Passing the local equipment supplier, I find myself thinking &quot;Hey, they have a 10.9 in the yard. I wonder if they have the large header for it. I&apos;d like to climb inside and push buttons.&quot; and &quot;why don&apos;t they make those manure spreaders larger?&quot;
<br>Learning, I guess is what draws myself to this. I&apos;ve spent a bit of time on the net looking up details of the machinery, how they function, etc. Even the growth cycle of corn.
<br>Do I recommend this for everyone? No. Action junkies will probably not like it. If you like making artificial money in an artificial world and get some sense of accomplishment from it, you probably will like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5540177">Expand</a></span>

The physics are fairly impressive but not quite the game Spin Tires. The UI layout looks better and is easy to navigate. There are allot of tools and machinery to acquire and use, many different crops some of which require different methods to harvest. Overall it is a very enjoyable experience however could be improved in the textures, shaders and physics aspects as it really doesn&apos;t push my system at all with everything set to max, i mean the game size is less than 3GB, take a very graphically pleasing game like Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor thats 45GB.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=4683911">Expand</a></span>

A relaxing game where you can sit back and take your time, there&apos;s no bombs blowing up.  Nobody shooting at you no timers running out before you become a charred corpse.  You simply live the life of a modern farmer, from plowing, to running the harvester, A-Z it&apos;s all in your control.  I personally love the game so much, I got the Saitek Controller with the side panel and pedals.  Adds a whole new level of fun to the game.  Also making the forestry aspect of the game MUCH easier to control.  In my opinion well worth the money if your budget allows.  Graphics are great, it&apos;s stretchable over multi monitors although I prefer one over 3.  Definitely worth the money for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=6232316">Expand</a></span>

Farming Simulator 2015, an extremely excellent game concept with the worst implementation possible, I have honestly never played a more frustratingly game in my life than farming simulator 2015. Frustrating for many reasons, where do I start? Firstly and probably most important is the game itself, did &#x201C;GIANTS Software&#x201D; find programmers who had just finished high school? The vehicle one drives in this game has literally 0 % attention to detail, not that it is a car game, but one does spend about 80 % of the game time in a vehicle, the only improvement since FS2013 is that you are able to see the speed you drive inside the vehicle and if they were able to script that, then why didn&#x2019;t they just take the time to script the current time of day to the clock inside the vehicle? The other improvement since FS2013 is that you can see in your mirrors, wonderful idea, but you only see the ground which isn&#x2019;t very interesting or helpful when driving a vehicle, would have been nice if one could have been able to adjust the mirrors or if they attest positioned it so it can be useful. More about the vehicles, logging, forklifts and excavators, probably the most frustrating things to operate in this game right next to the HEM 583 Z (a very time consuming implement for people who are very bored with their life&apos;s, this implement also breaks trunks into wood chips every now and then). Colors &#x2013; very nice that one can now select the color of one&#x2019;s harvester head (not all of them, in fact just the heads used to harvest corn), but how pointless since you can&#x2019;t order anything else in a different color. I just googled if it is possible to use a joystick for this game and apparently it is, will go and try this out in a bit and pray that it is actually good. Offline LAN? Nope and why isn&#x2019;t this possible? It is as if &#x201C;GIANTS Software&#x201D; comes from a different planet or are attempting to revolutionize gamers, do they honestly think that everyone in the world has access to internet and even if they did, that it is fast all over the world? Besides that, things like, the American flag in the game, which I personally have no problem with, but wouldn&#x2019;t it make more sense to allow the users of this game to put up the flag of their own country, else just change the name to USA Farming Simulator. The wind pump which is at field 16, makes a terrible noise, I mean what the hell? Feels like something from the walking dead. If you honestly want to bug someone with that noise, at least script the wind pump to have an on / off button. Placeable structures here once again, which basically ruined FS2013 is here again, now I haven&#x2019;t tried to use it in FS2015 because the point should be to play and make money and buy cool stuff with that hard earned money, which was pretty much ruined in FS2013 (Place a few placeable structures, put the game time to fast forward x 120 and afk while you get rich). I have a lot of other problems including the ones mentioned above, but feel like it would be a waste of time to complain for much longer since I already lost time actually playing this game, all and all, GIANTS Software, please contact me or anyone in this world with a imagination for advice on improving this game, not what I excepted from any game in the year 2015. Everyone else, don&#x2019;t waste your time or money on this game, not worth it, I&#x2019;ve played more exciting web based games than FS2015.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5316211">Expand</a></span>

My issue with this game is that it calls its self a farming &quot;simulator&quot;, but it is as close to farming as Mario Kart is to a driving simulator.  It lacks any real challenges that a real farmer has, and if not for debt to the bank, there is no challenge to the game at all.  It cannot even be called a game once the debts are paid as there is NO opposition.  It confuses farming with ranching, logging, and power generation.  It also includes unrelated seek and find games (hunt for coins?) for additional entertainment.  From the time fields are seeded it takes around three days for harvesting even when plant growth is set to the slowest setting (now that should end world hunger!).  Weather has no effect on plants, and only prevents harvesting during rain/snow, but has no effect on yield its self.  There is nothing to do with money once all fields are purchased, and there is no longer any need to buy more equipment.  There is no end game either.
<br>I do love the graphics, and the fact people can create, and add their own mods (nice!). It is family friendly and possible to co-op parents with kids together as a family game time.  I enjoy the offline gameplay, as I am not always in an area where there is Wi-Fi.  There is a nice variety of crop choices to utilize a variety of machinery.
<br>I just wish that all crops could be available in the same game without moding them in, i.e.; orchards, grains, fruits, and vegetables, and a better and more diverse market place to buy and sell, including all types of fertilizers, seed, etc.
<br>I think this &quot;game&quot; is poorly thought out as a simulator, and only onced over as a &quot;game&quot;.  It seems to be a forum for tractor manufacturers to display their equipment and to people who may be interested to hopefully print out their logos to pin up on walls.
<br>Farming Simulator is a wonderful opportunity to educate and inform people just how complex, and difficult farming really is, even with todays technology.  It can demonstrate why the fluctuations in food prices in the market, and why farmers always seem poor.  As the game is now, just after a few weeks (game time), I was earning $1,000,000.00 a day as a power generator and not even farming.  NOT REALISTIC!  I would&apos;ve retired after just a couple weeks and moved to the Bahamas.  Farming is hard work, but this game does not even suggest that.  If the &quot;Simulator&quot; was dropped from the name, and just called &quot;Farming 2015&quot;, now that is more appropriate for what you have here.  I wouldn&apos;t be able to wait for the 2016 release to see just how much easier it will be in the future.  Maybe there will be robotic tractors, so I can do even less.
<br>As I simulator I give it a 2 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best)
<br>As arcade entertainment (not a game) I give it a 8 on a scale of 1-10 (again 10 the best)
<br>So I averaged the scores to a 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=5800963">Expand</a></span>

Harvest a crop, take it to a store/point of sale, plant a crop, fertilize the crop, harvest it and start over again - that is the extent of the game. Besides the multitude of realism faults with the game there is NO motivation to continue other than make money. Crops are VERY LIMITED, interaction is non existent, poor almost non existent support from GIANTS, rain, snow does nothing, no irrigation/watering, vehicles don&apos;t impact crops, growth rates are the same for all crops, equipment failures are non existent, maintenance is non existent, non existent seasons resulting in unrealistic weather changes that do nothing, tractors can traverse sheer cliff drops but cannot break through a fence, time acceleration is restricted to speeding up time but nothing else - everything else moves at a normal rate.  MODS may or may not work with most failing.  &quot;Missions&quot; are repetitive and unrealistic that can produce higher returns than your crop.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is a very boring, repetitive, uninteresting waste of money and GIANTS will not do anything to improve it what so ever, despite many improvements being needed and known by GIANTS.  Although the game is called Farm Simulator (misleading in itself) GIANTS places the majority of their efforts on things other than &quot;FARMING&quot;, the name of the game.
<br>
<br>Conclusion is simple, Farm Simulator 2015 is a waste of money, unrealistic and very very boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-15/user-reviews?user_review_id=6008805">Expand</a></span>
