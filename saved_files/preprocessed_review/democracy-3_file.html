<br>
<br>The UI and general presentation is neat but plagued with some bugs. I had to kill the process several times due to hidden and unclickable buttons. Sometimes it breaks after saving.
<br>
<br>The game hides behind an initially perceived complexity with lots of statistics, neat focus groups, flow diagrams and pie charts. The perceived complexity is quickly replaced with the feeling of a pretty simple simulation.
<br>
<br>For me the gameplay consists of getting rid of the red bubbles by making obvious policy choices. Increase taxes and make up for it in give away policies. After that the country is stable and debt free. The only thing that follows is pressing next and wonder about the volatile behavior of the global market.
<br>
<br>The good news is that the game is fully moddable and the simulation parameters can be changed very easily.
<br>Which means the developer and the community can fix this and make it more challenging.
<br>
<br>They have to add more events, decisions, policies and the ability that policies can interact with each other by other means than the interest group. For example policies that exclude others or create an explosive situation.
<br>
<br>At the moment this game has no replay value. Every round seems to be the same.
<br>
<br>I really like the presentation and I will revisit this after some time has passed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3640746">Expand</a></span>

It honestly feels like, even when you create the best of paradises, your cabinet will always be out to get you, and won&apos;t bother supporting you when you need them most, which is after all the policies you want are in effect. It&apos;s nice for burning a few hours on, but not really worth more than a few hours.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just really annoying that you can&apos;t eventually somehow sway people in your cabinet to think a certain way after pretty much brainwashing an entire country into whatever your whims may be. You&apos;d think they&apos;d learn a thing or two and actually step down so people who care about what you want done will step up and help out. In other words, this game forces you to lose after awhile of balancing. While on paper that kind of thing sounds like fun, but not when you just want to run your own country without listening to someone scream about how ineffective the road system is while people are busy clocking into work from home anyway.
<br>

When I saw the title, I said to myself &#x201C;Oh, wow. Simulation politics. That&#x2019;s not something that you can find everyday,&#x201D; and of course, downloaded it immediately (Steam)
<br>After an hour into the game, there&#x2019;s 2 words conclusion I can say here: Never again
<br>Seriously though, in all honesty, I&#x2019;ve never been one as a fan of politics. Even so, I&#x2019;ll try to give the review as unbias as I can. Besides, there are something good in the game.....somewhere. Anyway, here&#x2019;s the review:
<br>The good stuffs:
<br>Educational. Yep, who would&#x2019;ve thought that games can be educational (...wait, think I heard that somewhere before....oh yeah, it&#x2019;s in 1996). Basically, you would do as the politicians do when they actually work &#x2013; governing the countries. You can control the existing policies, make new ones or even cancel it if you want.
<br>These have various effects towards the people that you look after and true enough, like the reality, you can&#x2019;t be a total saint by making eveyone happy. There are some events that may or may not be the result of your conducts &#x2013; like pollutions for example. You raise the car tax (please, if any of you politicians are here, DON&#x2019;T actually raise the car tax), people will use cars less, less CO emission and the air will be less polluted. Simple cause and effect chains that I find rare in games.
<br>The bad ones:
<br>Oh boy, where to start. Right, for one, the game&#x2019;s lack of graphic innovation. I&#x2019;m not comparing this game with other types of games, the others would have leave Democracy 3 in the dust in terms of graphic. I&#x2019;m talking about the comparison with it&#x2019;s prequels, the 1 and 2 and I actually played both of them briefly to compare. Seriously lack of innovation, and the time difference between D3 and D2 is around 6 years. If the developer added some kind of 3D moving man, showing reaction to the policies, I would&#x2019;ve call it an improvement but not D3. No point in making a series of a game but each of them more or less the same with each other.
<br>For me, this game lacks replay value. I only played for an hour and I already uninstalled it. It gets too repetitive, too soon. Even the goal is repetitive, you only play so that you will be elected again for the next term. And for what? For the same repetitive tasks you have to do again? There&#x2019;s no campaign in there or even mission objective. What&#x2019;s wrong with having objective like you have to lower down pollutions or increase country&#x2019;s economic value by the next term? And no, when people said it has a ton of depth, I say it&#x2019;s only about a kilo. Depth of datas shown in the game doesn&#x2019;t mean the depth of replay value is the same.
<br>Well, better make it my last point, running out of words here. Anyway, last and worst, the price. THE.PRICE.IS.BULL.(bleep). For around 200mb size of an appalling game, the developer expected the price of about $25? Are they drunk when pricing this game? I don&#x2019;t condone to piracy but after this game, I came to understand why people actually pirated a game at all. This sort of attitude done nothing to get people&#x2019;s support to buy a game legally.
<br>Well, here you go, my review. Bear in mind that it&#x2019;s my personal opinion. If we&#x2019;re of the same mind, good. If not, I don&#x2019;t care. If you&#x2019;re gonna troll, you&#x2019;re a baby. Welp, time for another round of Call of Duty i guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3939525">Expand</a></span>

There are no graphics to speak of and is a very basic game in that sense but gameplay feels a little complex and overwhelming at the beginning. One thing that annoys me is when you start doing really well (eg getting 80% of the vote) then you start having extremist (eg plots from liberals, religious, conservative etc) wanting to assasinate you,  and they usually do,  it ruins the game for me.  At least just have an attempted assination once every year or two instead of every turn (evetually they are successful).  If the Trade Unions are against you you should have them organising strikes, or if the religious are after you have them get you excommunicated from the vatican or something instead of this everyone are assasins blanket policy.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t make sense to me that your voter popularity at the very start of the game starts out at zero when you are first elected either,  and the other side has like 40%.  Maybe if you lose an election you could be in opposition and watch the other party in government reverse all your hard work and you can gain votes with opposition policy.
<br>At the moment I don&apos;t see much replay value after you&apos;ve played each country once.  And once you have your utopia (or as close as you can get to it) you are assasinated!!!  Can get repetitive.  Its a good idea and a good start though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4585345">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-There are like 5 random events and they happen  over and over(Gay marriage, adoption etc.)
<br>
<br>-Even if you have maxed out police and spy funding, you still get assasinated swiftly unless all groups of people are happy. Political assasinations in the EU are not THAT common.
<br>
<br>-Lowering taxes rarely makes anyone happy. For instance you may lower petrol tax to 0% and have maxed funding for road building, no bus lanes etc.. but motorists are still unhappy! WTF

<br>
<br>I found this to be too easy (in terms of being re-elected, which is really the only major goal you&apos;re trying to achieve each term). Also not as complex as it first looked (another reviewer mentioned this already) since it&apos;s actually rather basic once you get down to it.
<br>
<br>Big thing is that there isn&apos;t much to do  while there are a myriad of policy choices made available, most are extremely negative and will often result in serious consequences so essentially there is a &quot;right&quot; way to play this game. There aren&apos;t enough things to do (in my honest opinion) to justify the price point. Sure there are nice graphs and the UI is actually decent given the amount of information thrown at you, but beyond that and implementing/editing/removing a policy every now and again there isn&apos;t anything else. Plus while all the displays and the information given are nice, they&apos;re fairly obvious and anyone who has gone to college/is going to college will find nothing surprising here in terms of educational value  as one reviewer has said it is really a high school level game.
<br>
<br>After every quarter or &quot;turn&quot; there is maybe some random event that occurs or some decision that you have to make, but there really isn&apos;t much variety after a little while and the random events are often just that  completely random and illogical given the situations (at least in my two playthroughs). Plus once you decide you don&apos;t really get a notification or anything about what happened, which would have been nice. I got really bored after maybe 45 minutes (after starting and not finishing two different playthroughs)  never playing this again (unless they seriously add a lot more content and make it less of a snoozefest) and I will reiterate: not recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668992">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have spent many an evening trying to turn the USA into an atheist, liberal state, or convert France to hardcore capitalism, sometimes with mixed (even deadly!) results, but always enjoyed it.

<br>-Graphics improved from last edition
<br>-Overwhelming amount of data, all linked together. Lots of choices, graphs, spreadsheets
<br>- It&apos;s fun to play around and it&apos;s not terribly hard to achieve your goals: you can make the USA a communist country, or France a capitalist heaven easily, once you get into the mechanics.
<br>-Lots of mods available for free, both on Positech forums and Steam.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Too short. You won&apos;t play this game for more than a week, at best. It&apos;s incredibly easy to get all the achievements and once you tried even the more extreme policies, there&apos;s no reason to play it again. There are no scenarios. There are random events once every 4 years, but they have little to none impact on the gameplay. After a while, every playthrough just looks the same and you&apos;ll probably look for mods.
<br>- No editor. Modding is either done through Excel (lol?) or through an unofficial modding tool created by fans.
<br>-Terrible price tag: 23&#x20AC; + 10&#x20AC; of DLCs.
<br>
<br>If Democracy 3 was priced at 5.99&#x20AC; or even 9.99&#x20AC;, I would&apos;ve probably rated it 7 or even 8, but 33&#x20AC; to get the full game is just too much. By the time I&apos;m writing this, this game costs more than Skyrim and we&apos;re talking about something made entirely of spreadsheets and graphs, doomed to be left unplayed in your Steam library after a couple of weeks.
<br>
<br>For now it&apos;s a 6. I will eventually raise my rating if the price drops and/or if Positech implements an official modding tool.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4408607">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On my second play trough, I was assassinated with explosion from a liberal terror group. Can you imagine that? liberal, terror group?! And what worse is, they attempted to kill me multiple times before, and yet my presidential guard can&apos;t do anything about it!

I played it straight since I downloaded it last night I just got so absorbed into the game. The achievements are a little easy depending on your beliefs and values but the ability to play around with multiple different possibilities is great. I can see exactly where I want my country and political views to go in the real world and be able to predict possible results in a shorter amount of time. Only players that are into politics and the strategy behind it will truly enjoy this game. Does seem lacking but having been so absorbed that I stayed up all night seems to remedy that for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3665069">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The exact same issues that afflicted the previous game are present here  certain actions seem heavily weighted towards negative reactions no matter what you do, meaning that despite the myriad of apparent options available to you, there is in reality only one or two actual ways to play the game. Want to be a fascist dictator for a laugh? Tough, as it&apos;s next to impossible to do before you&apos;re assassinated or whatever. You have to be a &quot;good guy&quot;, either stereotypically Democrat or Republican. Anyone hoping for an in-depth political simulation of Tropico here are going to be badly misled.
<br>
<br>The exact same bugs exist too, which is really confusing as you&apos;d think they would have been eradicated. Random crashes plague this title more than any other I can think of, creating a sense of panic every time you press to continue your game as there&apos;s every possibility you&apos;re about to lose the last 10 minutes of considered gameplay.
<br>
<br>But the biggest disappointment with this title is just how dull it is. There&apos;s no diversity, no unexpected events, no real emergency scenarios, no tests of logic and reason. Nothing. You&apos;ll play this game an hour and you will have seen everything there is to see. And given that I&apos;m the target audience for this title  someone who craves something with more depth than found in the millions of FPS clones that has plagued the last decade  it is massively disappointing.
<br>
<br>This is a high-school educational game that has got too big for its boots and is attempting to fleece cash from actual gamers by pretending to be a serious title. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3644266">Expand</a></span>

Some people say its boring and repetitive, if so you can easily change some of the sliders, try running a country on 200% difficulty and trying to manage social services vs your debt, its hard but very fun. It is similar to Democracy 2 but its graphics and interface have been updated quite a bit and its now very visually appealing. The polices would be the same but there are some new ones with room to turn it into a proper socialist or police state than you could in D2. Overall &#xA3;18.99 is a good price for this game and with mods for new countries and policies coming out rapidly you can always play beyond what the vanilla game can provide and you can easily mod and add your own countries too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3769904">Expand</a></span>

<br>The mechanics themselves are almost the same as Democracy 2. There are more assassinations. There&apos;s little actual complexity, it&apos;s still the same old stat-juggling game. I won most games by just ramping up maximizing political, ramping up income tax at the start of the game, increasing things like education, science, school, police funding. No complexity. There will be assassins that try to get you, but assassins come no matter what.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3669602">Expand</a></span>

Democracy 3 is nothing like civ and to be honest I kinda wish it was. The game is all about really the policies that you set in place for the country your in control of. Sometimes I really do think regardless of if alcohol laws I put in place or the amount of time I put in to stopping wars It really just makes someone more pissed off. I could give everyone two-thousand bucks a piece and also punch there most hated enemy and still someone will still hate that I raised a tax by one percent. This game is just like actual politics and that&apos;s all it is a president simulator. I like the idea of the game and really I knew from the moment I started that this game was not the type of game for me. I really get what the devs were going for but in the end this is someones favorite game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3767814">Expand</a></span>

Positech&#x2019;s game sits you  as head of a country with the ability to change policy. Whether you are the United States, United Kingdom, or any of the other countries  you&#x2019;ll get the chance to move a country in any political position you want.
<br>
<br>The game is simplistic in scope, but offers a wealth of information. Political capital will be the currency and determines everything that can be done in a turn. The amount of political capital will be based on the previous turn. The population will respond based on what you&#x2019;ve done and the current political spectrum of the Nation. As an example,  Playing as the United States  I completely disenfranchised most of the population in the nation by removing all welfare benefits.
<br>
<br>The game is a point and click with turns. Every turn advances the game so many months until an election occurs. The election is straight forward, showing your base and the base of your opposition to see how energized they are. A graph dictates who is head and the winner. You can even have a display and break it down by type of voter, and reason they voted.
<br>
<br>There is a litany of information that can be garnered throughout the turn. You can see where voters are based on their type (liberal, Patriot, etc.), by issue, and other statistics.
<br>
<br>You will be forced to choose between a rising deficit, deficit reduction, popular opinion, and your own conscious in the decisions made. There are realistic consequences and the countries react relatively as well as you expect them to.
<br>
<br>The only real &#x2018;gripes&#x2019; you can have about the game is perhaps that it is a point and click game  meaning that this is more a relaxed feel. I would suggest listening or watching something while you play. Additionally, the game does sometimes can show bias. I found that capitalist and conservatives were far more willing to assonate then any other counterpart. This was even when I ran highly conservative and capitalist regime. It seemed stacked and gave an inaccurate message.
<br>The only other piece is the price tag. 24.99 is a bit steep for a point and click. Especially when you consider the price of alternative games are ten dollars lower. That being said, the game is well worth the money if you can afford.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>-	Fun game play, interesting concept
<br>-	Challenging, high replayability
<br>-	A lot of strategy
<br>-	Beautifully put together.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>-	Price tag, a bit overpriced for what is offered.
<br>-	Game can seem biased</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3802117">Expand</a></span>

The game centers around playing as the leader of a country, you then make and change policy which affects your country.

<br>The game gives the play a very novel setting to play in (how many other games are there that let you play politics?) and is executed quite well with superb UI, fantastic user feedback and giving the feel of a micro-manager&apos;s dream. Additionally with modding support and a fairly active community, there is the potential for massive amounts of content, but as of today there are not many quality mods out.
<br>
<br>However, there are a few bugs and there is a little bias on the count of the author (as different people with different view points would view the effects of different policies differently) however it is clear he has tried to minimize it. Additionally this game is very clearly NOT for everyone, some may find Democracy 3 very engaging, while some might find it a snore fest, however I still found it quite enjoyable and would recommend it to most people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805071">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Democracy 3 turns that picture into dull accounting, making the reelection your sole goal, and insidiously validating the fact that it&apos;s good to compromise with you opponents to gain a share of the votes, and take advantage of people&apos;s values and commitment to fool them.
<br>
<br>This game does not hide the fact being reelected will be hard and you will suffer. In fact, your eyes bleed at the very moment you see the general view and your policies. No scaffolding or ramp-up here. You don&apos;t start locally, lobby for one issue, push a particular law and move your way up to the top House of Cards style ; without the sex and murders. No, you are already in the President&apos;s shoes, knee-deep in a maze of interconnected and complex &quot;stuff&quot;.
<br>
<br>I understand this is a clear choice from the developers, and even if I formely enjoyed the idea of playing Democracy 3, it was the fastest disappointment I ever had in games.
<br>
<br>Hopefully, real democracy can be experienced in the real world, so you can pass this game without regrets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4961418">Expand</a></span>

Every so often you have to win an election to stay in the game. To win the election you have to have the majority of voters vote for you. All good. BUT.  Yo can get assassinated by extremists. OK, fair enough. But I created a liberal paradise with all the policies you&apos;d expect, but with a strong police force and lots of surveillance (to remove organised crime, violent crime etc). I won two elections and was just about to win a third. My police kept warning me the corporates were unhappy with my high tax rates. Fair enough. I had game &apos;awards&apos; for equality, eco friendly, health care, education etc - then a &apos;liberal extremist&apos;  assassinated me with a bomb. With no warning. Game over.  Not sure how realistic that is.

There are a few very unrealistic consequences to doing too well, which kinda makes the game stop up completely if you get into those situation, but if you try to play average instead of creating an utopia, you&apos;ll be fine.</span>

<br>Democracy 3 takes you through what seems like a promising political career, but what you realize is only a pile of kissing up to the various parties that have power.  Just like real life.
<br>
<br>Waive the mandatory drinking age?  The masses love you, but violent crime spikes.
<br>
<br>Legalize drugs and prostitution?  Liberals and socialists are fin, but the religious and conservative bunch really want you out of office then.
<br>
<br>Playing through, I never thought I would do half the things I ended up doing, especially since at the end, I was trying to run a country similar to Communist Russia, all while looking back, wondering what had gone wrong.
<br>
<br>My main complaint with the game, is that while you can change many of the the stats about your country, you can not change the religious population.  Many times I&apos;ve had to change what would have been a very good plan for the country because of strong opposition from the religious front.
<br>
<br>All in all, I&apos;d call this a solid game.  7.5  Will play again kind of thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3829677">Expand</a></span>

I mean it portrays people in ways that aren&apos;t just two-dimensional. Another nice thing is that you can edit the game, which I have started doing. Its easy to pick up and play. However, there are significant issues with the game that can&apos;t be ignored. Most of these is the price. To justify paying &#xA3;19 or $25 for a game, the game would have to be good, with cool graphics and most of all content that means you would replay it time and time again. Instead, you may play it 7 times and never play it again. It is extremely simplistic and simple. I mean you can increase healthcare spending but this is not accompanied by anything; no graphics just words for you to appreciate what you have done. This is only the beginning of the problems, Whilst voters in the game aren&apos;t 2D, they aren&apos;t particular complex either. Someone who is a Keynesian would be a Socialist in the game. A Socialist doesn&apos;t nationalize any industry though, which is strange because that is the definition of a Socialist, someone who believes in an economy which is collectively owned. In some regards, this shows the game to be particularly American. There is also significant Left-wing bias to the game. Capitalists and Conservatives are seen as heartless monsters that like to complain about any sort of government interference or liked &quot;gated communities&quot; or disliked disability allowance. Religious policies are always negative; either opposed to science and create a technology backwater or create ethnic tension. I mean religious countries can never be scientific can they? Oh yes, India is the world&apos;s largest producer of scientists. I am a Socialist myself but Socialism in the game is very simplistic but so too are the capitalists who like to privatize everything. But the Liberal/Conservative thing is perhaps just as bad. Most people exist between being true-Liberal and true-Conservative. I would say I am quite conservative on crime and family, There again I hate the death penalty and agree with equality for ethnic minorities. So I am a mixture but perhaps would exist in the &quot;Conservative&quot; section, despite my disgust of the death penalty. But people aren&apos;t just Liberals or Conservatives; perhaps they are a mixture. The game also completely ignores voting systems and considering it is supposed to be called &quot;Democracy&quot;, Having a systematic electoral college in say America would really add to the game. But instead to is just a collection of calculations of who votes for you, who votes for the opposition and who doesn&apos;t vote at all. This is the dumbest thing that has ever walked in a democratic arena. Firstly, you could easily win 75% of the vote in the game when in real life, you are unlikely to achieve more than 55% in a two party state or about 40% on a good day in a proportional based system. There aren&apos;t even constituencies or anything; just you getting half of the vote will establish your victory.
<br>
<br>Overall, it is questionable whether paying $25 is worth it. Sure, the game is good and is quite fun, but the content really does lack a lot of features which justify the $25</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944075">Expand</a></span>

At first it seems complex but then it become a little mundane once you understand how it all fits together and the impending timeline challenges for each country seem to be the same.
<br>
<br>The game needs a bit more balance. Once you figure it out you can stay in power indefinitely in a virtual dictatorship, which quickly gets boring. The beginnings are often the hardest, but after the first election it gets easier and after the second it become a cakewalk.

<br>A brilliant concept that unfortunately is somewhat self-limiting. The game does a great job of communicating the immense complexity of political action and the necessity of compromise. For this alone, I would recommend that everyone give the game a go at some point in their lives simply for the experience of being able to expand ones own perception of how government works. It&apos;s hard to have empathy for politicians, but this games almost makes it possible.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s realism and depth simultaneously makes it frustrating to play. If you do as you wish, you will almost certainly get assassinated. If you do compromise, the only goal you are working toward is eventual re-election. Certain people will no doubt love creating there own goals and toying with the knobs and dials in and of themselves, but I felt I had gotten everything I could out of the game after only ten or so hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/democracy-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6851959">Expand</a></span>
