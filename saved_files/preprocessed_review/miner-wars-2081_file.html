I found the 6 DOF combat to be lacking. Yes, the ship can rotate, but I have not seen the up/down button, the equivalent of jump and crouch in action games, that would make flying in this game much better.  I&apos;m not really enjoying the combat mechanics that much. There&apos;s no shield. Once the enemy hits your armor, you are SOL - there&apos;s no way to repair a ship, unless you find one of the repair boxes or buy a repair kit. There&apos;s no rechargeable shield, and I find myself replaying battles too many times, even on normal difficulty. I tried the mining part, and am not really impressed by it: the screen shakes and there&apos;s black dust covering half the screen. This gives me 5 credits, if sold, and my ship can hold about 16 units. A repair kit costs 6000 credits.  I really don&apos;t see myself mining for hours in this game.

<br>The game has its bugs. If you want to set the resolution, you have to set it manually in the config options. The story is a little odd, but fun. The gameplay is pretty fun though - if you want something challenging and not in this era of regenerating health and easy, pathetic fights, you are looking at the right game. Its pretty difficult on normal

<br>Only thing is you need to be patient to work out how to play and give it a chance, because the first hour I died a hell of a lot until I figured out what I was doing and really enjoy it :)

I can&apos;t understand how an Indie Developer thinks he can win the piracy war with measurements like this. It is not like I am never online or have an unstable connection - it is a matter of principle. I enjoy singleplayer and play online only with friends avoiding the abusive masses. Why do I need to log into a server on the other end of the world for playing offline and have my gaming experience maybe tainted with lags and connection issues? I don&apos;t expect it, but I don&apos;t take chances either, because we deal with an Indie here. I doubt that this developer is capable of having a worldwide network to ensure the maximum gaming performance for everyone.
<br>
<br>I give 3 points because the game itself seems to work, but any more would be praising the devil.
<br>Ubisoft learned its lesson - hopefully Keen Software House will learn it before it is too late.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/miner-wars-2081/user-reviews?user_review_id=2807320">Expand</a></span>

Only part I&apos;m missing is more intuitive controlls and better xbox controller support. Graphic, gameplay and story? Amazing? (graphic mostly). Really good job! Now I hope more people will join deathmatch games - it looks like most promissing part of content. Space battles in new NYC are just epic!</span>

Then the game came out and it wasn&apos;t just bad, but it was bad in the most unethical way possible.  It promised more than it could deliver -- 360 degrees of missed opportunities.
<br>The only resemblance to Descent may just be the out dated and virtually pixelated textures that the game uses, just one part of Miner Wars overall poor art direction with 3D models that make Quake look advanced and colors schemes that came out of a box of Trix.
<br>Couple this with poor voice acting of a script that a 12 year old wrote along with controls that are inconsistent and just as non-responsive with a graphic engine that makes the most advance GPUs cry and you&apos;ll wonder what DRM that requires a constant internet connection is really protecting.
<br>
<br>Recommendation:  Stay FAR FAR away from this forsaken game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/miner-wars-2081/user-reviews?user_review_id=2814312">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is mostly about story/campaign and little on sandbox, but why would be that a bad thing? This way the developers resurrected 6DOF gaming, made it available for everyone, even those who would be lost in sandbox. I have heard they are not done with Miner Wars, so who knows what will come next?

Obviously it&apos;s indie, graphics aren&apos;t great and the story is a bit hard to follow. But good on them for coming up with a totally different story/setting, and completely free 3D environment. It feels like the old game, Descent, but more fun. There&apos;s not much of a tutorial explaining things (none, in fact) and during the first mission when you start looking at the key mapping, it doesn&apos;t pause and the baddies keep shooting you while you&apos;re trying to work it out. Loading times are also very long, but they provide an excuse. Sound is fairly tame, and there&apos;s no sense of real physics. When you stop your spaceship&apos;s throttle, your ship suddenly stops. Not at all realistic, but the alternative would make for trickier gameplay. Time will tell whether it&apos;s worth $20. I&apos;m going to play it some more, for sure. It is different, at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/miner-wars-2081/user-reviews?user_review_id=2798100">Expand</a></span>

On the first day I couldn&apos;t even play the game as it has always on DRM and couldn&apos;t connect to the servers.
<br>
<br>On the second day:today: I was able to connect to the servers but only to be able to play single player if I wanted to play multiplayer I would have to contact the games customer support. First thing in game I was dropped into a lame mission with zero orientation as to the mechanics (though I was able to figure them out with a bit of effort on my part) other than this is the history. The mission glitchy forcing me to roam around before it recognized I was on the objective marker, mining is tedious and not made up for by the destruction physics which aren&apos;t even used but exist more as a novelty or for multiplayer. When I finally finished the mission the travel mechanic was entirely unituitive forcing you to have to zoom in on a tiny square of the world map to which I didn&apos;t care as I believe I had finally gotten to the open world part before the game crashed. I honestly suspect this game is still in beta as its mechanics don&apos;t seem to work very well.
<br>
<br>In conclusion the game doesn&apos;t work correctly, has always on DRM that is not advertised, and is missing core mechanics from the steam store advertisement. Avoid this game there are way better space sims coming down the road.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/miner-wars-2081/user-reviews?user_review_id=2858247">Expand</a></span>

Only thing I&apos;m missing a little is more precise vendor system  now I&apos;m not motivated to mine asteroids and sell ore to merchants, because it&apos;s easier to fly to some sector, wait for solar wind and then just loot corpses  And also (what isn&apos;t usual in space shooters), there is an amazing story  it&apos;s even funny and serious! Sometimes a little bit clich&#xE9;, but still fun to discover what&apos;s going to happen next. Listening to dialogues makes me feel I&apos;m part it.

<br>For an</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Miner Wars is a sad attempt to revive the 6DOF genre. When it was announced with words like &quot;we love Descent&quot; and Dan Wentz (composer of the Descent 2 MIDI soundtrack) joined in the hopes were high but in the end if failed to deliver. If I&apos;m referencing Descent a lot it&apos;s not only because it defined the genre but because the developers brought it up time and time again.
<br>
<br>For an inspiration they took the history of Descent 4&apos;s cancellation: it was supposed to use the GeoMod engine that was then used for Red Faction. So what they did was making it about miners with destructible environments but with 6DOF gameplay. It&apos;s not the worst somebody could come up with but in combination with an uninspired cold war scenario plus something about aliens it really shows they were really uninspired.
<br>The &apos;fully destructible environment&apos; only applies when you&apos;re not flying through stitched together prefab corridors which is 80% of the time. It is possible to mine resources and the voxel based asteroids will reshape accordingly which is kind of nice but it&apos;s novelty wears of really quickly when you discover how tedious and not worth your time it is.
<br>
<br>The graphics are a bit too colorful for my taste but overall OK. The level design sadly doesn&apos;t create any good atmosphere except for feeling lost. Descent made use of different textures to suggest where up and down is and rooms would vary in color and shape which helped navigating greatly. In Miner Wars every room is one of a few big prefabs that repeat time and time again which makes exploring levels a nightmare, especially if you consider there is no map. To make up for this they implemented a GPS to point you to your next objective but hitting the key every time you pass through a door isn&apos;t that fun.
<br>
<br>The gameplay could have salvaged it but it&apos;s the worst thing about the entire game.
<br>To begin with it&apos;s a quiet fast paced game which in it self isn&apos;t bad. What is bad is the fact that switching weapons requires the use of the mouse cursor so when you run out of ammo in a tight situation you can&apos;t do anything but hope to survive while selecting another weapon. Repairing or refilling oxygen requires you to open the inventory which again is mouse operated. In theory you can just pick up items and use them immediately but then you&apos;re wasting their potential. It&apos;s nice to be able to save powerups for later but the way it is implemented was a really bad design choice.
<br>
<br>But what finally kills it is the actual combat. To begin with every enemy is marked so there is never a suspense when or where enemies will come from. Basically they spawn somewhere based on triggers placed around the level, take a direct route to the player and then freeze in place because they have no AI. If you wait in front of a door the enemies will pile up and can &apos;easily&apos; be dispatched every single time. Only problem with this is they are pretty good at aiming and dodging bullets that hit instantly is pretty hard so good luck.
<br>
<br>It gets 2/10 points for the use of voxels, the decent graphics and for being a playable game if you look past all it&apos;s flaws. The rest is taken away by bad writing, awful level design, non-existent AI and for not delivering what was promised in the first place. The Miner Wars MMO never happened.
