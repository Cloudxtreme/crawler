<br>
<br>But the game itself is almost unplayable: the first thing I noticed is the strange unit selection scheme. Drawing a rectangle across the screen should select all units inside the rectangle, right? No, that is for putting units into squads, but only units of the same type, except for commander units. It doesn&apos;t add anything to the gameplay, it just makes things more complicated.
<br>Then I noticed the units horrible pathfinding. If there is any obstacle between them and their destination, or a tight corridor, they&apos;ll go somewhere completely different, or take a step back, or refuse to move at all. This is especially awful if you take into account that in this game, bases are tightly built clusters of buildings, literally touching each other, or they don&apos;t have power. My units also ignored attack commands regularly and didn&apos;t pursue enemies. Sometimes they stop just ahead of their target and take fire until they are dispatched.
<br>
<br>I had reasonably high hopes for this game, but it&apos;s a complete disappointment. The most amazing thing is that even though it came out in 2008, there are still patches coming out for it. The devs apparently care about their game, so why haven&apos;t they fixed these glaring issues yet, or given up entirely?
<br>
<br>TLDR: Don&apos;t buy this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunage/user-reviews?user_review_id=6019629">Expand</a></span>
