Personally I prefer the gameplay on this to PES5 but I can understand how some casual gamers would be dissapointed. Managerial aspect of the game well thought out. Easy the best out there for realism!</span>

I actually like the style of gameplay, it&apos;s return to it&apos;s arcade roots is a very refreshing change from the previously over complex control systems. The presentation is excellent, as always, but again as always it&apos;s let down by the core gameplay. When are EA going to realise that gameplayers demand a little more than scripted events? Do you like realistic ball physics? Good, so do I and that&apos;s exactly why I won&apos;t be playing FIFA06 anymore. Everything in the game is scripted, from the insect-fast reactions of AI players interceptions of your cleverly selected passes and through balls to the commentators announcement that the keeper has the ball safe in his hands before it&apos;s even halfway to his goal are all clear indicators of the cheap programming practices employed by EA in preference to the real ball physics seen in Konamis far superior series. A huge let down and a massive massive dissapointment. As I said at the start of the review, so much promise but ultimately there is nothing here for the serious soccer gamer outside of the licenses and the presentation.
