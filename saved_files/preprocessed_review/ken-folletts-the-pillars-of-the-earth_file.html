<br>Great story telling Not so great execution
<br>The Pillars of the Earth is a point and click adventure game based off of the book with the same title
<br>The game is set in 3 parts, though currently only the first 7 chapters are available, and takes about 5 and a half hours to complete with the other 14 to be released in December and early 2018
<br>Here you play as 3 characters, you start as a mason whos in the forest trying to find a way to take care of his family, but for the rest of the game you play as a monk trying to save his church and a forest boy that lives with his #singlemom
<br>The game takes place in 12th century England, and the story is told with a mix of cutscenes, story book choose your own adventure type moments and dialog within the world&#x2026;
<br>The game fits perfectly in the middle of a traditional point and click game and a telltale game&#x2026;
<br>Not too much of the collect and combine items nonsense&#x2026;
<br>But the other parts about running around the world until you find the right item or talk to the right person just reminded me how little I missed these moments in adventure games..
<br>The gameplay isn&#x2019;t quite as painful as those ,ore traditional adventure games.. but still I just didn&#x2019;t find these moments to be fun, of searching different rooms or looking for items in the environment to report back and find more&#x2026;
<br>of connecting clues to progress the story with other people&#x2026;
<br>and its made worse by the games constant loading when you go into a new area or even when you bring up the map to remind yourself the direction you should be headed&#x2026;
<br>a marker on the map where the character youre supposed to speak to btw would&#x2019;ve been appreciated&#x2026;
<br>this is the only bad of the game though as the story telling and characters are great, I was intrigued with with it all
<br>and because of a heavy religious theme the game sort of makes you think morally about decisions youre about to make&#x2026;
<br>I felt bad for choosing to do bad things,
<br>and I stopped myself from lying at times in moments that I should have
<br>this is a sign of great story telling and world building&#x2026;
<br>I cared for the people my decision was going to effect
<br>ive yet to run into a moment where I felt like my decisions has made a huge difference in what was to come&#x2026;
<br>but that didn&#x2019;t stop me from thinking before I acted&#x2026;
<br>Though the Pillars of the Earth is held back by its adventure parts.. this is still a decently enjoyable but very compelling adventure game with beautiful visuals that fans of the genre shouldn&#x2019;t pass up.
