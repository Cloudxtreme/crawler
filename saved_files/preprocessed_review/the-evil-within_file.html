<br>It&apos;s a great game and a true successor to RE4. But this game should not have made to the pc platform in its current state.

The controls are clunky and unresponsive, you can&apos;t bind keys properly and the default keybinding doesn&apos;t make any **** sense.

If you have a next gen console like the PS4 or the XBONE. Buy this game  on one of these and enjoy.

<br>
<br>It is a broken product so i can&apos;t really give it anything above 0,even after you uperformancenlock the FPS and make it full-screen the game runs like crap and there is no visual quality to justify the horrible .
<br>
<br>it is not even a horror game it is as horror game as is Dead Space 3 is a &quot;Horror&quot; game</span>

<br>The graphic quality of this game is sub-par. Do you still remember the Wolfenstein New World Order? Yes, the game has the same engine as this game. So, what&apos;s the problem? Bulky game size with a blurry and low quality texture in game even with all graphic settings maxed out.
<br>
<br>The game play elements bring nothing new to the table, e.g. some collectibles to collect for upgrading player ability, stealth-oriented game play with insufficient ammo. Generally the game play style is just like the last of us, but with a dull and boring plot. If the terror elements of the story was on par with those classic Silent Hill, then this game could be great. However, the plot element is so thin and the atmosphere is so weak due to repetitive environment and lack in story depiction. So players are left with WTH is going on here most of the game.
<br>
<br>Finally, the game play time for this game is short. Some chapters may only last around 15 to 30 mins. If you are experienced gamer and good at stealth, you probably can beat the game within 5 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4598591">Expand</a></span>

I will say that the graphics did look nice, though the brightness slider in the beginning wasn&apos;t accurate at all, even after I &quot;cheated&quot; a bit and made it a bit brighter than was suggested, I still couldn&apos;t see anything in some scenarios.
<br>
<br>The gameplay, however, was drab, and boring. Not much fun at all, nor t he least bit scary. It seems to have tried to take the sneaking aspect from games like Outlast or Amnesia, but the AI doesn&apos;t function well enough to make the game scary. I&apos;d often find myself hiding out under a bed for five minutes, only to get out when the killer walked away, but have to return to my hiding place when he turned right back around and resumed the same post.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599121">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is also badly optimised for PC! Moving the cursor around feels very much like I&apos;m using an analog on a controller. It&apos;s not so bad when I&apos;m &quot;looking&quot; in game. But when I go to aim it&apos;s like I&apos;m using a controller.

<br>I can&apos;t bind &quot;interact/confirm&quot; to the enter key. I can&apos;t even bind sneak and sprint to my side mouse buttons which is what I would use by default.

At first it seems that game is interesting, but when first enemy shown, and you try to fight with him - all became so unprofessional. Because of weird camera you can&apos;t see half of the screen and you step at dangerous trap every 5 second.</span>

<br>
<br>That said, I&apos;m pleasantly surprised by the story. It&apos;s deeper than I thought it would be, and it clicks nicely.
<br>
<br>All in all, 9 or so/10 for me. My gripes are mainly on the tech side, which I have a feeling is due to id Tech 5 and them not knowing what to do with it. In many ways it surpasses RE4, and in some ways it also falls short. But The Evil Within is better than RE4 in my eyes. That may change in subsequent playthroughs, but I love the creative effort put into this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609624">Expand</a></span>

<br>Keybinding is a mess, and it feels like a constant fight against the games desire to be played with a controller.
<br>
<br>The frame rate is a joke at 30fps. Yes, it can be unlocked, but we shouldn&apos;t have to do that, it should be an option in the game, instead of a lazy port which requires you to be a techie to get the best out of it.
<br>
<br>The controls are outright bizarre. It&apos;s a difficult enough game as it is, but when you combine that with having to drag your mouse around like it&apos;s stuck in tar and it&apos;s a recipe for disaster, and you simply have to use a control to get anywhere close to the meat of the game.
<br>
<br>The game doesn&apos;t look too impressive either, certainly for a 2014 game. It feels like a game from the PS3 era. Frame rate drops are persistent too, camera angles throughout vary between making little sense to being utterly stupid in their placement, and this is one of the only games to give me an acute feeling of motion sickness throughout; when a game literally makes you feel like you&apos;re going to vomit, you know you&apos;ve done something wrong.
<br>
<br>But for all that, there&apos;s a decent game lying underneath the problems. For PS4/XB1, this could very well be a good title on a platform which obviously demands controller support and therefore doesn&apos;t feel gimped by ONLY offering you that option, but PC gamers have different expectations and this title doesn&apos;t meet them in pretty much any way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599967">Expand</a></span>

<br>Why on earth would you cap the game to 30fps. I almost puked 20 minutes into the game. Not because of the gore but the motion sickness and low fps. Can be fixed in the console. The game should run at 60fps by default. Points lost.
<br>
<br>The only reason why I gave this game 3 points is because its a good game. I was really excited when I saw the trailer for this game. I love survival horror games but I have to be able to play it on my ultrawide monitor or it will lose its immersion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4597891">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have not finished the game but have played for long enough to form an opinion of it ( chapter 4 ) even though my play-through is still in the early part of the game I can safely say its great . Its a very good survival horror and has a wonderful atmosphere about it, great areas/settings and all the elements you would expect in a survival horror, traps, puzzles, danger, low ammunition levels and cool and original enemies. plus you are tense as hell while playing .
<br>My approach to the game is to use stealth as much as possible but the game changes gears in a split second so its not an option a lot and that&apos;s cool with me .
<br>
<br>Haters gonna hate but I would recommend this game highly and its cheap on PC at only &#xA3;34.99 compared to &#xA3;50 on console .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4638304">Expand</a></span>

Agreed - the roundabout way of overcoming the aspect ratio and the fps cap are awkward but have not given me any issues or technical glitches - its nice that the option has been considered for us PC gamers. Love the story line so far instant classic.</span>

This game is the true successor of Resident Evil 4, Shinji Mikami at his best. The Evil Within is a old-school horror, with stunning atmosphere and nicely balanced gameplay. The graphic is well done, very detailed, especially the environments. The music is unsettling and the the sound effects are creepily good. Level design is really well thought, every chapter have some unique characteristic, never repetitive or boring. The lacking of ammunitions keeps the difficulty to a good level, never frustrating, but challenging. The longevity is also quite good, it took me about 19 hours to complete the game. Once cleared, the game will unlock some new weapon such as the rocket launcher and the machine gun. Also the Model Viewer will unlock in the main menu, so it&apos;s possible to look closely to all the characters and creatures of the game.
<br>My only negative note is that sometimes you encounter some hidden track that kills you inevitably. But fortunately there is an abundance of checkpoints, so the player doesn&apos;t really need to redo very long parts of the tevel.
<br>I really recommend this game to all Resident Evil fans and whoever likes classics horrors.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4663926">Expand</a></span>

The problem most people seem to mention comes from the balance between horror and action the director of this game promised to recreate. Most people didn&apos;t want the balance anyway.They want the old 100% horror formula. The action segments might help with people who hated the tank controls and fixed cameras of the past but most real survival horror fans would see them a little to over the top. It&apos;s also inexcusable to release a game with a 30fps lock.This practice screams reference from the devs for console counter parts compared to their pc versions. Apart from that if you like your &quot;horror&quot; mixed with over the top action and lots of shooting the game won&apos;t stop from having loads of fun. I hope for a more traditional survival horror sequel since the story seemed to have premise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=5442363">Expand</a></span>

Right now the PC version is at a 5.4, while even the crappy PS3 &amp; 360 are both at a 7.6. There is NO possible way that the PC version is that much worse than either of those. It has FAR better graphics than either of them (and also better than the PS4/XBone), the framerate is unlockable (it runs at 30 fps on ALL consoles and it NOT unlockable), and the black bars are removable ONLY on the PC version. I&apos;ve seen a number of terrible reviews here  that say get it on a console because the PC has black bars. Well guess what idiots... the console versions have them also &amp; as stated, they are NOT removeable on the consoles. People calling this a bad port either have a terrible system or haven&apos;t even played the game - because it actually runs better and looks better on PC than on any other platform. Now, regarding the gameplay, I personally love it. Does it have stealth? Yes, but that&apos;s not all it has as some of the bad reviews state. Again, have they even PLAYED the game outside of the first two chapters? I would guess not because they would know the game takes several turns in gameplay styles in different chapters. Regardless, the game being either fun or scary is subjective. The point of my review is to get across that people should ignore the reviewers giving this bad ratings because it&apos;s a &quot;horrible port&quot;, because it runs poorly, or that it has black bars. Those people are wrong and completely clueless. How it has a user rating that&apos;s significantly lower than even the PS3/360 versions (which are the worst - especially in the graphics department), when it&apos;s even better than the PS4/XBone versions is beyond me. It clearly the superior version of the game, in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619893">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s challenging but fair. It&apos;s visually appealing and has some of the most impressive texture art in my recent memory. That doesn&apos;t mean that the textures are from the sharpest end of the stick it&apos;s just that it seems that thanks to idTech5 almost all the textures contain unique features in them. Level design is very organic. Sound and music is ok but not very remarkable. Monster design is very good. Controls are fairly responsive after you active the 60 FPS mode. I didn&apos;t find the film black bars problematic but rather played the game without them. The idea is that there are effects based on taking in and out the black film bars on top and bottom part of the screen. Adjusting FOV allows you to see around. The game has few design flaws regarding the stealth elements. With ammunition very scarce that is the perfect recipe to some really challenging difficulty spikes inside the game. Plot has been written in such a way they player should play the game through at least twice to understand the plot in its entirely. It has lots of interesting details and stuff that recent games have not had. Overall it&apos;s a great game and very much something akin to a spiritual remake of Resident Evil 4. Additional note about Windows-PC version is that you might have to adjust the game through the console to make it work the way you want even with the patch that fixed many of the issues reviews here at Metacritic complain about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4652417">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played a lot of games, challenging games, easy games, fun games and frustrating games, and this one most definitely falls into the latter category. The Evil Within is supposed to be scary, but it&apos;s ridiculously bad controls make it just excruciating to play. I tried enjoying this thing with a mouse and keyboard, an xbox 360 controller and even an xbox one controller, but the problem is the game, not the input device. The developers wasted an inordinate amount of time animating the player&apos;s movements to the point where normal actions like turning around, walking sideways and combat are painfully clumsy. To make matters worse, this game forces you into a bunch of stealth gameplay... That is in third person... Wow, now that sucks. Seriously? You have to decide whether you want to use your lantern to see what the heck you&apos;re doing but if you turn it on the monsters see you and ruin your day. Oh but you can&apos;t move around in the dark either, because some douchebag mischievously placed bear traps in every level that make you roll your eyes every time you step in one. But it gets even better. There are instant kill proximity bombs all over the place and as soon as they start beeping you&apos;re already dead. I said screw this game after the third time one of them blew me up. I could waste 1000 hours of my time trying to learn all the little tiny intricacies of this game just to be able to play it, but I&apos;ve got to go to work and school. I don&apos;t want to play a game if it isn&apos;t fun. So to say things in another way, the Resident Evil 1 remastered remake on Steam has BETTER controls than the evil within. Now that&apos;s bad. The controls and terrible camera angles completely ruin this game.

The texture pop-in gets really annoying, but that&apos;s more of an engine problem, Rage had the same issues.
<br>
<br>Worst offenders gameplay wise are sections, starting in the middle part of the game, where the camera inverts the scene, your already imprecise controls are also inverted and any misstep means insta-death. Great, thanks and thanks for making me reload, change from save location to game, walk to this area, endure two cutscenes before retrying this annoying section, as there is no immediate checkpoint before...
<br>
<br>Most of the game plays like a Resident Evil 4 / Resident Evil 1 / Silent Hill 1 Hybrid with slightly worse controls. I could deal with this, the old games were fun even with bad controls, but this game delivers nothing exciting, nothing new. It&apos;s seems more like a collection of deleted scenes from a various number of horror films and games. They just don&apos;t seem to fit together. Every chapter for itself is okay, but I always get the feeling I had already played or seen this before. Been there, done that. The game just seems uninspired, which is strange as the creator&apos;s previous work was bursting with creative ideas. And it does the modern horror thing of &quot;how much blood, gore and other disgusting stuff can i put on the screen before i become a parody?&quot;. Also, the game has very few scary moments.
<br>
<br>It does have some good moments, especially the chapter heavily borrowing from the cancelled &quot;Resident Evil 4 - Hooked Man&quot; demo version. Or the Silent Hill 2 like Boss fight a little earlier. However, picking up my earlier criticism, for every scene I can point to some game or film which did almost exactly the same, only better. Or more original.
<br>
<br>All in all, neither deserving praise nor condemnation. If you like the genre, give it a try once it reaches 20 bucks or less and you find nothing more deserving for your money. Definitely not worth full price. 6/10 for gameplay, 4/10 for content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4671677">Expand</a></span>

The game plays solid, so if thats all you care for, I&apos;d say go for it. However:
<br>
<br>- The upgrade system is completely useless
<br>You don&apos;t usually carry a lot of ammo, so being able to cut the reload time in half isn&apos;t much of an upgrade. Sure, you can upgrade lots of different aspects, but the game could have done perfectly fine without the upgrade system. All in all it feels a little forced. (Maybe so they can market the game as featuring &apos;RPG elements&apos;?)
<br>
<br>- The stealth system is completely useless
<br>Or at least, doesn&apos;t work at all. Or at the very least, doesn&apos;t work like the developers intended it to. If shooting my 160db revolver doesn&apos;t phase the monsters but throwing a bottle to distract them does, there&apos;s something fundamentally broken.
<br>
<br>- The hidden traps/bombs are completely useless
<br>As they stop beeping when you crouch, which doesn&apos;t make sense at all. They probably did this to make the player crouch more. (Maybe so they can market the game as featuring &apos;stealth elements&apos;?)
<br>
<br>- The story is dull, boring and generic
<br>
<br>- It isn&apos;t actually all that scary
<br>
<br>- The graphics are dated
<br>
<br>- The game is a little repetitive
<br>Press lever, door opens, mobs come out.
<br>
<br>- Sometimes the game is not being logical
<br>which for me totally ruins immersion. In the beginning your leg gets badly injured and you spend half a level limping about - one cutscene later you&apos;re fine again.
<br>
<br>- Ending is ****
<br>
<br>- Last but not least: The PC port is utter crap
<br>Lots of other people have mentioned this - it&apos;s badly optimized, locked to 30fps and has a weird aspect ratio. And no, console commands to fix things are not an excuse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4606515">Expand</a></span>

Let&apos;s talk about these: both games are GREAT, especially Wolfenstein. And they are destroyed, only because of id Tech 5. Now you successfully ruined The Evil Within on the PC with that unusable game engine.
<br>
<br>My problems with it:
<br>
<br>- the games are horribly big for nothing
<br>- the system requirements are unreal for the graphics
<br>- speaking of unreal, UE 3 looks a million times better
<br>- games with id Tech 5 are nearly unplayable on AMD cards
<br>
<br>So. I pre-ordered The Evil Within at first, than I looked at its requirements. They were pretty high, but since i don&apos;t believe these I checked the engine (yes, because of Bethesda as the publisher). As soon as I saw that it uses id Tech 5 I cancelled my pre-order, and I really hope a lot of people will ask for refunds for this catastrophe. The PC version is basically unplayable. Because of the technical issues I was not able to try the game. No matter what I set in the options it won&apos;t go higher that 15-17 FPS, as every id Tech 5 games. That makes the game pointless to play.
<br>
<br>I know that my 60$ won&apos;t do any damage to a publisher like Bethesda, but I&apos;m really happy that I downloaded this game from torrent. My 60$ is not burned this way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612446">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game was supposed to be scary, well it&apos;s far from it. Watching the Exorcism backwards on mute is much scarier, in fact, playing Kirby on a monochromatic gameboy is scarier. There&apos;s gratuitous amounts of blood though. Gallons and gallons of it. What we have here is a quantity over quality conundrum, so the only way this game is bound to scare you is if you&apos;re a hemophiliac.
<br>
<br>Maybe Mikami should get in touch with the developers at Creative Assembly to get some pointers on how a scary game should be made. In fact , if I was Japanese I&apos;d try to lure him into one of those Japanese prank shows, where they scare the living bejesus out of the participants. He deserves it, because he&apos;s released such a disappointing schlock  of a game that I waited months to come out only to be kicked in the teeth by a steaming turd boot and splashed with 3893829829283 liters of HIV infected blood.
<br>
<br>So in the vein of conan o&apos; brien (clueless gamer)...If a high score was a possessed ghoulish pasty white girl with a rotating head, and a really bad score was a chainsaw wielding inbred brute suffering from acromegaly. Then this game is a little girl that&apos;s lost in the woods; she&apos;s soiled herself and she&apos;s crying for mommy  to come save her.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4607914">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Not sure why some people are being so negative about this game as it was well polished and delivered what I was expecting. You can&apos;t just play this as a shooter like some people claimed here (maybe they are on casual?), if you do that you do not have enough ammo to continue. You need to use stealth and the environment to help clear out enemies while retaining enough ammo for bosses. The last couple of chapters do stray from this though and I ended up with far more parts for the agony crossbow than I could use.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4631379">Expand</a></span>

<br>I guess 70% of the people scoring it a zero because of the performance - or this being a bad port - didn&apos;t bother checking the system requirements before buying the game and the remaining 30% have no clue about their system specs and/or probably don&apos;t know how to check this lol...
<br>
<br>Of course there are a few things that irritates me, i.e. can&apos;t bind middle mouse click to anything, the story seems a bit incomplete and not sufficiently elaborated and finally the resource hog that the ID Tech 5 engine is - is it really worth it?
<br>
<br>PS: I&apos;d honestly give it an 8/10 but I had to give it a 10 in order to offset with people scoring it an unjustified zero (seriously it&apos;s not that bad).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4626453">Expand</a></span>

I am real junkie of horror survival games and movies. Unfortunately this game is broken on pc. If you don&apos;t have Xbox controller, then stay the  f**k out of this game. The k+m controls are imprecise. Another technical issue is 30 fps lock; witch makes game almost unplayable, in my opinion. What&#x2019;s the f******g point buying high end graphic cards if game developers lock frame rate to 30 fps? And there is this annoying aspect ratio that really grinds my gears. WTF?! It looks retarded and plays retarded. What is worse is that even it is possible to &quot;fix&quot; those issues, with unlocking console controls; the game still plays like crap. The aspect ratio is 2.35:1, by default and by changing aspect ratio, so it is in &quot;full screen&quot; mode, I notice that frame rate dropped significantly and after changing to new aspect ratio, the main character in the game &quot;gets bigger&quot;, so much that it almost covers half of the view in the game. It seems like the whole view in the game gets somehow &quot;cropped&quot; or &quot;blown up&quot; It doesn&apos;t look nice at all. But how is the game it self. Is it scary in any way? Does it have any interesting story? The game is developed by some Japanese dude and creator of RE series, as you all probably know that already. I never played any of those games so I was kind of new to this. But if this is how those games are, then I know I never will try them. The gameplay is awful and very uninspiring. The texture in the game are just ugly,  it is simply awful looking game, and what is worse is that this game is badly optimized for pc and it plays like s***. Forget high frame rates! The game doesn&apos;t feel like a survival horror game. It feels more like some clunky survival game, were you must gather some green crap, by killing monsters, so that you can upgrade your character. And then, by some miracle you get more ammo storage, better weapon damage, etc,etc. I really didn&apos;t find this kind of upgrade system interesting in survival game. Some people may find it interesting. For me it felt like some kind of unnecessary distraction. Game gets very frustrating because you die a lot, and not because of some tactical mistake made in the game. It is because of this sh***y aspect ratio and controls and all the other technical issues. It is frustrating even to make precise aiming or have any kind of control over any situation. The controls and the aspect ratio really make this game difficult to play. I don&apos;t understand what were developers thinking when they decided to make this game so unplayable. What about characters? The main characters in game are boring and sometimes annoying. I didn&apos;t care about any of them. The dialogs are boring and just made me skip most of those looong movie cut scenes, which I hate in games. I buy game to be able to interact with it. If I want a movie, I can always watch something on Netflix. Games are made to be interactive. It isn&apos;t scary game either. Maybe there are some few cheap jump scares that will make babies and small children cry, but overall, the game isn&apos;t scary at all. Though, it is very gory, which may appeal to some folks out there. It feels more like a survival game then a horror game.  Disappointing! How about the story? Is it any good? If it is difficult to connect emotionally to the main characters, then the story itself will be less interesting. I got very confused and had problems to get anything meaningful from the story. I felt they were jumping from place to place all the time and I lost track of what was the story about.  In the end, I really didn&apos;t care. The only thing that I really liked was the creative design of all the enemies . Would I recommend this game to anyone? Not for pc! Don&apos;t buy this game for pc. You might regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4611523">Expand</a></span>

I died alot of times (bad mistakes, traps, wrong button pressed, Need to get used to the controller).
<br>
<br>Gave it a 9/10 because it could use a Little more polish. Runs smooth on my rig (i5 4570, 8 GB RAM, 660ti) on Standard Settings, maybe I can push up things a Little bit, but everything is just fine!

<br>I dont want to spoil anything here, just pick up your xbox controller and setup a shortcut with commands so you dont have to type in with the console everytime and this game is alot to enjoy.
<br>
<br>9/10 - One of the best games I&apos;ve played for a long time, beats Alien isolation by far, maybe not in scares but just how the game is overall designed. There is put alot of thought behind everything here.

<br>the minus point i put because the story is kind of dull and hard to follow, I expect this to be a all answer in the end kind of thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4601910">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all the game is unnecesary stretched. There are 15 chapters in the game and absolutely nothing important happens from chapter 2 to 8, they play like naruto fillers... there may be some interesting sequence once or twice but it could have been condensed in one or two chapters, not 7.
<br>
<br>Chapter 1 is great for setting up the game and really hypes you but after that the game becomes generic third person number 999 with uninsteresting locales like: demolished castle, demolished asylum, demolished sewers and demolished etcetera,
<br>
<br>Chapter 2 to 8 don&apos;t deserve any kind of review... really... I think for the first time in chapter 6 someone talks and asks the question they should have asked like 10 chapters ago: what&apos;s happening, where are we? etc... funnily enough no one answers.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9 is excellent and it is what the whole game should have been, it has puzzles and great atmosphere, suspense and tension.
<br>
<br>Chapters 10 to 15 are ok... although the ending is ridiculous and so so bad it is not even funny.
<br>
<br>Biggest problem with the game is from the start you know **** is not happening because the story makes no sense and even after finishing it... it still makes no sense. We get glimpses of Castellano&apos;s family story through a diary but it doesn&apos;t have any kind of impact on the story and the things we learn about rubik are cool but experiments are not explained and we don&apos;t know who is working for who or why... it really feels like the game is incomplete lorewise and I&apos;m sure they plan to milk people with DLC, lol.
<br>
<br>Instant Death is horrible and sequences sometimes feel like Dragon&apos;s Lair... a tense situation quickly becomes boring and tedious and it really screws with the general atmosphere, you know something is wrong when instead of slowly opening doors you&apos;re kicking them open while charging with almost unlimited ammo shooting everything in the head.
<br>
<br>Graphics are really good and character progression (through skills) feels good except for some useless skills like melee... but in the end this game is a mediocre third person shooter, not a survival, that will not scare anyone but children... and will not hold anyone&apos;s attention with its stupid lack of story.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s like this people really forgot what makes a horror game great: suspense, tension and exploration.
<br>
<br>Shinji retire... or make a whole new game like chapter 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4624061">Expand</a></span>

<br>Technical difficulties apart, there&apos;s the actual gameplay. The Evil Within is a cheesy action tittle with some stealth elements that tries in all the wrong ways resemble to the 00&apos;s survival horrors. It does have plenty of gore and dangerous creatures, asylum or abandoned towns settings, but it ends there. The deformed creatures are nothing but boring. There&apos;s no psychological horror or mystery, just a straightforward linear action/stealth gore. You know everything that&apos;s going on from the moment you see it. The atmosphere created is so graphically explicit that has no substantial horror in it.
<br>
<br>You should download the game instead of buying because It is not worth the price, the developers does not deserve the support and you will get tired pretty soon and delete it, forgetting it ever existed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605876">Expand</a></span>

First yes the picture is in letterboxing(black bars on top and bottom) but this comes as no surprise, because at every event that this game has been shown at, this has always been the case. The luxury of PC is that we will be able to remove them(and actually there are a few mods to do this). Now that we have that out of the way, let us move on to the second huge issue people seem to have. 30 FPS. On PC it is not nearly as stuttering(or noticeable) as consoles. People are choosing to moan about something, because they feel entitled. They have always said this game would run at 30FPS and you knew this before purchase. Thankfully, once again, there are console commands, and most likely some mods that will fix this. As for the actual game(which reviews should be based on) it is a fairly decent survival/horror game, that starts off fairly slow, and builds a decent(not amazing) story along the way. Some enemy fights, are incredibly annoying, but some of the boss battles offer a unique experience that will ramp up the tension. I don&apos;t feel that the game is a true terrifying experience, as it commits closer to the Resident Evil formula(more along the lines of 4), but some situations pit you in scenarios where you will have to think on your feet. The designs in this game are absolutely beautiful and some bosses are incredibly unique. Overall if your a survivor horror fan, then you are in for a decent experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4614194">Expand</a></span>

<br>btw reviews based on technical issues, is just like pissing your pants when its cold. get a better comp or buy a console and stop whining.

<br>2nd of all you have to go on stem activate the console and type in these 2 commands every time before you play r_swapinterval -1  and r_forceaspectratio 0 , in order to make it a bit more playable but that is still not enough the r9 290 oc should never go below 50 fps regardless of what is happening . Also you cant change FoV , i think the camera is too close to the person , and of course the graphics look nothing special . This is just like shadow of mordor which require 6gb of VRAM in order to max out . I dont even understand why pc games have to be ported from console even though it should be the opposite .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4611449">Expand</a></span>

<br>Poor level design. You spend your time to don&apos;t know where you are or where you go. You feel lost every-time, and, actually, you are. Enemies are awful, they&apos;re buggy and have terrible collisions. You spend your time fighting bosses, one after the other, like in a beat&apos;em&apos;all. You cannot play 5 minutes without having an enemy jumping in front of you.
<br>Poor game design. No, this it not like &quot;old survival horror games&quot;. There is a huge difference between having not much ammo and dodging enemies, and having no ammo and being forced to kill every single enemy. Enemies see you, even when you don&apos;t see them. Doors are closed until you killed everyone. Enemies loot stuff.
<br>That&apos;s not fun at all.

<br>The problem with the PC game is that it constantly crashes for me and the frame of view is weird with top and bottom black movie-type banners.  Perhaps best to wait to get this one in the bargain bin/Steam sale. Hopefully by that they will have patched all the bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4697691">Expand</a></span>

<br>- ammo is very scarce that I ended up using the clunky melee attack more than I&apos;d use guns

<br>- early encounter with Ruvik is nothing but nuisance

<br>- very poor visibility in dark areas
<br>- extreme visual effects can make your eyes and head hurt in epileptic proportion
<br>- inconsistent damage from fire
<br>
<br>A marriage between Resident evil and Silent Hill, with The Matrix as venue - an experiment gone wrong.
<br>
<br>The game is peppered with cheap traps, cheap deaths, mediocre scares, levers and cranks, and distasteful visual effects that leave your head and eyes hurting.
<br>
<br>The only horror to you&apos;d face here is that curiosity got the better of you to pickup the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4859295">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Evil Within plays very much like you&#x2019;re in a horror movie. With moments based on the Japanese style horror genre that always makes for some serious panic inducing scenes, that never gets any less intense. The game however in most part isn&apos;t that scary, apart from a few jump scares, it relies more on gross out shock and intense gameplay. I feel the story is better than other horror games like Resident Evil, or maybe it&apos;s just nice to have a change from those games and experience something different. I would recommend The Evil Within to any horror fan.
<br>
<br>A guy chasing you with a chainsaw is scary, but if its a fat guy with a skin mask it&#x2019;s somehow worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=5842603">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is that game! AND I have 15 fps on the STARTING SCREEN - nothing happened, you see a black background and you get 15 fps! WTBF? My rig runs Crysis 3 fluently. And TEW looks horrendous on top of that! Is this a sick joke? I watch a strip of screen, (all configs turned to low), that is noisy, almost all black, ugly textures and I get around 20 fps. This is an insult :) Do people pay for this? And the don&apos;t RMA? Then you can do ANYTHING with them... They won&apos;t scream for anything.
<br>
<br>Besides this the gameplay itself is atrocious. Checkpoints, so you have to do 10 mins of repeat, everytime you die. You do everything with space, sit, jump, open, climb, **** etc. On consoles you have only 8 buttons, you have to live with that. But on pcs, you know, we have a lot more of them... This game wasn&apos;t ported to the pc, it is just sold to the pc. Back to the game: a trashy C or D movie&apos;s script, you basically know everything that wil happen before you install it.
<br>If you rate this above 0 you either a &quot;friend&quot; of the devs or you are an enemy of (any kind of) gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604763">Expand</a></span>

The game has a total Resident Evil 4 feel, but a bit slower and much more survival oriented. Terrific scenes of blood and gore, you&apos;re hurled through dark corridors and absurd scenes of violent horror without room for breathing. Burning bodies is a nice touch and the scarcity of matches will have you often deciding who to burn and who to leave behind.
<br>
<br>The Bad: Graphics are hit and miss. Some nice textures and art direction but a very aged feel to the game. Enemy AI can be blantantly dumb, sometimes getting stuck on fences and just walking eternally in place. Sometimes dying can feel unfair and leave you frustrated. You&apos;ll often not realize what&apos;s going to kill you and aren&apos;t prepared for death. Most of the enemies are zombie cannon-fodder, similar to Resident Evil 4.
<br>
<br>The controversy: While the PC port &quot;works&quot;, there does seem to be a few problems. The menus are otpimized for controllers with weird mouse lag at the title screen.  Many people complain about the letterboxing but I feel like it adds to the claustrophobic cinematic horror of the game. After 2 chapters on my 23inch monitor I forgot they even existed.  The key binding and ingame controls get alot of flakk but I don&apos;t see the issue.  It plays much like Dead Space on the PC; a bit wishy washy and clunky but that&apos;s what classic survival horror is about.  Characters are all very cheesy and cliche with baddish voice acting. If you came into the game expecting that Resident Evil appeal, then you&apos;ll probably enjoy the cheesiness of it.  If you didn&apos;t you might be put off by it.
<br>
<br>My thoughts: I really love the atmosphere and survival of this game. Jump scares and spooky monsters did not keep me tense, it was the lack of supplies and horrific environments. Many people don&apos;t touch on the psychological horror of the game, complaining about the lack of story. Most of the story progression comes in clues from the environment, including newspaper clippings, photos, and lines from the characters. The center of the game without spoiling the plot is just you being tortured relentlessly by some sick superhuman power. Thrown endlessly into horrible environments and just when you feel like you&apos;ve made progress or caught up with your allies you&apos;re tossed into yet another torturous bloody pit or dark corridor. It&apos;s taxing on your mental state as your accomplishments are tossed away in an instant.
<br>
<br>On a last note the charm of the Shinji Mikami really shine through in this game. In part due to the characters as I mentioned in controversy, in part due to the touches of absurdity found throughout the game. Like why am I being chased around by a giant dog monster while I try to retrieve my friend&apos;s glasses, or why am I running through a castle environment while zombies in wood boxes shoot gatling gun harpoons at me. I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s just the kind of game this dude makes. If you love what Mikami makes I don&apos;t see how you can not love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604075">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you enjoyed any of the Resident Evil games you will know what to expect and quite certainly enjoy what is on offer here. If you look at the finer points of the level, enemy and overall gameplay design you will start to notice while this is a solid survival horror game, the overall design and execution is a little rough around the edges and becoming a little dated. Still an enjoyable game, but likely only if you already a fan of the genre.
<br>
<br>On PC however, this is a really poor quality port. The framerate is locked to 30fps, aspect ratio and FOV are both locked and the framerate is both poor and inconsistent.
<br>You can boost the framerate to 60fps by enabling the console, however this has various problems associated with it. Various environmental effects are noticeably still rendered at 30fps, you will get noticeable frame time and stuttering issues, as well the game struggles to stay above 60fps consistently even at only 1080p. Despite the use of a high end graphics card, you will still experience poor performance as the game underutilizes the GPU, as well it is has horribly unoptimized multi-threaded CPU performance to boot.
<br>Altering the aspect ratio reduces the effective FOV and you cannot increase the FOV, leaving very little adjustment available here.
<br>The Ultra Wide aspect ratio also will not display full screen on Ultra Wide displays, which is especially horrid as you end up with black bars on top and on the side of your screen.
<br>The game also crashes infrequently throughout.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this on PS4 or Xbox One, but the framerate drops away from 30fps quite often. So while on one hand I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game on PC, as a PC game, I would still recommend it over the console counterparts. Load times on the PC are significantly faster and you will be able to maintain a steady 30fps at a native 1080p with a reasonably powerful PC, just expect to have virtually no level of customization and essentially a console style experience from top to bottom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604409">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been looking forward to this game forever and so far the only thing I&apos;m disappointed in is that it&apos;s game length is only around 20 hours. I don&apos;t care if some consider it a bad port, or the graphics might not be the best of 2014. It&apos;s a fun game to play if you like survival/horror.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m adding &quot;The Evil Within&quot; to my favorite games list: Resident Evil franchise (RE4 best, Op Raccoon City worst). GTA (All of them, been playing since GTA 1). Dues Ex: Human Revolution. Max Payne (All of them). Metro 2033 and  Last Light were amazing. Silent Hill series (gameplay good, dialogue makes me want to go to sleep or hit myself just out of boredom). LA Noire. The last few Sherlock Holmes. SP: Stick of Truth.  Sleeping Dogs. Call of Duty (I like them, but there&apos;s too much of them).
<br>
<br>Never got into Wolfenstein, Rising Dead, Walking Dead,  ____fill in the blank ____ Dead, Most recent disappointment was Watch Dogs which was a barf, it was so cheesy and repetitive, and had a bunch of unnecessary cursing just to create a MATURE GAME feel to it, because the story was far from realistic or mature, it was garbage, I quit 3rd of the way into it.
<br>
<br>The Evil Within isn&apos;t a revolutionary game, but if you like my list of best games you will also like this one.  My point is, despite all the reasons why people give this game a zero, at least it&apos;s better than 90% of all the other garbage that the gaming industry keeps pumping out.
<br>
<br>The Evil Within doesn&apos;t have any wizards or trolls, it&apos;s not based in the 1600&apos;s, it&apos;s not in the future where you have fancy laser guns and you shoot at rocket ships. You can&apos;t jump 100 feet or walk up walls of a bulding. It&apos;s just a fun zombie 3rd person shooter survival/horror game which borrows from RE and Silent Hill, and has just the right amount of stealth vs. run and gun. I can&apos;t really ask for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599715">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>One game i really looked forward to.
<br>but sadly it was a big let down.
<br>30 or 60fps doesnt matter, the story and gameplay is... well boring.
<br>its mediocre at best.. and sadly not worth the money.
<br>Survival horror without the horror, but just alot of &quot;zombie&quot; splatter
<br>I will say that the damage the monsters take is really cool
<br>
<br>So sad to see this game fail</span>

YET AGAIN THE MODDING COMMUNITY MUST STEP IN TO FIX PROBLEMS THAT SHOULDN&apos;T EXIST.They can claim it gives it &quot;cinematic felling&quot; all they want but this is a videogame not a f****** movie. I personally had it with this BS. I have recently decided that every game that runs at 30 fps, has black bars or pulls some s*** like that will be rated 0. Most of you may think its unreasonable but I don&apos;t really care at this point. I had it with pc gamers being treated like garbage. oh and some say it has issues with keybinds, well I use standard wasd assignment and rebinds and it works for now.  ANYWAY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

I&apos;m not accusing the game of not being scary because it&apos;s not that bad but it&apos;s not well crafted enough for a Shinji Mikami game. If anyone else was the director I would say that it&apos;s a quite terrific survival horror but for Mr. Mikami ... I dunno!

The engine should be directly capable, it appears it&#x2019;s the designers that are not capable. Gameplay should be good considering the dev studios leaders history, nowhere near a successor for RE/SH. You can unlock the FPS via the console. The black bars due to the native resolution at best add to the atmosphere of a B&#x2019;Movie. It misses the tricks of the new adventure/mystery games (Vanishing of Ethan..) and the new horror games (Outlast, Alien, Amnesia) I would not pay full price for this title on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599401">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are terrible, the gameplay is stale and repetitive, the AI is appalling, and even after 90 minutes of playing I&apos;m not the least bit interested in the story. If you can even call it a story...
<br>The game is incredibly vague and not even slightly engaging. I was more annoyed than anything.
<br>It&apos;s almost 2015... we&apos;re way beyond this standard of game development.
<br>To summarize, it&apos;s nothing we haven&apos;t seen before and it&apos;s about as scary as a carebear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608215">Expand</a></span>

<br>Although the game can be unlocked to 60 FPS, I can only imagine incompetence on the developer&apos;s side for this initial setting.

<br>The PC development skills on the japanese developers are low to none.

<br>But there is definitely some issues with performance and controls and graphics.  Black bars and motion blur cause me to have headaches and dizziness within an hour of playing (which I haven&apos;t had in ages in a game).  You can turn them off with the console but still doesn&apos;t change the fact that they thought it was a good idea.  So much wasted space.  Controls function badly with mouse and keyboard, works ok with controller though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4595849">Expand</a></span>

Wide-screen view and locked frame rate!  This game is 360 graphics by far and on steam it say the minimum requirements is an i7 processor?  Get out of here with that crap, hopefully there is an HD update to fix this nonsense.  Will play once that has been fixed and update my review.</span>

<br>The Graphics are fine to me and run mostly at the designed 30fps and have no issues with this and i feel the black borders and 2.35:1 aspect ratio is a bold and daring way to go. But i think it pays off in the overall feel of the game.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is great and the enemies are also very well done along with there AI. I would say this game broke my expectations as a survival horror work of art. Difficulty is as to be expected but its not frustratingly difficult and havent been stuck for too long at any part in the game.
<br>
<br>Got to give this game a solid 10 as i love the classic survival feel and havent played a game quite as good since Code Veronica back on the Dreamcast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-evil-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4599532">Expand</a></span>
