<br>Honestly, there wasn&apos;t much difference from Sims 3. Liked the Orleans atmosphere, CAS molding feature, and easy build tools. Emotions are fun. HOWEVER, that does not mean the game is worth $60.00. I read the reviews the day after it came out and was on the fence. I bought it on Origin away just to try it out and have already sent in my request for a refund. I&apos;ll be more likely to buy it when the price drops dramatically and when EA releases an EPIC EP that fixes all the flaws the base game has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4449508">Expand</a></span>

This game is only half there.  This is not worth $60.  It&apos;s not worth $30.  It&apos;s honestly Vanilla Sims 2, (yes, 2 not 3) with improved graphics.  The game looks great, the ability to multitask, and to move rooms is a HUGE improvement.  But when you realize you have to go through a load screen just to visit you neighbor, you will just turn off the game.  The older Sims games were great, it seemed like you had to work to achieve things, there was progression.  In this version you basically just send your sim to a job, keep all their needs sated and wait until you accomplish your goal.  Your phone can basically do everything your sim needs.  There&apos;s no upgrade path.  There&apos;s no need to keep making your home better.  You build a decent kitchen, get a nice bed, and some entertainment and you&apos;re done.  Which is probably for the better since there&apos;s only a handful of items in the entire game.
<br>
<br>Maybe in a few years when there&apos;s actually content in the game, it&apos;ll be worth a purchase.  But if it&apos;s some obscene $150 price tag for the game it should have been at launch you can be damn sure I will not buy it.  Time to try to request a refund from Origin.  This&apos;ll be fun.
<br>
<br>TLDR:  If you enjoyed Sims 2 and hated Sims 3, you will like this game in a few months when it has DLC.  If you&apos;ve only been playing Vanilla Sims 2 for the last 10 years, then you&apos;ll look at this as a worthwhile upgrade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4449728">Expand</a></span>

An avid Simmer since age ten (now age 23), I found this to be my least favorite of all three. Most of the features which made Sims 2 and Sims 3 great, have been removed. The lack of a toddler life stage, takes away an important aspect of the game. While I did enjoy the sliders in Create-A-Sim, the lack of control over colors, (ie: the Create-A-Design tool) is missing. I can no longer make my Sims have unconventional hair colors or strange eye colors.
<br>
<br>I am somewhat of an Build-A-Mode buff, but this one is terrible. While some of the features and pieces are arranged more thoughtfully and logically, several features are noticeably missing, again with Create-A- Design. There is virtually no room for artistic license. Also, there are no pools and there is no auto roof &gt;.&lt; There is a glitch with the foundation in which I had to build random rooms where I had to then delete walls to get the foundation to form correctly so I could build a deck. And the fact that there is no dishwashers is a minor annoyance.
<br>
<br>The worst part of all has to be the neighborhoods. Unlike the Sims 3, which opened up free play, we are limited to a smattering of buildings. There are a total of four community buildings in one area of the world. The Sims 3 had a plethora of buildings and lots to explore without having to bounce to the loading scene. There was a free range of movement where you could have one Sim go to the movies and another sit home and take care of the house and still keep track of another searching for collectables. This feature is not possible in this game which is a major issue with me.
<br>
<br>The game itself is rather boring to play, there is not much substance. While the characters are more believable, I could not help but find them mundane. There is very little range of freedom. The needs tend to turn red just under a half which puts the whole Sim in a tumultuous emotional state, granted the click to take care of needs option is certainly convenient. Also, I have notice that the buy mode items are much more expensive than in previous games. 12000 simolions for a refrigerator, I mean come on. Even in the real world a refrigerator would never cost that, except maybe an industrial one.
<br>
<br>The one good thing I can say about this latest debacle, is that the graphics are 100 times better than the other games. Loading times are also much faster than ever before.
<br>
<br>Even though the graphics are awesome, I cannot overcome the serious downfalls of this newest Sims game. I think I will retire my Sims 4 until major improvements can be made, if possible, and stick with the Sims 3, even if it means more glitches, worse graphics and longer loading times. The Sims 3, and even the Sims 2, are far better games than this one as it stands and I will return dutifully to them and hope that the SimGurus are watching and know this: this game needs a major revamp and judging by the reviews coming in, I am not alone.
<br>~Always,

EA has embraced the notion of releasing very basic functionality in all their games. In essence gutting each game until it&apos;s almost playable and then loading the backend with expensive DLC that provides the basic gameplay that should have been included in the original. With Sims 4, EA is testing the waters. How far can they strip a game to the point that consumers outright reject the product? There&apos;s a lot of wallet gouging on the line here. This game is so gutted that it&apos;s been hammered by reviewer after reviewer for all the same boring reasons. I can only hope that gamers unite on this front, accept EA&apos;s challenge and refuse to purchase this game. This is the ONLY way that EA will change.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4446307">Expand</a></span>

Ok, I get that the loading screens make it so a wider audience can play, and that people don&apos;t need a powerful gaming PC to enjoy it, but there is just SO much wrong with TS4 that I just cannot look past it. For starters, there is a whole bunch of content missing that was always supplied to us from the past sims base games. BUT it MAY be available in the future as DLC for EXTRA MONEY! I mean, come on. Is that all EA thinks of us? A dollar bill? Pools were always implemented in the game, now if they do decide to add them in we customers have to line their pockets with even more money just to get the basics that were always provided? As far as graphically, yes the game is a bit smoother BUT that whole cartoon like look is just not my cup of tea. Another thing that I cannot look past is the loading screens and the fact there is NO open world. The game feels so claustrophobic and cramped and we, the players, have lost the freedom of just leaving our home to go for a jog or drive aimlessly around town all hours of the night. To go to the next door neighbors house there is a loading screen. So lame. Another BIG issue I have is the playability. If I want to play with more then one character and want to leave my home or a lot, I either have to take them with me or if I go alone their not playable until I return to where they currently are. That is so stupid. I loved being able to take one of my sims to a spa while simultaneously making my other garden while making another dance away at a local night club. My freedom is severely compromised with TS4 and I am so disappointed at the choices that were made. I can&apos;t see how this is a step up, as it really reminds me of playing The sims app on my ipad instead of an actual PC game. I will stick with playing TS3 and will not be wasting anymore money on content from the sims 4. They are on my crap list hardcore right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4446542">Expand</a></span>

Loading time has been drastically cut. A player can really make their Sims look realistic. The emotions are fun and bring new interactions between Sims. The graphics are improved. Cons: The most frustrating and disappointing thing was not having an open world. EA has basically taken the Sims 2, shrunk the world by 70%, and made better graphics. The whole neighborhood view is grey and white. When you move your cursor over the small, five sections of the world offered, then it highlights with color. 4 hours I played and was bored. I was promoted twice in my career, made friends with the Goths, and then shut down the game down. Playing the Sims 4 made me miss the Sims 3. Thankfully, I bought the game through Origin and had a 24 hour guaranteed return policy. I will not be playing the new Sims until they introduce more expansion packs. I am so disappointed. If you like to ONLY build houses and create Sims, then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444021">Expand</a></span>

EA took one step forward and 10 steps back on this one.  The good points are Create-A-Sim and the build tool.  There are options in both categories that were not in previous games and they really are quite nice.  But there are so many things missing from this game that it becomes extremely boring very quickly, and some of the missing features are just plain annoying.  One of the first things you&apos;ll notice is the inability to turn off the tutorial, which is extremely frustrating when you have messages popping up all over the screen and often right in the way of what you are trying to accomplish.  No more in-depth design options like the color wheel and patterns.  No longer having the toddler stage is a huge problem for me.  Having a baby appear in a bassinet instead of being able to place him/her in a crib of my choosing is really annoying.  There&apos;s no more swimming.  The world map is a joke.  There are loading screens in order to go anywhere at all, even to visit your next door neighbor.  The autonomy options are extremely high autonomy, or none at all.  You can&apos;t have a private conversation between two sims if there are any other sims around, they will all join the conversation whether you like it or not.  Objects in the game look weird and boxy, lack of realism.  The options are so limited and the game is so bare bones that it is just no fun after creating your character and building a house.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443478">Expand</a></span>

Well other than the obvious pools and toddlers we keep hearing about... there&apos;s no more story progression.  Did you like watching your family tree build, who marries who in town, discover a 3rd cousin etc?  Well now that doesn&apos;t happen unless you do it yourself.  Yep, no more building that bunkhouse full of women and seeing what sort of relationships develop in town lol.  Everything is flat, no more terrain elevation.  No regular jobs - yep, no more cop or medical to get you started on your way up as you accrue your fortune.  Just straight to astronaut for you!  No burglars.  No ghosts.  No freakin&apos; cemeteries!   No &quot;accidental&quot; deaths!  That means no more can you be the creepy mad scientist in the mansion where people tend to &apos;disappear&apos; due to the pool of death.

<br>EA has been putting out one stinker barebones game after another lately, and I can no longer ignore it.  Their excuse for skimping on content?  Lack of resources they say, plenty of FX people but not enough other devs.  Yeah, EA - one of the largest developers in the world, making the latest installment of a flagship super-popular game lacks resources for content.  Ok. Who wants to bet that all this content will make a conspicuously convenient appearance in DLC format, for a premium, at oddly regular intervals, almost as if it was already finished long beforehand?   As if, oh I don&apos;t know, it was planned out in advance....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4447411">Expand</a></span>

<br>No pools, no basement. You can&apos;t lock sims in a room anymore. So you can&apos;t kill them by starvation unless you take the fridge off. You can&apos;t drown them either obviously. It&apos;s nearly impossible to kill a sim. No more happiness points based on moodlets, instead you have an useless buff called &quot;emotion&quot;, that unlock useless interactions for &quot;wishes&quot; that barely grant any points. And that whole new design is just awfully confusing. I liked the old system a lot better the more moodlets the happier my sims, the better rewards, that&apos;s **** emotions for you... simple, powerful. No social worker. No cars. No urinals. Sims &quot;pee like a champion&quot; sitting down... No jobs location, no school location. Can&apos;t access sims to see their needs etc, when at work or at school (imaginary place). So weird tilting in the rewards section. An awfully obnoxious tutorial system that will pop a thousand times in your face.
<br>No jobs. It&apos;s all text based and skill based.
<br>Hair that look like kiddy paste. I don&apos;t see the point of doing Sims all over again they looked fine before. It&apos;s just so they can stick &quot;Sims 4&quot; on the box.
<br>People claimed that demo of Create a Sim didn&apos;t have everything, it very much did... There is not any more clothing options in the real game. And no create a style, no create a world either...
<br>Teens/YA/Adult/Elders look exactly the same that&apos;s why they only shown YA in the demo. They knew themselves. Stupid walks, who cares...
<br>Small cities... and all these sims walking around your home, feels like the Truman show car scene with his wife &quot;they are running in circle all day&quot;.
<br>If you own Sims 3 and several expansions you are lucky because you don&apos;t need this crap! There is no reason whatsoever... Even build mode, so you have new commodities, cool, but with the old one you could achieve nearly the same, they just needed to patch it in not do an entire new game and call it &quot;Sims 4&quot;.
<br>I played this game 2 hours, and I don&apos;t feel the need whatsoever to come back to it. I might actually buy an expansion of Sims 3 but this, no way... And they spent years to make this? No way... 6 months top...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4449151">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is lacking at best, it feels like it has been stripped down just so they can sell DLC that include the stripped down features.
<br>
<br>Sims 3 DLC added up to over $400 in total, it seems like it&apos;s going to be worse for the sims 4</span>

The two worlds (what you get to see of them, anyway) are gorgeous, and everything seems to sparkle. The Sims are adorable, and I love that you can fully customize body shape. In fact, in game, subtle changes appear over time if your Sim doesn&apos;t eat properly or exercise. However, the CAS lacks customization options for eye colour, hair colour and is certainly lacking on the clothing front; no surprise here, really, as Maxis has always provided a limited number of fashion choices. What was really disappointing to me was the fact that colour options are limited to just a few pre-selected choices. I was hoping that wouldn&apos;t extend to the build/furniture options, but wouldn&apos;t you know it, you&apos;re limited there as well.
<br>
<br>Aside from those issues, I was hoping game play would keep be suckered in. Nope. The new interactions are cute, but the game failed to motivate me to keep going. Your Sim goes to work on their own, and travelling is limited to switching between a few (four in the one world) community lots. Game play becomes akin to playing the mobile or Free Play versions. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to sit and play long enough to have a good run at a legacy.
<br>
<br>There is limited time for your Sim to socialize once they&apos;ve found a job; you have to complete menial tasks in order to be promoted, and these tend to take up a lot of time and energy. I didn&apos;t really have the desire to socialize anyway, since going out means you&apos;re bombarded by three or four NPCs at a time, and they never stop talking to you. Since you don&apos;t have the option to limit autonomy (it&apos;s either you have it or you don&apos;t), you pretty much just let your Sim and the others do whatever they want.
<br>
<br>This game was a huge disappointment for me. I&apos;ve been waiting and waiting, but what I got was boring. If I wanted to play the mobile version with better graphics, I would&apos;ve just purchased it for my phone. $80.00 for limited game play seems ridiculous. Thank God EA offers a refund within 24 hours of launching your digital copy.
<br>
<br>I sincerely hope that after a few patches, and perhaps a major expansion launch, this game will be worth the money. The updated Create-A-Sim and the build mode are everything I&apos;ve wanted in The Sims 3, but the game play just isn&apos;t on par for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444593">Expand</a></span>

EA&apos;s excuse for leaving out what are considerably core features is infuriating that they cite lack of development team resources... yeah, lack of resources from one of the largest game developers working on a long awaited sequel to one of the most popular franchises ever.  Makes sense.  Even if such is true, and EA really is so inept that they cannot even allocate the resources required to put out a worthy sequel - then they should definitely not be rewarded by your purchase for their continuation of the trend of large developers putting out shoddy product and asking you for more money so they can &apos;fix&apos; that shoddy product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443896">Expand</a></span>

No pools,Dishwashers,cant edit the ground, basements, no cars, worlds are way way smaller maybe 10 to 15 lots if that. Seems like they went backwards here. Only other thing i can for see is if they release everything in paid dlc!</span>

<br>Oh EA. You know it&apos;s sad when you make a game so bad that I feel the need to let everyone know why it sucks...
<br>
<br>They left out: Cars, open worlds, CAST, repair man, pools, toddlers, hills, burglars, cemeteries, color wheel, ghosts, the  move object on/off cheat, schools, work places and MANY other things...
<br>
<br>But here are some major PROS:
<br>-Origins gallery is AMAZING. You can almost instantly bring households and homes into the game.
<br>-Emotions are a lot more in depth, but this can also be frustrating..
<br>
<br>But let me just share with you my first 6 or so hours of gameplay.
<br>
<br>I started off in CAS (Create-a-Sim) in hopes to make a normal, married couple. First thing I noticed was that the color wheel was missing... I always took it for granted in The Sims 3, but then I realized how important it was in the creativity aspect of the game. I had a hard time finding heels that matched my dress, lipstick that matched my heels.. just simple stuff. Which also applies to everything in the house. It is very frustrating getting items to match eachother. I guess it&apos;s good that you can switch between the two worlds there are.. which are pathetically small.. But wait! There&apos;s more! Sub-sections in each world in which there are about 5 lots each, in which you need to sit through a loading screen each time you switch between them. You need your phone (which you automatically get, not earn) in order to go anywhere. There are no cars, and you cannot see your workplace, or the school; Your sims just vanish and come back later. One good thing is you can super-speed through the night when everyone in the household is sleeping. If one person is napping, and one is sleeping, this doesn&apos;t work. Same goes with working. You need to complete certain challenges before advancing in careers.. which take up a lot of time.
<br>
<br>Emotions: I don&apos;t like how some traits now have some negative connotations with them. For example, being a slob means dirty surroundings don&apos;t bother you, yet your sim causes things to get dirtier faster around the house.. and this goes with about half the traits (if I remember correctly, apologizes if I&apos;m wrong).
<br>
<br>There were a few glitches...
<br>1. My sim was signaling there was something in the way when she tried to get in bed, when there wasn&apos;t.
<br>2. My sim was signaling there was something in the way when trying to get inside the house... when there wasn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Making a house seems like it would be better but it really isn&apos;t even fun anymore because the sense of creativity is gone with how easy it is.
<br>
<br>If I got more into how many things were missing from this game, you&apos;d be reading this for hours.
<br>
<br>When playing The Sims 3 base game for the first time, I was on it for weeks, thoroughly entertained. With The Sims 4 I got bored very fast and didn&apos;t know what to do with my sims within 4 or 5 hours, so I just made sims and rooms to post to the gallery.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s all missing. Everything that made The Sims what it is was is mostly gone in The Sims 4.
<br>
<br>The fact of the matter is this game was definitely not worth the 80$ I spent for the premium edition that comes with a crappy little book and some extra content.
<br>
<br>Origin wants you to hope that this game will get better with more expansion packs, so that you&apos;ll buy them. If you haven&apos;t tried The Sims 3, I recommend buying it instead with some expansion packs, because they&apos;re all 20$ now instead of 40$. You would save big $bucks$.
<br>
<br>If you still want to try it out, get it online through origin. They have a 24hr refund policy. If you don&apos;t like it, you get 100% of the money you spent back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4445441">Expand</a></span>

No es posible editar las texturas ni los colores. El n&#xFA;mero de opciones de peinados, barbas y detalles del cuerpo se han visto reducidos a unas pocas opciones. Los tatuajes tampoco se pueden editar, no puedes superponer varios para crear una imagen mas persnalizada y  tampoco permite colocarlos a distintas alturas y tama&#xF1;os.
<br>
<br>El mapa del mundo es de aut&#xE9;ntico chiste, un simple dibujo plano con apenas unas pocas parcelas. Dentro del barrio, su tama&#xF1;o es como 1/5 de los mapas de el anterior juego
<br>
<br>Pr&#xE1;cticamente todo el juego parece una involuci&#xF3;n de la anterior entrega. Todo es peor, todo tiene peor editor, menor tama&#xF1;o, sin opciones de personalizaci&#xF3;n.
<br>
<br>todo esta mal en este juego.  Es decepcionante en todos los aspectos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4449602">Expand</a></span>

No wonder they gave out The Sims 2 for free, they were trying to suck up to us for this complete piece of **** Just wait, your going to see about 20 DLC/Expansions worth $30 a piece. Great job stealing our money u **** bags EA</span>

I quickly realized how foolish I was in holding onto that hope. This game is a joke to the series, with so many missing features, it becomes boring far too quickly. It feels like a Sims game, there&apos;s no doubt about that, but it only feels like a half assed one at that. I&apos;m not going to be exploring this game any further, especially when EA brings out the DLC. What really hurts, is the fact that The Sims has been one of my favorite series, and I can do nothing but watch as it&apos;s treated like **** by EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443192">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Another big anoying things is bugs.
<br>My sims are sometimes stuck in walls, the music is running wild (i seems there are multiple tracks played at the same time), and I have some grafic glitches when moving objects around.
<br>Sure, its the first week for the game. But what in hell, was there no internal testing?
<br>These bugs are so obvious to me, how could they make it to the final product?
<br>
<br>For me EA would have done better by focusing on the gameplay, content and game mechanics than all the other stuff around the game.
<br>What is the benefit of the community stuff when the actual game is not satisfying.

<br>For 70 bucks im really extremly disappointed from what I got.

Sims 4 shows about 15% of Sims 3 gameplay. the rest they choose to throw out!? You cant walk next door and go knock on a door, it loads up? REALLY!!!? The town itself is only 4 buildings, and a park!?? Wow totally a waste of money peeps!</span>

One would think that an advanced version of The Sims franchise would hold some of the basics of the other base games (ie. dishwashers, security systems, toddlers, etc.)  But alas, this one did not.  Not to mention the lack of pets, seasons, etc.  I was thoroughly disappointed, even though I tried to get past it by playing for a few hours.  The houses are nice, but the lack of all of these items was enough to make me throw up my hands and give up.  I have requested a refund from Maxis and may have finally given up hope that they will ever listen to their fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4445879">Expand</a></span>

At first I was looking forward to it, but overtime we all found out what EA have axed from the game and I grew more and more optimistic. So now I have it... and it&apos;s terrible.

The reason being... because it&apos;s a game, and it&apos;s not exactly horrible compared to some of the worst games out there. But for a Sims game? It is atrocious and deserves no higher than a 1.  The game just feels very empty overall.... and if you didn&apos;t know you were playing a full production new gen game you might mistaken it for a free to play or an alpha of some startup. But no... sadly this is the full retail version of The Sims 4. I even went ahead and got the premium pack. I actually figured with or without the pack there should still be a decent amount of items to place in your house hold. You want to know the truth? This game has less items than the first Sims. I will admit the multitasking of sims is very cool, but it&apos;s the only polished thing in the entire game. Even the options menu is sad. It has about as many options as an early 90&apos;s DOS game. There really isn&apos;t much you can do at all with the sims themselves.... what they can do is more entertaining than ever to watch the first few times. From what I could see there is really no outdoor activities at all. Yada yada but you know what the saddest thing about this is? You just know that in a few years and after $1,000 of expansion packs this will be a good game.... and that&apos;s the problem.... this first incarnation of The Sims 4 is nothing but bate to advertise future DLC. On some developer&apos;s computer somewhere there is a fully functional and much improved Sims 4.... but sadly only if you are sucker enough to buy every expansion and DLC even after this insult - will most of you ever have enough patience to see it.

<br>Goodbye Maxis. EA is the end of another great gaming company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444754">Expand</a></span>

For those of you who are new to the sim world, playing this game would actually be quite appealing; for the simple reason that you wouldn&apos;t know what you were missing out on. 89 notable features (and these are just the big ones) have been removed from the game in order to push individual DLC packs and micro transactions.
<br>
<br>I would understand if the game kept some of the major features that previous simmers loved (such as something as basic as a pool) and then offered a few DLC packs with innovative **NEW** content. However, completely gutting the game of any and all depth in the pursuit of financial gain is unacceptable.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be a fool and buy this game. It&apos;s on Origin for $69.99, but after all the DLC packs for this travesty to become a real game could cost you upwards of $600. Give this game the bad score it deserves to spread the word about the awful things that EA is doing to a franchise so many people loved..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443864">Expand</a></span>

Such tactics appear to be a subtle admittance that EA expects everyone will hate it and I guess they need to keep the average score above 1-2 out of 10... Can you even imagine that one of them even referenced the disaster that was Sim City as a positive comparison... Anyways, I have to say Sims 3 was a fun game and I&apos;d recommend it if you haven&apos;t played it, but only if you can cheap out and not buy the gobs of the money-sucking expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444429">Expand</a></span>

Create-a-Sim looked good, too (at first). Then, I started to realize that this game just isn&apos;t that good. Create-a-Sim is a disappointment compared to previous games. There&apos;s no color wheel and there aren&apos;t even many colors to choose from. There just aren&apos;t a lot of options and I had significantly more trouble getting my Sims to not look the same, even with the adjustments of facial features (which actually aren&apos;t that great because they are very limited).
<br>
<br>The game feels like a Sims game but it&apos;s missing a LOT. Not just content such as pools, outfits, colors, etc. but gameplay and options. The options are practically nonexistent. The camera doesn&apos;t work that well and there are zero options to adjust it! Have they never heard of options in video games?
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;m just not a fan of this. It&apos;s a Sims game with better coding but 1/4 the amount of options and it brings very little to the table in terms of new or original content, just multitasking and emotions. Not worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441793">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s clear that this game was intentionally gutted to then require copious amounts of DLC to fill it out and make it the playable, functional game it should&apos;ve been from the beginning. This company has no respect for its consumers. Don&apos;t waste your time or money.</span>

I was recently made aware of the missing pools and toddlers but I&apos;ve been playing The Sims since the beginning so I decided I wasn&apos;t going to let that keep me from giving this game a shot.
<br>At last the game has arrived! I get on to play and start creating my sim, the create a sim tool is great, I mean it&apos;s missing some simple things from TS3, like body hair but no biggie. So finally, I&apos;m done creating and I get to start playing... Select a house? Okay, but why is this neighborhood all divided up into sections? Well... you can&apos;t simply travel around the neighborhood like before. What, are you joking? No! Remember what it was like in TS2? It&apos;s like that, loading screens to travel to and from a lot of places. Meh.
<br>Fine whatever, let me just go get my usual job in the business career and it&apos;ll all be good. Nope, you can&apos;t do that either, sorry! My Sim just vanishes into thin air, I can&apos;t see his needs or anything while he&apos;s gone. There are many other things that I&apos;ve found missing from the game compared to previous versions.
<br>While the emotions of the sims are an interesting addition to the game, they most certainly do not make up for the all of the things that are now missing. The graphics in my opinion are only slightly better than before.
<br>I remember the day the first Sims came out, I was glued, for hours and hours. It&apos;s only taken me about 3 hours to get bored with The Sims 4. Keep your money and stick with The Sims 3, you&apos;ll be glad you did.
<br>I&apos;ll probably be returning my copy tonight via the Origin Great Game Guarantee because in my honest opinion, the game is a very stripped down version of the Sims 3 that is not worth the price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443704">Expand</a></span>

The game is fun and exciting for the first couple of hours but then as soon as they go to work you are just stuck there unless you have another Sim. Sending one of your Sims out of the house is just terrible, you can only view one at a time and you have zero control over the other Sim. I feel like I am trapped in my home unless I send both of my Sims somewhere. The career options are quite limited and it feels like there are very few stages of life. I love some of the new features but for the most part I&apos;m very disappointed. I pre-ordered it before I saw a list of things that were missing from The Sims 4, then I felt like refunding the game but I figured that it might be good still. I have loved The Sims franchise since the first Sims so I still have a love for The Sims 4 which is why I&apos;m giving it a two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443066">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Despite this, there are some good features such as the new CAS mode and the new animations. However again, they do not weight up to what everyone was expecting- which was an amazing upgrade from The Sims 3. They should learn from games such as &apos;Skyrim&apos;.
<br>
<br>The game at the moment feels lifeless, restricting and incredibly unrealistic. I would recommend people not to buy this game. I&apos;m completely disappointed by EA and Maxis.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4445564">Expand</a></span>

<br>A whole lot is missing and the new fancy features don&apos;t make up for it at all. Truly limiting options and creating a sim with no create a style blows and it really shows after playing the sims 3, like they say you never really know what you got till its gone. The creativity you can do is just abysmal to it&apos;s predecessors. Building and creating is simple and easy but you have just a couple options to work with. Sims clip through objects and ghost through people. The story progression is non-existent, if you don&apos;t personally do it then nothing happens outside your family. Its horribly immersion breaking and huge step backwards. So many features were taken out it&apos;s sad. The background of your world is literally a picture. Feels like the Sims 2.5 or a mobile game with enhanced graphics.
<br>
<br>Not ready, not good, don&apos;t waste your money. Thank god for EA 24-Hour Refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444939">Expand</a></span>

Graphics almost has no  changes (sometimes it looks even  less detailed than Sims3). Overall game doesn&apos;t feels like something solid and completed but only like platform for future expansions. Thank you Origin for 24-hours refund.</span>

For a life simulator, deeper characters are definitely a plus. EA has emphasized this, and it&apos;s definitely delivers as a proof-of-concept. This, along with the graphical overhaul deserves three points.
<br>
<br>However, this game feels like it regressed in many other ways. I won&apos;t go into the lack of toddlers and pools, that&apos;s been beaten to death. What people aren&apos;t talking about as much are:
<br>
<br>1. Create-a-sim has been nerfed. You only have around 5 patterns or colors per furniture/piece of clothing
<br>- No more thousands of combinations of patterns to customize clothing
<br>- You don&apos;t have a color wheel as well to edit
<br>
<br>2. You are back to dollhouse mode like in Sims 1 and 2.
<br>- No more open world like in Sims 3. You have to go to a loading screen even just to visit the people next door.
<br>- Loading screens are signs of a bygone era. This is unacceptable considering Sims 3 got us past this already.
<br>
<br>3. Character interactions are much less and just weird.
<br>- You don&apos;t have as much character interactions.
<br>- There are weird interactions like when you are having your sim talk to someone, another person your sim doesn&apos;t know just joins the conversation, and you can&apos;t kick that extra person out of the combined conversation without quitting it.
<br>
<br>I really wanted to like the Sims 4. However it feels like it took us too many steps back to give us the new emotion system. This is not a game, but a proof-of-concept of the emotion system. Compared to the Sims 3 base game, which really made you feel like you cannot go back to the Sims 2, this incomplete version of a game only makes me want to go back to the Sims 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443392">Expand</a></span>

I played the Create a Sim Demo and I liked the new creation mechanics.
<br>
<br>Now that I&apos;ve covered the only good parts of the game...let&apos;s move on to the negatives.
<br>
<br>That large city in Sims 3 is now missing. There are only a handful of places to go and you will be punished by long loading screens when you actually do want to go somewhere.  I ignored all of the bad press before that game released about the game not having toddlers or swimming pools.  God I wish those were the only problems!  There are still countless other things missing from the game.
<br>
<br>The level of customization took a long step back from Sims 3 and you can basically choose from a selection of 5 colors for most objects.
<br>
<br>The biggest disappointment in this game is the constant glitches.  I&apos;ve only played the game for a little over 5 hours and my characters are continuously unresponsive or walking into walls and getting stuck. I know there may be bugs on the first day with any game, but any amount of testing would have indicated this game was not ready.  EA should have held back this 2014 title to make sure it was truly COMPLETED for 2015.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4442722">Expand</a></span>

You know what happened? everyone bickered and fought due to cheating and sims being forced to watch this. The biggest travisity about sims 4, you can do this (i have also seen twitch.tv streams of this same kind of cheating behavior) and the other sims don&apos;t even get mad or negatively affect one another you can just go right down the road and sleeping with past loves again like nothing bad happened and impregnate them time and time again. Wheres the realism? what fun is this where it seems like none of the other sims have a mind or will of their own they are just subject to what ever interaction I&apos;m able to do with no consequences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4442802">Expand</a></span>

Despite having the tutorial, (which if you click off of it goes away until you randomly do whatever it asked you to do.) It assumes you know what to do, and it tries to empower the user with &quot;freedom&quot; and flexibility, but instead you end up missing parts like changing body parts. You see the dials for muscles &amp; fat, but clicking on the body parts and adjusting them at different angles? Well I hope you intuitively know where they are and what their abilities are b/c there is nothing to queue you to their functionality. Again I&apos;ve been playing with the CAS demo extensively, but in the production version of the game there is no natural flow.
<br>
<br>My biggest complaint is that there is far less control in general. You have only the pre-determined styles and there&apos;s no room to custom or alter ANYTHING.
<br>
<br>Like that shirt or counter top but want to make it a shade lighter? Too bad! You get these 5 options we&apos;ve created.
<br>Want to make that metal object, wood? #SorryNotSorry
<br>What a design on that lampshade? So long as it&apos;s white, sure!
<br>
<br>There are 1/20th selection of anything, except random crap you don&apos;t care about. There are 6 counter/island styles, but 19 stove hood styles. Seriously?
<br>
<br>Standard things are missing. Like? Dishwashers. Under counter, trash compactors. Classic double kitchen sink. Not-hanging ceiling lights (i.e. standard flush mounted can lights)
<br>
<br>The new mouse/camera controls are weird. You can change them back to Sims 3 style but since you&apos;re missing pitch/tilt it doesn&apos;t make much sense.
<br>
<br>I am so frustrated by the complete lack of *everything* I rage-quit while setting up my house. Something that I could do for hours in all previous versions.
<br>
<br>I spent nearly all of last weekend in The Sims 3, making a really cool new house. Making sure that the wood of the bedroom furniture was the same style and color. Pulling tones from bed fabrics and using them in curtains and wall colors. Making sure the metal of the kitchen counter knobs was the same metal and hue as the light fixtures and the appliances.
<br>
<br>All of the subtle details that made The Sims 3 a fantastic customizable world are COMPLETELY lacking in The Sims 4.
<br>
<br>They completely screwed up the worlds too. Instead of having a cohesive world, you have the vague notion of a world with out of scale venues in neighborhoods. In order to go anywhere or see your world you have to use your phone. Instead of getting in your car or summoning a taxi you go to a load screen and appear at the venue. You cannot seamlessly travel within the world only in the neighborhood. I feel like I am using an internal alpha and not a released game.
<br>
<br>With the Sims 3 I loved trading patterns in the Exchange and getting new buildings or furniture that would have new patterns that I could customize and apply in existing buildings or clothing. I loved being able to choose that SPECIAL shade of green for my Sims eyes, deep green but vibrant. I missing selecting hair color and adding subtle highlights and low-lights.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars, buying every expansion pack, every new world, every stuff pack and new set and venue in The Sims 3 store.
<br>
<br>The entire reason I loved playing this game, the customizing of houses, and furniture and clothes and the people ... all of that has been decimated to what can only be described as bare bones, poor-mans replica.
<br>
<br>I want to throw money at EA like I did with The Sims 3, but until I can change the shade of purple in a shirt, or matchy-match my furniture, I have no reason or desire to. I am heart broken that the newest version of my favorite game is only a shell of it&apos;s former glory.
<br>
<br>All of that is gone, and until it&apos;s back, I am too.
<br>
<br>Damn, so disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441782">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Sims 4 is a &quot;core&quot; game in a franchise that has been wildly successful and around longer than kids born in the 2000s.  It has plenty of added features and is created on a brand new engine that is designed around being as smooth and accessible as possible, even on the lowest end of computers.
<br>
<br>So why am I giving this game a zero?
<br>
<br>I think most people are confused as to what an expansion pack is supposed to be. An expansion was a way for a developer to continue to develop updates for a game. The process of patching new content for software that&apos;s already released costs a lot of money and resources.  When you purchase an expansion pack, you&apos;re paying for the team to continue to patch in new content.
<br>Expansion packs for video games should be considered just that. A patch that elaborates upon the core game in a way that completes the experience.
<br>
<br>By ignoring content they&apos;ve already released into the franchise; they&apos;ve made the base game smaller and bareboned. They&apos;ve ignored all the iterations they&apos;ve released of their software.  Yes.  The game runs very well. (minus a crash or two I&apos;ve received with the autosave function being non-existent despite the claim that it&apos;s implemented) It looks fine, but it&apos;s full of archaic loading screens;
<br>invasive saving, and several design choices that boggled my mind to the point where I simply couldn&apos;t continue playing.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s such an exceptional amount of customization to a Sim&apos;s body and face-- very few complexion changes (every Sim ends up looking like a barbie),  limited make-up or hair colors.
<br>Every Sim ends up looking the same with one of the 21 total male hair styles or the slightly more extensive 25 female hair styles.
<br>
<br>Teens, Young Adults, Adults and Elder are all the same height with very few differences that place them apart.  Why even have variation?
<br>
<br>The neighborhood system is very restrictive.  Under the current system it&apos;s completely possible to run out of lots to place Sims.  In fact, if you want a new neighborhood for each family you make? Can&apos;t happen.  They all exist parallel to each other in the same neighborhood.
<br>And I.. just the jobs and what happens when your Sims are on different lots from each other.
<br>
<br>I spent 60$ USD on a complete experience and instead of getting Microsoft Word I received Notepad.
<br>
<br>However, EA customer service is pretty exceptional lately.  I&apos;m very, very happy with my refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443452">Expand</a></span>

<br>I thought after Sim City, EA would be more eager to regain their trust with the customers, but I guess I was dead wrong. Unless you like paying more than 50 bucks for a Sims game that has less features than the freemium app on mobile, I would recommend you to throw your wallet at something else. EA does not deserve any money for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441913">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The bad: Everything you loved from the Sims 3 is now gone. There are no color wheels. There&apos;s a mismash of preset colors. Customizing your sims is pretty hard and in the E3 demo they showed them pulling on the sims in all kinds of crazy ways. No... You can&apos;t. There are limits. Very limited limits. No colors for changing colors of the clothing, hair, etc. You can&apos;t make anything even close to what you could in the Sims 3.
<br>
<br>The world is very limited. There are a few houses, a park, and no alterable terrain. No swimming pools. No karaoke machine. You have to unlock objects with career levels. Which is nice, but what if the sim you made wants an electric guitar? Nope. You have to get him up career levels to get it. What if you want green hair on your sim? Is the color available? No? Well, you can&apos;t have it. What if you want your sim to have a pink and purple shirt? Is it a preset color? No, well... You can&apos;t have it.
<br>
<br>The free to play app has more features than the Sims 4.
<br>
<br>The good (and there&apos;s not many):
<br>Load times are faster
<br>You can search for objects by name
<br>There are moods
<br>
<br>That&apos;s about all the good things that there are... Sadly. :(
<br>
<br>If you love the Sims 3 and have expansions, then you&apos;re going to hate this game. I have every Sims game from 1 and all it&apos;s expansions to now... 4. 4 is the worst Sims game I have ever seen and I bought the fully loaded premium edition for 80 bucks!!! I am not happy in the least!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4442791">Expand</a></span>

No burglars, repair man, carpools, dishwashers, newspapers, toddlers, pools, etc. If it wasn&apos;t for the core gameplay and new features such as multi-tasking and emotions, It wouldn&apos;t be nearly as good. The worst thing is probably the fact that the game feels so empty. Public places are more like chat rooms there&apos;s almost nothing to do besides talk to people, sometimes you can dance or play guitar for tips or tell jokes and play chess, but that&apos;s about it. The buy mode is so very limited as well. There&apos;s not even a video game console category the closest thing you have is computers, a tablet or your phone. One thing I can&apos;t get over is that teens looks nearly identical to young adults, young adults have broader shoulders...that&apos;s about it. Sims 4&apos;s pros rely on socialization, multi tasking and more realistic socialization, neighbors hang around the district outside your house alot so its very easy to meet people and I like the small touch that friends randomly knock on your door and if you&apos;re busy working on your writing skill you can talk to them while doing so. The loading screens may be frequent but theyre not that much longer than a sim driving across town in sims 3. Overall it has its good parts and it bad parts but I can&apos;t accept it has a serious successor to sims 3. If youre looking for a new sims game to play my advice would be wait for a bundle like the sims 3 starter pack for sims 4. $60+ is definitely not worth it, just stick to sims 3 for now, sims 3 will probably still be better by the time the sims 4 era ends and sims 5 is announced anyway. I can only hope EA adds alot of features in the first expansions pack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444428">Expand</a></span>

In Sims 3 I always struggle to find a good plant so this is a pretty good feature. Windows can be placed and roof and wall can be dragged more easily now (Sims 3&#x2019;s roof is irritatingly hard), But what I don&apos;t like is that the house is built based on rooms, at least not for me (I prefer building a house than rooms), and your house always limits on the surface of the lands given. Live mode, your sim can do multiple things at the same time which is good. Interaction between your sim and other NPC is also improved, I sort of like the emotion they added, but I don&#x2019;t really care about that, but there is no more open world as it was broken up into different neighborhoods, every time you access a neighborhood a loading screen will pop up. The loading time is pathetic, and it is unacceptable. More marks is deducted because of all the missing features from Sims 3 (you know what I am going to mention don&#x2019;t you), pools and toddlers, car etc. but EA is probably going to flood us with 200 DLCs and put those in again. At last, the graphics, I do not hate the super cartoony graphics, but this feel like a step back from Sims 3 since Sims 3 looks more realistic. Sims 4 is basically a bit easier than Sims 3, but as a sequel, features in previous games should be already featured in the based game. People who already played previous Sims game should probably still enjoy playing this game, since they play like the same and Sims 4 runs smoother than Sims 3, but if you are new to the franchise, I recommend you to buy it after all DLCs is released. 5/10 for the base game and probably 75-80/10 when all the DLCs come. (I hate DLC but it is probably the only way to get a full Sims experience) (Remember EA is a greedy company. DLC is not free-update they are not free add-on. If you don&#x2019;t have that much money, go back to Sims 3)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441844">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t recommend this game until they get at least 1 expansion.  It is no where near as good as Sims 3.</span>

I was very excited to see Sims 4 coming - they amped it up to be this amazing new game. I could not agree more with the other reviews on here... The Sims personalities, the way they look and interact is fantastic. But thats the whole game right now. Honestly. I purchased the game this morning came home excited to play spent a good 5 hours hoping something was going to happen once my sim progressed so far. Nothing. What I did during my 5 hours was socialize. socialize, go to work, socialize, improve skills, go to work. build a little. There are tons and tons and tons of content left out. At this point in time I would rather revert back to playing Sims 3. This game has huge potential. Hopefully EA makes good with their fans and adds free downloadable updates and content to make this worth owning. When I first starting playing Sims 3 I was glued to my chair. After my 5 hours today with Sims 4 I was bored and shut it off. Such a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443633">Expand</a></span>

Hmm, this game is missing so much content that earlier sims series games had. Game has plenty of bugs, including babies meshes can bug really badly, similar to if you download some broken custom content in sims 3, Characters run trough each others, their hands clips through clothes, so called new smarter and emotional sims doesnt really show as they dont react if someone has a baby, or if there was fire on the kitchen and your sims stand next to the fire, his moodlet is happy? Really happy when your house is on fire.. Sims doesnt also care about fire like they can drop their mug in the floor near fire and then leave the house. Also missing major things that sims 3 had like open world and create a style. Tiny worlds,Also less traits. There is also missing some other minor elements like toddlers, pools etc., no basements. Sims 4 actually mis over 89 features compared to earlier base games.(without expansions.) There is loading screens and they are annoying as they pop up all the time, because places are so small, they load pretty fast with my fast computer (5-10secons), but they come often also with only basegame, when expansions start to pop-up loading times will easily grow atleast 2-3x times longer, just like in earlier sim games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4442349">Expand</a></span>

<br>The build mode is the only thing so far that has improved from The Sims 3, you can add entire rooms or easily expand your foundation/walls after building your house.
<br>
<br>The 1 score is for the building mode, i did try hard to find anything else worth adding after hours in-game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4448609">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, the gameplay is too poor compared to the previous Sims&apos; base games. I am disappointed as I expected a better game than what EA badly made. I&apos;m a fan of Sims games but Sims 4 is bad.</span>

You can&apos;t do things that the original Sims 3 game did.  You can&apos;t buy traits so really the only goal you have is to keep your Sim happy.  I won&apos;t go into any more features that this game is lacking.  I just feel like this is another game where EA just sold a name to me without backing it with the content that I am used to.  Plus this game was way too expensive.  Again I felt like I was paying for an improvement to Sims 3.  You can&apos;t improve 2 things and throw away 90 and call it a new edition.  This is a game that needs free apology DLCs to put it on the same level as the Original Sims 3 game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4443432">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing this game for a while now and to say that some things are missing would be kind of an understatement.  Yes,  a great deal of things from the sims 3 are missing among those being babies and pools.  While it is true to say that these missing elements  are a let down and give EA an opportunity to make more cash out the DLC&apos;s, I could not help but think how entertaining this game was.  Seeing all those omissions on paper made me think I would absolutely hate this game, while in all actuality I forgot about those omissions because I was having too much fun with the game.  The new emotions and character creation is enough to engulf me hours upon hours just to try and get the perfect sim.  The world in itself does not seem as vast as previous versions.  But when you kind of think of it, this always happens with game franchises.  Everybody always complains about not getting this feature or that feature from the previous game.  I am personally enjoying my experience playing this game and sincerely hope people actually try it out themselves instead of spewing hate over a game they have never played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>(-) The game runs very smooth on my PC, 60 fps on Ultra settings. + load and save times are much shorter. Graphics look great!
<br>(-) The new UI looks amazing. It&apos;s much easier to find a certain object in Build mode.
<br>(-) I like the new possibilities in Build mode. There are TONS of new options to create unique houses. And the controls are easy.
<br>(-) Multitasking is amazing. This is a big improvement. My Sims feel more human because of this. It&apos;s very cool to see them talking while they&apos;re playing games for example. Though they tend to change (seating) positions a lot when they&apos;re in a conversation, which is kinda annoying.
<br>(-) Emotions are awesome! Again, a huge improvement. Now you actually notice that your Sim is angry, sad, emotional and so forth. It&apos;s so much fun to see you&apos;re Sim hiding in his bed when he&apos;s embarrassed. Again, they feel more like humans.
<br>(-) Public places are fun! I never really like public places in The Sims 3, because they were kinda chaotic. In The Sims 4 this changed a lot. It&apos;s a lot of fun to go to the gym and talk to other Sims during your workout. And I like that when you&apos;re sitting in the bar talking to another Sim, other Sims can join the conversation.
<br>(-) Promotions. Even though the new careers are not really my thing I do like the new system. You have to complete certain tasks to get a promotion. When you actually get a promotion you&apos;ll also receive a gift like a new PC when you&apos;re a blogger.
<br>(-) The world is beautiful. Yes, we don&apos;t have an open world like in The Sims 3 anymore. But because of this the game runs very smooth. And the world looks much nicer now. My Sim was eating in the backyard yesterday and the view was amazing. I could see a fast food restaurant and a highway and beautiful hills. Really nice.
<br>
<br>So far great impressions. It really feels like a new Sim game and it&apos;s a very solid base game!
<br>
<br>What I don&apos;t like so far are the careers. It&apos;s cool to be an astronaut but not very realistic. I miss the business, medical, political, law enforcement careers and so forth. I don&apos;t understand why the developers removed those.
<br>
<br>Maybe my opinion will change after playing it again later today, but for now I&apos;m impressed. Yes, they removed some big things like pools and toddlers, and I&apos;m not happy about that but they&apos;ve added many new cool things. Too bad nowadays all people do is hate on gamedevelopers that dare to change things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441972">Expand</a></span>

The Sims 3 runs horrible on even the best computers suffering from freezes that progressively get worst forcing you to use debug cheats and restarting the game to fix it or even downloading user created mods to fix all the issues.
<br>
<br>The Sims 4 may not have one seamless world but is also does not have a 10 minute load screen at the start of the game. All the loading screens take less than 30 seconds and you can travel anywhere you want even to different worlds faster than you can travel to your neighbors house in The Sims 3.
<br>
<br>As for not having pools, The Sims 4 has fountains which function the same in every way as pools except you can not swim in them (which was useless anyway). With the fountains you can also install various different water emitters in them to make them look even better than pools.
<br>
<br>The biggest thing i think that The Sims 4 does not have that The Sims 3 did is the style editor. The Sims 4 will not allow you to create custom styles for objects and clothes but that do have a few premade styles for almost every object. I believe the style editor was a big contributing cause to the horrible performance issues of The Sims 3 and may be why they chose to leave it out.
<br>
<br>The Sim Creator is very easy and intuitive. The way it works is you just click on any part of the sim and drag it different ways to change size, shape and position. You can tell what part of the sim you are editing by the way the game highlights the part.
<br>
<br>Of course The Sims 4 does not have all the content of Sims 3 with all its expansive packs costing 100&apos;s of dollars but The Sims 4 base game has all the content an reasonable person would expect from a base game. Also there is no amount of content The Sims 3 can have that will make it a better game over the superior performance and smooth gameplay of The Sims 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4442080">Expand</a></span>

Ok so no more cast however I had rarely used it, only when the preset styles were ugly (many of which were in the Sims 3) but I liked the styles to choose from in ts4. It&apos;s not compatible with the game engine so I got over it. There&apos;s only so much they could do with so little time and the corporate heads breathing down the developers necks. I can&apos;t wait to see what this sequel will turn out to be. I think it will only get better and I like the base game the way it is. If all of this is to much for you don&apos;t buy the game.however I will enjoy this game for many years to come. I loved the emotions and create a sim also.

Yes, The Sims 4 does not show many changes from the third to the fourth, but there was an evolution from second to fourth, then, satisfied me.

The camera control give you more option to view - control sim with new way. Sim can do more than 1 task at the same time. in Sim 4 I can play chess and chatting with friends. control sim sit down and... &apos;do somethings&apos;. The programmer must do more more work when sim can do 2 task or more at same time. Sim act as real person that use can control but sometime can&apos;t because Sim don&apos;t need to do that.... at lot of think. with me.

<br>Sim City has already drawn so much attention and become a legend of simulation games in modern era. Today, another legend has born, which is this wonderful game.
<br>
<br>Sims 4 has significant improvement over its predecessor. It has an improved UI, which is more user friendly. Its graphic is superb and oustanding. On a technical side, the optimization is perfect, the game is running extremely smoothly. The game play elements also bring the simulation of life to a new level. It has a lot of elements added, and offers a great variety of game play choices for players. Also, it is very realistic, which is an outstanding life simulator.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game has a lot of innovative and creative improvement, which is a must-have for all fans of simulation.
<br>
<br>I am already looking forwards for more DLCs to come. Please do not release expansions again like the old-days, as this takes too much time for development. Fans want new contents as soon as possible. Developers, please try to release more and more DLCs on a weekly, or if possible, on a daily basis. Fans are eager to pay for more FUN! ;)
<br>
<br>Every one, please join me to celebrate the great launch day of such fantastic title!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441767">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game feels so totally shallow with none of the charm of its early predeceors, the lack of content (which is sure to be sold back to us piece by piece) is another disappointing feature. The game looks like it was meant to be an &apos;always online, mmo sim-city esc&apos; game, but after getting spooked by the debacle that was Sim City they went back to their roots, albeit money grubbing the whole way.

<br>The game gets a single point for allowing me to repopulate the entire city with my own Sim&apos;s seed with little-to-no negative repercussions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4496829">Expand</a></span>

I know I&apos;m always a bit bummed with each new sims because I&apos;m losing all the expansions from the last, but even knowing that going into this game, i still could not even find the basics.  Sims 4 is a highly watered down version of what i used to love.  I cant get into caring about my sims. Nothing i do make any real difference and they do really nothing unique unless i tell them to.
<br>
<br>Loading is all over the place and it kills it for me.  They told us about neighborhoods but i did NOT think that meant load times to walk to my next door neighbors house!  The towns themselves are decimated and about 1/3 the size they used to be... if even that.
<br>
<br>Then comes customization! At this point, i feel totally fine saying there is really none to be had. You are limited to their choices in colors and styles for everything for you hair and eyes, to you clothes, your furniture, your walls, appliances... everything really.  I dont like a lot of their pre-set options either.  The very least I am done playing this game until Create-a-Style comes back.  Its not Sims without customization.  Anyone else remember 1 and 2?  you could make your own MODELS for furniture and other things and import completely new items into the game.  Sims 3 irritated me at first with the removal of that ability but from a business stance i understood.. And sims 3 did provided many in game ways to still make their models look the way you wanted them too through color and pattern.  Now i cant even kind of do that.
<br>
<br>Simulation games have so much more computing power to play with in today&apos;s general home set-ups.  EA&apos;s decision to takes 10 giant steps backwards as far as game features in Sims 4 just rankles and smacks of shady business practices.  I&apos;m sure an expansion will come out with more customization options that will cost another $40.  This is something the sims series has done each round... remove standard features and re-introduce them as expansions... but this is hitting the limit of my tolerance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sims-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4460515">Expand</a></span>
