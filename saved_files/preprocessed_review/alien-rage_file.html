I`d compare it to Bulletstorm, which is about two classes better. For 5$, yea it`s worth it. A feeling of cheapness for this game is overwhelming. But yea, this game is decently playable.
<br>
<br>Good things first.
<br>So we have Unreal Engine here, looks pretty good in 2014 but it is aging rapidly. Graphics are nice enough, nothing particulary bad. Some levels really look great.
<br>The music is okay too. Nothing special but fits the scenery, doesn`t irritate.
<br>Guns feel and shoot like standard fps hardware. There are 7 types of which have their own differences. I like how the ironsights look on them, they sound and look pretty good.
<br>
<br>Now the bad things.
<br>There is no story. You just shoot stuff and blow things up.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is standard, but the actual text is very annoying. So all the voice actors do a good job while the guy who wrote the stuff didn`t do good at all.
<br>
<br>AI is horrible. Yes, they take cover, they shoot, they seem to have some strategy but after 30seconds you notice what is wrong with them. They are far too accurate even on lowest difficulty setting. They are far too quick. They have unlimited ammo, so you get sprayed with grenades all the time. They do not see walls, so even when you hide, they know exactly where you are and they shoot you through the walls.
<br>Then all you have to do is crouch hidden, they will come running like sheep one by one. They are really tough too, so the only way you can survive is to score multiple headshots.
<br>And so with an exception of minigun and boss stages, every single enemy shootout looks the same in Alien Rage. You walk into a room, a flood of monsters appears, rinse and repeat.
<br>Oh yes, the boss battles. They`re not that bad, just not fun at all.
<br>While walking through the game I had a feeling that no one tested the gameplay. There are so many cheap player deaths here that you have to stop playing every 2 hours just not to throw your monitor.
<br>
<br>There are no powerups, no special skills or facilities. You get three most basic player perks and that`s it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4365586">Expand</a></span>

That adds to the fights a little, but it becomes quickly just another meh...I saw you coming, shotgun to the face brother. And the weapons? Alien shotgun, human shotgun, alien assault rifle, human..you get it. All the fights in this game are the same fight over and over again, and new enemies add nothing, because they are just an old enemy with more health or stupid stuff like that. The story and characters are laughable, but I would forgive that if the gameplay was any fun. Like this, it just adds to the pile of ****. The levels are nothing more than dark corridors illuminated by orange and blue lights. That&apos;s all...no exploration, just some corridors. And a few pointless collectables that you need to &quot;explore&quot; to find. (meaning they are a little off the set path, like any modern game).  The reason why this does not get a zero is because the fight (not the fightS because, like I said, there is only one fight repeated again and again) was somewhat enjoyable and there were a few moments that made me sweat a little (boss fights, avoiding a deadly minigun turret, stuff like that)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4404854">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s hampered by more than a few problems, especially at launch, but they are mostly fixed by now. It feels like a good mix of old sensibilities with the new, but even that is hampered by the damn annoying health regeneration or no armor. Now, look, I see why health regen is a go to game element, game developers. You want the players to keep on moving without stopping for health items to keep the action going, but even that is rectified by having health items YOU CARRY ON YOU like in FEAR 1 and FEAR 2! Which are games I love.
<br>
<br>To confound matters further, it  feels insanely silly that Alien Rage kept telling me where to go despite the areas being so straightfoward and linear. I don&apos;t HATE linear games, by the way, but here it just seems laughable when there is an objective marker! Go here, press a button, move on, and repeat. That is what the areas are kind of like in this game driven by a not that amazing story, despite the badass space marine action. However, I still cannot deny that I enjoyed this fairly visually stunning game, even when blinded by the excessive visual effects! The addictive scoring system really aids in the fun as well, and we even have perks to power up with.

<br>A decent game, let it pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3751851">Expand</a></span>

I think it&apos;s mainly more hardcore, old-school gamers liking this. Not because of all the old-school elements, but because of the difficulty factor. For a first-person shooter, the campaign is a challenge on normal difficulty (named &quot;hard&quot; difficulty on start-up). You don&apos;t have much warning of when you die, the A.I. won&apos;t wait for you to recover when behind cover. Expect to die a lot, even the best of gamers will find dying isn&apos;t a rarity with this game. That&apos;s why it&apos;s a game built for gamers that grew up with more challenging games such as the original doom. Another retro feel to it is...wait for it...actual bosses. Not like the ones they throw at you in modern shooters, but bosses that are actually a challenge to kill. Fresh of breath air, yet so nostalgic at the same time.
<br>
<br>First thing I want to point out about the graphics is that the environment is absolutely beautiful. Especially if you&apos;re a sci-fi freak like I am. There is so much to take in. The lighting is also something else that is very well done. The textures don&apos;t really stand out since it is a dark game, but the lighting and art-style make up for that. The shooter mechanics are also simple and smooth.
<br>
<br>There is a scoring system, but you won&apos;t really pay much attention to that unless you really want to. The story kneels more towards the weak side, but the game is still enjoyable. This game is sort of geared towards a niche&apos;d market, but it is still a good title. Just don&apos;t go in expecting a story on The Last of Us or Mass Effect&apos;s caliber because it&apos;s not. The narration is humerous, but that&apos;s pretty much as much character development as you get.
<br>
<br>MULTIPLAYER:
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t gotten much of a chance to play it, but from my brief experience I can tell you I have already experienced most of it because there is not much to it. Don&apos;t expect it to be strong on the multiplayer department, but then again most of us didn&apos;t go in this game wanting to try out the multiplayer. I think a co-op feature would have worked better for a title like this than multiplayer because the multiplayer is extremely bland.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s only 2 modes, Team Deathmatch and Deathmatch which you can prbably already know what they&apos;re about. It&apos;s enjoyable but only for a small amount of time since there is no incentive to keep playing. There isn&apos;t too much weapon variety so don&apos;t go in expecting many guns, the guns that are there are really enjoyable to use.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this game is a title worth picking up, especially for 20 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3590873">Expand</a></span>

Single player is amazing, lots of action and explosions! Game is really hard, i spent 6h and i didnt even unlock half of the levels.

Alien Rage is a game about shooting from first person view-point, that&apos;s it, there is nothing else behind it. It is dependant on it&apos;s gameplay, not a story. You should understand that some games are meant to be senseless, just for fun. Look at Serious Sam games. What&apos;s the story there? Aliens start attacking Earth after humans discovered some ancient artifact and Sam goes to kill them all, that&apos;s it and yet Serious Sam is an insanely great shooter imho. I mean if you are watching porn, you are watching it for....you know what, you don&apos;t look for story in there.
<br>That&apos;s what Alien Rage is about: shoot aliens, survive and make it to the end. I am not going into details here because if you are reading this review, you&apos;ve probably seen some gameplay videos and decided everything for yourself already. Just keep in mind that this one is an old-school type fps with some cover system to it which actualy didn&apos;t feel bad at all even though i kinda hate cover based fps but this one got away with it it seems. Consider it to be something like Hard Reset with same level of difficulty and  similar pace of action but with using cover and not that many available upgrades</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3597628">Expand</a></span>

<br>When i started playing i had to restart from the first Checkpoint about 10 times until i made the it to the second checkpoint, just because you have to use cover and aim for the head of the enemies (on hardest Difficult). Its not a &quot;BOOM IM ALLMIGHTY&quot;-Shooter. If you are looking for a challenge this game will bring it to you.
<br>The graphics are ok, not groundbreaking, not bad. Its Unreal Engine, so you may know how it looks like. I saw one smaller bug and had to restart that checkpoint, but it didnt recreate so  i dont bother about it.
<br>I got disappointed by so many &quot;Blockbuster-Full-Price-Games&quot; the last months and years, but this cheap game rocks them all. I grew up in the 90&apos; with games you had to replay from the beginning if you lost all your lifes. I loved the Doom and Quake games. Alien Rage is the first game for years i can compare to them. Its not a horror game where you fear the shadows like Doom 3, its just a good Sci-Fi Shooter where skill counts. Give it a try if you like it hard :-D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3596758">Expand</a></span>

I am really happy that dude could find work in this day and age of games that are trying to be movies and points and skill are irrelevant unless playing online.

Graphics are outstanding, but I do experience some slowdown as some scenes get can graphically complex that tax my Crossfire setup. I can dip as low as 18FPS at times. Either way a great old school shooter for a great price.</span>

<br>i just wanted some puzzles here and there and the game really lacks characters coz the only character is YOU  also the story is nothing new and they should&apos;ve made some abilities in your armor and some upgrades to your weapons

<br>Unbelievably harshly criticised this game isn&apos;t anything like as bad as pro-reviews are saying.
<br>
<br>This is IGN&apos;s review.
<br>&quot; Between its lack of personality or distinctive, original features of any kind, and completely non-existent multiplayer community, the only memorable aspect is its annoying and frustrating difficulty spikes.&quot;
<br>
<br>Complete rubbish. It has originality because there just aren&apos;t any FPS sci-fied up games like this about. (No comment on multiplayer other than there might be if they gave it a fair review.) The difficulty spikes are a myth. I played through on hard, out of 1 - challenging, 2 - hard, 3 - brutal. I finished only minutes ago, and I never got stuck on a difficulty spike. I was very worried about getting this game because of this comment, but I loved the demo, and risked buying it. I am glad I did. Sometimes I had to repeat bits, but I didn&apos;t care coz I was having such a good time. The weapons and the bad guys are sci-fi spot on. Often I passed checkpoints first time.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s fairly straight forward. Pick up guns, run over ammo to collect, and shoot the baddies. The plot plays out with the story, so you just have to get from A-B in one piece. The only time it got tricky was with the boss fights, but I got most of them quite quickly beaten. The last boss may be my favourite all time boss. It was just so cool. The last level was like it was lifted straight out of the closing twenty-five mins of an action sci-fi movie.
<br>
<br>The graphics literally sparkle but you don&apos;t need a massive rig to run it. Something like a gen 1 i3 3GHz, and a GTX 650, and you&apos;re away with it maxed. I added x32 AA in the Nvidia Control Panel so it looked tidy.
<br>
<br>My only criticism is you start every level with a minimum of ammo. Even though you just maybe walked through a door from the last level, you loose heaps of ammo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4101422">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty sets it apart from some games because it forces you to pick are harder setting than &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;. In the end the entire package is enjoyable if your looking for a good arcade style FPS that gives you a good amount of bang for your buck.</span>

                                        <span>I give an 8 for the singleplayer. Its a great action game that really keeps you interested till the end. The story isnt that great but the game is all about the action. A.I could be done a bit better and ive encountered some bugs but for 20 euro its a great deal. I had games for 60 euro in the past that dont even come close to this game. Highly recommended.</span>

But it&apos;s a fantastic strategic-shooter, in the sense that you really have to try different strategies for each area not to die.
<br>The plot and dialogue are better than both Halo and Bulletstorm, both of which it has some cultural ancestry through. And yes, it is a little derivative of Halo in terms of the weapon system, but then, Halo was derivative of virtually everything.
<br>I wouldn&apos;t advise any difficulty level other than &apos;Challenging&apos; - you&apos;re really not going to enjoy the game otherwise. But played right, this is reminiscent of the difficulty of Serious Sam 1 on &apos;Hard&apos; mode, trying to desperately think of a way to not die and go back to your savegame.
<br>
<br>The visuals, though perplexing and detailed at first, quickly become navigable, and in time you&apos;ll come to appreciate how polished this game is, both in textural and structural details.
<br>
<br>Sound-wise - pretty good, pretty standard, though some nice touches here and there.
<br>And I actually found the boss fights pretty satisfying and enervating - a great combination of &apos;figure out the strategy&apos; and adrenaline-fueled desperation and chasing.
<br>
<br>If you never played an old-school FPS, get used to the following tactics -
<br>1. Cover is not always going to stay upright, or be perfect at blocking explosions and bullets, depending on how wide it is and where you&apos;re placed.
<br>2. Retreat to better tactical location is always an option, and usually necessary.
<br>3. Fast reflexes and headshots win wars.
<br>
<br>Overall a very satisfying experience, and no-way-near worth the ire it&apos;s attracted. Again, not everybody&apos;s game - but then, why would it be? And what&apos;s wrong with another game that&apos;s not as simple or puerile as GoW clones?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3932315">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Overall, this game has just been really frustrating to me. I was dying quite a lot especially during the parts when I was trying to take cover to regenerate my health and then like 4 or more enemies would come rushing over to where I was taking cover and killed me. I was having some fun with the few different weapons in the game to shoot at the enemies, though.</span>

It&apos;s like a cross of Killzone and Quake, truly amazing experience. The only thing is that I seem to have small problems with stuttering on my system  but it doesn&apos;t have to be because of the game itself.</span>

This game is great value for $20-odd. I am about halfway through and enjoying it. It is, after all, a game and that means you play it for fun. I am not looking for a deep meaningful story or believable characters, I just want a bit of fun. Seems like a lot of other users feel the same.</span>

<br>They were all a challenge on hard settings and I like a good challenge, but Alien Rage ist nothing but unfair. The fact that you die every 10 seconds at a boss battle, doesn&#xB4;t make a game hard. You don&#xB4;t gain anything from the death, like in Dark Souls where you learn something new about a boss and can change your tactics. But in Alien Rage, you die so fast. I shot the first boss down to half and wanted to change cover, had full energy and I could&#xB4;nt run 2 meters till I was dead.
<br>The most annoying thing is, that the talking is also repeated every time you restart a boss battle. Your character always says the same words and I hate something like that. I turned down the voice volume in the menu! Reminds me Prince of Persia The sands of time, were you had to activate a machine and one of the guards screamed at every single  move of the machine &quot;Careful! Think about you&#xB4;re doing!&quot;

While playing i even thought maybe the devs should&apos;ve made a 3rd person shooter instead, it would&apos;ve worked better i think because their &apos;&apos;hardcore&apos;&apos; FPS making skills are pretty sub par, unbalanced as hell and on purpose punishing difficulty doesnt equal to hardcore shooter experience, its just bad game making period.
<br>
<br>Medium difficulty alone is broken not allowing you to progress a on rails segment making you change it to Easy (in game called Challenging), but when you do that game doesnt allow you change it back anymore which is something i&apos;ve never seen. Enemies are running around like theyre just drank 1000 litres of energy drinks charging your reticle and sights, enemies can deal you splash damage thru walls and solid objects, enemies splash damage doesnt hurt other enemies while when i misfire explosive i get damage, enemies have stupidly god like accuracy, everytime you pop your head of out cover they hit hard, overall there&apos;s just so many many stupidly annoying little things that drive you almost nuts. Atleast the shooting itself is decent, it doesnt have any weight or much feel, but it does the job thankfully. Movement is is really fast paced, but can feel rough, you can get a bit stuck on ground geometry, you cant jump higher than 20 cm off the ground meaning theres not any freedom of horizontal movement cuz you cant jump over even the smallest of objects.
<br>
<br>All and all it doesnt do anything particularly well, other budget shooters have had more satisfying gameplay, story is generic but atleast doesnt get in the way too much, performance can be all over the place with dropping frames, theres few bugs and glitches i encountered, meaning its really not that well optimized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=7598110">Expand</a></span>
