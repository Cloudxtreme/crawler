I played the first five titles in the series extensively each in their own hay day. Especially Marvel vs. Capcom 2. I really loved this franchise, I can&apos;t say other Capcom properties have the strength this one has, which is why it hurts that the brutal honest truth about Infinite is it&apos;s just a bad game. I don&apos;t give established franchises or IP&apos;s with a lot of hype slack. The removal of characters like the XMEN and other non-disney Marvel properties is felt, and it is painful. Their absence leaves a less diverse roster. The argument that you can just play Black Panther rather than Wolverine is a weak one because losing the characters that built the franchise just shows how much it has lost its way.  This game suffers do to a much more barebones, beat by beat, slapstick story; lacking any intelligent writing, interesting character interactions, or actual meaning. The story is an easy step down from Marvel vs. Capcom 3.  The Infinity Stones aren&apos;t a gimmick and they definitely are a core part of the game, but in terms of making gameplay deeper and more satisfying, i&apos;m gonna have to say they aren&apos;t revolutionary enough to warrant a new entry in the franchise. The Infinity Stones simply don&apos;t make this a better game. The gameplay other than that really just feels like a remaster of the second game, while thats a good thing it feels like a version of the second game with less characters, ultimately once again making it a step down. This game runs well but the graphics are just pitiful. You can try to argue the style is a matter of taste but still, there&apos;s nothing wrong with MVC 2&apos;s art style and I think most would agree it is superior. The sound design is easily my least favorite part of this game. We have some of the worst voice acting in a AAA game of recent memory, sound effects straight out of the dreamcast era, and to make matters worse sounds often won&apos;t sync up with any part of the game. You can argue most of what I&apos;ve criticized can be patched out, but I don&apos;t subscribe to the game devs are untouchable ideology. If a game is bad at launch i&apos;m not defending it. Capcom shows that this game was all profit no heart through their actions. The game has an unfriendly UI, a tacked on story, almost a dozen characters hidden behind a paywall, and a very clear mentality that this game is anti-casual. This game is a repeat of Street Fighter V in the sense that its very clearly meant to trick casuals into thinking they can go pro, and make Capcom thousands of dollars off of tournament revenue. Whether or not you love Capcom, don&apos;t defend anti-consumer decision making.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=7526475">Expand</a></span>

The game takes advantage of the old characters, but there was a deep balance, and new skills. The characters are better worked and deep. The developers have already said that they have had to take advantage of many characters because of the low budget given by Capcom. The game is not good for casuals, there is not much offline content, but those who like fighting games will fall in love with this game. The criticism was perverse, and the game the guys speak badly because one follows the opinion of the other, without playing and analyzing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=7577087">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ll start with good stuff. Gameplay is great, intuitive and the most noob-friendly across all the titles. You can get crazy combos just pressing the buttons approximately to what you wish to do. I&apos;ve never been a hardcore fighting player and this game is definitely fun to play with friends. That&apos;s about it.
<br>Now the bad points.
<br>1) The story is honestly pretty weak and has nothing really cool about it. Tekken story wasn&apos;t amazing as well, but at least it had some really epic moments and the last fight was pumped up af. Nothing like that in MvC. The last boss is just ridiculously stupid.
<br>2)The roster is not very big and has some really weird picks, like, Firebat. Wtf is Firebat? I don&apos;t even want to google it, he looks like some generic fire-demon and it&apos;s plainly lame.
<br>3)Again. Where is full arcade mode with endings for every character? Tekken didn&apos;t have it and MvC doesn&apos;t have it as well. That&apos;s disappointing.
<br>4)Character design is baaaad. Just bad. Half of the Capcom characters look really ugly and the rest are mediocre at best. Marvel characters are not really much better and have maybe a couple of good-looking ones, like Gamora, Captain Marvel and Hulk. After MK X and new Tekken it just hurts to look at them.
<br>5)Poor optimisation. You have to do a rain dance just to set up your controllers, like, for Gods sake, this is a fighting game, full controller support is a first thing you should care about when porting it from consoles! And if your controller gets disconnected during the game you have to completely restart it, cause it won&apos;t work till you do. *Facepalm*  The loadings are pretty long as well. Honestly, I spent half of the playthrough time looking on loading screens and that&apos;s annoying.
<br>MvC just feels like an unfinished product and there is no way anyone should pay a full cost for it. Get it on sale with a 50% discount and maybe then it will be a good value for the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite/user-reviews?user_review_id=7629627">Expand</a></span>

Nothing to blow you away like Injustice had, but certainly better than SFV had.  Netcode is good so online plays nicely.

<br>
<br>I really enjoy this master piece, and I recommend it to anyone who likes fighting games.
<br>
<br>Graphics look cool but soundtrack is not very memorable. Megaman X is my favorite character, I&apos;m glad they did include it here, same as Spiderman. Buy it you won&apos;t regret about it, you shouldn&apos;t hear to haters making biased reviews, they are DC fanboys.</span>
