The voiceover feels a bit polished in the second part, definitely packs more love than before. However, what I still don&apos;t get is why Nico is barely playable? The puzzles seemed to be more logical than I remembered, got stuck only twice due to missed hotspots. I would definitely support the next installment.</span>

The graphic of the background and the characters is great. The story is interesting and accelerates from a quiet investigation toward a fast-paced journey around the world. The game is a little too easy, but in the second episodes there are a couple of very tough riddles. The voice acting is perfect, both in english and in italian. I seriously hope Revolution will continue on producing these games, because they&apos;re one of the few companies that still understand how an adventure game should be made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/broken-sword-5-the-serpents-curse---part-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4511092">Expand</a></span>
