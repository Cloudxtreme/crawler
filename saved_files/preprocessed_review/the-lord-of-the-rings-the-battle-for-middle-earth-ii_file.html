Its campaign is good good with voices and music. Outstanding game play I never get tired of going back and playing a match in multiplayer or even a little of campaign. With the Create a Hero and War of the Ring It gives more game play. The create a hero is Amazing I would be sitting there making heroes with strategy&apos;s for each one, But sooner or later I would have 100 heroes and never use a majority of my strategy&apos;s. As the game is great go play it and if you don&apos;t like it then you aren&apos;t a fan of Lotr. Well thats fine but that dose not mean its not a great game. The balance is very good but still some mess ups there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379846">Expand</a></span>

How is it that the numerous testers were able to final the game, have multiple reviewers play and review it positively, and the vast majority of users are playing and enjoying the game without issue? How would all that be possible if it &quot;always crashes&quot;? Guess what... it&apos;s YOUR POS system at fault. PCs are not consoles folks, you have to maintain and be knowledgable (meeting the system reqs of the game, latest drivers, closed background tasks, free HDD space, running defrag now and then, etc.) Wanna play on the best gaming platform... gotta get wise dudes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385965">Expand</a></span>

Not sure what&apos;s going on with some users who are getting Crashes, I&apos;ve had the game running on my secondary system for about 3 days now. If your system is crashing, and the computers at your local LAN centers are having problems, you might try cleaning off your hard drive a bit, I won&apos;t say what you should clean off, but there are great utilities out there for removing adware and other random spam that you can pick up from &quot;Internet Sites&quot;. Good game EA, I love the presentation as usual. Couple technical notes, if you have a high end computer, set your Anti-Aliasing to 2x or 4x from Windows desktop, really makes the game quite pretty. Oh, last note, Isengard is a bit overpowered, watchout for high ranking players that only use Isengard, they have amazing resource gathering abilities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385923">Expand</a></span>

It is suprisingly, suprisingly good. Believe me. You would be skeptical playing it at first, considering that most games based on a movie kinda falls short. But this doesn&apos;t. Yes its based on a movie but the game itself stands on its own. The pacing is fast and smooth and ive never experienced an RTS game that feels like a &quot;fighting&quot; game. You could play a skirmish in half an hour and thats more than enought to keep you in excited. The sound is excellent. The ambient sounds to the shuffle of armor and the sheating of blades puts you into the game. Also, the replayibility is high. Theres so much variety in the gameplay. Just research about its War of the Ring mode. You install the game, you play the campaign - next thing you know youre already playing for hours and want more. Kudos to EA for this game. The only thing that stopped me from giving it a 10 is that you cannot zoom far enough. Hopefully, they&apos;ll do something about this soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=388325">Expand</a></span>

The micromanagement is there, but the base building -&gt; strategic depth in build orders is missing. In BFME2 there is free building, a dynamic popcap, tons of upgrades. So there is simply way and way more strategic depth in this game. People have WAY more strats to choose from. This is why i choose BFME2 far above EaW. I have to admit that i was really looking forward for EaW and BFME2. But BFME2 got me the &apos;omfg, i need to pwn now!&apos; feeling. EaW couldn&apos;t produce that :( You will find me for a long time on the clan ladders for BFME2! Hope to cya guys there too :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385983">Expand</a></span>

Granted, it&apos;s not really balanced yet - but was there every any RTS-game that was balanced at the day of the release? The BFME1 patch-history wasn&apos;t the greatest - EA has to prove us that they can do better with BFME2. It looks promising, 2 patches are already announced and should come soon. Though one has heard the word &quot;soon&quot; too often in the process of patching BFME1... ;) Anyway, I enjoy playing BFME2 at lot, I know it will keep me busy for months and I&apos;ll enjoy it a lot. It was a game I looked forward to and my expectations were not deceived. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385985">Expand</a></span>

The game has kept some of the elements of the first game, and really built on them and improved both the game dynamics and the strategic depth in the gameplay. You can see that the games are not estranged totally from one another, but the sequel has definitely surpassed any level of skill or fun that the original had. If you liked the original then this game will definitely give you a run for your money, and I can guarantee you&apos;ll enjoy it more. Now, if you were very critical of the first game and thought it was lacking in many serious departments (the Hardcore RTS Gamer, for example) then I think you&apos;ll be very surprised (in a good way!!) when you try this revamped and all round awesome sequel. The multiplayer is going places. It really is a true contender for inclusion in major LAN tournaments and pro leagues. With a few tweaks that EA have committed to making this game could be the next big thing.

Game runs great, even on older computers.</span>

What makes RTS games fun and exciting is the design, the balance, the innovation (the cool things if you will), and the competitive feel of the atmosphere. Let&apos;s look at BfME1 for example. The game simply appealed to players that were less experienced with RTS games because of its simplistic money design, its pre-built defense system aka Walls, it&apos;s cheap control layout and imbalanced 1-man-army heroes. Was this distasteful for more experienced RTS players? Of course it was. More experienced RTS players rely on heavy resource management in terms of both internal economy and external map control. Both are crucial to the success of the game, as seen in the most successful RTS titles -- those fit for WCG/CPL/GGL..etc. Without the drive of map control aka BfME1, a player only focuses on 1 thing, no multi-tasking if you will. Without the drive for effectively stop your enemys resource income in terms of map control/harrassment is the bane of any experienced RTS gamer. Face it, it&apos;s EZ-mode and often times classified as Noob. Take EAW for example, they represent the pinnacle of easy with prebuilt bases, unit structures and an almost infinite amount of resources to whore units from. That&apos;s very distasteful for RTS gamers as it almost exterminates one of the building foundations of RTS: The control of money. So BfME1 had that, EAW had it worse, and BfME2 doesn&apos;t. That automatically puts them on top of both of those games in terms of money control. You have to expand and fight for your money, or you simply, lose. I know how hard it can be for some newer RTS gamers that need walls to hide behind and think of counters, but for the better players, there&apos;s no such barrier. It&apos;s simply more appealing because its faster paced both in micro (unit control) and thinking of counters. That&apos;s how a RTS game is supposed to be. Look at Starcraft and Warcraft, you don&apos;t see any walls or prebuilt armies for you now do you. What has kept those games going is the drive to compete, the drive to become better, and the drive to master your opponent where YOU, the person that can think the fastest, move the fastest and counter the fastest in this new-aged chess will be the victor. No more handicapped bullcrap for you to fall back on -- It&apos;s time to play RTS games how it&apos;s supposed to be played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385963">Expand</a></span>

The game is easy to pickup with a learning curve of about 2 or 3 online games or scrimmishes. Screenshots do not give this game justice, it looks MUCH better when everything is flowing seemlessly without a hitch. Although the game is easy to pickup and play, it also has massive depth to it. There are so many elements present that it changes the game completely. An example is elevation, in maps such as minas tirith or any map with a hill for that matter, arches at the top will have a proportionate increase in range compared to those trying to capture the hill or fortress. Another aspect is the hero&apos;s and custom heros (much too get into detail with herp&apos;s). I highly reccomend this game to any fan of the Lord Of The Rings or strategy games in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=387858">Expand</a></span>

People that actually say they like this game for it&apos;s depth of tactics are down right monkeys. Avoid this game, if you want a good traditional game try Dawn of War or C&amp;C Generals if you want something new try Empire at War.

Building was simple, but the battles were exciting and could see-saw back and forth based on one good or bad move. That is why I am so confused on how they screwed the sequel up so badly. Was the project taken over by a different design team or something? The new build system is atrocious. You have to spread your resources out at spanned intervals in order to get anything out of them, which forces you to build a sprawling base very early. So, what does the AI do? Send in units on suicide raids that completely ignore your armies and run around destroying all your resources. So you can either turtle, and try to frantically defend all your spread out bases, or try to chase his units down, meanwhile hes building up... or lastly... rush him first. That is what is wrong with BFME2. This is the only viable option. It is the only option that works... so every game becomes a VERY predictable game of who can rush who first. After teh first 10 minutes of each game, you know whether you are going to win or lose. There is nothing fun about this. At all. And just in case you wanted to play these meaningless skirmishes over and over, you can head over to the War of the Ring mode. This great feature allows you to play skirmishes over... and over... and over... and guess what? Your armies dont transfer from one battle to the next. Your buildings either. Its the same tired excuse for strategy tacked onto RTS that other games have tried. Note to designers: DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. The campaign is forgettable. Although I havent heard from anyone else, Im having significant graphical issues (flickering), although its still playable. Long story short, it looks like BFME, but it feels like a budget game rushed out to turn a quick buck. It feels unfinished, unbalanced, and worst of all... poorly thought out. My guess is they tried something different, and by the time they realized it wasnt working, it was too late to fix it. They should have kept the gameplay of BFME intact, and just added content and called it an expansion. Instead they did a hackjob on a great game and charged me $50 for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=385900">Expand</a></span>

I was expecting to see new improvements in game-play, Instead they side stepped, turning the series into a Warcraft III clone that offers little to no substance for fans of the original. It is truly a great example of why EA is not a leader and innovator in the genre and can really only copy what</span>

I never played the original but heard it got some pretty good reviews. I picked this game up the day it came out and installed it. Let me tell you this game is the opposite of fun and exciting. There is almost nothing special about this game that makes me want to play I uninstalled it about three days after I bought it and now use the CD as a coaster. Let me preface this part by saying that I play a game called Dawn of War and the expansion Winter Assault, so this may be why I am so spoiled. The battles in BFME2 are downright boring, non-exciting yawnfest&apos;s. I feel like I am baking a cake when I am amassing my armies. The actually fighting itself is uninspired and doesn&apos;t make me feel involved at all. The strategic portion of the game seems clumsy and not well done, as well as the tactical. I love the graphics of the game and the sounds are nice otherwise this game would be a floater in the swimming pool if you know what I mean. If you seriously want a good RTS with action, story, competitive online play. Then do yourself a favor and don&apos;t get this game, get Dawn of War, Winter Assault, and the new expansion that is coming out soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=386007">Expand</a></span>

<br>the game is full of bugs, campaign is too short, quality is nice except from the flickering, tactics are just who&apos;s the first one to rush. and balance is extremely bad. for 4 armies in bfme1 it took ea games like a year for a fair balance, how long will it take now. and when will the last bug be resolved?

<br>maybe one day ea games will release a good game which is actually finished but most likely i will be dead aready when that happens</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=57934">Expand</a></span>

BFME II can look better if i settle for a slide-showing throught the game , i have to give EA that. I wonder how come the gamers hate it but the reviewers love it....$$$...</span>

BFME2 was basically BFME1 with new units and buildings. The campaign wasn&apos;t good. They brought build everywhere back which isn&apos;t original, and now the game is only about rushing. There is absolutely NO TACTIC in BFME2 or BFME2: ROTWK. On multiplayer games, the only thing that people build are archers. The graphics weren&apos;t different than the original. The music didn&apos;t fell LOTRish to me at all. There are big disbalancement issues. The forces of good are unbeattable which makes it pointless for a player to choose the forces of evil. The Create-A-Hero feature was uber crap All the heros of good had the same powers and all the heros of evil had the same powers, they are almost impossible to kill.The campaign missions were to repetitive and it seemed like you were only playing a skirmish game. This game was the biggest RTS disapointment ever. BFME1 was obviously better than BFME2 and BFME ROTWK. Mainly because of the simplicity of gameplay, you had the choice of playing a long campaign or cut through with the army of your choice. The balance was excellent and the graphics good for that time. The music was as good as the movies! It was also based on the movies which felt very familiar but different at the same time. Mark Skaggs was a much better producer then Mike Verdu. The people who gave this game 10/10 obviously are book fans who&apos;ve never played an RTS game before and would give a 10/10 for any kind of game that&apos;s labelled &quot;The Lord of the rings&quot; Don&apos;t buy BFME2. Buy BFME1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=399963">Expand</a></span>

An RTS set in the LOTR universe with large, epic battles, and touted improvements over the first BFME seemed extraordinarily amazing. However, after actually playing BFME 2, I quickly found out that the graphics were very mediocre on a mid level machine causing lots of lag. Despite this, the gameplay seemed extremely lacking as well. Simplistic controls, buttons, and commands made the entire system immensely very watered down. The balance was horrible, destroying bases took seconds. In addition the game mechanics were changed to be more like C&amp;C Generals and a very bad clone of Warcraft III. There is no real-innovation; only lots of glitz and special effects.

The free-build for the game was nice, but it ran into problems, since resources took up a HUGE portion of the map. Perhaps this was done to make the games longer, but for me, I spend a lot of early time building resource buildings so I can build (and maintain) an army and then I have to spend a lot of time defending huge tracts of land. I liked building the huge fortresses of BFME1 better. The addition of the new races makes it a bit more fun (although the Men of the West are basically Gondor and Rohan combined) but they also have some frustrating imbalance issues. For instance, a dwarven axe thrower has a longer range than any other ranged unit that I&apos;ve seen (even Gondor Rangers). The lack of customization on the Create-A-Hero was a little bit of a letdown for me. You can customize the armor, but there&apos;s nothing you can do about the face, and even then, there&apos;s only about 4 or 5 armor selections to choose from. I also didn&apos;t like the fact that when I tried to attack a territory with my Create-A-Hero in the War of the Ring mode, it wouldn&apos;t do it, for whatever reason. A bug? Intentional? I have no idea, but it kind of ruined that aspect of the game for me. The War of the Ring concept is interesting, but really like the Dawn of War: Dark Crusade idea (and I think DoW did it better). However, the mythology and the scope of the game are great and you can get a lot of replayability with it. I&apos;d say just nerf the &quot;superheroes&quot; (e.g. Gimli was able to take down three of my heroes, all level 2, my entire army of about 5 or 6 squads of various types, all at level 1...), patch the War of the Ring to let custom heroes invade territories, and shorten the range of the Dwarven Axe Throwers, and I say the game would get at least an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=417029">Expand</a></span>

This was a horrible &quot;innovation&quot; which attempted to make base building, an already incredibly simple procedure, even simpler. In doing so it removed player flexibility and depth of strategy. Now that you can build anywhere, you have a wide variety of build orders and build strategies to employ. Game pace is thankfully much more engaging now. A good player can defeat a less skilled player in a reasonable amount of time now. Walls cannot be used as a crutch for those incapable of or too lazy to properly control units. The population cap is now flexible. It&apos;s tied into your economy network. The more of the map you control, the more your population cap is increased. This means you must be aggressive and &quot;attack the map&quot; rather than sit in your base and hope you survive without really doing anything to facilitate your own victory. WHAT DOESN&apos;T WORK: There are too many special ring points now. This is the same problem that was seen going from Generals to its expansion pack, Zero Hour. There are too many &quot;cool&quot; point and click powers which take away from the skill needed to tactically defeat your opponent. The economy is a little too &quot;loose&quot;. You dont have specific points on the map that are of strategic value. In some ways open space itself is a valuable strategic point but in order for maps to properly supply this, they need to be fairly large which slows down the game pace. Overall Battle for Middle Earth 2 is something that more experienced RTS gamers would like. I know for a fact that many of the people who were disgusted with the simplistic gameplay of BFME 1 are now enjoying the pace and style of gaming found in BFME 2. BFME 2 is a serious improvement over BFME 1. It&apos;s still not quite C&amp;C, but it&apos;s a very good game that is certainly worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=386001">Expand</a></span>

It will play with 512MB but make sure you have enough virtual ram allocated. A better set-up would be at least 1GB of ram and preferably 2GB. Those that had crashes can try this it worked for me. Don&apos;t give up on this game, it&apos;s a lot of fun and has great replay value online or skirmish settings. You can even set up your own heros... There are alot of games that are technically perfect (CIV IV or ES:OBLIVION) but not fun to play and then there are games that probably could use some facelifts but are great to sit down to and play on a daily basis (LOTR, CIV II, COMMAND and CONQUER).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=386874">Expand</a></span>

The only bad part about the game is the story line in campaign mode. Good mode is crap and to easy. Evil mode is harder and more of a challenge. ps if you want a kick@$$ army go for the goblins. pps dont wait for an army youll die right away.</span>

They did a lot of things right in this game like the sound effects and the semi-RPG elements with the units and character, but they also did a lot of things wrong like the &quot;power up&quot; ability. 1st off they take way too long to recharge and also they are really expensive so you&apos;ll generally have to wait a long time before you can buy another one.</span>

Good Asymetiric balance enough factions that gameplay felt varried and Wall building was a blast building little cities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7349511">Expand</a></span>
