(Don&apos;t worry, the mod can be configured to be just like the vanilla game, without any useless modifications done by overenthusiastic modders.) Otherwise the story is great, the city feels great, the activities and the customization are fun.</span>

Most of the missions are a lot of fun. I must admit though that the &quot;boss battles&quot; are ridiculously easily. And there are a lot of fun things to do around Stilwater which help boost your Respect rating to unlock more missions and progress the story even further. Customization could offer a lot more -- and this is what surprised me the most -- because there is more stuff to buy (mainly clothes) in a game like GTA: San Andreas than there is in Saints Row 2. Not a big fan of the music in this game either. The game has been patched and that supposedly fixed a lot of the bugs that people were complaining about as well as adding 16:9 resolution support. As far as PC optimization goes, Saints Row 2 was no doubt built to be played on consoles, but for its low price on Steam, it&apos;s practically as steal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1780715">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s my favorite in the series, one of my favorite games of all time even, but the PC optimization was horrid.  Even with GoTR mod installed, this port still struggles to struggle at times.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t like the idea of Gat Outta Hell?  You&apos;re not alone.  Play SR2+SR:TT instead, and forgot the series ever happened after that.</span>

it&apos;s only flaw: you need a powerful pc even to run it on everything low: My -XP intel core 2 duo 2.5ghz, 3gb ram, nvidia 8600m gt 512mb- runs it ok on low until i get in a car and smash stuff, then it goes &quot;not so smooth&quot;</span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>The open world is huge and a joy to explore, there are lots of places you can walk into, lots of activities for you to do and its just generally impressive.
<br>The characters might not be the best, but in my opinion, they are really memorable and (mostly) live on to be classics in the series.
<br>There is a mod called &quot;Gentleman in the row&quot;, which fixes a lot of the problems mentioned below:
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>The controls are bottom line HORRIBLE. When walking and in combat, its OK, however when driving, they are absolutely abysmal and slippery, much worse than in GTA IV.
<br>The graphics, even for the time, are not very good. Character models look dated and textures are fairly weak. Yes, the shadows are good, but very basic. Even though I am not one to fuss over graphics, Saints Row 2 does look very dated in comparison to other games and even later entries in the series.
<br>The frame rate is all over the place. Sometimes, it is really high, then its really low. Explain that????
<br>
<br>Overall, Saints Row 2 is a very good game, however, PC issues really bring it down. I recommend downloading the gentleman of the row mod to fix some of these issues as it really makes the game feel a lot better. The game gets an extra point for the gameplay after installing the mod.
<br>
<br>Original Score: 6/10
<br>Score with mod: 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4906825">Expand</a></span>

I love the fact that you are able to store you cars / helicopters / planes / boats, I also love the fact you can customize your cars to suite you style. A feature GTA does not offer to my knowledge. And the list of side missions and diversions is huge. I have uncounted at least one new diversion every time I play. I would defiantly recommend this game to anyone that has a platform that can support it, and if you can ... get a 360 controller. Makes life in still water a breeze.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=422136">Expand</a></span>

Definitely worth your $40 compared to $60 on the 360. I do admit, it can be quite laggy even for my 2100$ velocity with a nice gamecard, i dont know what it takes to be regular...must be an alienware...</span>

The whole game is so diverse in everything you can do in Stilwater, the cinematics are brilliantly choreographed and cinematography is excellent, hilarious and sad lines are delivered by the cast flawlessly, and the gameplay is all around great. However, the optimization is poor. I can run it at a smooth 30 FPS through and through, but sometimes I get that drop. At first I was going to childishly tell off the people that couldn&apos;t play the game with its graphics engine about how they should lower the settings, but I checked the settings menu, and it turns out there weren&apos;t many to lower. There are no texture or model detail settings to change, but you can turn things like shadows and depth of field off, but my framerate still stayed at thirty when just staring down at a floor. That is, though, most likely because there would be a framerate cap added to make it stay that way. I normally hate consoles with dread, but unless you have an above-average computer, this is probably a console choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=84524">Expand</a></span>

How lazy is that? they couldn&apos;t change it to an arrow? That is how the rest of the game plays. Cheap and nasty. Poorly optimized for the PC.

The storyline is after all not new, but always thrilling and definately more interresting than the boring imigration drama, gta 4 came up with. Important charakters are few, but well balanced and individual. Great + for the very individual charakter-editing options right from the beginning. You don&apos;t just get a charakter u have to live with, you create him/her right from the beginning. And the minigames.. when did you last time find a game where it always gets better? Taking part in a &quot;bad cops&quot; episode, showing what the viewers wanna see, spraying the rich-peoples phallus-symbols with sh*t, a Crash-Dome, fight clubs, after all its a lot of fun. Even if its not as unfair Hyped as GTA 4, which is still more a open Beta, than a playable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=423445">Expand</a></span>

While it is not a great game in terms of graphics, its fantastic story and bad ass moments keep me feelings great. even though there is one very big difficulty spike in the game, overall combat is balanced.

The sidekicks in the game are funny and memorable. Gat, a psychotic killer who constantly cracks jokes. Shaundi, a pothead who constantly steals Pierce&apos;s thunder and gets around town. Pierce, a thug who whines about your music selection, loves opera, and is comic relief. The rival gangs are also quite memorable, from the hardcore tattooed Brotherhood, the voodoo practicing Sons of Jamaica, to the Japanese gang, the Ronin, ran by the pansy and spoiled son of a hardcore mobster. I do find it&apos;s rating to be completely undeserving, for it really is so much more fun than GTA. The only reason I can see why it doesn&apos;t have a higher rating, is because too many people have a boner for GTA and constantly, and unfairly, compare the two. The two games, while about open city crime, as two different philosophies.

And even if i ignore all those problems the game still manages to disappoint.  The driving is ,bad which is unforgivable in a sandbox game such as this. The action feels dated and more similar to GTA: San Andreas than any newer sandbox games. It short it feels static, non-responsive and the AI is a mess that cant aim for **** I wont criticize the story too much since i didnt come to far into the game, but what i saw didn&apos;t impress me. No this game feels dated and unfinished even if you ignore all the the other problems which you clearly shouldn&apos;t, I heard that this game was supposed to be really good on consoles but sadly i haven&apos;t seen anything even resembling that when playing this game on pc.

The story while not exactly portraying great complexity none the less makes me actually have some care and attachment to those involved in it far more than any recent RPGs managed. A thoroughly great sequel to a solidly decent game.</span>

Excellent story line, great game play, not overly American gangstery if you use the British voice. To me it takes all the great things about Vice city and improves the graphics, storyline and game play. In terms of technical issues I had none. In terms of being a bad port of a console game, I only found that the need to tap the driving controls was a pain because it was design for thumb stick controls not keyboard but that was about it. The game is great fun and was well worth the $70 AUD I paid. I&apos;m by no means saying its the perfect game but it provides alot of fun and got me hooked playing it because the quality of the storyline was so good. But I highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=422661">Expand</a></span>

Comparing to GTA4, it looked and ran a whole lot better at higher resolution. But what actually gives it the score isn&apos;t how it&apos;s better than GTA4 in those aspects, it&apos;s how it simply is pure fun. I&apos;ve played it far beyond the time it takes to finish the main missions, actually, I&apos;ve yet to finish the main story. There&apos;s so much to do that&apos;s fun beyond the missions, just running around with a weapon in the city and messing with the people is something I have yet to get bored of even though the large amount of hours spent on it. The co-op mode is also awesomely fun, if you find the right person to play with, chaos can easily ensue. The mini-games are made so they don&apos;t feel like mini-games and feels just a natural part of what you do.and most of them are entertaining. The character creation is fun that I also managed to spend multiple hours on, the amount of choices are huge, and you can if you&apos;re willing to spend time on it, get quite good likenesses. There is just as much clothes to choose between. But, the cartoony style and humorous approach the game was made with didn&apos;t get a good reception from many GTA4 fans, and they call it ugly. The amount of graphical features in Saints Row 2 surprised me when I compared visuals between it and GTA4, especially when my framerate was so much better in Saints Row. There are lightsources almost everywhere you go, you don&apos;t go unshaded, and ambient occlusion covers the rest. That with the multiple shadows cast makes Saints Row look fresh from almost every angle. The only reason I can&apos;t give Saints Row 2 a 10 is because of technical issues, it is still not a good port, and due to how some of the faster cars are handled with steering. Driving isn&apos;t always fun in Saints Row 2. A very strong 9/10, even though it&apos;s a bad port :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743722">Expand</a></span>

For me it was much more enjoyable than another crime simulator released this year. The online co-op is very entertaining, it is fully integrated into the story missions. More to do and more fun to be had in Stillwater than in Liberty City.</span>

And even if you do overcome that challenge all you have is TERRIBLE controls which would make any master race PC user cry themselves to sleep. Get it on the 360 or not at all.</span>

On the other hand, I hate playing saints row 2 with a passion. It&apos;s sickly. It does not feel like I am playing a game. Remember big rigs, how you laugh at how something feels unatural - or you boot up some nintendo 64 game that nobody has heard of for good reason. Those games feel better mechanically (maybe not big rigs, I might have taken that too far) superior to this game. It also looks.... Sickly. And I don&apos;t actually use the word sickly that often in reviews. It&apos;s specific to this game. So you are expecting a 0 right? Sigh.. I guess not. Look... Saints row 3 would have never been what it is without saints row 2. Also, saints row 2 has some killer features. It had an inspiring co-op mode. Few games actually features that many open world moving parts when this was released. It kind of innovated. And the game is large. Large with content that is creative. Poorly controlling in most cases - but creative, and diverse. This game has a LOT of content. And when you actually dig into the story missions, there are some truly creative moments. However for me personally, none of this was worth the consistent pain of playing this. I also lower the score for the pc version. Nomatter what system you have (I personally have a 5.8ghz corei7 260 with a 6990), it will stutter to some extent. It&apos;s the least optimized game I have ever seen in my life. Bar none. -- To sum it up, saints row 2 has a 9 of potential, and a 0 of execution. It has a 9 of some side content, and a 0 for a lot of other side content, it has a 0 for graphics, and it makes me feel physically ill. I want to give it a 0 with everything I have. However this content, presented better, would possibly lead to a 9/10 game. So I&apos;ll give it a 1 for the sole purpose of &apos;what it could have been&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143581">Expand</a></span>

Since the release of the original back in 2006, I have been patiently awaiting the release of the sequel, and finally that day came, when I was able to pick up my copy of Saint&apos;s Row 2. Needless to say, but said anyway, I was extremely excited to play this game, and the guys over at Volition didn&apos;t disappoint. I found the depth of Saint&apos;s Row 2 to be more than that of GTA IV, even though both share the sandbox gamestyle and some, if not most, of the same features. But one thing I found that Saint&apos;s Row 2 had that GTA IV didn&apos;t, was a story-line that was actually interesting. Instead of being a weepy depressed Eastern European with a brother who doesn&apos;t when to leave you alone, you are a badass character of your own creation who has made his way up through the Gang ranks and lost it all, only to come back with a vengeance. Another feature that I enjoyed was the return of the gang war feature, something that both the original Saint&apos;s Row employed as well as GTA:San Andreas. The return of a couple old faces was quite a nice suprise, because if there&apos;s one thing I hate its a sequel that isn&apos;t actually a sequel. The arcade feel to Saint&apos;s Row 2 was a nice comparison to the more (and sometimes too much) realistic feel of GTA IV, at least in terms of game physics, running over innocent civilians sends them flying into other objects, which gives me that warm sociopathic fuzzy feeling inside. Of course, Saint&apos;s Row 2 had its downsides, for example, I may not have the greatest computer ever, I don&apos;t have a terrible one either, but during certain visual events: driving, explosions, massive gunfights, my framerate would drop immensely and almost render the game unplayable, even on the lowest possible visual settings. Another disappointment I found was the briefness of the storyline, sure, a game isn&apos;t supposed to take forever to play (ie Oblivion) but I was able to complete Saint&apos;s Row 2 in under 30 hours, even with all the running around I did in order to gain respect to unlock new missions. There were also a fair amount of glitches in Saint&apos;s Row 2, but nothing a patch...or two...or more, won&apos;t fix. Yes, sometimes cars and people would vanish out of thin air, and occasionally I would be set on fire and not be able to put myself out, doesn&apos;t everyone know stop drop and roll? And what was with random people falling from the sky? I wasn&apos;t sure if that was a bit of humor that was tossed into the mix, or if it was a glitch that just happened to be funny. But all that aside, be objective when you play Saint&apos;s Row 2, it IS different from GTA IV, and all it takes is one run through of the game to figure that out. I give Saint&apos;s Row 2 a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421493">Expand</a></span>

First of all, the story, its a very over the top and fun story throughout, with varied missions which take you to different styled environments and give you a plethora of different &quot;Toys&quot; to play with over the course of the twenty six hours I enjoyed this game. Doing each kind of mission against the main three opposing gangs was very enjoyable and gave each gang their own personality which made me enjoy the game further.   The vehicles are pretty good, with different styles and such which were very fun to drive around the big sandbox city, the radio was also great too with a fantastic choice of songs to listen to as you go along on missions or just exploring.    This game didn&apos;t score perfect with me for two reasons, despite being over the required specs it sometimes didn&apos;t run as well as I would have liked, mainly when it came to driving, which didn&apos;t bother me much unless it caused me trouble when I was on a mission, the second reason is really just how boring some of the side missions were, which were the easiest way to continue with story missions due to the reputation metre which in the end just felt like a chore to see more of the story.    Overall, this game deserves an eight, because I had a lot of fun while playing the hilarious story and really didn&apos;t want it to end as soon as it did, however for the 26 hours of gameplay I can say my money was well invested and is a game i&apos;d reccomend to anyone who enjoys playing a fun game, or just these sort of crime games in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2505898">Expand</a></span>

The physics of this game are almost non-existent.  I can think of games as far back as the SNES where vehicle physics were far better.  Play GTA 4, Mercenaries 2, go back and play San Andreas, but skip this one.  A huge disapointment.</span>

Unfortunately as others have said, this game is practically unplayable, even on a computer that runs Fallout 3 on the highest settings. Even with the graphic options turned on low Saints Row 2 still has many hiccups and really ruins the gaming experience.</span>

Why do the cars have such horrible steering? Why does this game get 20fps at low quality when Crysis gets 60fps at medium quality? As it stands, the game is unplayable. It has potential to be a lot of fun, but right now it&apos;s a broken mess.</span>

Absolutely unplayable on a modern-day, gaming PC and lack of PC support, including 2 patches which fixed/solved almost nothing and no DLC (should be free if ever released but I doubt it as the people who made the PC version completely abandoned it immediately after creation and once they realized it was beyond fixing and provided no extra help to any of us). I decline to buy Saints Row 3 even if it is a little better as PC gamers were stabbed in the back severely this time and shows how much they cared. A game should have bugs, yes and some can&apos;t be patched but when a game cannot be played on a majority of systems without being stable, constant crashing, freezing and errors as well as lag it should be noted that this game is infamously world-wide known now as the most bug-ridden and infested game on the planet. Not even RPG&apos;s that weren&apos;t even patched have the same amount of problems. At least they&apos;re playable and the customer deserves a refund or at least an offer to fix/patch the game if it is beyond unplayable. The customer is always right and should be treated to a game which they can simultaneously enjoy and be able to play or get to the main menu at least... but don&apos;t worry if you buy it on the console you will get full support + DLC - which you have to pay for. So stay clear of this game if you only have a PC or don&apos;t even buy it if u have a console and show your support that games that are multi-platform should be treated with equal consideration and care on all platforms regardless of sales or liking. The 1st and 3rd Saints Rows are not bad but I haven&apos;t got the first, skipped it but now won&apos;t even try it regardless after playing 2 and all the hype, sure it was good for console just not at all cared for on PC or optimized well and shows how all the complaints were true. There are fan-made mods and the biggest one &apos;Gentlemen of the Row&apos; fixes up some problems but still remains 80 % unplayable and I can only start a new game and then it starts freezing up, once past the 1st mission and on the mission screen or just at random. It also adds dlc for free by fans who care and extra additions. Some have reported its more playable but the majority of us are stuck between 60-90 % unplayable. Yes, Saints Row 3 does have DLC for the PC but for people who bought this game retail or on Steam should have them all free after what we were subjected to going through and trying to play this game to the end and stuck with the worst port ever. So, yes, buy it on Steam if you do intend to self-torture yourself as it&apos;s got the latest patch which no other medium through which you purchase online or retail has and makes the game at least another 20 % playable. There are 100&apos;s of fixes for the PC - I&apos;ve tried them all, the but at least the game didn&apos;t promise to be something and then complete failure for the PC crowd especially with dedicated servers *cough cough * - CoD.  I didn&apos;t have high expectations and when the few minutes it actually did work and I could play some random, yet quirky gameplay I enjoyed it a little, little enough to show pity for a 2/10 rating. Be warned it&apos;s a bad game and quite a gamble - it won&apos;t even start up on most PC&apos;s but if you get it and it works on your PC - you are gifted and enjoy the minutes you can have playing it &apos;cos that&apos;s going to be rare. But hey, at the end of the day, look foward to Saints Row 3 that proves to be actually listening to us and improving - much needed and vast upon this, to the extent where it could become beyond playable and at least fun for a 7/10 or more rating. Looking foward to it and it could prove to be different and at least promising this time. Hopefully... that&apos;s all a PC Gamer can do, is to hope, in this day-and-age. &apos;Nuff said. 2/10...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2432455">Expand</a></span>

Luckily, I must have a computer super enough, because this runs very nicely with all settings at max. Loads of vehicles, plenty of customization, plenty of missions. I think it&apos;s  unfair to rate it bad because your pc isn&apos;t good enough, it isn&apos;t the games problem. For the &#xC2;&#xA3;5 I paid this game is epic.</span>

Customization is through the roof, and one of the best I have ever seen in a game. The quests, while at times somewhat frustrating, are fun and humorous. The sidekicks in the game are funny and memorable. Gat, a psychotic killer who constantly cracks jokes. Shaundi, a pothead who constantly steals Pierce&apos;s thunder and gets around town. Pierce, a thug who whines about your music selection, loves opera, and is comic relief. The rival gangs are also quite memorable, from the hardcore tatooed Brotherhood, the voodoo practicing Sons of Jamaica, to the Japanese gang, the Ronin, ran by the pansy and spoiled son of a hardcore mobster. I do find it&apos;s rating to be completely undeserving, for it really is so much more fun than GTA. The only reason I can see why it doesn&apos;t have a higher rating, is because too many people have a boner for GTA and constantly, and unfairly, compare the two. The two games, while about open city crime, as two different philosophies. in GTA, it&apos;s more &quot;realistic&quot; and &quot;gritty&quot;, while SR2 is more about doing whatever the heck you want and not have some damn cousin call you every 5mins</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743773">Expand</a></span>

Problem 1: The game does not like my Saitek keyboard. This is the only application I have run across that thinks that one of my keys is stuck. The menu looked like a slot machine cycling over and over again and my character had the sudden urge to run off once I got started. After unplugging the usb connection and reconnecting it a few times I can occasionally get it to work. Vista and Fallout 3 don&apos;t share the same issues. Problem 2: The game lag. Running on an AMD Turion 64 at 2.21 ghz with a gForce Go 7600 and 4 gigs of ram is defiantly not enough for all that is going on in the game. Even after all of the effects are off and lowest settings are chosen, game play is very jumpy. Don&apos;t plan on buying it unless you have a very good graphics card with DX10 to fully benefit. Problem 3: Keyboard driving. If you like the mouse and keyboard setup, don&apos;t bother. Tapping the directional driving key to go left makes you veer out of your lane, across the opposing lane and right onto the side walk. This affect is increased as speed is increased. I&apos;m guessing Violation didn&apos;t test this thoroughly but there are reports that there are plans to fix this issue in the future with patches. Other thoughts: The over all story seems interesting and the fact you can do basically whatever without the game telling you &quot;NO!&quot; and swatting you with a news paper is quite refreshing. There is even the possibility for a cross dressing gangster nitch if you see fit. I&apos;m hoping with future patches and fixes this game will meet my initial expectations before playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421147">Expand</a></span>

This game has an intense story, that keeps you at the edge of your seat, a badass player, and when you don&apos;t feel like playing the story, you can run the streets, stealing a plane and shoving it in the &quot;ULTOR&quot; building.

There is so much crazy **** to do. It&apos;s like playing Grand Theft Auto, but with coop! Grab a friend, your favorite alcoholic beverage, and go have a blast with all the unique missions.</span>

I like the fact that you get to build the gang up, as in Saints Row Three you&apos;re in more of a futuristic world that pisses you off. It&apos;s a pretty bad port, as the driving is terrible and the glitches and bugs are horrendous. I only have 2.3 hours of playtime, and I don&apos;t plan on increasing the number.</span>

The controls are NOT anything like that with keyboard. Your trying to run the game on a laptop, that explains it all. Mate with those specs, I&apos;m surprised the game starts, the 4GB of RAM does NOTHING over 2GB. It&apos;s a Turion first of all, and a GeForce 7600 &quot;GO&quot; do you realise that&apos;s probably as powerful as a 6600GT, which is now obsolete hardware.

Fortunately, I was able to find a mod (Saints Row Powertools) that fixes this issue.</span>

SR2 has much better world design and customization than 3; however, after beating the formulaic missions there isn&apos;t much to do besides activities. The only collectables are CDs to make custom playlists (most of the music sucks) and your territory control is completed passively while doing missions. Probably the strongest point of SR2 is the cutscenes with their amusing character facial expressions, good camera work, and funny dialog. If you are looking for a less serious sandbox game then SR2 &amp; 3 are both good options. Overall I think SR3 is better but they both have their fair share of issues. You will most likely have trouble getting this working because it is such a poor port. It has a lot of graphical, sound, and stability issues so be prepared to dig around for mods &amp; fixes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822773">Expand</a></span>

Pierce and Shaundi are great. The missions involve bringing the other gangs (a government-gang included) to their knees. The co-op rocks! What can be better than you and your friend jumping around in low gravity throwing C-4 at people in the mall, and then riding the ATV&apos;s around? Although you will get frustrated at stupid moments, like when two Brotherhood trucks run you over at the same time, you will have an amazing experience playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3232104">Expand</a></span>

This is surprising as my HD7770 can run most games on high/maximum settings. This is a worse port than GTAIV. The shooting is fun, but it is a disappointment I cannot play further due to the slowdown. Do not buy this game on PC.</span>

<br>
<br>Bottom line is that this a TERRIBLE ported game. The graphics are terrible, even on the HIGHEST settings, the car mechanics are lazy and stupid, and when driving around a corner or just going straight, decently fast the frame rate goes extremely low for some reason even though my computer can run tons of other games that have better graphics on HIGH, this is an utter disappointment.
<br>
<br>Not to mention having to get enough respect to play a mission is beyond annoying, I spent 30-an hour usually just to get enough respect to play a 15 minute mission which drives me INSANE.
<br>
<br>In the end, even though the missions are fun and challenging it doesn&apos;t make up for many of the technical glitches, random frame rate drops, car mechanics and annoying respect.
<br>
<br>Would get this game when is on a big sale but otherwise I would buy this on a console, or just get Saints row 3 or 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639126">Expand</a></span>

Years after the destruction of Richard Hughes&apos; boat, Julius has gone missing, and the player, his second-in-command, is thought to have died in the explosion. The Saints have long since dissolved and three new major gangs have taken over Stilwater - the Brotherhood, a heavy metal gang that specializes in arms trafficking and demolition derbies, the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian voodoo gang that controls drug trafficking, and The Ronin, a Japanese biker gang that controls casinos and night clubs. Following the disbanding of the Saints, Johnny Gat, the Saints&apos; trustful enforcer, was arrested and awaits trial for mass murder. Aisha, his girlfriend, has faked her death for her own protection but continues to sell records. An earthquake leveled much of Stilwater, and as a result, a corporation named Ultor began renovating the city and became very powerful in the process, taking over the Saints&apos; old slum territory and turning it into Stilwater&apos;s big financial district. Dexter &quot;Dex&quot; Jackson has reformed and is now Ultor&apos;s head of security, while Troy Bradshaw is the city&apos;s chief of police.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4956213">Expand</a></span>

Well... you shouldn&apos;t be, period. You would&apos;ve been better off leaving out the place you review for, because you just lost all credibility from your comment. The game is great fun, but needs a patch or two and QUICKLY, being only $39.99 on Steam is a massive advantage, as long as they keep supporting the game and patch it fast. Considering I haven&apos;t had any of these technical issues so many others have had with GTA: IV I can only feel sorry for them. And if you&apos;ve written off the game, due to the issues, your really missing out. But if your complaining that a game doesn&apos;t run with a system close to or even JUST exceeding the minimum system requirements, you haven&apos;t obviously been around the PC Games long enough. A game will NEVER run even GOOD on a system with the minimum requirements. It will RUN the game, but that doesn&apos;t mean it will be playable, it will at least start though. This has been the case since the 90&apos;s. It&apos;s nothing new, and you all have to start realising the minimum requirements aren&apos;t going to provide you with a flawless playable FPS. It&apos;s annoying, and misleading, but that&apos;s the way it always has been. You should look at a games recommended requirements, as being the minimum requirements to have the game running at a playable rate. I have the recommended requirements for GTA: IV and I get 40+ FPS on average, but everything is at LOW and view distance is at around 25 this is @ 1680x1050. The 2 games are very different, and TRY to be. So comparing them directly is silly. GTA has always tried to be the more life-like, and I prefer that. The physics are absolutely amazing, and with SR2 it&apos;s more about providing a fun time no matter what your doing in the game, rather than simulating a life-like story. Which is just as great, but has much more technical issues than GTA IV. Which HOPEFULLY gets fixed, because it really is/can be a GREAT game. But it needs a few weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421702">Expand</a></span>

As far as the story goes, it&apos;s pretty short and really there isn&apos;t a big enough motivator to get people to do side missions in my opinion. I avoid comparing it to GTA because though they are sandbox games they are different, not to mention the hypocrites that don&apos;t seem to realize GTA also got ideas from Saints Row. The character creation in the game makes it the character you create alot more personal for you which actually makes the game more fun, though in game I wish there was more clothing to choose room, they have enough to meet everyone s personal taste. Combat in the game is nice, you can even choose different styles as you progress through the story. Saints Row 2 shows a bigger and better improvement over it&apos;s previous game but the online play is sort of bland. And I by bland I mean no one is online half the time or there is nothing really to do in the CO-OP multi player mode. That is if you like blowing people up for hours at a time. Now I am not a real big fan of console games going to PC because usually they are dumbed down games so the console can support them but or some reason there seems to be people complaining about the PC version requirements etc. I have no clue what half these people are talking about because I didn&apos;t have one problem with it. And no, I don&apos;t have a $3000+ PC or even close to that. I&apos;m guessing most of these players have no idea how their computer really works. But even I realize that most of these people are PC haters who love their consoles so much and hate to see games go to the PC, so I suggest ignoring them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421926">Expand</a></span>

<br>I actually didn&apos;t mind the driving or shooting mechanics, they were fine, even good. I did experience a speedbug (win7 users beware), but I downloaded a patch from a famous modder (google it, you&apos;ll find it) and was right back on track.
<br>Game&apos;s story and gameplay are epic, but I was most drawn to the characters, they truly made me play- I cared about them and wanted to see where they&apos;d end up. About 26 hours of gameplay for me.
<br>Overall? Recommended, it&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s definitely fun! </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3422153">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it&#x2019;s buggy sometimes, and even though it gets frustrating at some points, for the most part you will have a blast if you like sandbox crime games like GTA. Vehicles are fun (from bikes to boats and aircraft) and there are stores where you can dress your character (highly customizable since the moment you create them) the way you want with clothing and jewelry (tattoos included). You can buy houses, stores and buildings (you make profit) then decorate them. If you have a 360 controller it will feel so natural. A fun and very enjoyable game that will awake the gangsta in you, I love being a Saint! ^.^</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3467403">Expand</a></span>
