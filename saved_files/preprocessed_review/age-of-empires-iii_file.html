<br>It follow relatively the same gameplay as it&apos;s predecessor, adding an interesting Home City system. With an awesome timeline, it kept me enjoyed with it&apos;s smoothness on overall making strategy and beautiful, just gorgeous visuals. It has you choosing the city and country you want to choose, making strategy and gathering resources with citizen and exploration. The flaw here is that it is rather too familiar to be anything revolutionary.
<br>However, the old AOE gameplay is fantastic and the visuals will blow you away. It&apos;s another great game of the series and it&apos;s remarkable.

<br>I know there are a lot of AOE2 fans out there who hate on this game....it is all misplaced hate.
<br>Villagers are still &quot;weak points&quot; that can be exploited and must be micro controlled. removing the Camp aspect of the game streamlines the whole system. The whole game is pushing you to pressure your enemy early and often in order disrupt their flows. It does make map control slightly less relevant, but it also means that troop positioning, flanks and tactical withdrawal makes a whole lot more sense. Establish forward troop production bases and enclaves.
<br>
<br>AoEIII is a streamlined, highly flexible RTS that can punish or reward tactics.
<br>Like all RTS it has &quot;cookie cutter&quot; flavor of the month builds and some empires are less balanced, but you should really enjoy most any game you play of AOEIII.
<br>
<br>Single player is weak, this is an online game to play with and against friends/foes.
<br>
<br>AI is very good overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994411">Expand</a></span>

The game truly comes to life like it never did before. However, I have played this game only about 20 hours. Sometimes I ran the game again but everytime I quit before I even started a game. As soon as the thrill of playing what looks like a new prettier version of a good game wore off, it became a huge disappointment.
<br>The campaign is now mostly a fantasy story, while one of the reasons I enjoyed Age of Kings so much was because the scenarios were (based on) actual historical events. Also, there are only 3 storylines in the original game, where AoK had 5 (including 1 tutorial).
<br>Another great disappointment was the map creator. In Age of Kings this feature alone added a few hundred hours of gameplay to my total. AoE III threw overboard the simple interface in the map creator. As a result, the map creating is so incomprehensible it is virtually impossible to create a map (let alone a scenario) without googling how to do basic things every other minute. And even after searching the web for answers, when I tried to change the map size to bigger than the initial tiny, I got an error message. Because the campaign wasn&apos;t that great either, this serious flaw pretty much destroyed any replay value this game had left.
<br>I was unimpressed by the (lack of) variety and nations as well. Age of Kings and the Conquerors together offered 18 civilisations to play with, whili AoE III and its two expansions together gave 14. True, some strategic elements are improved. Nations have more unique units and technologies, and the naval part is improved a lot. However, I never really played any AoE game for the strategic experience, I play it for fun. And as I find naval warfare not nearly as interesting as knights, soldiers and suicide bombers, those improvements really didn&apos;t do it for me. The same goes for the time. AoE III is set in the early modern period in the Americas, just after they&apos;re discovered. I was kind of bummed when I found out, because I love medieval strategy with castles and knights and kings. But the game captures the atmosphere nicely.
<br>Age of Empires III also added a kind of trading card game as a new gameplay element. I do have mixed feelings about that. It really adds a new layer of strategy to the game, and it&apos;s quite fun leveling up and upgrading your cards. But I think this doesn&apos;t really belong in an AoE game. Because as I said before, I don&apos;t play Age of Empires because I want in-depth strategy, I play it because I want to play an easily accessible game with countless different options for different games and just as much options for messing around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4007967">Expand</a></span>

You make villagers and they just gather resources, you don&apos;t even have to build a gather site. Later on you can make buildings that automaticly generate resources, making everything focused on fighting. The fighting is boring and stupid. Cannons are overpowered/cause lag because of needless physics that can&apos;t be turned off. The campaign is stupid. This is age of empires not age of magic. I wanna play a campaign about history not fiction. Fountain of youth? WTF? Russians in the US? WTF? Someone was smokin hella good weed when they made this. Online is fun. ESO is ok but not as good as Battlenet. You get a homecity its like an RPG because you need to lvl it up. Yeah not much to say 7/10 is a nice score for this game I want to give it lower cause it pisses me off but yeah I won&apos;t be like that. Peace out go play Age of Empires 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=383085">Expand</a></span>

Why release a game with those kinds of issues... I could&apos;ve spent my $50 on a game that works! Greedy bums!</span>

Instead of emphasizing and expanding on what AOE2 had, there seems to be a step backwards to make it more akin to AOMythology. AOM was an enjoyable game, but it&apos;s not an AOE game. Here, formations can&apos;t easily follow other formations, there&apos;s no wheeling about, no way to make a New Model Army, little co-ordination, no good way to keep support units like healers out of battle by, no obvious way to select a default stance, and even trying to keep units in a line when told to &quot;stand ground&quot; feels like cat herding. If there IS a way to do these things, it&apos;s not obvious or clear at all . Games like Rise of Nations and Rome: Total War do a much better job of dealing with combat, especially RON. Given all that, I very much like the Home City concept. It adds another level of strategic planning and unpredictability. Overall, a good buy, but not a must-have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=383643">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the graphics are good, but I didn&apos;t find any great challenges or innovative leaps forward. I was a bit disappointed as I had been eagerly awaiting its release. Good, but not brilliant!</span>

The included campaign is contrived and is based on some ridiculous mythical premise which was obviously very poorly thought out. It doesnt help that the heroes look and behave like punks you wanna beat up on. IMO the interface takes up too much screen real estate. The graphics are ok, but they are nothing fantastic for a contemporary game. Controlling the artillery is a major pain in the butt - you usually end up with arty pieces wheeling around in the heat of battle. Even the computer controlled units do it so its a design flaw(?) Otherwise it is an OK and well built game. OK buy but nothing special, and well short of the hype.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=383869">Expand</a></span>

However, I, like many reviewers, have played this game before. The card system is a rehash of the God powers of AoM. The Home City is very insignificant and is only meant to increase the longevity of the game until you see how shallow it really is. AOE III has many strengths, like its style, graphics, and polish, but it is nothing new. If this sounds like the reviewers above, it&apos;s because I feel the same way - a bit unsatisfied. I still had fun with it, though.

The storyline is excellent and very challenging on hard level. Multiplayer is good, me and my bro can play over our WI-FI network and the online function is awesome. Only problems are no multiplayer save and the scenario generator is hard to use.</span>

The gameplay is much too simple. While Age of Kings and Age of Mythology contained many unique units, AoE3 basically has only a few different kinds of units with some variation in fundamental stats and graphics. This is the game&apos;s main problem. The game makes up for this by focusing on special traits for each civilization, but this is not enough. The home city system is a good concept, but it also gives the player too much of an advantage over computer opponents, which do not appear to use them. Trade routes are a good feature of the game. They add strategy by setting fixed locations to try to control. Native Americans are another good feature, though the lack of unique units makes for squandered potential in this area. The campaign was also unsatisfactory. The scenarios were too short and most of them were just the same build-and-destroy scenario on a different map. It quickly becomes repetitive and boring. Finally, unless you have the best graphics card ever, don&apos;t play maps with a lot of water. The game tends to slow down severely whenever a ship or dock is taking damage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=399410">Expand</a></span>

But the looks do detract a little from what&apos;s required of you and how the game mechanics actually work. AoE had a square grid system that was easily translated into tactical options by the player, 1 square could have 1 tree or 1 stone block or a building, etc. and said objects would inform the player where enemies could move/move around or get through them by destroying them. This system is defunct as units can move through trees, although the proximity of trees that will block units appears arbitrary and the way units move through forested areas insinuates a cover mechanic that doesn&apos;t exist. This could have been an excellent aspect of the game that was completely forgone. It all leads to one conclusion that the games combat has not evolved. The macro aspect is emphasised by units being built in 5&apos;s, it feels so daft you can just multi-select your structures and set a waypoint at the enemy base and be done with it. That&apos;s essentially what the game is, 2 bases throwing units blindly at each other.
<br>
<br>This game is all about macro and economy, which is an odd focus for an RTS when requisition mechanics have always been the most boring aspect of strategy games and how macro dilutes any sense of strategy. Micro plays so little in combat that as long as you match up a bunch of varying units your army is safe, or you can be a bastard and just mass cavalry which is good against everything except pikemen; who can be out maneuvered an kited anyway. The deciding factor is often who can amass the largest army or replenish a dying one fastest. A last note on this matter of micro, units have a habit of freezing up when given orders in quick succession as they&apos;ll constantly want to change formation. This is the single most annoying thing about this game as it costs significant time and makes your units vulnerable to being sniped as they dawdle in battles.
<br>
<br>The home city mechanic gets in the way of gameplay. That&apos;s all about i can say on this innovation, sadly. You&apos;re in the middle of a heated skirmish and you&apos;re constantly prompted to visit your home town to select a bunch of stuff that contributes almost no significance to the round. This mechanic seems to only exist to keep players playing to grind and level for pointless rewards. A sad turn for a classic genre defining RTS game.
<br>
<br>The battles and skirmishes aren&apos;t interesting, the units aren&apos;t defined enough, too much focus on macro and subsequent battles of attrition over tactical decision making. Only recommend buying this game in a sale and playing the campaign if you must play it at all. The multiplayer is tiresome and un-interesting. It will disappoint die hard AoE fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2872649">Expand</a></span>

Second of all, I want to say I think this game has been pretty harshly treated in the user reviews. The main reason for this overcritical attitude is the large number of gameplay innovations and evolutions introduced by Ensemble in what was one of their last games.
<br>I think the deviations in formula were a risky move but they definitely helped revitalize the series  AoE II is still a solid game, but it epitomizes the style of pre-2000 RTS games. Ensemble needed to make some real changes or it was possible the series would become stale and outdated only its third full release. A couple of of these changes were definitely questionable (I&apos;ll mention them throughout the rest of this review) and they stop AoE III from being a 9/10 game but most of them are welcome additions in my eyes.
<br>Graphically, Age of Empires III is gorgeous. The unit models haven&apos;t improved a huge amount from Age of Mythology, but the textures are more vivid and crisp than ever. Damage animations on buildings look great, with realistic-looking explosions and chunks of debris adding to the chaos of battle. Overall the art-style is both rugged and colourful and it looks beautiful across the board I just wish I could zoom out further! Thankfully there is a great mod that lessens the restrictions on zooming but I don&apos;t get why Ensemble chose to lock you into such a small field of view.
<br>The card system is interesting, and both allows for and encourages experimenting with dynamic strategies. There&apos;s more differences between factions than ever and the card system adds even more variety in strategies. There are many viable playstyles in AoE III  turtling is always an option because of buildings like the plantation, which are an unlimited supply of coin (replacing gold  stone has been removed completely which is a bit of a shame) and really great fortifications. Outposts are effective and the wall placement system is just fantastic  even more refined than Age of Mythology&apos;s.
<br>At first I wasn&apos;t a fan of the circular maps as opposed to the square and rectangular maps Age fans are used to, but after a while it really only bothered me when it came to using the map editor.
<br>A more sticking criticism is the simplification of the skirmish/random map options. You can have a maximum of two teams that&apos;s it. Your only options are playing FFA or a two-team battle, and it&apos;s pretty baffling that there aren&apos;t more choices.
<br>All in all AoE comes close to topping AoM as my personal favourite game developed by Ensemble, but it doesn&apos;t quite manage it.
<br>RIP Ensemble Studios and RIP AoE IV and V.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515410">Expand</a></span>

This looks like another type of game, with very few civilizations, lame campaign and bad mechanics. This is the reason why Microsoft decided to develop Halo Wars and then shut down Esemble Studios.
<br>A shame that this game sunk the AOE franchise.</span>

It&apos;s predecessor was a brilliant, fun strategy game. There were lots of unique civs to pick, historic campaigns to play, and a simple, easy, but flexible map editor. AOE 3 has only a handful of civs, and you have to buy the expansion pack to use any native american civs. There are 3 long campaigns each with 5 minute missions in the place of a ton of short campaigns and a few individual missions. The first campaign was just silly. Magic. No kidding, magic. In the first campaign you have to find the fountain of youth and destroy it to keep a secret organization from using it&apos;s powers for evil or something. It sounds like some sort of bad sci fi. Another thing that irritated me when I played was that everything is so... big. The inability to zoom out combined with the fact that every soldier in my army is half an inch tall means that there is very little room on the screen. Not only that, but the maps are very small too. I found myself quickly running out of room to build, and, when I just started and was playing on the easier levels, found myself accidentally destroying an enemy because my guards went rouge. That&apos;s another problem. AOE 1 had that command list where you could pick formations, and set units to patrol, guard, escort, or just not attack anything. That&apos;s all gone in AOE III. If you want to guard your base with troops, you have to constantly pull them back to keep them from following a trail of retreating enemies back to their home base. In this version, instead of just reducing troop training time, troops train in squads up to 5. Personally, I have no objection to this change though, it saved me one time because I had to train soldiers while under attack, and if they had been coming out 1 by 1 they&apos;d have been slaughtered. And then there&apos;s the realism. I&apos;m sorry, but if your unprotected fleeing screaming villager can take over 15 BULLETS TO KILL, there is something seriously wrong. Bullets are incredibly underpowered in this game. Even after buying a special upgrade that gives me massive bonus damage versus villagers, it still took way more bullets than it realistically should have. A game where bow and arrow &gt; gun is one where the laws or reality are warped. There are 2 things in AOE III that keep me from giving it a 2 or 3. The first one is the home city option. Though it isn&apos;t exactly &quot;Age of Empires&quot; style, it did a nice job of motivating me to keep playing. After all, I can&apos;t just stop with a level 9 home city, I have to go to 10. And after that, why not 15? or 50? Another thing that was fairly well done was the graphics. I don&apos;t mean the troops. They all look like a mess of colored triangles. And the buildings just look like buildings. Nice, but nothing to write home about. I&apos;m referring to the thrill I get from positioning 16 cannons in a circle around his town center and firing, watching pieces of it fly 50 feet into the air and land in a shattered heap on top of the mess that used to be a colony. The physics in the game, though also somewhat unrealistic, (Houses appear to weigh nothing, a 20 foot long chunk that must weigh at least 1 ton can be blasted straight up into the air and come back down as if it were a lego brick) are very fun and visually interesting. All in all, this is an okay game, but if you are expecting Age of Empires III, you won&apos;t get it. This is just another rts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2510658">Expand</a></span>

<br>Esta nova vers&#xE3;o at&#xE9; que poderia ser boa pois tem gr&#xE1;ficos muito bons mas peca em diversos pontos. A vers&#xE3;o 3 do Age Of Empires n&#xE3;o tem a op&#xE7;&#xE3;o de salvar ou restaurar um jogo na op&#xE7;&#xE3;o de Multiplayer/ LAN. Isso &#xE9; um absurdo para um jogo deste porte. O que aconteceu? Os programadores n&#xE3;o encontraram uma solu&#xE7;&#xE3;o para algum poblema relacionado a salvar/restaurar jogos  multiplayer? Que decep&#xE7;&#xE3;o.

So I was over the moon to get this game and start playing.. What a shocking disappointment! This is not an AoE game, for one there are only 3 resources, and with that there is no resource pits anything that is gathered magically appears in your stack! Wheres the strategy and realism in that? I have only just started playing and I couldn&apos;t see anywhere to set formations or stance of the trooops(maybe i just need my eyes tested). There are very few types of unit, and when you upgrade these you don&apos;t get &quot;differant&quot; units, they just get up ranked, eg &quot;veteren musketeer&quot; instead of &quot;musketeer&quot;. On the other hand the graphics are nice, when buildings are attacked big chunks break off instead of the usual flames. But graphics are not everything, I want a &quot;brunette&quot; game not a &quot;blonde&quot; one! Buy Empire Earth 2 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=392157">Expand</a></span>

Should have been stated on the package before we wasted a significant amount of money to play family LAN game. What were they thinking?. Very disappointing. Aside from that, the gameplay seems dumbed-down from AOE2, which would be tolerable, but the no save is not.</span>

The game still crashes, but much less frequently. The sound rarely works. Microsoft has admitted the game has problems and will release another patch. The game itself is not bad, just more of the same. The campaign mode is nothing special at all, with nothing anywhere near as interesting as Age of Mythologies. I liked that game far better for gameplay and storyline. AoE 3 is much the same, with some minor changes. I certainly regret paying $60 for the game.

The stroy was decent but the voice acting totally tore the whole game apart. Skirmish was never different, not like games such as Dawn of War 40K or Starcraft, which had at least a little bit of difference in their skirmishes. I found it utterly atrocious.</span>

This game lacks in all areas that a great RTS game has ever had. Limited towers? What is up with that! Units that all look and feel the same? Wow that was real innovative! Railroads you cant build walls over or gates over, wow, just what i want, a nice gaping hole in wall. Age of Empires 2 was an amazing game. Its sad to see that they desired to drop the ball on the Zone supporting the game so now you cant even find anyone to play online anymore. They lost a large community just to push everyone toward Age of Crap 3. Ensemble Studios has defiantly took a turn for the worse. The card system is just stupid. It makes anyone that doesn&apos;t know how to get resources quickly and efficiently suddenly become really good at the game with a click of a button. The peasants don&apos;t have to return to the town center or lumber mill to receive the resources makes people not think about how they make there base before they build is because hey, you can have that 1 guy in the middle of the forest on the other side of the map getting resources for you and he doesn&apos;t have to run a mile to return them, he just happens to have a massive infinite strength to be able to hold it all just for you. I thought about giving it a 2, but then i thought, thats too generous. This game is the worst game ever made and should be avoided by all RTS Enthusiasts. Trust me, it is not worth it. Complete and udder failure just like Red Faction 2 was to Red Faction 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-empires-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=400914">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Dissapointment!!! AOE 2 was so much better, much more balanced. This is more like RPG when the game begins, the explorer runs around collecting stuff and getting experience points. Very colorful though, what the Microsoft should have done is to take the Sim City 4 and just have the sims fight.</span>

It&apos;s really addictive to level up and upgrade your city. And the Home City option is really good, but the gameplay seems exactly the same, so that&apos;s why It&apos;s not amazing. But still with the great story and worth adds, this game is a must buy. 87 out of 100</span>

<br>The only issue i really had is that it did get quite repetitive after a while.
<br>
<br>The details are still pretty good for a older game, The story was fun to for me at least.
<br>I did get this game on sale though, I&apos;m not sure if i would spend the full price on it. (37 Euro).</span>

<br>controls are clunky and expect lots of lag when u play online( this is 7 years old game)
<br>community is nasty and when u lose in teamgame everyone calls out each other
