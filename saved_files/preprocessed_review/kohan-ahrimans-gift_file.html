The expansion did not bring much in the way of content  just some new units... but it&apos;s the best of the series.  Kohan is the most strategic of any RTS I&apos;ve played.  It had the unique concept of companies rather than individual units which greatly reduced the combat micro allowing greater focus on battle strategy.  This was complimented by a great economic model that got rid of the &apos;resource gatherer&apos; and construction micro of Warcraft series,  The biggest drawback to the game was the multi player match making  which could not compete with Battlenet.  10 years after release  and I still enjoy playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kohan-ahrimans-gift/user-reviews?user_review_id=3156437">Expand</a></span>
