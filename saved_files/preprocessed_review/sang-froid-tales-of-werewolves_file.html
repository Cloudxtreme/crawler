<br>1. Map (TAB) will not be shown after the enemy is show up.</span>

Over-all the game is really interesting to play and I would have given it 10/10 if not two reasons. REASON #1: No Multiplayer. Just like in the first &quot;Orcs Must Die&quot; you can not share the experiences with a friend, which really surprises since the game gives you to characters to play as.  REASON #2: Bad voice-over acting. As a gamer who really likes to get into a well plotted game, I was really disappointed by the voice over. It was not absolutely bad, but in some moments  I found my self being bored by some of the conversations characters have. Even though it is not a big deal for the game, I expected a lot more. In all other cases Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves is a must-buy for all lovers of tower defense games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3090593">Expand</a></span>

You play as one of two lumberjack brothers, protecting your sister from werewolves and other enemies in the Canadian wilderness.  The game consists of two phases.  The strategy phase occurs during the day, where you set out traps, and purchase supplies and upgrades.  At night, you put your planning to the test, as you try to lure your enemies into your traps, and engage in melee or range combat.
<br>The gameplay features several fun and innovative mechanics.  &quot;Fear factor&quot; is a numerical value assigned to your character and each enemy.  If you have a higher fear factor than an enemy, it will cower in fear and not attack you.  Various skills and items affect fear factor, allowing you to use it to your advantage.  You can also use sound and smell to lure enemies into your traps.  You have to be clever with your trap placement, or you will be quickly overwhelmed.  The difficulty level feels about right.  It may take a few tries to complete a level, but you will learn something every time so it doesn&apos;t get frustrating.
<br>The story is well written, and it get darker as the game progresses.  One thing that really stands out is the music in the game.  The terrific folk music fits perfectly with the game, as well as standing on its own as one of the best soundtracks I&apos;ve ever heard in a game.
<br>The voice acting is a bit uneven.   Some of it is pretty good, but some of it is not.  The campaign, while decently long (it took me a bit over 12 hours to finish it), doesn&apos;t have a ton of replay value.  It seems that just as you get all different toys and traps that the game has, it&apos;s almost over.  There is a hard mode, but it&apos;s not that different from normal.  A new game+ mode would have fit perfectly here.
<br>Overall, Sang-Froid is a great game that belongs in the collection of every action/strategy fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3101756">Expand</a></span>

Were one to look solely at the surface, one would conclude that Sang-Froid offers a relatively familiar action/defense mashup. Two facets serve to dispute that claim, and one completely destroys it. First, Sang-Froid offers numerous skills and monetary investments which allow for varied and interesting character builds. Second, the narrative is relatively intriguing and above par for the majority of games in this genre. What really seals the deal, though, is the fascinating fear mechanism present in Sang-Froid. Your chosen hero utilizes attacks, strategic tactics and light/fire in the attempt to dominate his werewolf opponents into believing the hero is the alpha of their pack. This gameplay element allows for many different playstyles and keeps the game from getting stale. Buy it for the story and atmosphere. Buy it for the traps and combat. Buy it for the innovative fear mechanism. Fifteen dollars hasn&apos;t bought this much in a long, long while, and you owe it to yourself to support this enjoyable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3090879">Expand</a></span>

Great trap synergy, a vast skill tree and a well thought-out preparation system allows for some fantastic strategizing and variation of gameplay. The controls are tight and every wolf you kill feels satisfying, be it with your axe, gun or one of your many traps. Definitely among my top 20 games.</span>

The mechanics are simple, but solid.  The story is quite goofy, but dark.  The graphics are cartoony, but not terrible, especially for a low-budget 3d game.  Quite enjoying it.  I hope there&apos;s some more added later.</span>

<br>- Very good atmosphere, sometimes tongue in cheek, other times not so much (and can even be a little bit dark).
<br>
<br>- The story is simple, but intriguing and well presented.
<br>
<br>- Very good tutorials for every game mechanic make the game easy to grasp, especially with the different enemy types and traps at your disposal.
<br>
<br>- The game even manages to add some light RPG elements in the mix with some inventory management, character upgrades and gear upgrades as you play through. You can basically &quot;build&quot; a different character depending on your play-style (brawler, trapper, shooter).
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t appear to be a &quot;long&quot; game, but for 15U$S I guess it doesn&apos;t have to be .

The Tower Defence genre has became a little stale over the past year with only a couple of worthy releases, one being a mobile game!  However, where this game shines is the additional gameplay features, namely the 3rd person combat.  Whilst this has been done before in the form of Dungeon Defenders, this game, for the most, is heavily focused on being in the right place to fight against the varied lycens that the game throws at you, whereas the former relies heavily on the right towers and you collecting gems to upgrade them.....................One thing I like about this game is its difficulty level.  Veteran TD players will find a reasonable challenge using the normal character, but for the very talented few, most will find the harder character a worthy test, and one that will keep you replaying maps to fine tune your plan of execution.........Grahpically, this game won&apos;t make anyone stand back in amazement, but the small development team have done themselves proud and look like they are doing well with the marketing side of things........The music in the game is very, erm &quot;Canadian&quot;  in as such there is a lot of traditional folk songs which actually lend well to the scenario........Support seems to be something this developer is keen to keep an eye on, and they commuicate well on their website and the Steam forums.  Regular patches that fix bugs, balance mechanics and that actually try to include suggestions from it&apos;s community bodes well for the planned Tome II which may at some point include a form of co-op!.......I recommend this game to anyone who longs for the days of something that challenges and stimulates your intellect, yet doesn&apos;t punish those who aren&apos;t exactly great when it comes to twitch reactions in combat....9/10  Would&apos;ve got 10 if it weren&apos;t for the slightly lacklustre cut scenes and need for more story animation (I know its expensive).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3105738">Expand</a></span>

This game is a Canadian folktale. It is a tale of the snowy frontier and the brave lumberjacks who lived there, where the Christian god and native spirits coexist, and the Devil&apos;s minions are fought off with cunning, traps, and whiskey. Like the best folk tales, it covers familiar ground, yet is unusual enough to stay lodged in your mind.
<br>
<br>It plays like the love child of Orcs Must Die! and Rainbow Six, combining third-person defense with a Planning Phase. Although it looks like a tower defense game at first, it doesn&apos;t play like one; it&apos;s more methodical, cautious, toning down both the enemies and your own abilities. Each wave only has 4-10 enemies, but just one of them can threaten you in a straight-up fight and each of your traps only works once. You can&apos;t set new traps between waves, either; instead, you view your enemies&apos; numbers and paths during the day, concoct a plan, and set up your traps before night falls. You do not funnel dozens of enemies into a growing Corridor of Death, you carefully lay out bait over spike traps to kill 3 of the incoming werewolves and rely on your rifle &amp; axe to kill the last one.
<br>
<br>Personal combat cycles between attacking and recovering: your 1850s rifle takes several seconds to reload after each shot and your melee attacks drain your Stamina bar until you take a breather. There&apos;s a Fear Factor that makes enemies hesitate before attacking you, giving you time to reload your rifle or recover your Stamina, but I found the best strategy was to make sure they were nearly dead before they reached me. I spent about 60% of my time in the Planning Phase, double-checking my trap placement and making sure I had some spare holy bullets &amp; drink in case it fell apart. Sometimes they chewed through bait faster than I expected, or I&apos;d miss a shot with a ballista, or they caught a whiff of my scent in the wind and beelined towards me, and I had to retreat to an emergency bonfire to keep them at bay while I picked them off one-by-one. Slowly reloading a rifle while two werewolves circled my bonfire was a slow-burn tension I don&apos;t experience often in games.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s story has the same pacing. It plays out like a folktale, not an action film. Over several weeks in December, two feuding brothers try to work out their relationship and protect their younger sister, who prophesizes the Invisible Beast will run rampant on Christmas Eve unless they stop him. The Devil wants to kidnap her, but here he acts more like the Trickster of myth than the final boss of a game, sending his minions after them and turning the townsfolk against them. Even the final boss feels subdued compared to other, more frantic games: you&apos;ve gathered everything you need to defeat him, and now you just have to hunt him down in the dark woods, man-vs-beast, as heavy chanting punctuates the inevitability of it.
<br>
<br>The folk music really sells the game&apos;s setting. They licensed several tunes from Canadian folk bands, providing haunting chants &amp; violin pieces for the slower parts of the game and Irish jigs for the fights. It sounds like something you&apos;d hear in a logging town pub on a cold wintry night, and is perfect for fighting werewolves deep in the Canadian wilderness. The graphics are a bit crude &amp; cartoony, but they fit well enough with the folktale style that I didn&apos;t mind them. There were even a few times I just stopped to look at the moon rising over the dark forest.
<br>
<br>My biggest gripe about the game is that the controls occasionally feel sticky &amp; clumsy. Sometimes it took multiple attempts to drag inventory around during Planning, or I would focus attacks on the wrong beast during the night. It was a bit frustrating at times, but I never lost a fight due to it, and with the game&apos;s emphasis on planning instead of action, it didn&apos;t come up often.
<br>
<br>It certainly shouldn&apos;t stop you from trying this game. It&apos;s a defense game that emphasizes planning &amp; care and gives it the feel of a frontier folktale. I&apos;ve grown bored of tower defense games, but I&apos;d love to see where they take these mechanics, and the continuing tale of the O&apos;Carroll brothers, next.
<br>
<br>Sang-Froid can be bought on Steam for $15. It took me 7 hours to complete the game on Normal difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106039">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s novel for about ten minutes, but not worth the money. And this is from someone who loves werewolf movies.
<br>
<br>Someone out there is eventually going to do this right. This just feels dull and uninspired by comparison. And for a game that supposedly has a known writer on board, I haven&apos;t encountered anything that&apos;s tried so hard to put me to sleep in a while. It&apos;s just... dull. It&apos;s not bad, you know? It&apos;s just soul-crushingly dull. If you&apos;re looking for a tower defence game, then you could do much, much better, and not much worse. Try out Defence Grid or Sanctum instead. You&apos;ll be better off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3104284">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s structure is broken into pre-mission cutscene, pre-mission preparations, the actual defense of your structures on foot, and a post-mission cutscene, with no deviation in this structure. Of the twenty missions available, the first few are thinly veiled tutorials which quickly ramp up in difficulty once supernatural enemies are introduced. Unlike most games, the difficulty doesn&apos;t budge; for the most part it was a non-stop train ride through a frustratingly difficult game. I was finding myself quickly frustrated and had to restart missions many times because of accidentally hitting myself with a lethal trap, getting sidetracked defending one objective while another was being destroyed, or just dying from being overwhelmed by enemies I was unprepared to face at full health because they &quot;dodged&quot; a trap I set for them.
<br>
<br>While the story is good enough to push you forward and explain character actions and interactions, it really feels like it was stretched thin and simply made to build a game around. There are no sidequests, no mini-games or diversions, no non-main story character to chat with, or even any non-story or non-shops to visit while in towns. I loved the game&apos;s atmosphere and environments but much of the game feels rushed and lazy, as if the devs said &quot;this is good enough, ship it!&quot; The story also seemed to end abruptly and un-satisfyingly, as if the devs couldn&apos;t decide to lead into a sequel or not.
<br>
<br>I would love to see a sequel that wasn&apos;t such a barebones narrow corridor of gameplay. Simple touches, like actually being able to walk around in towns, would have added much to the atmosphere of the game. This could have been a cozy, atmospheric game with a unique spin on Tower Defense, but instead it feels like a quick in-betweener for a dev looking to make money for his next big project.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=5363184">Expand</a></span>

Take a couple of genres (RTS, Tower defense, Action/RPG), mash them up with some unique takes on the genres, and throw in some thoughtful but ultimately ugly visuals, and some god awful voice acting. Gameplay wise, its a very simple, elegant, satisfying game with a few rough edges, and an effective but unintuitive UI. Its worth the Price of admission for that. The music even has some high points. The story, visuals, and Voice acting are a chore. However, as bad as it is, you can tell they didn&apos;t just phone it in: Their are a few moments where you can really tell that they tried their very best. The Canadian wilderness can feel truly desolate and bleak, and the Tutorial guy is wonderful. But the cut scenes look like something out of a cheaply produced adventure game from the 90&apos;s, and the voices probably should have been just a tiny bit more stilted, emotionless and robotic, and it could have been so bad that its funny. The devil is particularly bad, as he comes across as a Saturday morning cartoon version of satan, which feels wildly inconsistent, tonally. I really wish that they embraced the limited resources they had, and went with a more stylized approach to telling the story, like an interactive comic, and maybe even cut out the VA altogether. Nothing good is gained from the direction they went.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t want to discourage people away from the game though. After all, I gave it an 8. The game play is wonderful, unique, and very fun. Its a solid title, well worth your time. Just avoid it if your looking for something pretty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=4458187">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are nice for being cartoony,very fun gameplay, if you play on hard its very challenging which is something I always like in a game, good music, an ok story. It cloud get a 10 if it improved a little in some areas. This game brings a new experience with an idea not tried before and for only 15$ its much better than all of those 40$ first person shooter,unoriginal story and gameplay games, you should buy sang froid if you want to try a fun game with a different style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3362193">Expand</a></span>

Sang-froid should be used to teach other developers how to create internal consistency in their games; it is a shining exmaple of how to link the gameplay mechanics with the story and the lore, creating a dynamic experience with believable gameplay elements.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is about defending your environment from several waves of attackers using traps of various kinds, and your trusty axe and rifle. Time and resources need to be managed carefully and used effectively against a variety of enemies with different characteristics.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of defensive strategy, give this a crack, you will not regret it. The story is a bit childish in its presentation, with somewhat cliche characters, but it works, and as I said earlier, the story and setting make sense of the gameplay mechanics and vice versa, which is something very few games have ever managed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=4075714">Expand</a></span>

Cant wait til next tomb and looking forward to dev&apos;s other projects as well.  Easy paced and excellent tutorials.  Even if you dont really like the supernatural elements like I do...this game is just pure fun.  Music and artwork alone would have sold it for me...as they both are just awesome!</span>

The graphics are cartoon style but well made and beautiful, There are some RPG elements like skills and new weapons that make the game very dynamic. Great gameplay and music. The only issue it&quot;s that became repetitive after a while, but definitely recommended!</span>

<br>pro : I love the fear factor and generally traps are genuine and interesting to use and the fact that your enemies fear you when they have the reason
<br>con : animation is just  repetitive for the character even with the special moves and the soundtrack could&apos;ve been bigger even though it isn&apos;t the main theme is just awesome
<br>What I would want
<br>- How about split skill trees for new moves
<br>-  How about upside down crosses to lure demonic creatures to it
<br>- Separate parts to build better guns and even axes (or to make your own parts) and even bring some pistols
<br>- more new items
<br>- how about mercenaries that you can hire or bring some other forest animals that you can lure to fight the beasts
<br>-  this  time how about demonic or angelic creatures to fight along the others
<br>-and if it is the 19 th century how about some steam-punk inventions from (little spoiler) that hermit in the tree ( if he was able to make those glasses than maybe he can do other things )
<br>
<br>I totally recommend to try this game at least for just one full experience</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=4240633">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is nothing like those &quot;new school&quot; tactic games made for console players.

Second, criticizing the difficulty of the game also makes no sense: if it were easy, EVERYONE would wail about that. The difficulty is what it is: that&apos;s were the strategy comes in. Third, saying that this game is pure crap is insane. It&apos;s worth the price of admission just for the historical background alone. Is it a perfect game? No, but it is fresh and original. The big professional groups like Creative Assembly and Firaxis could learn something from these guys. This game is a little known gem.

It is a tower defense game with the addition of a player controlled character that must be used in conjunction with traps in order to defeat the waves of enemies. Enemies follow set rules that you can reliably count on, but your own interaction with the enemies as well as your traps influences the way a stage plays out. It slowly introduces you to its available arsenal while also introducing new enemies. There are short, very bearable tutorials which also slowly introduce you to the somewhat surprising number of factors that can influence your strategy. You gain experience and levels which are used to gain skills - there are enough skill choices that you can customize your play style accordingly. The difficulty on normal is pretty standard and if you run into trouble with a stage, you can restart after making small adjustments, or choose to start fresh and try an entirely new strategy. The game has a currency system which is used for both placing traps and purchasing weapons, potions (in the form of alcoholic drinks), and equipment.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is &quot;repetitive&quot; only in the sense that each stage follows the same formula - analyze your enemy waves, place traps, plan your strategy, and carry it out in action. However, the same stage can be handled several different ways and your own playstyle can easily shine through. You can be trap heavy, focus on attacking from range, or depend on your own two hands and axe as you melee the enemy waves.
<br>
<br>While some may find the story, voice acting, and animation to be tacky or dull, it is actually rather stylistic and adds a quirky sort of charm to the game. The plot is rather immersive and sometimes the storyline sets you up for a surprise twist in your upcoming map. It has a lot going for it when you realize that similar games actually tend to have little to no story.
<br>
<br>Sang-froid falls a bit short due to it only having a good 8-12 hours of gameplay and standard replayability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941832">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics - 6 (This game is not about graphics, so don&apos;t worry about this portion of the rating)
<br>Story - 5 (wasn&apos;t bad or great.  It was just there. The voice acting and dialogue isn&apos;t great, but the core concepts are conveyed and it had something there to keep enough interest to not skip the story)
<br>Gameplay - 9 (The game is a like a tower defense and I give top marks for innovation.  This is what carries the game and I would say even negates any negative remarks I made about the other categories.)
<br>
<br>Even though my rating does not divide evenly into the 3 categories states above I believe that gameplay is always the top reason for playing any game.  Therefore, I gave this game a 7 to counter the secondary storyline and graphics against my 9 gameplay rating. This game has value and I would suggest it to anyone who like RTS tower defense style games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sang-froid-tales-of-werewolves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3959946">Expand</a></span>
