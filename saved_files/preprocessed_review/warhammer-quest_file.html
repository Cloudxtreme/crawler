<br>
<br>There is a good game here, which recreates an old board game. Worth an 8 or 9  (a 10 if you could actually see the dice rolls) and the production values are high
<br>
<br>Though the game gets a 1, why? The microtransactions. This is a &quot;dungeon crawl&quot; game were you hunt for gold and loot. Most of the characters are paid DLC. Most of the loot you get is for those DLC characters. They are very expensive to buy INDIVIDUALLY. The gold rewards are dropped at a dismal rate. So there is a &quot;gold store&quot; where you buy gold with real money to speed things up. Yes, almost like a facebook game.
<br>
<br>There are also game breaking weapons you can buy, so you never have any challenge with the game.
<br>
<br>The whole point of the game is to dungeon crawl, survive the challange and find loot and gold (that is the board game in its entirety) Yet this video game version allows you to buy stuff from the start so you can skip all that, leaving you with a hollow game because there is nothing else to do. As stated, the gold drops for those who dont spend real money to progress has been designed so its a very slow progress. Gold is used for everything, from buying items to levelling your characters.
<br>
<br>iOS users also get shafted, as they need to spend about $50 to unlock everything compared to the PC users who get a &quot;deluxe&quot; edition which has everything included for about $30, although still with the gold store microtransactions. There is also a basic version on PC, where you need to buy everything individually like the iOS. $30 itself is on the high-end for such a title ($50 is just ridiculous)
<br>
<br>It is a horrible system, one which abuses it&apos;s customers and anyone defending it is guilty of ruining gaming.
<br>
<br>The developers have also stated some of the sleaziest PR talk you can imagine such as:
<br>&quot;Some customers prepurchased the game expecting to buy in-game gold&quot;
<br>and
<br>&quot;We can&apos;t remove the gold store, as it would break the game&quot;
<br>
<br>They are not catering to fans of the board game, they are not catering to gamers, they are catering to that &quot;facebook game&quot; personality type. Shame on this developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-quest/user-reviews?user_review_id=4890941">Expand</a></span>

Whether its $15 or free, this is a bad game and continues the precedent of companies selling incomplete games and expecting consumers to pay outrageous sums to purchase content that should have been included in the original purchase.
<br>
<br>With any luck niche games will stop this practice in the next few years.</span>

<br>
<br>Bottom line:DONT BUY WARHAMMER QUEST!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-quest/user-reviews?user_review_id=4897256">Expand</a></span>

Warhammer Quest is an astounding triumph of failing against all odds though. It looks decent enough and sounds good and it boggles the mind how it could have been mangled the way it has. For more on the ancient art of turning virtual gold into offal, read on!
<br>
<br>Weird design decisions abound in this game and are one thing to consider when trying to understand just how bad it is. The camera keeps resetting the zoom to way too close. And it does this every time there is an enemy turn, which is basically every ten seconds the entire game. The zoom is in other words meaningless. And not only that, but it readjusts the zoom for each monster in every fight in completely nonsensical ways until you become dizzy from watching the entire spectacle. How such an amateurish camera control got past Q&amp;A is a mystery.
<br>True to this unpromising start, the designers also decided to add random fights, in addition to the fixed ones you unlock as you explore dungeons. Regularly these either take place far behind you with ranged monsters, forcing you to backtrack to kill them, or melee mobs just dump right on top of your ranged characters with no warning. In the first case I twice in just the second dungeon in the game had almost reached where I needed to go to proceed into the dungeon, when three archers appeared WAY behind me. We`re talking about six rounds of walking for the melee characters here. So off I go to kill them and thirteen pointless rounds later I am back where I started only to have the SAME DAMN THING HAPPEN ALL OVER AGAIN!!! Add to this that the archers shoot through things and the general mood is set for a good time in the dungeons!
<br>In the second case it just makes the entire notion of tactics completely pointless, since mobs can drop on you basically anywhere. What`s the use of trying to protect vulnerable ranged characters when this stuff gets added to the game? It is another version of the skydiving mobs in Dragon Age II and just totally unacceptable for a tactical game. It is just unbelievable how such stuff gets past testing. So fifteen minutes of this and similar pointless nonsense pr dungeon is statistically the minimum you must expect, based on my experience. It is as if they were trying to drive players mad with all this stuff, and it is as if no one has ever before made a video game. And bear in mind that I have just started, and already the miserable design is absolutely shocking. I can only imagine what other horrors await for those masochistic enough to play the entire game.
<br>
<br>But all this would perhaps be acceptable if it wasn`t for the appalling moneygrubbing by Rodeo Games. You get to start with four generic characters. A hunter, a wizard/healer, a barbarian and a sort of dwarf fighter. There are other classes, but lo and behold you have to pay three Euros to unlock each of them. And there are seven characters, totaling in at 21 Euros! Pay 21 Euros to unlock content for the game you just bought! The nerve of these people is just unbelievable. Needless to say no one should ever buy any of these classes, or any other DLC ripoffs for this game. And there are plenty, including a reprehensible gold shop. And sensible gamers know that where there`s a gold shop there will inevitably be a contrived shortage of in-game currencies, forcing players to waste real money for in-game currencies if they want to progress. If I didn`t know better I`d think Rodeo was a subsidiary of the masters of moneygrubbing over at Blizzard. It`s just that bad. A complete boycott is the only way the people responsible for this will learn. Consumer activism ftw!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-quest/user-reviews?user_review_id=4952388">Expand</a></span>

I find the art quality excellent (doesn&apos;t feel as sharp as the iOS though on my large screen) and I&apos;m happy to finally be able to play this game on my PC.
<br>I just don&apos;t get all this whining about micro-transactions, don&apos;t you want the game to expand and update? No one is forcing anyone to buy anything (what&apos;s with the mentality today &quot;I want it all, and I want it all for free!&quot;), you can just grab the basic game and stay with that (you will already have more than the basic iOS version). The company put effort into developing and adding new material in the form of areas, heroes etc and this cost money, do you want them to do that for free out of the kindness of their hearts because you can&apos;t be bother to spend a little on something you supposedly like?
<br>Another view is this, in the original game you also only got what is in the basic game here. All the extra heroes, loot cards, expansions with new maps and fancy special gear was extra purchases (expensive) so the game holds true to that.
<br>My only concern with micro-transactions is that they sell gold because you can lose gold in random events and it&apos;s BAD to have game mechanics that lose you cash money.
<br>Oh and I saw someone complaining about random events in the dungeons... It&apos;s PART OF THE GAME, it always was, it&apos;s keyed to the wizards roll for magic points, whenever he rolled a 1 (0 in the digital game) an event occurs, in dungeons that&apos;s usually an ambush. In other words, it&apos;s always been like that and is how it&apos;s supposed to be.
<br>As suggested earlier I would really like to see the dice rolls and it would be nice if they had ironed out a few more bugs before release, but that seems to be the norm of games these days.
<br>To sum it up, I really like and enjoy this game and think it&apos;s worth the money I&apos;ve paid for it several times over (bought it for my brother as well). I give it 8 for what it is and is supposed to be, I would give it higher if we had dice rolls and no game stopping bugs (I have encountered one), I&apos;d bump it to 10 if we could also get co-op at some point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-quest/user-reviews?user_review_id=4901401">Expand</a></span>

<br>On top of all of that, the video game, even with all its puny dlcs that have barely something in them, does not even come close to 20% of the base game of Warhammer Quest where you have zillions of different monsters, and especially a good challenge as well as infinite replayability... This Rodeo Crap has not much replayability. Once you finish the game, there is really no point in playing.
<br>
<br>Oh and get this! Your backpack is rarity based. Really! You cannot carry more than 4 common, common and rare items! LOL What are these idiots at Rodeo Game smoking? Are we playing World of Warcraft or Warhammer Quest? Why did they screw up this really nice game of the 1990s?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-quest/user-reviews?user_review_id=6041652">Expand</a></span>
