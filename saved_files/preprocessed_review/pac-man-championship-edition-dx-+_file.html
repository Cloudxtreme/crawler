<br>When I got around to actually PLAYING, the game wouldn&apos;t allow me to play for more than 30 seconds before just instantly crashing to the desktop. No warning, no information on what the problem was, but every single time I tried to play the game, it crashed in under a minute. So yes. This game is... literally... unplayable. I cannot play it.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t bother with this one. It is easily the worst port I have tried, because it doesn&apos;t work. I checked the program version, it&apos;s 1.0. They didn&apos;t even bother to make a patch for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pac-man-championship-edition-dx-+/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599634">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I loved DX on XBLA, but I&apos;m unable to play it on PC due to multiple serious bugs. It crashes after ~30 seconds on every map I&apos;ve tried without fail. It also sometimes makes a cacophony of overlapping sounds on the title screen like a weird feedback loop. This is on Win8 x64, with GTX 555 and recent-ish drivers. I&apos;d hold off lest you&apos;re unluckily impacted like I.</span>

It&apos;s legitimately one of my all time favourites. A game I find so blindingly addictive that on several occasions I have had to be forcefully removed from my joypad. I have lost days trying to rack up world record scores. I have played beyond the pain in my thumbs, the aches in my back and shoulders, until my knees have locked into position and my eyes can no longer fathom what is happening in front of them through sheer fatigue.
<br>
<br>Always desperate for that perfect run, that perfect pattern, that little more luck, that all conquering score that I can never seem to grasp.
<br>
<br>Not everyone will appreciate it&apos;s old skool mentality or it&apos;s new neon lick of paint. At first glance, at higher speeds, the game looks confusing and dazzling, like a David Lynch directed Tron movie. But play it and you soon realise this is all about memory, dexterity and durability.  Follow the dots, memorise, avoid ghosts. Simple. The visuals which once seemed distracting now seem attractive.
<br>Delve a little more and you realise that you have to stray from the beaten path to get high on that online leaderboard. That breadcrumb trail doesn&apos;t always lead to the land of milk and honey. And straying from that path means unpredictability, until you find your own path, until you make it work. Until you make your own destiny. Until you find your own trail and make it yours, you will always be lost in that neon maze and a leaderboard place of obscurity.
<br>
<br>If you are the type of gamer that has to find every single star in Mario, every single achievement in the Lego games or are always trying to beat your own high score at Tetris or Columns - This is a game for you.
<br>
<br>Just apply that determination and will to win and you will love it..
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be afraid to scream at the screen. Don&apos;t be ashamed to be defeated time and time again. Don&apos;t hesitate to take that calculated risk in the aim to rack up even the slightest point advantage. Don&apos;t be embarrassed to check out it&apos;s Youtube videos. Don&apos;t get upset in beating yourself up.
<br>
<br>You are not alone.
<br>
<br>This game is for those who like to win, those with a competitive nature, perhaps unhealthily so.
<br>And without question what it is, dear reader, is the greatest sequel to an 8 bit arcade game the world will ever see. Like the old Pac himself,  it has tons of charm and is timeless in appeal. It feels like the TRUE successor to that world conquering original classic.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not for everyone. There&apos;s no blood. There&apos;s no melees. There&apos;s no stealth missions or tower defence levels. There&apos;s no variety, just slightly different maps. Just different paths. Different patterns to memorise.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s for adrenaline junkies. It&apos;s for the gamers who like knocking seconds off their arcade racer lap times. It&apos;s for the gamers who like to try and remain calm as the timer counts down when you are INCHES from beating your old score and must try and hold your nerve.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a game perfect for me. Perfect.
<br>
<br>The clock is ticking. Your hands are sweating. Your heart is pounding. This could be it. This could be perfect. Don&apos;t lose it now. Stop thinking these thoughts. Concentrate. You&apos;re almost there. This could be your chance. Stop talking to yourself. Concentrate.  That was a slight mistake but you recovered. Your nearly there. Why do I think like this so close to success? You blew it YOU BLEW IT YOU BLEW IT YOU IDIOT. YOU DOLT. YOU FAILURE.
<br>
<br>Just one more go. I almost had it. I&apos;ll get it this time. Just one more try.
<br>
<br>Having played this on my old Pentium D/ HD5450/ Ancient Dell PC I can honestly say I have found none of the reported bugs that some complain about. If you really want to make sure you don&apos;t run into any problems though, the 360 version is just as perfect.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll recommend it but I don&apos;t care if you like it. Pac-Man CE DX+ just feels like it was made for me. It&apos;s one game I regard as simply perfect. I can&apos;t think of a single way to improve it or make it more enjoyable. The only other game I can say that about is Tetris. How do you improve perfection?
<br>
<br>I hope Namco let us know sooner rather than later.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pac-man-championship-edition-dx-+/user-reviews?user_review_id=4667605">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a living, breathing, actual human being over the age of ten, then most likely you&apos;ve played &apos;Pac-Man&apos; at one time or another. Growing up I would play at local arcades and pizzerias whenever I got the chance, but I never really cared all that much about the game. That is until I picked this one up during the 2014 Summer Sale. Now all I have to say is that &apos;Pac-Man&apos; is highly addictive! Sure, the levels all look relatively similar, and all you&apos;re really doing is running around collecting dots and eating frantic ghosts, but as I said before; this game is insanely addictive.
<br>
<br>And if you&apos;re thinking to yourself that you&apos;ve already seen everything &apos;Pac-Man&apos; has to offer, then think again. Because this is not the same game that came out all those decades ago. That&apos;s right, &apos;Pac-Man&apos; has been updated with new rules, game modes, stimulating colors, and best of all: competitive online score keeping. So now you and your friends can post your high scores for all to enjoy! But seriously, if you aren&apos;t familiar with &apos;Pac-Man&apos;, consider picking this one up. You really can&apos;t beat it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pac-man-championship-edition-dx-+/user-reviews?user_review_id=4926391">Expand</a></span>

Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ is gorgeous. You can choose from different art styles to board colors, and they all look absolutely stunning. Like you&apos;d expect, it&apos;s packed with different modes to play, although they all play pretty much the same. The difference is how the boards are setup. In Half, for instance, you&apos;re confined to one side of the level, and in Darkness you can&apos;t see much in front of you. Sometimes the game can get ridiculously fast-paced. Thankfully, the new bombs you are supplied with add action into the mix and keep you alive a bit longer. I hadn&apos;t experienced this before in Pac-Man, and I really enjoyed it. Also, eating the long lines of ghosts feels so very satisfying. I got 100% of the trophies for this game in roughly one week of frequent play, but still didn&apos;t get all of the medals that there are (bonus achievements unrelated to trophies). It would take a lot of extra time to do so, but I&apos;m a bit disappointed they didn&apos;t include those as trophies as well. It just doesn&apos;t motivate me to get them as badly. I had a great time with Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+, though. It really made me happy while I was playing it, but now that I&apos;ve completed the trophies I can&apos;t see myself returning much due to time constraints. For what it is, I think the game is very well executed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pac-man-championship-edition-dx-+/user-reviews?user_review_id=5087047">Expand</a></span>
