The movement around the game is seemless and I played through using a 360 controller, it was generally hassle free although inventory management took a few attempts to get used to. The  can climb up walls and along ceilings which leads to some movements that resemble Fez.
<br>
<br>After playing through however, I decided the game was not similar to Monkey Island at all with regards to the puzzles. Some of the choices were bizarre and made the game difficult not because of how hard the puzzles actually were but the placement and sheer ludicrousness. The game effectively consisted of 3 &apos;large&apos; puzzles. Each zone was unique and had a certain theme to it but all followed a main &apos;quest&apos; or aim linked to the zone. The game difficultly was mostly gauged by the awkwardness of certain actions, combined with the fact that rarely did you get any sort of clue other than a speech bubble depicting a cruel picture of what the character you&apos;re interacting with wants.
<br>
<br>The length of the game is fairly short, I took around 3-4 hours of passive gameplay, i.e I was watching TV whilst playing this game every so often. I can&apos;t imagine the replay value of this game is very high, maybe at some point I will speed run this game but it doesn&apos;t have that charm Monkey Island ever had and thus I don&apos;t feel that I could return to play this game simply for the storyline. Then there is the price, I wouldn&apos;t say this game is worth the RRP at all, I caught this in a bundle by chance and after a while decided to actually play it.
<br>
<br>However, despite that overall difficulty/awkwardness I think the game deserves some credit. The game is technically flawless with regards to bugs and the developers should be applauded for that, not often does this happen now that they can just simply release broken and patch later.
<br>
<br>The game really should be around the &#xA3;5 range though due to its length. I honestly think I could speed run this game in under 20 minutes and that isn&apos;t really a selling point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/journey-of-a-roach/user-reviews?user_review_id=3845452">Expand</a></span>

It has a nice story and challenging puzzles(good luck with it). The arts is good, the characters, settings and background music are cute(actually the whole game is cute). But you need to be aware of the spinning screen when Jim is climbing walls or ceilings, it might make you dizzy.
