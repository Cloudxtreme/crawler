You earn points for each game you play and you use those points to unlock more generic weapons, skins, and characters.  The problem is that characters and weapons are completely unbalanced so you&apos;ll find yourself using the same character and loadout every time. There&apos;s also a problem with the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; and not being able to &quot;upgrade&quot; to it. To obtain the goodies in the deluxe edition you&apos;ll have to buy the whole game over again. Yeah. For $20. Though, seeing how not-worth-your-time this game is, the only people who will want to pick up the Deluxe Edition are achievement hunters since you&apos;ll need both of the characters in that edition to unlock two corresponding achievements. Bad move, Arrowhead. Also, it appears the game has been abandoned by the developers; no support, no updates, no forum activity. The longer you wait, the more dead the game will most likely be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-showdown-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=3464135">Expand</a></span>

Most of the learning happened in the game against other players  I couldn&apos;t find any ranked matches to play, so I went to custom games, where I was repeatedly killed for a few hours. I started to gradually understand how the fighting system worked, but I could never duplicate the other player&apos;s actions, both due to lag and due to the fact that the stronger weapons and characters are all locked. It seemed to me that certain load-outs/weapons were overpowered. Finally, I found that, even in practice mode, the graphics seemed laggy and the audio stuttered frequently. I sense that, if you were to stick with the game for 10s of hours learning all the moves you need to do to kill your opponents and unlocking the weapons you need, you&apos;d find a pretty enjoyable game.

Me and 2 of my friends with randoms 5v1 a player with the rocket launcher and heal and no one could kill him. I would one shot you run a way and heal himself to full health in under 2 seconds. If you buy this game, only play in a private lobby with your friends where you can make some ground rules or be prepared to get pissed off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-showdown-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151377">Expand</a></span>

<br>Be warned, there is no controller support and the controls take ALOT of getting used to, but once you start to get even a rudimentary understanding of the controls and the pacing of the matches it then becomes one of the fastest and most brutal multiplayer experiences you can get. The ode to 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s nostalgia is just the beautiful wrapping the game came in, and it works. I always thought a good competitive Super Smasher Brothers type game was just what the PC needed and this game delivered.
<br>I even waited until it had been out for awhile to make sure that there was a good foundation of a community,(yes it&apos;s only playable online PVP) so that I wouldn&apos;t get stuck with a game I can&apos;t play, and from what I&apos;ve seen they are a great bunch of people to play with. Only downside is that most of them are deadly good at the game by now....lol
<br>The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the fact that it offered an in game store that enabled you to shortcut the grind.
<br>All round great game if you&apos;re looking for that new competitive type experience, definitely worth the price and a must have if it goes anywhere close to 50% off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-showdown-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=3248758">Expand</a></span>

This is not the average style of game that I play--I&apos;m normally not into twitch style games.  Maybe this has been done better elsewhere, but since I&apos;m a bit out of genre on this, it seems really well done to me.  The fast reload seems awesome, particularly when you do it right in the middle of a fight.  It&apos;s pretty awesome (in that disappointing kind of way) when you fail to do a fast reload too.  The music is pretty lousy, but you do listen to your own music in most games anyways right?  Every now and then the graphics or sound effects seem to glitch out, but given the short attention span required for a match restarting isn&apos;t a big deal.  It also seems to fix itself if you just hang out for a bit.  The learning curve seems a bit high to me--there are not really great tutorials in the game, as you are basically educated over a series of load screens between matches.  There are 6 characters in the standard purchase and 8 if you bought the deluxe pack on steam.  One of the extra characters on the deluxe pack is one of my favorites.  One of the default characters seems to be the best (the Arnold ripoff character) however so you are not really at a disadvantage w/o the extra characters.  I think there are 4 maps, all of which are well done.  That said, I am left wanting for more quality maps to extend the value of the game.  The game looks like it will be supported by a pay store, though I find it hard to believe that this will be a long lasting game.  There are 10-20 games currently, and I don&apos;t really see that swelling to some huge number.  If you&apos;re into this genre (or hey, maybe you&apos;re like me and you&apos;re looking for something with just a bit more action than usual) I&apos;d pick this one up while there are still players on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-showdown-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=3017561">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game had some great potential but sadly it is completely broken. What could have been a fun combination of Smash Brothers  Shank, essentially became a race to bank off the efforts of other players. Basically, two players meet, attempt a dance-of-death which means they attempt to hit each other through the bad hit-boxes, uneven balance and weapons only for the &quot;victor&quot; to be murdered shortly after managing to beat the system for a shallow, short lived &quot;win.&quot; It becomes painfully apparent that there is nothing more than that early on, and it makes the game feel like a shallow attempt to lure you into purchasing items in game with real money to attempt to get an edge.
<br>
<br>Sadly it won&apos;t matter, because the items cannot fix the game&apos;s mechanics. I would recommending watching this from a distance and possibly getting invested when it&apos;s playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-showdown-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=3432001">Expand</a></span>

<br>Once I got the knack of how to play, another issue arose. Lag. I would join a game, and have 300 ping. I wouldn&apos;t be downloading anything, I wouldn&apos;t be using any other internet other than to play this game, but I&apos;d get 300 ping, rendering the game unplayable.
<br>When I did get a game where either I or my opponents were teleorting all over the place, it would be after about 5  10 minutes of sitting in the &apos;Ranked Match&apos; lobby, doing nothing. I then tried custom matches.
<br>There were about 10 of them, 6 of them requiring passwords to get into. The first one I tried wouldn&apos;t let me on as &apos;the server is not responding&apos;. The next one, I joined, and got insta-killed whenever I spawned.

Dedicated Servers for better Pings, more Maps, more chars, more weapons, cheaper price. Magicka has a lot more Stuff then Showdown Effect, but Showdown Effect costs the same. They should work on it like the Developers of Awesomenauts. Maybe some Performance Fixes would be great, or some Graphic advanced settings.</span>

Musical score that nails the 80&apos;s cheesy action Arnold or Norris vibe. Combat is well done, with many improvised weapons to be found, though I believe there could be improvements here. The melee attacks are simple, with a charging tackle, a block, and an attack. Some weapons attack slower and do more damage as you would expect, others are quicker. All can be thrown to do some damage in a pinch. The ranged weapons require that your mouse targeting reticule be over the enemy you intend to hit as well as aiming at them; failing to do this will result in the bullets hitting the &apos;wall&apos; behind the target. This works surprisingly well. In all, combat is solid, though more variety in melee weapons attacks would be good; I felt little reason to use anything but the default katana.
<br>
<br>The presence of a paid cosmetic item shop is a concern, but all ingame abilites and characters and weaponry unlocks via the ingame currency store, earned by playing matches. This currency is gained quickly, but I still think the presence of the actual currency store is unneeded. Similarly, the number of characters feels rather limited, though this doubtless will be expanded on in the future (hopefully for free) Each character has a special ability which appears locked to the character  this is ok, but it would have been nice if this was assignable as the standard items to a loadout.
<br>
<br>Gamemodes are intruiging; you can play as a generic Henchman in some of the modes and lack the powers the oridinary characters have  all henchmen then work to kill the &apos;one man army&apos;. This and some other modes are entertaining and the Showdown mode is probably the best, where its a standard deathmatch until the end when the victor is determined by elimination. One downside is that the game is entirely peer-to-peer, similar to many console games, meaning you have to play on a non-dedicated server. This can result in laggy connections, but during the several hours I have played the game over a few days, this has not been noticable (other than, perhaps, the host having a slight edge) Hopefully the developers consider adding some dedicated servers to the game and release a server executable  it will help in keeping a long-term playerbase.
<br>
<br>TLDR Fun 2D battles with both ranged and melee fighting
<br>Vivid animations and background
<br>Peer to peer connection can cause some issues</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-showdown-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2989643">Expand</a></span>
