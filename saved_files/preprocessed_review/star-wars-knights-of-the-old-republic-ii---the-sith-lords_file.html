Amazing interface, plotline, and interactivity. I have not been this impressed by a game in a long time.</span>

As a result, the restored content patch must be download, fixing all of the missing content and finally rendering this game worth playing. In stark contrast to its predecessor, Kotor II is much darker, more mature and filled with ambiguous though more compelling characters, with dialogues which will cast the player into a series of gray-shaded paths which will ultimately shape the fate of a tattered Republic. Most importantly, the ambiguity and sort of Jedi atheism shown by Kreia (the player co-protagonist) will cross the boundaries of ordinary game-platform, displaying the inconsistency of a &quot;beyond good and evil&quot; moral and showing the inevitable consequences of always playing the neutral part. One major flaw may be the outdated graphics; nevertheless, Kotor II represents a landmark in PC Rpg story writing, possibly one of the last of its kind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2302646">Expand</a></span>

Once you get into the meat of the game, however, I can&apos;t think of another game that is more entertaining for an RPG player. The product was rushed, leaving out a lot of important content, which was the reason for its relatively lower score among critics, but with The Sith Lords: Restored Content Mod, available to all PC users, pretty much the entire game has been restored to what the finished product was supposed to be. If you&apos;re looking for a good Star Wars game with a lot of bang for the buck, look no further.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2606066">Expand</a></span>

Great story, characters and battle system. In many ways it&apos;s much better than the first part and deserves at least nine - if you have all the necessary patches (most of them unofficial, but they work awesome) and some mods. There are lots of interactions with your party, and you can make them all better while talking to them, and you can make yourself better the same way. The number of levels you can go up is above 50, although nobody can achieve that in normal gameplay (I got just above 30, I think). There are lots and lots of mods out there  which are being produced even now and they make the game much better. As most of you know, the game was released sooner that it should have, so some of the content was not introduced, and some of the bugs were left ingame. I think official and unofficial patches must be installed, to make the game deserve a perfect 10,like: TSL Restored Content Mod, (there is another content for restoration but much smaller, and it adds even more quests), patches (official and unofficial), mods for sabers, sound and ingame menu color (I changed it to blue like the first KOTOR), new, higher resolution videos of important scenes that replace the poor ones that are already in game (it&apos;s the same video, just higher res), TSL Save Game Editor, and the rest....I only encountered only ONE bug, on Nar Shadda with Red Eclipse quest, and there is a simple solution to that also. So, great game, a must play for everyone but only with patches and mods, and it&apos;s a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826160">Expand</a></span>

Everything has been pretty logically advanced; the combat&apos;s been fleshed out and is faster moving and slightly more varied, items are much more customizable and generally prettier, and there&apos;s tons of more variety in every aspect of the game. They also made another wise decision  no need to muck around with the plebeian classes, been there, done that, we&apos;ve already seen Jedi powers, give them to us from the beginning. The plot was also made much more complex  in order to understand the entire story-line you have to actively fish out bits and pieces from your companions and always try and look out for the big picture. Every important conversation slips you a little of the larger puzzle, and there&apos;s no big revelation, oh, no. TSL doesn&apos;t baby you, if you don&apos;t figure it out yourself you&apos;re going to be left half in the dark for the rest of the game. Not only that, it even explains some elements of the first game which weren&apos;t quite explained. For sure, TSL is aimed at an older age group than its predecessor. The original Knights of the Old Republic was accessible by all age groups, but left little to the imagination as the plot progressed. TSL requires investigation, and in some cases thought, as the game occasionally deals with thoughts which aren&apos;t as simple as the typical quasi-philosophy of the Jedi, and enjoys giving different perspectives on events of the game their fill. After all that, however, The Sith Lords did have some drawbacks. It seemed to be an unfinished product  even after doing as much as I could to further every single character&apos;s plot-line to their completion, some were still incapable of having their loose-ends tied up. I won&apos;t be too hard on the game though, with those aside the game was a huge, massive product, and for how ambitious as it was it&apos;s admirable that as much was put together well as was in the game. Despite its few flaws, I would say the game was excellent, and without a doubt superior to its predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2934872">Expand</a></span>

Offer great storytelling experience and  offer a deconstruction to the Star Wars setting. Like a predecessor it&apos;s combat system is weak but it entirely makes up for it by a thick, grim atmosphere and splendid writing. One of a player companion, Kreia, is one of the best npcs ever created, she is so good , she might have as well come from Planescape Torment. Which is not surprising as this game narrative designer was Magnificent Chris Avellone.  It had many bugs on release, but now it has been corrected by fan patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=4531504">Expand</a></span>

Do you people realize how long it takes to program something like this? Try making a mod one of these days, and you&apos;ll get an appreciation for the process.

Though the gameplay feels the same, the story has a different tone than the first game. This sequel is darker and narrative was deep and thoughtful, along with the dynamic characters and overarching story which kept you siphening through a philisophically grey mist to unravel the conflict which was intertwined with both the external and interpersonal.

It begins steeped in thee unknown, with your arrival aboard a badly damaged derelict ship under mysterious circumstances, headed for an abandoned mining facility, you are quickly tasked, much like the games predecessor, to reveal your origins, and unveil the secrets surround your past and peer into the greater scope of the plot itself.    Observing the surroundings as you go through the game, learning about the peoples and cultures you find yourself in the midst of, you may very well become overwhelmed by the wealth of characters you encounter, many who may reference a history your unfamiliar with. If you&apos;ve played the previous title, or read any of the comics, you&apos;ll be aided to some extent in your quest for self-discovery with the prior knowledge of events that have had a profound effect on the peoples and environments you come across. (like a planet, ruined by the conflict that takes place in the first game) yet even if you have not, dont let this discourage you. These additions are largely atmospheric and text related, and will not significantly hinder you in your journey. The planets you travel to are well designed, thought out, and written. I found myself so capitivated by the strange and ordinary figures i encountered, that i constantly lost track of what the hell the main objective was i&apos;m supposed to accomplish.    More intriguing then that is your own companions. From the cryptically cynical, to comically murderous, no two characters in KOTOR II are alike. In fact, you&apos;d be hard pressed to find one that shares any noticeable similarities at all- in Mannerism, ideology, humor, or communication. One of the new features added from the original that adds to the relationship you have with these characters is influence. As the plot progresses you will be challenged at one point or another with one more dilemma after the other. What one praises you for the other might scorn. The higher standing you are with one, the more dialogue options become possible, and the lower, the less. The former, revealing fascinating insights into the supporting lore, their personal thoughts and stories, as well as even their most closely guarded secrets. The voice acting is exceptional, and adds a feeling of immersion that no technological marvels of graphic improvement could achieve.  The plot is a dark, engrossing, well crafted and most of all original, drawing its strength from a number of story-telling aspects, from political drama, to a psychological thriller filled with unexpected twists, to its bits of comic relief, and surprisingly deep, philosophic moments of reflection, there&apos;s really a little something for everyone that really serves to open up the game to a broader audience. Overall, i can say with confidence, that this has been my favorite game i have had the pleasure of playing to date. I can not recommend it enough, and can truly say, its a wonder unto itself, a one of a kind piece that is the equal or greater of any classical example of literature of film. Its doesnt shine with the unfathomable graphic advances we have come to feel entitled to, and it may have been cut short due at the crunch time of development and thus feel awkwardly unfinished at times, yet once you can get over that, your in for a great time you wont soon forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2936436">Expand</a></span>

I feel that the storyline is too complex,and certain side quest are a little &quot;boring&quot;. The animation are also a little dissapointing. It&apos;s like all focosing on landing on planets and departing. No action. KOTOR was much more enjoyable, more joyfull, you know...able to romance with characters, and alot of side quest of party members. More joyfull i say. Why Are Sequels Always Darker !!! less joking , more killing, you know? --_--. The ONE thins i must comment is the ending. The ending is so rediculous and very dissapointing. Usually we would expect a climatic duel but this is uhhh...dunno what to say...This Is a game that should stay in the lab for a longer period of time, and not russhed out, and what about bastila, and carth?i have games that have no ending.Still i would prefer having to play as REVAN again instead of some &apos;Excile&quot;.Nevertheless, it is a rather interesting game as it inherited a lot from KOTOR.So..i dunno? the choice is your Dark side or light /gg. and May the force be with you...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=379534">Expand</a></span>

Well, to be fair it&apos;s not difficult to surpass Bioware in almost every department. Bioware delivered a story about a Disney villain trying to take over the galaxy with a plot twist so utterly laughable and obvious that I can&apos;t imagine people didn&apos;t see it after the opening credits roll. KOTOR2 is not just about the ancient lurking evil coming to take over the galaxy. It&apos;s about a jedi knight finding out about his/her connection the force and learning about the responsibilities of always acting the neutral party. It&apos;s an enjoyable journey to say the least and you&apos;re not going to think it&apos;s unfinished until after you&apos;ve finished it. If you do want to put the unfinished stuff back in, there&apos;s a patch out there for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=1547303">Expand</a></span>

Its awesome to choose between playing as a female and male because you get the Disciple or Handmaiden and the story line of both player genders is awesome.

Kotor 1 has more a story that anyone can understand and it&apos;s story is more open ended than the 2nd kotor. Kotor 2&apos;s story is darker and richer. You feel like your choices decide whether the sith deserve to rule or the jedi. Therefore it&apos;s more about your choice. Other than that the gameplay is the same other than kotor 2 has a few more powers. But kotor 2 has some points where the only way you will understand is if you played the first. But kotor 2 can easily be played before playing kotor 1. They are a great series and if you aren&apos;t the itchy kind of gamer that just wants action, then this is the game for you as it has one of the best stories and feel to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2554014">Expand</a></span>

If it was a completely different Star Wars game it probably would have a better place in my heart but because it failed to live up to the expectations of its predecessor it will forever be doomed to sub-par. But even disregarding those failed expectations the game is simply average. Combat The melee combat is automatic and aside from occasional force spells is not very engrossing. The force spells are interesting and Force Lightning is always a blast but the melee feels like it could be done without you. If you started fighting and went to make a cup of tea the game might automatically win the fight for you before the kettle dings. You are really only needed for the more difficult fights and to move your characters from one encounter to the next. The main satisfaction is derived from waving around lightsabers.<br><br>Dialogue<br>There is enough dialogue to fill a book the size of War and Peace or a washer manual but instead of a plethora of well defined characters like Tolsky&apos;s masterpiece you find yourself talking to a washer manual with as much character as the soapy water within it. In the beginning there is plenty of people to meet but eventually you can predict what a characters next plot point will be 10 hours before it happens. I called the antagonist from the moment I met them and it was just a matter of time before my predictions were confirmed by their betrayal.<br><br>Story<br>In KOTOR you are a Sith Lord. In KOTOR 2 you are an old soldier. Why does the story need to exist? Who are you saving? What is your motivation? Why cant I just wave my lightsaber around for 20 hours? All these questions are unfortunately left unanswered and even unacknowledged. The plot is simply a device to move the character from one lightsaber battle to the next. I think the game wanted a character that anyone could relate to, a person with no outstanding qualities or past accomplishments that the player could then mold into an ultimate bad-ass. But there is no quest to save the galaxy or even defeat someone who is remotely capable of destroying a planet. You are simply a nobody who is trapped in the story of a nobody.<br><br>In conclusion the only selling point of this game is the lightsabers. If you want to fantasize about yourself holding with a glowing hot stick then go for this game and skip all the dialogue and character interaction. But if you are looking for an engrossing and interactive game that will enhance your appreciation of the Star Wars universe then look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=1723858">Expand</a></span>

The opening of the game is great. The midpoint of the game is interesting. And then, just as soon as things seem to start coming together, omigod fightthissithlord fightthatsithlord fightthethirdsithlord whatjusthappened whoknows gameover rollcredits. Plot threads vanish, characters vanish, other characters talk to each other about events that never happened, you blow through three Sith lords in less time than it took to get through the star forge in KOTOR 1, and the game ends. You don&apos;t see what happens to your character, the secondary characters, or the galaxy at large; the camera just pans up into space and credits start.

Problem is...that last 25% is really, really bad...and made all the more painful by that wonderful first 75%...kind of like ice cream that tastes wonderful when it hits your tongue and swirls around your mouth...but right before you swallow, it sours and leaves you with an awful aftertaste. On the good side, the story (um...except for that last 25% part) is interesting. The characters are more deeply developed. I like the new Influence factor, where you gain influence with characters enabling your light/dark shift to have a greater impact on their light/dark shift. The voice acting is good and the sounds effects are great. Put it this way...if I rated this game after playing about 75% of it, I would give it a 9. Then came the last 25%. The problem is that the game has these various plot lines...which are completely and utterly ignored at the end of the game. I mean...what is it with HK-47 and T4-M3? What is up with the voice lock on the navcomputer? What about the HK-50&apos;s - where are they coming from? And what happened to the rest of my crew? All this...and MUCH MUCH more...is left dangling. I imagine it would be like reading two-thirds of a good Tom Clancy novel, turning the page and reading, &quot;And they all lived happily ever after...the end.&quot; In other words, when you get to the end of the game...go ahead and take a breath....sit back...and wait for the final closing cut-scene to bring everything together...and I guarantee....30 seconds later, you will be yelling at your monitor asking, &quot;Is that it? Is that all there is?&quot; Also, I should mention that the bad guys are incredibly easy to beat. My Sentinel would simply force up to Knight Speed, take 2 or 3 swings, and the fight would be over...and this was against the toughest opponents at the end of the game. NOTE: I should mention that I seemed to get more information about the plot playing the dark side than I did the light side...not much more, mind you, but more nonetheless. So...I give the game a 6 because 75% of the game is a 9, but the last 25% of the game is a 1 or 2...and that comes out to around 6. It is a game of such great potential with a totally, absolutely, incredibly unsatisfying ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=380572">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, it seems great with all of these plot threads and detail at first, but in the end neither the plot nor the subplots are resolved. I was surprised when the ending credits rolled because I was certainly expecting something to pull together at least some of the missing pieces - but sadly there was a BRIEF cutscene that didn&apos;t make any real sense and then BLAM - THE END. Then I realized how badly the gameplay had deteriorated during the second half of the game was not going to overcome by a solid ending - and realized that I had been had by this sad sham of a game. I certainly will not buy future LucasArts products as a result.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=416516">Expand</a></span>

The first KOTOR pulled you a lot deeper into the story than this one. The game was unsatisfyingly short, upon finishing the last boss it was only 33.5hours. The ending cinematic really was a let down, I played all the way till the end to see some uneventful 10 second low quality video clip!? But all in all. this is really a decent buy, despite all these bad things i&apos;ve been saying, it really got 7 because the gameplay made a high cut. Waiting for thrid sequel, hope its gonna fill up all these rooms for improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=379418">Expand</a></span>

Even though I bought this the week it came out, it took me long to finish the game. First, the bugs were annoying. Then, they made you wait forever for the promised music patch that is not worth downloading. Anyway, I had heard that the ending was rushed, and boy, it is. No matter how awesome the beginning is, the shitty unfinished ending destroys the whole plot. Story elements disappear, others get finished so fast there is no way to enjoy them. Also, while the dialogue is well written, sometimes the characters get simply boring. And there are so many party members, at times it felt like work finding out what&apos;s the matter with all of them. The gameplay is ok, but not very well balanced. On medium, most fights are just too damn easy. 95% of the game I didn&apos;t care for the &quot;battle stances&quot;, and found no use for most of the items. The better Jedi armors also look stupid. Kotor 1 was excellent. This one is not worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=391947">Expand</a></span>

This is sad because it had that movie feeling in it but which slowly degenerated. Combat interface is as horrible as in first one but they are so easy you don&apos;t even have to watch the screen let alone change tactics. Addictive, but wouldn&apos;t play it through again.</span>

The force powers were excellent and so were a bunch of the abilities. However the game felt incomplete, after the end game you feel like their is more to do but there is nothing. It took WAY too long to get your lightsaber, i mean way to long. However that is a minor part of the game. Since this wasn&apos;t made by bioware you have to expect it would not be as good as the first one. I think if bioware made this game it would have felt complete instead of incomplete. Still i recommend this game to any fan of star wars or any rpg fan. But if you are not an RPG fan you might not like this game and if you are an rpg fan you might feel a bit disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488176">Expand</a></span>

<br>But then the game open up and you see a lot of qualities unseen in the previous title.
<br>If Kotor 1 had a intense macro plot involving everything, but forced conversations with characters (for example, a character would bring a talk about his parents only to develop background) and an often unilateral representation of the world , Kotor 2 offers the opposite: the bigger plot isn&apos;t all that relevant or entertaining, but the characters are great and their personalities amazing. Some lines of Kreia and Handmaiden are writer&apos;s material, and it&apos;s a relief to finally see someone being original and playing with moral and ethical dicothomies in the Star Wars universe, an universe so hungry of this.
<br>The downside is that Kotor 2 is an incomplete game with a lot of wasted potential, besides the fact that, unlike Kotor 1, you can&apos;t really enjoy all the social interation with characters due of the inexorable influence system; if you mistreat a character once you may never be able to interact fully with him again.
<br>Play this game as weekend casual rpg and you won&apos;t disappointed. Also don&apos;t forget to install the mods.
<br>If any bug happens, see the bright side: at least you are not playing a game with bioware level of writing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=2866510">Expand</a></span>

<br>if your looking into this play the first kotor before you delve into this part of the story blends together. but if your picking this up for the first time crafting is a must on your main character for the first play thru, blaster deflection alone once it really gets up there will not only save your butt, but kill people in the process. Also i would go as far as to say &quot;i dare you to be good&quot; it takes about 10x more work and side quests to play all light side.

It is nothing compared to The original KOTOR and is overall a bad game it has crash problems and was shoehorned out by development to make a deadline.  The only thing that makes this game possibly worth picking it up is the wonderful modding community trying  to fix all of this games problems and a couple memorable characters.  But even with that the game still suffers many bugs and just overall bad design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=3121559">Expand</a></span>

<br>The problem with the game is that you basically have to talk to your companions to get a good idea of what exactly is going on. If you don&apos;t you&apos;ll get to the end and will wonder &quot;what just happened&quot; because of how poorly explained many things are in the game.
<br>
<br>What some people call the &quot;richness&quot; of the characters is really just making up for the otherwise sloppy writing and game development.
<br>
<br>The game was left by Obsidian in a totally unfinished state. There are parts of the game where they clearly intended to add more, but didn&apos;t. The final area is an example of this.
<br>
<br>There is considerably less to explore in this game compared to the first game, and it is much more linear.  Also you are never going to be awed by a richly created background on a planet like Manaan. Nope, instead you get a lot of very bland areas like Nar Shadaa and Telos. Nar Shadaa was especially disappointing as the enemy you fight there is probably the least interesting boss in both KOTOR 1 and 2, and the quests you do on the planet are cartoonish at best.
<br>
<br>The balancing is also frankly laughable, as the additional force powers and advanced classes that they add to the game make it so that enemies are barely even scratching you. The pretty much make your jedi a god by the end, which makes it just not particularly fun if you are looking for any kind of challenge.
<br>
<br>Ohh and then there are the bugs. The game is full of them, to the point where FANS HAD TO PATCH IT. Even then you only have to go onto other places like the Steam forums to see how many problems people have in trying to either get the game to work or to not crash when they enter their ship or go to a new area.
<br>
<br>Overall it is inferior to KOTOR, even if KOTOR has a cartoonish final boss itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=4430646">Expand</a></span>

The ability to influence your companions and then train some of them to become Jedi was particularly neat. The story is deep and engaging and a good deal of fun. In many ways, I liked the game even more than the original KOTR, which is saying a great deal because I loved that game. Unfortunately, KOTOR II was a classic Obsidian game in that it reached for the stars in many ways but was let down by some irritating technical bugs and a rushed timeline that led to a compressed and clipped ending to the game. There was also a great deal of material cut from the game that really should have been kept but had to be jettisoned to get the game out on a deadline. There have been mods to restore much of that content, however. This one is definitely worth a play through simply to see all of the greatness in it, even if it didn&apos;t ultimately quite reach the heights it seemed capable of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5321734">Expand</a></span>

I truly felt like I was the exile, deciding the fate of myself, unfortunates whom I attempted to aid, or not, and the fate of the galaxy as a whole.  My issues with the game are primarily with the vast array of bugs, with the environment, enemies and the story.  There were several times where the decisions I made in conversations left me stuck perpetually, unable to move on with the game, until I loaded a previous save state.  The worst was of course with Atris, and this same problem has been recorded my many other players.  Choosing one conversation line leads to no story progression, while others work just fine.

<br>All in all, a really great game, held back by the many apparent bugs in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=4322777">Expand</a></span>

I would start by saying that you really have to get this game on a PC and do some of the patching to restore the ending. It was originally rushed by LucasArts and it showed.

<br>
<br>This is one of the best RPGs in a wide array of areas. The characters have fleshed out  backstories and feel very differentiated. The text tree use in this game is among the best ever done in terms of developing the characters you talk to and how it is integrated into the game. There are quite a few times where you can gain information and even traits through talking to crew members. This is one of my favorite parts of the game as simply from a mechanical perspective the idea of your character LITERALLY learning things from speech is represented by the fact that you gain actual stat bonuses etc, from the dialogue. There are speech points in battle(or just before) that also affect the enemy stats, this is very rare and you might not even know that is how the game is working but that is the level of detail put into the speech in this game. The light/dark system is certainly binary but this is the Star Wars universe, there is really no getting around the light/dark representations of the force and this honestly is probably the best game or movie for actually making the dark side seem more alluring to someone that is not literally evil.
<br>
<br>The combat is not particularly good, though. You can have some fun seeing the lightsaber for the first time or using a new force skill here or there but it feels fairly weak compared to the rest of the game, but  I&apos;d still say its solid for an RPG. Stealth seems pretty much useless other than incredibly rare spots. There can also be some annoying cases of running back and forth for quests, and I swear to god the card game cheats, no one can convince me otherwise.
<br>
<br>Overall though, when you look past its flaws you are in for a rare treat. This game ends up being much greater than the sum of its parts, because these types of experiences simply aren&apos;t made very often, 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938034">Expand</a></span>

As a fan of both Planescape:Torment and KOTOR I, I would have to say that the former does mental stimulation better and the latter conveys a sense of adventure better than this game. The actual gameplay mechanics, etc., are great, but that indescribable sense of fun that existed in KOTOR and PS:T is missing here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=390606">Expand</a></span>

Knights of the Old Republic II suffers, in short, from being in the shadow of it&apos;s predecessor&apos;s brilliance. When the former not only brought to life the Star Wars world better than any previous game, but also managed to combine PC RPG stats and dice with Console RPG storytelling, it did so almost unexpectedly. KotOR threatened to be far less than the sum of its parts, and when it turned out to more, much more, its success was guaranteed. Unfortunately, that first game, but for a few tiny control issues, really didn&apos;t leave much to be improved upon. Taking up the motto of &quot;If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it&quot;, the developers subsequently created something that feels more like a hefty expansion, rather than a true sequel. New story, slightly altered levelling up system, but all within the same shell. Unfortunately, the game fails to match its predecessor on several of these levels. Firstly, the combat and skill related section of KOTOR II lacks the balance of the first game. Certain fights in the first game were genuinely difficult, and frequently your choice of skills and party members only opened doors at the expense of others being shut. In contrast, from the outset of KOTOR II, it is easy to have a party capable of accomplishing everything and kicking ass to boot. A carefully constructed jedi is quite capable of destroying even the toughest enemies on their own, and several of the other party members (or yourself, if you choose) can cover ALL of the skills needs you&apos;ll ever have, while remaining quite combat capable. The satisfaction of levelling up becomes muted as the game wears on, and towards the end begins to feel rather meaningless. Secondly, the interactions between your fellow party members and yourself, while still a cut above most rival games, never reaches the brilliance of the first game. Ultimately, despite the game&apos;s efforts, the brilliance of Bastila, Carth and Mission is not replicated, and instead we end up with characters who range from the flat to the outright dislikeable. This is coupled with a well intentioned system of converting followers to the light or dark sides, which while a promising idea ultimately serves to replace rather than support the &quot;it looks like something is bothering ____&quot; of the first game. Rather than developing, the game instead seems to pour all the character&apos;s stories into initially accessible paths and abandon them for the endgame. Indeed, the game also includes a rather bizarre continued conflict between two NPCs that might well not feature in the player&apos;s plans. Finally, the story itself borders upon weak, though it likely suffers again from the impact of its predecessor here. The pacing of the game, certainly, is poor, and the game seems to drag for large periods without any injection of urgency or a strong wider goal. When the endgame does approach, it is thrown on almost unexpectedly. This combines with the game&apos;s enemies, who, after appearing deeply menacing when we first meet them, and radiating a sense of power, proceed to fall like bowling pins so quickly at the end, that you&apos;re left expecting revivals that do not come. This is a shame, because while characters like Darth Malak and Darth Revan (KotOR) might have been impossible to best, the game initially appears to have matched them. Frankly, KotOR II&apos;s concepts deserve far better than the game delivers. It isn&apos;t all doom and gloom, though. The sensation that this is KotOR 1.5 will probably be welcomed by most, and although the game doesn&apos;t match it&apos;s predecessor, you would be hard pressed to accuse KotOR II of being the cash-in it might have been. Some of the dialogue is genuinely brilliant and there are many pleasing little concepts in the storyline. And it is another replication of those wonderful star-wars worlds, which is always appreciated. My final gripe with the game, concerns the way the story progresses from it&apos;s predecessor. It would have been nice if the game could have absorded some details of what happened in the player&apos;s previous outing, but instead we have a hotch-potch amalgamation of the potential light/dark paths ventured last time around. Indeed, given the options available in the previous game, it is disappointing to see a story told where the actions of my character seemed completely contradicted. The ending, in particular, is very unsatisfying, and seems to cater for only one path of play. Frankly, the story of the second game is best ignored when thinking about the series. KotOR II remains an acceptable RPG romp, but fails to deliver to the level of it&apos;s predecessor. Ultimately, it fails to reach the benchmarks in gameplay, story and characterization of the first game, and though fans will welcome the extension of the series there is no doubt that it will take more to acheive the success of the first game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii---the-sith-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=424210">Expand</a></span>

<br>In the Sith Lords you have one of the best opening sequences - exciting and gripping - of any gae I have played. Obsidian kept the good looks and a similar interface, made the Items available more interesting and varied, made the characters far more interesting, and went for a more complex plot. I still think the ending was a shame, it felt so sudden and rushed and The Trayus Core scene just felt ridiculous.
