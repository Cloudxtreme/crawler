<br>The game starts by a cinematic intro of your faction &apos;Broker&apos; uploading you into one of the planets faction &apos;The Surveyors&apos; Robot, blending you in with them as they are friendly/neutral with you.
<br>You get three guns, a powerful pistol, a mid-long range assault rifle and a strong sniper rifle.
<br>You are introduced to a small tutorial that gives you all the information you need to get going with your journey.
<br>Once you get the hang of the controls and the abilities of your robot (you have an activable plasma shield and various spells/abilities at your disposal) you are sent to explore the area and investigate about the signal on this planet called T&#xF6;lva.
<br>The graphics are astounding, the atmosphere is STALKER-ish and the music has an eerie feeling of deja-heard from Silent Hill.
<br>You will be fighting against two factions, the Zealots and the Bandits.
<br>The Bandits fight for territory and will constantly assault your bunkers while the Zealots are more interested in the ancient relics and ruins which they will protect tooth and bone.
<br>The Surveyors, your faction, will help you out by capturing, assaulting or exploring with you.
<br>
<br>It is appreciable that the ressource system is unlike the other modern AAA games, you collect orbs/cubes that give you a currency called &apos;Ressources&apos; which you will use to upgrade your characters weapons, abilities, armors and hazard shields.
<br>
<br>There is a day and night cycle and each has an unique and aesthetic look to it, nights are dark and gritty, reminding you a lot of Kholat, while days are shiny and blinding akin to Far Cry.
<br>
<br>There are many subtleties to the gameplay elements presented to you but i will leave the mystery for you to solve, for a low price tag of 19.99$ the game is very well worth a buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-signal-from-tolva/user-reviews?user_review_id=7216310">Expand</a></span>
