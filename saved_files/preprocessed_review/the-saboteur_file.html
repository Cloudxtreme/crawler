Part Assassins Creed, part Grand Theft Auto...you&apos;ll be climbing rooftops, hijacking and collecting cars, shooting and blowing Nazis, and watching burlesque dancers in this open world 3rd person action game set in WWII Paris.  The graphics are pretty good, but distant textures get muddy.  Still the world looks nice and Paris is pretty big.  The game mechanics are very easy to control; driving, shooting, and upgrades are all done well.  The game seems to favor ease though so if you want a challenge crank it over normal because I find normal too easy for my taste.  Mission vary which include racing, assassinating, and bombing.  Outside of the main and side missions there are plenty of things to do to earn contraband, the games currency, to buy gear and level up abilities.  My favorite part of this game tho, is that it&apos;s mostly in black and white until you &quot;free&quot; a neighborhood which then get colorized showing it&apos;s free state.  A unique and effect gimmick that adds a great look to the game.  This is an excellent game all around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555753">Expand</a></span>

<br>My only complaints are that the map is not working properly (I&apos;ve heard you have to play in 720p for it to function, but I haven&apos;t tested that) and the occasional bug but so far I have not encountered any game-breaking ones. The story line is also pretty cheesy but if you look past that and simply the enjoy the gameplay Saboteur is a very good experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383753">Expand</a></span>

Maybe because it doesn&apos;t have multiplayer? Who knows.. Combine GTA IV with Call Of Duty and Godfather II and Prince of Pursia, and you get Saboteur. The graphics are excellent, sound is great, gameplay is top notch, animations are fluid, its quite hard to fault. It has a unique style/atmosphere to the game, kind of like th original Call of Duty but in a Sandbox setting. You can roam free and go after enemy objects how you please, there is loads of detail and polish, and plenty of action. I honestly think this is the best game of the year, way better than the boring scripted linear setting of other WW2 games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=741472">Expand</a></span>

Lots of different playing aspects to the game from the more scripted main missions and side missions to just roaming around idealized versions of Paris, La Havre, and Saarbrucken going after the various types of freeplay targets. This game can take weeks to play. Thankfully, you don&apos;t have to go after every freeplay target. Pay special attention to the Perks as they can give you access to extra and more powerful weapons. I thought the storyline was engaging and the voice acting very good. Character facial animation could have been a bit better, something more like in Half Life 2 would have been perfect. Game physics was good. Driving a car was a challenge as all Parisians seemed to have a death wish by randomly jumping in front of my car, not to mention the cars controlled by game AI. Bodies all over the place!<br><br>It&apos;s too bad the game has problems with ATI cards. The game sat on my bookshelf for that reason for about a year before I upgraded to a slightly faster system with an Nvidia card. Even then, the game crashes if I play it for too long under XP or Windows 7. The beta 1.3 patch didn&apos;t help the crashing problem. I just live with it as the game is too good to just give up on. Maybe the folks at EA will fix it and add a few more missions.

The story is alright, the action is alright, the climbing works alright and the cars handles alright. But the game is overall a little bit rough around the edges and nothing really stands out. I did enjoy the ability to disguise myself even though it could have been executed better. I also really enjoyed the setting and the visual design in the game. It is also quite fun to run over cows in the game. The campaign should take you around 10 hours to complete and its for the most part quite good. The missions could have been a little more varied and the general gameplay gets a little bit repetitive in the end but for the most part it feels alright. I don&apos;t wish to sound too negative since i had some fun with this game. I believe that the game is a quite average free roaming game. That doesn&apos;t mean that the game is bad and if you have an interest in the setting, happens to find it for a cheap price or if you simply are a fan of the genre then i would definitely recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=3072532">Expand</a></span>

But Saboteur!  yes the climbing mechanic is SLOW and repetitive, but thankfully you don&apos;t need to do too much of that.  Oh, and the world feels more alive!  I actually cared about the civilians and wanted to rescue them when they were being harassed by Nazi soldiers.  I actually didn&apos;t want to jack any car I saw on the street.  The perks were fun and free-play objectives are addictive, but the best part of this game and why i keep playing it is that this game made me care about its citizens.  and for a 3rd person open world action game, that&apos;s a rarity.  Choices that matter, not just choices for the sake of having them  that&apos;s what makes game worlds come alive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=3134763">Expand</a></span>

I just had a blast with this game. Now like most open world &quot;sandbox&quot; style games, you could spend hours roaming the map and still never see everything that is in this game. Now granted sometimes the story seems to get a little slow and a tad bit tedious but you get a pretty good amount for entertainment. A whole slew of people say &quot; I would rather buy GTA&quot; and i cant blame you for that, GTA is awesome but this is a whole other monster.
<br>
<br>Being in Paris during a point in history where the world was falling into its darkest days while under the boot heel of the Nazi&apos;s is a far cry from Liberty City. Granted they share a lot of the same features such as most sandbox games, in this you most always be ready to fight. In GTA you must do something bad to even have the police come after you let alone gun you down. The Saboteur on the other hand keeps you watching out for any jack booted solider ready to air you out if you cross over into Nazi controlled areas.
<br>
<br>The historical elements I quit enjoy, I mean hell I&apos;ve been blasting away at Nazi&apos;s since I was about 7 years old playing the first shareware version of Wolfenstien on PC. A lot of the missions you take on are based on many of the real events the resistance movement .Even the main character Sean Devlin is based off a S.O,E operative named William Grover-williams , a racer car driver who help organize the resistance movements and plot sabotage cells to help aide in the fight to stop Germany.
<br>The whole map does a great job of showing to now just the city but the whole area outside Paris, you can even go out into wine country, pick off some Nazi with your rifle, blow up a radar station on your way back to town and still have time to catch a burlesque at the Belle de Nuit.
<br>
<br>So lets get down to some of the MAJOR problems this game has had since day one. I haven&apos;t played this on console but the PC version has some of the buggiest graphic errors i have ever seen. If you set your resolution too high when game map over lay is all a skew and never lines up, so your forced to play the game with a lower resolution even if you have a high end rig. Also I noticed tons of shader glitches and rendering effect go wrong while playing. For instance I was inside a building during a rain storm, I took cover behind a metal crate to get off some shoots and i noticed that even tho I was inside the box had a rendering effect like water was running down the side and rain drops splashing on the top.Another thing I found is that if you own a 3rd party xbox 360 usb controller you must have it unplugged before you start the game and open your save file. what happens is when left plugged in the controls go nuts and are mapped out in some weird fashion and even without touch it you seem to spin around in place.
<br>
<br>The year this came out you would think that since its a new title and alot people did buy this on PC, they would put a patch out to address this....no of course not. EA games has a bad habit of never fixing games, and its left up to the studio who made it or some fan in the public to fix it. Since Pandemic broke up there was no help coming and reading alot of post here I see many people cant even play it. Now I spent a few weeks debugging it on my PC and smoothed over 90% of the glitches and I have windows 8. Even before going over this with a fine tooth comb the game ran from day one and I could play it fine.
<br>Sorry none of you got to work but, I see that most of you are using ATi cards...yea there is a reason why I dont buy those card. Most major studios partner with Nvidia and I use custom software and firmware with my graphics cards to have a full range of control with any program . So unless your willing to do alot of extra code work and reprogram the software when you have these problems I would shut up and buy more popular hardware.It will save you a headache and even tho people talk smack about either of the 2 brands...it doesnt matter one is a more stable and widely used format then the others so screw the techie trash talk ,go buy an EVGA and play some games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=4003282">Expand</a></span>

The perks are not easy to unlock and it is so fun to unlock them. in my opinion it is the one of the most if not THE MOST underrated game of all time. If someone hasn&apos;t checked the game yet just try it, trust me you won&apos;t regret it.</span>

For some reason, I did not have great expectations, but after the first few hours I literally fell in love with it. Artistically it is outstanding, wandering in Paris is extremely entertaining, the music choices are fantastic and the main character is charismatic.
<br>Simply put: a game hard to forget.</span>

It is set in Nazi-occupied France during WWII, and features an Irish race car driver off for some revenge in Paris after things go wrong when he and his friend decide to drive their racing rival&apos;s car off a cliff. Despite that simple premise the story is quite good, albeit clich&#xE9;d, with some funny writing and memorable characters. The campaign is also rather lengthy for a game that was essentially rushed to release by EA before they closed down Pandemic. I believe it took me 10-12 hours to beat.
<br>
<br>The game features the city of Paris as well as its countryside and a small German town. The map is quite large and has a ton of things to do. A unique graphical style was used to show the game&apos;s world, where Nazi occupied areas and districts are covered in a black and white colour palette with only the occasional yellow light from buildings or the red swastika flags of the Nazi&apos;s. As you progress through the campaign and liberate Paris, however, parts of the map will become colourful and vibrant though this is admittedly uglier than the eerily beautiful black and white, with some muddy washed out textures.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is essentially your standard open world game and borrows heavily from games like Assassin&apos;s Creed with its parkour and GTA IV with its cover shooting and driving. I really enjoyed the cover shooting combat, but I know many have complained it isn&apos;t as good as GTA IV&apos;s so it could just be me since I love most cover shooters. There are a variety of weapons unlocked through side missions that range from silenced pistols to scoped carbines and rocket launchers. Since the main character is the titular &quot;Saboteur&quot; you will also be able to blow up some Nazi radio towers and installations with dynamite.
<br>Other activities aside from combat include races, about 10 side missions, a knife throwing minigame from the free DLC, and vehicle collecting.
<br>
<br>As for flaws, there are a fair number but I didn&apos;t find any of them too serious. The climbing feels pretty stiff because to move from one handhold to the next you have to press the jump key each time, compared to Assassin&apos;s Creed where you could climb with minimal button pushing. Since the game borrows heavily from other games, it also lacks some originality and not all of the concepts it borrows from are fleshed out as good as the games they came from. Other than that, I can&apos;t think of any major flaws. I encountered no bugs or glitches playing PC as far as I remember. Also, be prepared to suffer through some awful fake French and German accents.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a wonderful open world game with a lot of charm and loads of content and one you should definitely pick up if you ever find it in the bargain bin at your local game retailer.

Apparently the developer also is no longer around and therefore no guarantee can be given that EA will be able to fix it. So if you got ATI hardware stay away till the problems are resolved. Really unfortunate was looking forward to playing it. Might get it on the PS3 in stead when the price drops.</span>

This Assassins Creed gameplay not works as good as in AC. And what about the GTA part? It&apos;s s.uck.s too. One of the best thing is that the base of the resistance is a brothel (or what the hell) full of Nazi officers. It&apos;s ridiculous. The whole story is really bad and the cinematics too. Look at the cinematic, when Luc (or whoever) plants a bomb to the side of a track in the fuel-depot mission. What was that? A joke? How could this happen? Why the Nazis didn&apos;t see a man planting a bomb about 8 meters from their fuel-depo? Were they blind or what? And the race in Germany. Pfff..... Man, that was absurd. The whole German army was there and we can easily shake them off with that racing car. Was that possible? And then the race was the joke of jokes. Look at the race in Mafia and compere it with this. In Mafia you can see a real race. And in this? It&apos;s only a joke. The first 7 racers were much faster than me. What did they do? They stopped and were waiting for me in the last corner of the 2nd lap. And then that cinematic....pfff.... But the &quot;best&quot; is the escape from Germany. That was nothing but unrealism. And look at those tanks with 2 (yes two) tank guns. Did the Nazis stole it from the Commies from Red Alert? Then our Irish says: &quot;They started a war&quot;. What? Did the developers read the history book before they made this **** Great Britain and France declared war on Germany, not reversely.

The problem with ATI card can be worked around with few tweaking and after that, the game runs fine. (Folks having issues with this game will most likely have issues with other titles.) I find this game to be one of best open world game I&apos;ve played so far. (Well next to Mafia 2, yet another under-rated title)</span>

<br>
<br>Is it doing a good job mimicking the two titles I just mentioned? It does not.
<br>Is it a good, fun game on its own? Hell yeah.
<br>While not being everyone&apos;s cup of tea, The Saboteur does some stuff right, and was enough for an enjoyable experience through most of the 26 hours I spent playing it.
<br>
<br>The Story&amp;Cast: Saboteur is taking place in France during the days of WWII. I won&apos;t spoil too much, basically you&apos;re a part of the resistance against the nazis. There&apos;s some more to it as you&apos;ll see early in the game, some personal stuff.
<br>The game also begins with a pair of boobies right at the beginning, and our story actually begins in a brothel. There&apos;s also some sexy british agent, and also a &quot;nudity&quot; setting in the options menu. All these conspire to give the game a &quot;sexy&quot; shade. But no. There&apos;s really nothing sexy about it. Just your old ordinary Nazi resistance stuff.
<br>Anyway, while the story wasn&apos;t disastrous I didn&apos;t find it too charming, with a slightly slouchy beginning to a rather mundane road, and, and better and serviceable 3rd and final act to the story, it simply wasn&apos;t the main attraction here.
<br>The script was nifty at times but the characters themselves were very &quot;dry&quot; and highly uninteresting. The voice-overs were a little annoying, even though there were good accents (british, german, french, and **** IRISH!), the acting just didn&apos;t do any good to the game, aside from the one of Sean Devlin perhaps (which is the main protagonist and currently my favorite irishman).
<br>
<br>The Gameplay: Saboteur doesn&apos;t really decide what it wants to be, and that might feel both good and bad at times. As you get into the shoes of Sean, you&apos;ll go through a rather long prologue which seemingly never ends. Why&apos;s that? Because it presents to you all of the game&apos;s concepts and aspects, and that&apos;s exactly the point where you can see that the developers may have crammed too many genres into one product, as you&apos;ll be introduced to the winning combo of The Saboteur- Racing, Parkour, Stealth, Killing. Many of your missions will include SOME elements of SOME of the big words I&apos;ve just mentioned.
<br>
<br>The Saboteur would offer you story and side missions with the usual NPCs recipe, and also the freeplay targets, which are mainly some Nazis&apos; stuff you&apos;d want to blow. Oh, and you can collect cars as well. And there are also &quot;perks&quot; which serve as some sort of achievements and would reward you, depends on the achievement (e.g. you get an awesome racing car for winning all the races, you get a certain fighting move for killing a certain number of nazis. this type of things).
<br>
<br>The Longevity: With everything mentioned above, you&apos;d get hours of gameplay. I&apos;ve completed the story with all side missions in 26 hours, and only did 31% of the freeplay targets, didn&apos;t collect all cars, didn&apos;t get all the perks as well. Now the million dollar question is whether you&apos;d want to do these things or not!
<br>
<br>The Graphics: Here comes a nice concept of The Saboteur. While the graphics themselves are nice but not top-notch, they hold a beautiful vision of France of the 2nd WW, and, large portions of the map would be black&amp;white. These portions represent areas where there&apos;s no resistance to the nazis. As you&apos;d progress through the game the b&amp;w would transition into beautiful pallet of colors. The idea is very original and was certainly nice to watch.
<br>
<br>The Soundtrack: Was quite nice, ranged from dramatic symphonic stuff in action sequences to a very fitting and easy-listening songs playing while you drive with your car through Paris. It felt like much of the music was recycled throughout the game, which is a thing I really hate when done in video games, but here it just flowed nicely.
<br>
<br>The Atmosphere: Is definitely very worthy and well done, the visuals, sounds, colors, people, scenery, everything merges perfectly into a lively noir-France, and that&apos;s one of the things which kept me going with the game.
<br>
<br>Technical **** Game&apos;s not innocent when it comes to technical bugs, the controls are clunky in a way and take some getting used to, and lots of crashing and stumbling upon walls. Also, AI gets VERY expected, and ranges inconsistently from simply stupid to horribly sharp. But, as you &apos;get&apos; the game you can get used to it all.
<br>
<br>Execution&amp;Summary: Saboteur does some nice job in many aspects of video-game creation. Too bad it fell into the trap of screaming at you ASSASSINS CREED through the screen, therefore making itself pale beside the titles it tries to copy, in a way. Unfortunately it does feel at times that there are too many ideas and concepts in this one single product, some are well done and some are half baked.
<br>Still, the atmosphere and uniqueness the game has is worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=6061414">Expand</a></span>

The parkour is slow and geriatric, the driving is stiff and far too many controls and mechanics which add unnecessary confusion.  The gun play is the only thing that works although, it is still primitive by todays standards with many bugs and issues which don&apos;t happen in modern shooters.
<br>
<br>Not to mention a lot of issues such as Nazi super soldiers with mini-guns ruin the experience that is desperately trying to live up to an authentic WW2 experience.   Back in 2009 this would have probably rated 6 or 7 since it isn&apos;t terrible, but for the modern day players who just might see this on sale or something, just be warned that this game just simply hasn&apos;t aged well and more modern shooters will have spoiled you so you&apos;ll only see the flaws that this game has.
<br>
<br>Another major issue is that the game is still unstable, prone to random crashes and quite possible to fall &apos;through&apos; the map,   I think a more modern version of this game without all the major issues and bugs could be well received though, considering all this time and the infamous map glitch has still not been fixed, and your forced to run in low resolutions for the map to work properly which leads me to believe this game is obviously a port of the Xbox 360 version and the console version is probably the better option to play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=7193420">Expand</a></span>

Do not believe the subpar ratings it got in mainstream media. The color versus noir graphics work well together and serve as a means to make the player feel epic when they liberate part of Paris. The dialogue is great and voice acting is fantastic on most counts. Two characters in particular - Sean, the main character, and a priest who has been left frustrated by the Nazi occupation. The story, while nothing new, is fun to follow and serves to encourage the player to continue quite well. Revenge tales have all been told before, but Sean is an interesting enough character and he undergoes enough growth that the story does not become stale. Gameplay is great and this is by far one of the best sandbox titles out there. As many have said, it&apos;s like a combination of GTAIV and Assassin&apos;s Creed, but that&apos;s not a bad thing. The Saboteur combines gameplay elements from both and does it well and with a lot of polish. Climbing is great and only once or twice did I feel like Sean wasn&apos;t doing what I wanted him to and driving is way better than in GTA - sometimes, ultra-realistic vehicle suspension don&apos;t equal fun (I&apos;m looking at you Rockstar). Blowing up Nazi installations at your leisure to gain contraband (the game&apos;s money) is fun in it&apos;s own right and there are plenty of weapons and alternatives to use while on your mission of destruction (including some wicked fun fictional Nazi weapons near the end). The set pieces are solid and get progressively more epic as you go with some truly fantastic gameplay moments like running through an exploding Zeplin or busting prisoners off of a moving train before it reaches the end of its trip at a bridge wired to explode. The gameplay is a mix of stealth and action with some fun minigames like racing or a duck hunt remix to break up the pacing. Graphics and character design are solid, although some optimization would help. I kind of felt that the game should have been able to run at higher settings on my lap top for the way it looked, but it wasn&apos;t too bad. There are games with far worse optimization out there. There are some bugs (the occasional floating object or Nazi) but they are rare. Sound design and the soundtrack is downright fantastic. Explosions and gunfire sound great and there&apos;s nothing like the purr of your racecar&apos;s engine as you flee from Nazi pursuers. The soundtrack is a blend of period music in English and French, many of which have been remixed or jazzed up in some way, but it&apos;s nice to drive to and the orchestral pieces for the more action packed moments serve to make them feel more epic. Overall, Saboteur is a must try for any sandbox or action fan. It&apos;s truly sad that it is Pandemic&apos;s final game as it is also the best by far. The ending alone is so simple, but so epic that it is one of the best game endings in a long time. The Saboteur is one hell of a ride and anyone looking for a solid title to fill some time should give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=743776">Expand</a></span>

As for the people who have had issue with ATI cards, they must&apos;ve fixed this somewhere along the lines, because I am running it just fine (hasn&apos;t crashed on me once yet and I&apos;ve played quite a bit) under 64-bit Win 7 and an ATI Radeon 4870X2. Maybe that and the i7 just power through the problem spots, I dunno, but I do know that I haven&apos;t noticed any issues yet, even after playing for several hours straight.

High replay value since I want to go back and get all the perks and cars to 100% this game. Only bad thing was the graphics. They seemed a little dated for a game in Q4 of 2009.</span>

So if theyd just use a little bit more time this would be one of my favorites. Also i wish there were more missions</span>

Great atmosphere, well made story and acting, recommend for anyone with some proper refined taste ;-)</span>

The story and characters are enthralling, the soundtrack is poignant, and the sense of free-roaming, which sees the player sabotaging various kinds of nazi installations, is incredibly fun, at least for the first 10-15 hours.  The graphics and the ambient design of the game is at times breathtaking, and is definitely a highlight.  Nazis assault civilians as you drive past, Zephyrs fly through the sky, nazi flags and guard towers dominate the thundering black and white skylines and once you get into the later missions you will even face off against Orwellian-styled SS flamethrower troops, tanks, and fighter planes.  If you are interested in atmospheric, historical and/or character-driven games with plenty of free-roaming, this game is for you.  The only negatives really surface after the first 15-20 hours where the novelty of the sabotaging begins to wear off, but by then you should have enough contraband to buy most of the good weapons, etc.  Compared to the free-roaming elements that have featured in games such as GTA 4, it is much better (no annoying date-calls here!).  There are also a few minor bugs (you will occasionally see the odd nazi floating through the sky) but they are rare and throughout 35-40 hours of total play I never encountered any game-wrecking bugs.  Overall, this game is by far one of the best games released in the last few years, combining a thrilling war setting with fun and atmospheric car races, wall-to-wall shootouts and exploring the city of Paris (which is wonderfully designed).  There is so much to do and see in this game that it can easily deliver over 35-40 hours of gameplay before you finish the last mission, as it did for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440676">Expand</a></span>

He&apos;s funny, clever, brazen and a total potty-mouth.  What more could you want?!  His character makes the game.  Everything else in The Saboteur is a knock-off of the Assassin&apos;s Creed and Batman games just poorly programmed.  This game is chock-full of glitches, tedious mission design and unbalanced gameplay.  The controls are sticky causing movement to be tricky when traversing and climbing buildings.  This ruins the few fun missions and races and causes a lot of frustration.  To be fair, Saboteur has some good qualities.  Aside from Devlin, the other voice actors are great and very convincing.  The music is beautiful and the sound effects / foley are excellent.  The designs of the cars and military hardware are spot on and the environments are simply stunning and life-like.  With all these good qualities they make playing Saboteur tolerable.  It&apos;s just  damn shame that the negatives are there to begin with.

Lots of action, climbing on rooftops, and killing Nazis.  You can pick from a variety of weapons and explosives to complete the missions.  The scenery in the game is also interesting and authentically Parisian; e.g., Pigalle Street, Montmarte, and the weird roads and biways.  When I played the game, I really got caught up in the plot even though Sean Devlin is somewhat transparent and the ladies are pretty, but not very entertaining. The only reason I didn&apos;t give this game a 10 was because the characters seemed to move in a jerky motion and the Sean was slow to react to the controls.  Overall, I recommend this game highly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=2309301">Expand</a></span>

It is a great game that had the potential of becoming a great franchise, hope they retake it and make a sequel. After reading some reviews and  watching some videos I decided to go out of my way of buying only games from Steam and gave it a try. Get it, deserves a chance in your collection but for what i understand first check if u don&apos;t have compatibility issues since that would be the only thing standing between you and a great production. It&apos;s not perfect but sure it&apos;s fun and a great concept.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315499">Expand</a></span>

The game can be very lighthearted sometimes, and the only real problems I see are few nasty bugs on PC version (map for example), somewhat poor character decisions sometimes and rushed ending that leaves you dissapointed. But not the game itself, I definetely wasn&apos;t dissapointed that I&apos;ve spend good 30 hours on it.</span>

<br>the game has easy controls and after a very short time you should have no problems with the layout and climbing fighting ect should be a breeze, i dont see how so many people find this game so hard, ive completed it on the 360, ps3 and pc without any such problems, finding out where you&apos;ve got to go during missions is easy thanks to the map showing you where to go and completing the missions is not about running around as fast as you can it&apos;s about stealth and avoiding the nazis, when you are trespassing you have to make sure you are not spotted so an easy tip would be to go round when not doing missions and blow up all the look out towers and anti aircraft guns though im sure most people have the common sense to do that first.
<br>
<br>overall i found the game experience very rewarding which is why i enjoyed completing it several times over, if you prefer run and gun go play call of duty where as if you like stealth games with a twist im sure you&apos;ll love the saboteur.
<br>
<br>ps AMD graphics cards no longer have any problems with the game, it was a driver problem from ATI not a game problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-saboteur/user-reviews?user_review_id=2808419">Expand</a></span>
