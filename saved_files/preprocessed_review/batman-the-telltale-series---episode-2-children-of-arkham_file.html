<br>For everyone interested in comics, and Batman especially, the game will be a refreshing experience. Bruce Wayne is the main protagonist here indeed, with Batman being more of an addition. Add an EXCELLENT plot to that and you will easily get 9/10 for Batman fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series---episode-2-children-of-arkham/user-reviews?user_review_id=6706659">Expand</a></span>

<br>Children of Arkham includes more important decisions. Some may not directly impact the story, but they do manage to make you feel like you did something. I think that we could&apos;ve had one more episode where a certain death and a certain injury didn&apos;t occur as those parts of the story felt a bit rushed. Other than that, the story is extremely engaging and really keeps you waiting to see what happens next, especially with its unique take on the Batman origin story, even if this installment is quite a bit shorter than its predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series---episode-2-children-of-arkham/user-reviews?user_review_id=6781645">Expand</a></span>
