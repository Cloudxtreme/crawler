So they are saying that if you are a gamer, they hope you die a horrible death. 1/10 Don&apos;t buy it.</span>

<br>There&apos;s walking simulators with interesting puzzles like Penumbra, that actually have tension and then there&apos;s Sunset.

<br>The game has an interesting concept, great aesthetics, and a tight scope, but it&apos;s one of the most boring and pretentious games I&apos;ve ever played, and I&apos;ve played Dear Esther.

I did like the look of the game however Game play is what matters and I took some peoples advice on wait till you&apos;re a good bit into the game like about 12 -15 days and I believe it&apos;s the worst advice. Just don&apos;t get it.</span>

<br>
<br>There simply isn&apos;t enough to do in the game. You find the objects that you can click on in the apartment, and decide to do A or B, with the knowledge that you will A: increase romance, or B: increase neutrality. For a game trying to handle political upheaval and socioeconomic injustices between classes and nations, this really isn&apos;t enough. There&apos;s a little to explore in the environment to drive the narrative deeper,and there are a few events that occur, but overall it just comes off empty.
<br>
<br>If the goal was to create an abstracted sense of isolation from real life in a penthouse stronghold, then the monologueing from the player character throws it off, being too righteous and full of revolutionary potential. Additionally, if you go the romance route, it throws this whole narrative out of whack.
<br>
<br>If the goal was to show the power of one person to make a difference, or for the individual lives of disparate groups to intertwine, then the lack of gameplay choices really suffocates this narrative. And the monologuing again has a tendency to not fit, throwing revolutionary ideals around while you post cutesy notes around.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a powerful game for about half an hour, or until the first instance of violence happens. After that, it&apos;s pretty lame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunset/user-reviews?user_review_id=6088959">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s not just that it is a walking simulator with barely any gameplay. It&apos;s not the lack of optimization that gives it a terrible framerate, either. Put that aside for a second, and consider the story that they tried to tell: a housemaid getting tangentially connected to the political turmoils of a fictional Latin American country.
<br>
<br>Wait, that&apos;s actually an interesting idea. How could that go completely wrong? Here&apos;s how: they made the protagonist a North American college student / tourist that just happens to be temporarily forced to take this job. It&apos;s like they are saying: What, a poor Latina, making insightful comments about her country&apos;s politics? Preposterous! Let&apos;s make the protagonist an enlightened &apos;murican like us, bringing culture and civilization to the ignorant cucarachas. (Let&apos;s make her black, though, we still have to meet the progressiveness quota.)
<br>
<br>Thus, not only it fails as a game, it also happens to be condescending and offensive to Latin Americans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunset/user-reviews?user_review_id=5938084">Expand</a></span>

This is not an issue of artistic execution or &quot;its mature, so one can use ones imagination more..&quot;
<br>
<br>So lets be clear about it - this game looks worse than &quot;the Sims 2&quot; in terms of proportions, detail and design.
<br>
<br>It is a rightful shame that such a great idea fails (fails in my opinion) because of the technical execution.
<br>
<br>a 8/10 for creativity - it is awesome to see novel ideas in such a saturated industry like the computer games industry
<br>but a 2/10 for execution - none of the enviroments (penthouses) feel remotely real in any aspect and rather remind me to very early computer graphics (like 90s - in terms of enviromental architecture - that is 3d modelling)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sunset/user-reviews?user_review_id=5301907">Expand</a></span>

It is not a game for thrill seekers, no doubt, BUT the atmosphere is very successful, and makes you feel distress in many times.. You&apos;re a woman living in a country in conflict. A war about to start. Soldiers break into the house. Bombs explode around you... The atmosphere in the seventies is wonderful and it have a lot of references to history, music, books, famous people... There are a really big and good job of environment and game history.
<br>It&#xB4;s a very good recommendation for the video-game lovers.
