(My favorite area is the medical bay) Dark and moody is definitely attractive, but at times, items were very difficult to identify from other scenery. Oftentimes I knew what needed to happen in a puzzle, but couldn&apos;t figure out where the part I was missing was or seemingly clicked at the wrong spot the first attempt to solve a problem. Some environment interactions are inconsistent room to room (IE, bed footlocker) and a few times a description threw me off. (&apos;Processed&apos;) The &apos;bone &apos;&apos;glue&apos;&apos; could have hinted more at its use if it were Bone &apos;&apos;Plaster&apos;&apos; or something along those lines, glue typically.. glues things solid. Thankfully most are logical. Once there is a need to backtrack near the very end, which at that point I might have just been fatigued but felt a bit contrary.
<br>
<br>It was nice to play a game that was psychologically orientated without relying on jump scares (well, some audio queues are designed that way, but thanks to the isometric perspective they are more enjoyable than uncomfortable). The text entries are well written and the VO is passable, though the actors lines give away a bit too much information in the way they are constructed. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the VAs, the delivery seemed hampered by their lines and it sounds as if lines were recorded out of context.
<br>
<br>I played through Stasis in about 10 hours with my wife; reading every text entry I could find to divulge more of the story. Sadly, towards the end I felt let down as the curtain was drawn. The climax of the story is suppose to be moving (and if it were juuuust a bit different it would be heart-wrenching), but we just sat there in disbelief. Surely there is some twist? This seems too, odd, straightforward. Is this a dream seque- nope. It has a reprieve before the final scene that is very well put pacing wise, it sets a dissonant tone, though it is immediately followed by another confusingly straightforward reveal that was plain as day. I was almost fooled mid-sentence into thinking it wasn&apos;t what I suspected with how sudden it was played.
<br>
<br>I advise you to play it, it is definitely worthwhile, it is a flawed game, but if anything the atmosphere of the first half is worth the pick up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stasis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5470004">Expand</a></span>

<br>I initially hesitated buying Stasis due to some mixed reviews, especially with the regards to the story. Don&apos;t make the same mistake. The story is top notch, the puzzles are fun and the atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous .Rich isometric graphics combined with amazing sound effects make this one of the densest games I have ever played.
<br>
<br>To think that all this has been created more or less by a single person (Chris Bischoff) is just mind boggling.

<br>
<br>The story could be a bit more original--particularly the villain. Most of the puzzles are logical, but a few I had to solve using random guesswork. One thing I liked is that you only have five or so items at any given time, making it less of a guess-fest. You probably won&apos;t have to use Google to solve this one.
<br>
<br>It was fun, but a bit of a letdown. Without spoiling anything, I suggest you keep in mind that this is first and foremost a horror story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stasis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5524542">Expand</a></span>

Yet a while later, a patch introduced a larger font, to be modified in a configuration file, an XL size that finally behaves like a normal font. Or almost (it&apos;s still rather small and hard to read.) Credit where due, the developers are active and diligent on the support, so, if you have a technical issue with the game, you still have a chance to come back to it later, like I did.
<br>
<br>The pretty pictures, unfortunately, are also terribly small. Very few developers seem to understand that the constant increase in screen resolution is not meant for smaller sprites and fonts, but for more detailed ones at a constant metric size. In the case of Stasis, it&apos;s hard enough to provoke a scare with animated pixels, it becomes a complete waste of time when one can&apos;t even distinguish that some tiny creature is rushing towards the protagonist. Can&apos;t give a more than average note for the graphics; specially if you consider that you&apos;ve already seen it all before, many times.
<br>
<br>The interface is definitely less than average. For starters, there is no hot spots key, in 2015. Who still wants to scan their entire screen with a mouse ? I, for one, don&apos;t need the aggro. Here it&apos;s worse since the large majority of hot spots can&apos;t even been interacted with. When they do seem to interact, sometimes nothing happens on the click. When something does happen, it can be very unclear. For instance, you click on a corpse and a PDA pops up, supposedly the corpse&apos;s journal, but it&apos;s very awkward. In another case, you click on a corpse and all that happens is that your inventory icon flashes briefly in another corner of the screen. Open this inventory and you might notice that a new item is in there, but since inventory items have no descriptions, you are still left wondering. In short, the interface confuses the narrative instead of helping it.
<br>
<br>The voices are good. The atmospheric sounds also, technically, but I&apos;m still wondering why I keep hearing screams and such in empty rooms and corridors. They seem out of place, random, played for thrills with no regard for environmental consistency.
<br>
<br>Finally, the story and its context are dreadfully unoriginal. I won&apos;t spoil, but you&apos;ll recognise every single aspect of Stasis from a previous game or movie if you were not born yesterday: the plot, the setting, the narrative through logs and journals, etc.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend; it&apos;s good enough for the true fan of this niche genre, not for the picky point n&apos; click player. And I still wonder why the lift goes down at least 10 floors when I press the button to go down 1 floor. Maybe just for the muzak unfunny joke...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stasis/user-reviews?user_review_id=6692569">Expand</a></span>

One thing that stops me from giving this game anything higher than an 8 is simply because some of the puzzles do not have very apparent solutions. Most of the puzzles make sense but some will leave you scratching your head and wondering how the developers even figured this would be a suitable way to go about figuring something out.

I immediately backed the project but would honestly forget about the game between the sporadic update emails. But now that Stasis has launched and is available to us all, how does it stack up?
<br>
<br>Quite well! Stasis seems to be a sort of labor of love from developer The Brotherhood, which, as far as I know, is basically just one-man-show, Chris Bischoff. Stasis is an isometric overhead adventure game, point-and-click style set in a near-future science fiction setting aboard a vast space ship, akin to the films Pandorum and Event Horizon. The story is told through interactions with survivors and numerous computers, PDAs and journals left scattered throughout the ship. The gameplay is backed up by a fantastic score by Mark Morgan (Fallout, Wasteland 2, Planescape: Torment) and chilling ambiance.
<br>
<br>The core gameplay element in Stasis is navigating the ship with the limited resources and information available to you. Challenges include using those resources to open doors, fix (or sabotage!) components of the ship and evade any various scifi/horror gooblies that may or may not be roaming its derelict halls. The dialogues with other characters are fully voiced and are quite well done, while the text is competently written and thoroughly entertaining. The version on Steam also boasts a full suite of achievements, most of which involve your character getting brutally slain by any of the many hazards and pitfalls that make up the beautiful (in a disturbingly creepy kind of way) isometric environments.
<br>
<br>Most of my gripes with Stasis come from my lack of enthusiasm for adventure games in general. It is a testament to the quality of this game that I rate is so highly and enjoyed it so much despite my feelings for the genre. I found some of the puzzles to be illogical and the solutions only came about by exhausting all available options, though my inexperience with adventure games could be contributing to my failing in that respect - adventure veterans&apos; mileage may vary. My inner RPG nerd would have appreciated multiple solutions for puzzles or various means of progressing the story, which may well exist, but I didn&apos;t detect any during my playthrough. Minor gripes, all.
<br>
<br>In closing, Stasis is a fantastic game and a steal at $19.99 for anyone even remotely interested in scifi, horror or adventure games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stasis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5451007">Expand</a></span>

<br>One point beyond stating I applaud its story, atmosphere and production value....it is not a &quot;typical&quot; point and click game as the puzzles not only require the right components but are also dependent on John&apos;s positioning. Good example is that pool cue.

The grimy decks and bulkheads of the Groomlake, recently (and suddenly) redecorated in every shade of intestinal red, are as expertly and extravagantly realized as anything you&apos;d see in a triple-A game - a phenomenal accomplishment by one-man design team, Chris Bischoff. Seriously, this is sci-fi horror at its most spectacular.
<br>The voice acting is mostly very solid, with South African bad guy Dr Malan claiming much of the slimelight, and the sound effects will keep your blood pressure dialled up to the max with ambient whispers, occasional shrieks, and WHY ARE THERE CHILDREN TALKING OUT OF THE WALLS. Music by Mark Morgan (Fallout, Planescape: Torment) is a bonus extra, the tension-setting, minor key intro sequence being my personal favourite of the mix.

The gameplay is excellent: the puzzles can be challenging but are never too hard (unlike older point &amp; click adventure games). I also really appreciate the voice acting. It kind of reminds me of Dark Souls in the sense that it&apos;s kind of weird &amp; off-beat, but it totally fits the setting. Last but not least, the writing is superb too. Reading the PDA&apos;s of the dead crew members really pulls you into the story.

<br>
<br>I think it&apos;s crucial in this kind of game to feel connected to the protagonist in order to become invested in the story, and that just didn&apos;t happen for me. I never felt as &quot;connected&quot; in this as I did in other adventure games. The voices were part of the trouble for me. Ending was disappointing for me, too, but I&apos;ll keep this spoiler free.
<br>
<br>Despite the flaws, I&apos;d love to see a second game from this team. So much promise in this debut! If the sounds, music, and dialog were as refined as the visuals, this would be one of the best adventures of the year.
<br>
<br>Recommended for fans of sci-fi, point-and-click adventures, and anyone who is tired of jump scare and hiding games that try to call themselves &quot;horror&quot; game.

<br>There is a lot of text in this game and you have to read it as it&apos;s probably the best thing about the game. The **** up stuff was pretty good, and although the general plot was rather simplistic and not that original, it&apos;s rather enjoyable. The ending wasn&apos;t the best, and kind of reminded you of the lack of polish, but the setting and atmosphere is great.
<br>
<br>Normally not really my cup of tea, but a good game overall for an indie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stasis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5557951">Expand</a></span>
