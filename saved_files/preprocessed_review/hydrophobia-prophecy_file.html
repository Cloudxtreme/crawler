I feel sorry to give this a low score because it seems there was really an effort put into making this a good product. At the very beginning of the game, it reminded me of Dreamfall, which is one of my favorite games of all times. The two games are very much different, BUT, both have adventure elements in them, but are NOT controlled with the classic point n&apos; click interface, and both are, well, rather weak in terms of gameplay. How come I&apos;ve played and enjoyed every one of my playthroughs with DF, and on this one I just waited eagerly to finish and uninstall it already?
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll start with the good, though: Hydrophobia does it nicely in the terms of setting and atmosphere. The graphics are interesting enough and the water mechanics and original engine were justly praised, and I honestly wish someone would make some more use of the HydroEngine. The soundtrack is also nice, even though it feels a little &apos;off&apos; at times, it&apos;s perfectly fine, dramatic and intense and fits the game and environment. Unfortunately, I&apos;m finding myself proceeding so fast to...
<br>
<br>The Bad: Unfortunately, not much else is done well here. I&apos;ve mentioned before a weak gameplay, and it indeed felt weak for me. The game has SOME slight puzzleadventure elements, which I think the devs should have used some more because it could potentially save the game. Instead it relies on action, which is mostly consisted of awkward platforming, clunky combat, and mundane obstacles shooting. And no matter how much medals or collectibles I&apos;ve earned (which are much appreciated, but still) I just felt I keep doing the same thing over and over again. And it wasn&apos;t a fun thing I was doing back there.
<br>I&apos;ve also mentioned the faint resemblance I felt to DF, and that both games had weak gameplay in my opinion. Yet Dreamfall relies heavily on a STORY which saves its ass and making it easily a favorite of mine. Does a game have to rely on storytelling to be a worth title? No. But it should at least tell a good one, to pull us from the, at times, horrendous gameplay. You&apos;d cover most of Hydrophobia&apos;s story on its first act (the game has 3), the rest just felt like poor excuses to run from point A to point B and do X. I really thought they were going somewhere deeper with all the mess they&apos;ve created, but no. When I realized that I was going to complete the game despite not having so much fun with it, I prayed it&apos;d at least have a good ending. It didn&apos;t. I did get to create water-pillars, which was cool. And then there was a random boss battle, which made it not cool at all.
<br>So, yeah, I got the impression this title is story-driven and found out that it wasn&apos;t really so true. There aren&apos;t many characters and the existing once don&apos;t seem to have much depth. And. They. Are. Dubbed. Irritatingly. I&apos;m so sorry. I really tried to get used to it, but at some point I just stopped noticing what our hydrophobic hero and her useless sidekick were saying.
<br>
<br>The Ugly: As I said, this is all kinda sad. Even tragic in a way. The &apos;Prophecy&apos; version is an improved one over the original Hydrophobia title, which got many complaints and bad reviews. I never tried it, only read about the process, and it seems the developers really tried and wanted to listen to the customers and give them what they want. They really tried to make massive improvements according to the feedback they received. There&apos;s even a &quot;dev feedback&quot; option where you could send them your opinion through the game! Where else have you seen such things?
<br>Still, if this is the &apos;revamped&apos; version, then, and I feel to terrible saying this, it&apos;s no wonder that Dark Energy is now defunct. I actually wish they had another chance at making some other stuff and possibly get better and make good products. But Hydrophobia Prophecy simply turned from a title which grabbed my attention and anticipation, and seemed to cool and unique, to a very big &apos;meeeh&apos;, and later into a big annoyance which I&apos;m glad is over.
<br>I might try and play this game again in a few years for old times&apos; sake, but... I doubt that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6129446">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is from a cheap B class movie, nothing complex or genius. Also the voice acting is from the same movie category. The game is also very short, which in this particular game was not a problem though&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693702">Expand</a></span>

Objectives are simple find-the-button busywork.  Platforming is shallow.  Protagonist controls poorly.  Combat is awful cover shooting against pathetic AI.  Weapons feel like ****  Narrative and characters are handled with a Call of Duty level of absurdity.</span>

Well it turns out to be quite disappointing. First, you only get to use your water ability at the very end. Before that, you just have a basic gun with multiple ammo choices but only the sonic is necessary, the rest is pretty useless. At this point the game is fun to play, but nothing original though. Story is simple but convenient and Scoot (your guide) is entertaining, though the heroin, Kate, could sometimes whine less. The water effects are nice and so is the MAVI device and the hacking system, environment designs could more original though and facial character animation is weak (all they do is move their mouths). Upon starting the third act, you get to have your power but all you can do with is move objects around, still fun though. THEN comes the big disappointment: the final boss. This part was just a pain in ***; you actually HAVE too use the electronic ammo, like some kind of E.M.P (otherwise useless for the rest of the game) and when you&apos;re done shooting at the big robot (which is powered by weak or too simple AI) you&apos;ve got to throw explosive barrels at it with your water ability but all you can hope for is actually trying to catch one while you&apos;re being shot at by other enemies... and crap: you can&apos;t aim while your ability is enabled! Worse than that, when you&apos;re finally done with the boss, if you fail to go fast enough and pursue the next events: the damn DEAD machine comes to life again and you have to start over. I really wanted to love this game but I just got too frustrated. All in all: positive are the water physics and graphics (Kate looks pretty good); average: level design, most of the gameplay and story; negative: the reason you actually bought this game for. I still gave it a 6 because the developers care for the game and have made significant updates and for the very low price (bought it for 2.50 euros on Steam).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697986">Expand</a></span>

Especially with Havok-powered physics?<br><br>Well, after the first act, it seemed to be the case that I wasn&apos;t actually getting any cool water powers at all. Then in the second act, I was like &quot;Nanobot infestation! Now I get cool powers!&quot; But no. I just got to run around taking meds. And then at the *very* end of the game I get my water powers, and all I get to do with them is throw some barrels. What a disappointment :(<br><br>What&apos;s worse than not getting superpowers? Getting 3 minutes of superpowers. You know what&apos;s worse than that? Wishing you never actually got them. Apparently I can&apos;t aim my gun and use the water power at the same time. Apparently the developers thought that &quot;4&quot; was a good button for switching between water and gun. The only thing you can do with your water powers is move objects, and doing so is awkward at best. The final (only) boss battle relies on accurate use of your brand-new powers, but all you can do is flail around hoping to grab something. Oh, did I mention people are shooting at you at the same time? Too bad you can&apos;t aim your gun. Oh wait, you can use water to throw people around right? You can *try*, but they&apos;ll probably kill you while you&apos;re trying to pick them up. Stick to your gun.<br><br>And about the gun... Your gun has infinite &quot;sonic rounds&quot; at the outset, and you really never need to use the other ammo types. The gel rounds are kind of fun, but semi-auto is useless, energy is useless, and rapid-fire you only get at the very end. The game actually forces you to use energy rounds for the boss battle. It&apos;s like the developers knew they were useless and needed some way to justify their existence.<br><br>The control is awkward at times, especially when swimming, and there&apos;s no shortage of swimming in this game. The camera is usually OK, but sometimes you can&apos;t point it where you want to look, or it&apos;ll aim in such a way that Kate completely blocks what you&apos;re trying to shoot at.<br><br>Luckily, the first two acts of the game are actually fun to play. When the acrobatic sequences work, they&apos;re really fluid. Speaking of fluids, the water effects are indeed very good. Explosive barrels are a mainstay of any game with guns, and by god they&apos;re everywhere. On a boat. I don&apos;t know why. Scoot&apos;s dialog is well-written and entertaining. Kate isn&apos;t a stereotypical heroine (though sometimes whinier than she needs to be) .The MAVI device is fun, and the hacking sequences are novel. The story is simple, but it works, and the villians are neo-Malthusians which isn&apos;t exactly standard fare. Almost all the problems with this game are in the third act. Scoot isn&apos;t there, the level design is suddenly more trite, and most of all you get useless water powers. Unfortunately, this is how you end the game, so it doesn&apos;t leave you feeling very satisfied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697776">Expand</a></span>

In ever other aspect, it is mediocre to poor. Platforming and combat are artificially difficult due to poor controls and camera angles, and there are a host of bugs, such as enemies spawning right on you when you load a checkpoint.  The game is extremely repetitive, shooting the same enemies and collecting the same keys ad nauseum. You also don&apos;t &quot;control water&quot;, one of the game&apos;s selling points, until the last half of the final act, which is about 20 minutes from the end.  Oh, that reminds me.. Hydrophobia is only 2 hours long.  I can overlook a lot considering the price is currently only $5, but if I had paid the original price, I would be pretty angry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578620">Expand</a></span>

The story and setting are really original and interesting, the graphics are good, the gameplay is good, the level design is pretty decent. This is the least frustrating and most rewarding game I&apos;ve played in the last 4 months. At $12 on steam, this is a really safe buy.</span>

The controls are unresponsive and cumbersome; at one point, I solved a puzzle on accident because the action bindings are so ambiguous that my attempt to do something completely different caused me to perform the correct action.  The camera control is equally cumbersome; an early jump puzzle forced me to reload because the camera swung 180 degrees without warning, causing me to leap to my death instead of to safety.  The voice acting is awful; the main character can&apos;t seem to decide what sort of accent she has, being vaguely Irish most of the time but dancing through Scottist and various flavors of American and Australian, and sounding like a shrieking harpy the whole time to boot.  Scoot is a bland stock character, no more and no less.  The setting is actually pretty neat, and most of the time I spent playing was to dig up more details on the Queen of the World and the Population Flood.  The villains detract from this severely, as they are too cartoonishly evil to be taken seriously;. To whit, the game&apos;s setting is struggling with feeding a severely overpopulated earth. The game takes place on the eve of the unveiling a new technology that could feed the masses, ending the crisis.  The villains of the story want to use that technology to kill off the masses, as an extreme way to end the crisis--that just letting the technology work properly would also accomplish, minus about six billions deaths.  In summation, I bought this game on sale for about two dollars, and feel that I didn&apos;t get my money&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2331559">Expand</a></span>

As 90% of games these days are run and shoot affairs, the different approach to gameplay feels innovative. Special mention of course to the visuals, the elements (fire, water) effects really are amazing and there&apos;s lots of great ideas floating (ha!) around that make the game well worth checking out.</span>

I paid $12 for this game on steam last night. I played it for roughly 2.5 hours and beat it.  It has 3 acts, and your help gets wrote out in the 2nd suddenly with no word from him again other than &quot;they&apos;re here&quot; or something to that effect.  The camera controls are a pain, the swimming controls are horrible.  The water effects are awesome but that&apos;s just it, it feels like 75% of the production budget went into the water engine and 25% went into everything else.  Save yourself the headache and problems and just pass this one up.  Oh, for those of you who have already bought the game... the final boss uses wall hacks.  I think a 3 out of 10 is generous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1635563">Expand</a></span>

The water physics are an absolute blast, and the combat is very satisfying, even if it isn&apos;t quite up to Gears and Uncharted. The pace of the game is good too, every time I started to wonder if I have to do that same task again, the game throws a curve ball and introduces a new element. I also love that when the game starts it gives you the option of having objectives marked on your natural HUD, or your mini computer(MAVI). I love exploring, but I can check the MAVI and see where exactly I&apos;m supposed to be going too; great for that immersed feeling! The bottom line is that I had FUN playing this. I didn&apos;t feel like it was too easy or difficult on normal. It reminded me what playing a video game is all about. My only other note is that if you&apos;re expecting this to match and beat a full major game like Uncharted, it won&apos;t. It&apos;s a very fun game, but it is not perfect, and it&apos;s silly to expect it to be. So grab 12$ and enjoy! It&apos;s more than worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1615393">Expand</a></span>

In my watery grave. It was so different that it will propably be in my memories for a while. I liked that you don&apos;t just go from battle to battle from the start. I&apos;d like to call it an adventure rather than action. Maybe I even call it an experience. I liked the exploring, the good looks and even the action. Cover-system was greatly done. There were some complications now and then when shooting behind the crate or whatever.. There were nice moves and I thought that it compares well to mass effect 2 cover-system. It felt sometimes even better. Controls were good. I played on PC, but I used xbox-controller. Rumble was not done good. If I get a load of water suddenly in my face from a hull breach.. I want to feel it. =) Story was a bit hazy. &quot;I&apos;m waking up and now the ship is falling apart. &quot; I would have also liked to see more floating corpses. Enemies were decent bunch of masked bastards but they should have reacted better to my bullets. &quot;come on, how can you be still alive, I just shot a full machinegun clip in you&quot; So my weapon of choice was the common pistol and heatshot. And gel-rounds were useful. Final boss was a chore and I felt the game just ended. Well, I liked the music in the credits. All in all it was fun, different game. Some shortcomings but I was suprised that it really made such an impression.

The graphics are nice and the setting is nicely done. The controls are a bit quirky, but not overly so. The voice acting isn&apos;t stellar, but it&apos;s above average. The hacking system is very cool. All the ingredients are there. But what ruins it is cut-scene hell. You can&apos;t take two steps without the game yanking control out of your hands to dump you into yet another damn cut-scene. It completely wrecks the immersion. For all the visuals and the occasional puzzle, this game end up amounting to nothing more than running from one cut-scene to another while avoiding obstacles. There are better and more clever ways to tell a story in a game than to turn it into a movie that&apos;s interrupted by brief bouts of running along a completely linear path. By the way, you CAN skip the cut-scenes, but they&apos;re about 90% of the game content, so you won&apos;t have a clue why you&apos;re doing what you&apos;re doing if you skip them. Granted, the game is so linear that you actually can play it without having a clue as to why any of it is happening, but what&apos;s the point? So, if you can stand just sitting back while the game plays itself and occasionally being allowed to run the character from point A to point B, you might enjoy this for the view. It is pretty. But if you prefer to play a game yourself and actually have choices in what happens, you&apos;ll be disappointed in this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2014762">Expand</a></span>

You get to kill your first bad guy in level 2  and you get to manipulate water for the first time at the end of level 3. The camera is terrible, i&apos;d constantly find myself struggling to keep the camer above or below water. The controls for climbing are a bit awkward. The story started out decent and was being told well but then it ends all of a sudden with no real conclusion to what happens on the ship or to the people you met along the way. Sometimes you&apos;ll jump.move in a direction you didn&apos;t want to because the game just decided that was a better idea for you. Swimming is very very annoying; if you&apos;re in shallow water the game may let you dive or may not. Some of the collectible are glitched which will make you have to restart your game if you want to collect them all. Overall the game started off well, the graphics and water physics are awesome but once you start playing you come across the many glitches and it just becomes very frustrating at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321815">Expand</a></span>

Do you love to develop a character, or be able to explore everything, to feel challenged, or do you love a good story? Or do you play a game based solely off the graphics? If you love graphics then I think you will find this game very engaging. Don&apos;t be fooled by the users who have only reviewed this one game.  This game is a sad excuse for gameplay.
<br>
<br>Hydrophobia reminds me of crappy games from 1994. You see, CD-ROMS were just getting traction and finding their way into everyone&apos;s home PC&apos;s. CD&apos;s gave a lot more space than most games could have filled just a year or two before. So developers began producing games that were movies. You would do a few interactive things, but for the most part you watched a movie on your awesome new CD-ROM device. This is the route Dark Energy Digital took when making this game a mere 17 years after the wave of interactive CD&apos;s flooded game stores.
<br>
<br>Was it that they didn&apos;t really have a game or that they had a great cinematics department and no level designers? We&apos;ll never know. The game plays out like this: A strange cut-scene that doesn&apos;t explain anything. Then you find your character in her room, you walk 2 steps to a table, then another cut-scene. You walk two steps to the door, then another cut-scene. You walk 2 steps to the elevator, then another cut-scene. You take a few steps to get out the elevator, then another cut-scene. Does that sound like fun to you?
<br>
<br>Steam has me clocked in at 1 hour of play time. The only reason I endured that long was a friend was with me and we were laughing at just how bad this game really was. I think if there was a bit more game to play and less movie I could have given it a 6 or 7.
<br>
<br>To put it another way: If your in 1st grade and draw a picture of stick figures with crayons; you&apos;re teacher would give you an A+ and tell you to take it home to mom to hang on the fridge. If, however, 17 years later you passed a similar picture to your college art teacher; you would get an F and no amount of fake reviews from your friends could hide the dismal work you tried to pawn off as legitimate effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3725875">Expand</a></span>

We see glimpses of a dark futuristic world amok with terrorists, but none of it seems related to the immediate tasks of jump, climb, shoot. On the plus side, the water and other visuals are very pretty. The artists did their jobs well. But it feels less like playing a video game, and more like watching a futuristic remake of the Poseidon Adventure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2837060">Expand</a></span>

This is perhaps the games best aspect.The Hydro-manipulation powers turn up a little late in the game but are still fun to play with and bring a refreshing new way of taking out enemies The rest of the game is fairly average,  a few jumping puzzles, some baddies to dispatch. A solid cover system allowing you to round corners, switch sides at doorways and to hang on to floating debris and use it as cover too.
<br>
<br>The different types of ammo were interesting until you realise that your unlimited stun rounds are all you need for the majority of the game
<br>
<br>All told this is a solid all round game, with nothing particularly special (except the water which is awesome) Definitely worth a go!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2814456">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>In few words, very good game. Graphics is very good, game has the best water effects i&apos;ve ever seen, play is smooth and storyline is just nice, maybe the last minutes when you get &apos;nano-powers&apos; are short and lacks punch. Despite some minor camera bugs and low AI of opponents, game is very enjoyable and better than most today games. This game is surely worth it&apos;s price.</span>

Not at all like many of the poor reviews.<br>The controls were NOT hard like some said, very basic for this type of game. If you have played Tomb Raider you will be at home with Hydrophobia. In fact the controls in the water add to a truly hydrophobic feeling.  The water and fire was awesome on my GTX560 and very smooth. It&apos;s a fun little game for the money. I personally own over 120 games and this is a decent game and not even close to being a bad game. The only things I would change. 1.Light Bloom is a bit too much. 2. There is some sort of fog or haze with the graphics and not clear. 3. Too many cut scenes for my personal gaming taste.<br><br>I can&apos;t complain for the $3 dollars I paid, but it&apos;s worth $10 easy. Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is. I gave it a 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1688801">Expand</a></span>

The game design, plot and the protagonist are all very likeable. The whole idea of water being a focal point of the game is enthralling, as we live in a day and age where water is commonly discussed and how to prolong the water supplies we have. These elements of the game drew me in before I actually even bought the game and were the most appealing parts of the game for me.<br><br>The actual game itself, while short was very fun and challenging. The fact that the game has a variation  of difficulties inside the stock-standard easy, medium and hard made the game accessible for casual (like myself) to extreme gamers. The main thing that let me down was the actual combat of the game. I don&apos;t know whether it was my doing but I found it hard to aim, the gun seemed hard to use with constant ammo changes for a variety of situations and new fighting system in the final act of the game seemed buggy. The final boss fight was a real letdown for me and the ending just ... wasn&apos;t really an ending.<br><br>I don&apos;t play a lot of FPS but this game has defiantly rekindled my interest in the whole platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1692750">Expand</a></span>

The game has water physics, REAL FOR SERIOUS water physics, and it gets really awesome once you gain the ability to manipulate the water. For about 10 minutes. The game is unbelievable short, almost insultingly so. I finished it in 2 hours. The game could have been great if they actually made it last for longer than a movie.</span>

Through this screen you can see hidden messages on the walls, hack control panels, and access the facility security cameras.<br><br>-The ability to manipulate water with your mind and use it as a weapon.  It looks somewhat similar to water bending from Avatar: The Last Airbender.<br><br>-Your gun has a stun mode that can be used to knock out your enemies, or to kill them with repeated blows.  This is useful, since it has infinite ammo, unlike the other weapons in the game.<br><br>-&quot;Gel&quot; rounds that you can fire at a wall, and when they stick, you can detonate them when you like.<br><br>The gameplay feels like a mix between Mass Effect, where you can take cover and shoot at your enemies, and a classic 3D platformer, where you can jump, climb, etc.  There&apos;s also a bit of puzzle solving as well.  To add to it, collectible items and readable documents are scattered about, and completionist gamers will love searching for them.    Cons to this game include:<br><br>-The voice acting ranges from good, to so- so, to laughable.<br>-It&apos;s short (but at least it&apos;s not expensive).<br>-The water abilities are not presented to you early enough in the game for you to have time to enjoy them.<br>-The plot can be hard to follow at times (though still rather enjoyable)<br><br>I HIGHLY recommend this game if you can get it on sale at Steam.

Dont think i&apos;ve evet seen water as good,it sweps stuff arind and you can really feel the flow,sometimes you feel as though you&apos;re fighting agaibst the current,but i loved that! the water powers and the end boss were cool,just hope that if they make another hydrophobia thete are more water powers,you also get the water powers late on but i think it was how the story fits it in maybe?
<br>
<br>i hear that this is coming out on psn sometime soon,wil prob buy it to play it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1818257">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Although the game is relatively short and the storyline is not too complex, it deserves a 7/10 IMHO.
<br>
<br>I would definitely recommend it.</span>

Sadly they decided to include a terrible shooter element to the game. Overall it is a decent experience for a few hours. Nothing to brag about.</span>

At under three hours, it&apos;s one of the shortest commercial releases I know of. It&apos;s a third-person shooter with a bit of Uncharted-style climbing, a hacking minigame, and a surprise gameplay twist near the end I won&apos;t spoil here, simply because it comes literally out of nowhere. I bought the game about three years ago and never touched it before today, but it proved a satisfying diversion. Hydrophobia is most notable for its water physics- player character Kate Wilson, a systems engineer, is aboard a massive oceangoing vessel in the midst of a terrorist attack, and nearly every area is at least partially flooded. This can be used to the player&apos;s advantage, triggering bulkhead breaches to toss enemies about in addition to the more genre-standard exploding barrels and exposed electrical currents. The swimming controls are competent and you have a generous oxygen meter, although the camera can be disorienting. Uniquely, you can grab objects such as crates while underwater and use them as portable cover. You have only one gun, a pistol, but it can be used with five different ammunition types, including remote-trigger grenades. Hydrophobia succeeds better as an entire game about water levels then most games do in a single segment, and on that merit alone I can recommend it. It seems this title was the first episode of a series, but the developer has since closed without further episodes being made and this title ends on an extremely abrupt cliffhanger. If that doesn&apos;t bother you however, Hydrophobia will make for an enjoyable afternoon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507837">Expand</a></span>

It may have been my computer, but the graphics were fuzzy to the point that I couldn&apos;t see the written directions.  It was hard to switch between weapons, and the weapons were meager at best.  On the plus side,  the story was interesting and some of the gimics like the MAVI were pretty neat.</span>

Some of the most enjoyable skills though don&apos;t unlock until the final act and you get little opportunities to explore it. Story is average and the game abruptly ends after no real closure of the build up. Worth a look considering the very cheap price it can be found for.</span>

<br>
<br>And then the water and puzzles hits. At first I tried to use only &quot;Mavi&quot; without waypoint help. But that quickly became annoying. Let alone &quot;explore&quot; mode, you can&apos;t even find your way WITH waypoint help. There are some pipes or roads that looks like usable, but not, actually. Or you need to use very weird ways to clear your way. Like shooting electricity cables with gun, instead cutting the power down. Normally I&apos;m open to all kind of realistic and creative gameplay, I even though of that exact thing on previous games I played but with Hydrophobia the game doesn&apos;t give you an idea. It&apos;s completely unexpected. Another example would be glass, lately discovered only exit out of a place, not breaking with multiple shots without finding out on YouTube, your &quot;sonic&quot; gun actually powers up when you keep pressing fire. On PC, controls are a mess. Water use is a good idea but you&apos;re really drowned to it. Moving in water around debris is incredibly hard, underwater moving is very difficult, some parts are very weird places that requires you to go underwater, stay on water, fight, find stuff without even A proper place to stand/cover. There are parts that enemies are coming at you from 360 degrees, you find little to cover, end they never end. Since finding your way is very hard, you&apos;re gonna need to do that in combat. Both trying to stay alive and finding a good place to figure things out. &quot;Mavi&quot; use is also sometimes pushing too much. Sure, it&apos;s an interesting addition but it&apos;s use is painful.  After game&apos;s actual start, the story pushed too far behind. Game is like a Crysis 2 start, with no end. I wish we had a bit more &quot;general environment play-time&quot;. Sure the game&apos;s name is &quot;Hydro&quot;phobia, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t get a decent peak to a futuristic world. In this sense I think you find  Deus Ex: Human Revolution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2764651">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not necessarily a bad game, but it&apos;s not worth playing if you aren&apos;t going to buy it for the water effects/physics. If you are okay with a tech demo, then consider getting it.
<br>
<br>Hydrophobia: Prophecy was developed by an indie company, so straight away you know that it won&apos;t easily compete with the best TPS games out there.
<br>
<br>If I had to compare the entire game to other games, I would say that they took the climbing mechanics from Tomb Raider/Uncharted and made the sinking ship level from &quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot; into a game.
<br>
<br>The game was made for almost no other reason than to show off the engine. It has dynamic water with physics that are incredible. You can shoot out windows to flood rooms even more and the water can either help you in combat or it will just make things more difficult. Unfortunately the game is short and doesn&apos;t really speed up. The game is apparently the first in a series, but when you are playing a 4 year old game, you know that there won&apos;t be a sequel any time soon.
<br>
<br>The gameplay would be far too unacceptable if it weren&apos;t for the water mechanics. It&apos;s essentially a corridoor shooter with an upturned bucket of water over it. Most of the time you&apos;ll die because you didn&apos;t know what the game wanted you to do. The waypoints and tips from your work partner who is known as &quot;Scoot&quot; are overdone as they literally tell you how to get through each section of the game. The character development is so weak that it shouldn&apos;t have even existed.
<br>
<br>The controls are okay most of the time, but the camera does not want to go under the water, so it really limits how far you can look up or down, which is really annoying when there are 3 metre waves flying everywhere.
<br>
<br>The story is just a lame excuse for a giant city on a boat to start sinking. Basically a bunch of terrorists claim that in order to save the world, they need to kill everybody on board. The story is weak as anything I&apos;m afraid.
<br>
<br>The water is definitely the main focus of the game, as waves crash against you and send crates floating in all directions. I especially love it when you open a door and the water from the room you were in slowly seeps through. The water can appear almost gel-like at times, but since it was an innovation that literally tested the water (heheh), I can forgive it.
<br>
<br>This game could have shown how water can really change up the gameplay of a game, but unfortunately, they didn&apos;t make the mechanics good enough for it. The potential was there, but the presentation was sub-par.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, no other games used this engine and other engines are starting to produce better effects, which is making this game even more obsolete and mediocre. Some things just don&apos;t get better with age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5369878">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is awful, the characters extremely one dimensional and voice acting is so bad that it makes me wanna stab my ear canals with a knife. The fact that main protagonist Kate is so god damn irritating doesnt help anything either. End boss fight and ending itself is quite pathetic too. And the pacing in the game is horrible aswell.
<br>
<br>Camera on mouse and keyboard is very unrefined and buggy, shooting mechanics cover just the basics, lots of deaths from game&apos;s poor controls.
<br>
<br>Only redeeming factor i can see is that Hydrophobia isnt the worst thing out there, but even then theres no way i reccomend this anyone, unless youre really into bad game for some reason.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=6944797">Expand</a></span>

Un peu de piratage de portes avec un syst&#xE8;me assez bien pens&#xE9; qui utilise pleinement le pad 360 (fortement conseill&#xE9; d&apos;ailleurs...) et un peu de plate-forme avec une maniabilit&#xE9; toute unchartienne (pas forc&#xE9;ment un compliment), de m&#xEA;me que la couverture classique lors des phases de combat (plut&#xF4;t mou) pour un jeu &#xE0; la troisi&#xE8;me personne.
<br>
<br>Tout cela est plut&#xF4;t bien &#xE9;quilibr&#xE9; avec un petit peu d&apos;exploration mais pas trop puisque l&apos;environnement de salles et couloirs tend h&#xE9;las &#xE0; se r&#xE9;p&#xE9;ter en raison d&apos;allers-retours incessants. Si le d&#xE9;marrage est lent, la suite se d&#xE9;roule dans une tension manifeste quand on doit nager en apn&#xE9;e (souvent) d&apos;un endroit &#xE0; l&apos;autre... ce qui nous am&#xE8;ne &#xE0; la gestion de l&apos;eau tr&#xE8;s r&#xE9;ussie dans Hydrophobia, belle et r&#xE9;aliste.
<br>
<br>Les voix (en anglais seulement) sont correctes mais les sous-titres fran&#xE7;ais ne sont pas exempts d&apos;erreurs ici et l&#xE0;. La musique minimaliste pour ne pas dire absente sauf &#xE0; quelques moments cl&#xE9;s n&apos;appelle pas de commentaire particulier. Dans l&apos;ensemble, le jeu est assez beau avec un certain cachet.
<br>
<br>On ne s&apos;y ennuie pas mais Hydrophobia reste court (une bonne poign&#xE9;e d&apos;heures tout au plus) et le plus gros d&#xE9;faut d&apos;Hydromachin c&apos;est surtout ce boss de fin grotesque en d&#xE9;calage avec le reste du jeu : du grand guignol qui impose de g&#xE9;rer une certaine habilet&#xE9; du personnage qui s&apos;av&#xE8;re... ing&#xE9;rable.

<br>Podr&#xED;an haber aprovechado de un mont&#xF3;n de maneras el agua, pero en ning&#xFA;n momento te sientes impotente frente a ella, lo &#xFA;nico que sientes es que es muy chula, y que probablemente sea el agua que mejor fluya en ning&#xFA;n videojuego, pero quitando eso...
<br>
<br>La historia es interesante, pero est&#xE1; contada de la peor manera posible, quitando todo inter&#xE9;s en saber sobre ella.
<br>
<br>La mezcla de plataformas y shooter est&#xE1; muy mal hecha, parecen dos juegos distintos, por no decir que ambos son bastante repetitivos y no aprovechan para nada sus posibilidades.
<br>
<br>Un juego que sin duda podr&#xED;a haber sido mucho mas de lo que es, y que por el final tan brusco que tiene, deduzco que tuvieron problemas con el desarrollo del juego. Aun as&#xED;, considero que es un juego bastante malo, y no puedo recomendar su compra para nada.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hydrophobia-prophecy/user-reviews?user_review_id=7082571">Expand</a></span>
