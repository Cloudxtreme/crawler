I would like to confirm it. I disabled internet, started steam offline and then U-play popped up and asked me if I wish to start off-line. I did this and I was able to load my previous game in offline mode. The only difference, which I spotted is the ability to play multiplay -which kind of makes sense, if you don&apos;t have internet, why do you need multiplayer. Now to the core; Music is fantastic, and graphics are beautiful for a 3 year-old engine. I haven&apos;t encountered any game breaking issues or bugs yet. The environment is stunning and beautiful -wish Anno 2070 had this cheerful colors. Single player is easy at start, but then picks up. Game concept is involved and mechanics well thought. If you like builder kind of games, you will like it. Else, it&apos;s a pass. To conclude, I give -1, because it took Ubi 3 years to disable DRM and -1 because Ubisoft didn&apos;t listen to the Settlers community at start with DRM. Anyway, it&apos;s now official the game is playable and it&apos;s great fun too!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2979755">Expand</a></span>

The game requires strategy in order to succeed: you must build up various supply lines of manufactured goods via conquering and collecting resources from various strategic points.  There is also a well thought-out technology tree that requires a well-thought out plan.</span>

While nicely polished and offering a fair amount of customisability, it lackis the depth and lasting appeal of earlier games in the series. And thanks to the ridiculous DRM scheme, I have been unable to play it on the weekends on several occasions..</span>

I&apos;ve seen about every type of DRM in the last 20 years, and this is a step too far, even though I have a perfectly stable connection and it probably wouldn&apos;t affect me. Sorry Ubi, it&apos;s a matter of principle.</span>

The fact that gold is not circulating into the economy is nice as it saves you alot of the usually involved micromanagment. The big bummer for me was the DRM. The game stops if you lose internet connection! Seriously, If I knew that before I bought the game I would have used my money on DA origin expansion. I should be able to play my single player games when I want, however I want and while connected or not. Such a shame seeing a good game with this stupid limitation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=747024">Expand</a></span>

This game is nothing like the Settlers series that came before it and has destroyed the franchise in my opinion.  Whatever you may have loved about the Settlers, is all gone.  Whats left is a cartoony impersonation without any real strategy.  If it weren&apos;t for some quality work on the graphics side, I would give this game a zero.</span>

They&apos;re really Settlers 3-4 alike and I take the look of Settlers 7 over two previous ones.
<br>But sadly the looks aren&apos;t everything. DRM aside. The game is resource hungry and tends to overheat my GPU for no reason and very often I suffered serious FPS drops (from 60+ to 5). And the good overall art direction for the most of time is barely visible outside of cut-scenes. Most of the time you play on the smallest zoom, which is FAR away from the ground. So far, that every single building looks exactly the same and every single settler looks the same. The developer was aware of that and implemented small goods icons above the settlers, so you can see what exactly is happening in your settlement. Also, the initial charm of Settlers 7&apos;s looks is ruined by animation. They have too much frames and every movement seems like put into x2 speed (on x1). The issue is extremely glaring on soldiers&apos; animations. The world is also too sterile. Remember wildlife, dogs, cats and chicken in Settlers 6, settlers wandering around the town, etc? You will find none of that in Settlers 7. Say goodbye to different architecture (already limited in Settlers 6) - everything is the same in Paths to a Kingdom.
<br>But the above is just a nitpicking, really. The real problem lies in the gameplay. It&apos;s awfully stale and ultimately boring. It&apos;s even more simplistic than Settlers 1. There are production chains, but they don&apos;t come out of 2 levels. Settlers don&apos;t have any needs other than food (which is partially optional). And the worst of all - the building itself is extremely limited. You can&apos;t rebuild the main routes (as you are able in Settlers 6), every structure needs a road which placement is extremely limited, you can&apos;t even build walls. Their placement is predetermined. I bet you hated control zones in the previous Settlers game. Well, it&apos;s worse in Settlers 7. The outposts are prebuilt and you can only order your armies to attack/retreat. They&apos;re limited to roads (it&apos;s even bigger limitation than Settlers 2!). All maps are boring and even quest zones don&apos;t change anything. It&apos;s all about send quantity X of resource Y or kill some bandits. Settlers 7 have technology trees, but every single technology = % bonuses for your soldiers and structures.
<br>I guess the sandbox where you can put together your headquaters is nice...
<br>Other than that, you&apos;re better off with the original 2-4 Settlers and even Settlers 6. It&apos;s better than the 5th game, but that&apos;s not saying much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6291121">Expand</a></span>

There still some improvements that can be done in the graphical (some blurryness problem) and performance level (its heavy even with a super overclocked gtx285). The economy is very good but i would like some tune up to make it more real (like everybody must eat. and a sword , a armor and a gold coin to make a swordsman, like the good old days) The military is good but can be better (no soldiers promotions :(( ) . The game as return to its origins in a way, but as extended further in onothers, like the trade and researh. Overall the game is very good, as good now as settlers II was in its time or even better. So if you want to play a real setlers since 1996 try this one. I will rate the DRM because i have not encontered any problem with that sp far, but i understand that could be a problem to some who do not have a good internet connection. I will give it 93/100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=747107">Expand</a></span>

I was appalled at spore for limiting you to 5 installs, but this goes one step further in ridiculous attempts to prevent piracy.  Software publishers need to learn from companies like Stardock with their success on Sins of a Solar Empire.</span>

Settlers 7 is an improvement and gameplay is a little retrospective towards its old style and also with some nice new touches and personalization. However, there is a beast of a problem underlying in this game which many gamers will use as an excuse (and probably a justifiable one) not to buy this game, and that is it&apos;s DRM. Whilst not as bad as other Ubi games that use this, forcing the user to be online 100% whilst you are on the game isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s cuppa tea, but at least with Settlers 7, if you do lose your connection it will attempt to reconnect for a short time. So, if your internet goes down due to a spike or some other reason, at least it will attempt to get you back in the game, whereas other games using this platform will just boot you off the game and won&apos;t even attempt to save where you were. I would have scored the game a 9 but for it&apos;s poor DRM system (my opinion), and I haven&apos;t written much about the game and its play, but you can get a good idea from the official reviews around the internet, they all pretty much agree that the game itself has high production values and has been released in a stable version at release with not too many bugs or technical issues - which for a new release on PC these days, is saying something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=746980">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, in today&apos;s world it is coming common place to only be able to buy or activate software online, and that is not just for games.  Personally, I find Steam very convenient as I work off of four different computers and every once in a while I misplace an old game CD I wanted to play, that means I have to pirate something I own which is frustrating stupid and time consuming.  Whereas if the game is on steam I can just pull it up and install.  And then I am done.  Simple!  Settlers 7 is the best Settlers since 4 in my opinion.  Although I still like 4 the best it just seemed to look nice and had so much freedom.  Although it was very buggy.  But it had the coolest of stories.  Final Note Settlers 5 was unplayable in my opinion it just seemed like another RTS.  And Settlers 6 was okay but just to repetitive A went to B then AB went to C then ABC went to D ...  I was just always annoyed by it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=1603237">Expand</a></span>

I believed I was in store for a dynamic economic/military kingdom builder, but what I got was repetitive and narrow game play (tedious micromanagement can still be narrow). I was able to put in 5 hours before being so bored that I may never boot the game up again. 5 hours 5 score. The meat of my problem was in world layout, warfare, and victory. The nature of each level and the layout was redundant, and provided for pretty much the same game every level. Then there was the disappointing game component of &quot;neutral&quot; regions. If I have an army and they don&apos;t, I say sucks to their neutrality.
<br>
<br>In warfare I was disappointed in defense and offense. Defense, I wanted to have better control of towers and walls. Maybe this became available deeper in the game, I may never know. Offense was even more of a joke. There was ever only one way to attack a region, the horrible bottlenecks, and there was no command and control other the retreat.
<br>
<br>Finally the most important aspect of any game, achieving victory. I understand that they wanted to allow for different modes of ending levels, using economy, military, or trade, but it always felt as though my conquest was incomplete. The Victory Point system was a cheap out for the developers. The enemy, or myself,  would suddenly be defeated because one held more regions, and had a higher prestige, never having to directly challenge the opponent on the field. Silly. High points of the game was that citizens were very intuitive and got their work done. Nice variety to the economy.
<br>
<br>There were many other problems outside the scope of this short review. sigh...
<br>
<br>When will someone let me build a real Kingdom!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=1643026">Expand</a></span>

<br>so depending on how close the warehouse is to your say wheat farm the less time the farmer has to walk and can spend more time making wheat, since there are so many people giving bad reviews on DRM that i had no problem with i give a 10 but it should get an 8.5</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2712086">Expand</a></span>

It earns a fair 7-8 for the game itself, but loses 2-4 points due to the DRM depending on how strongly one feels about it. Therefore, it gets a firm 6 from me.</span>

The graphics are great, same goes for the gameplay and music. In truth I think the factor that had the greatest effect on me was the raw nostalgia. This is the closest the settlers series has ever come to returning to the modal set by settlers 2 (one of my faveroit games of all time). On the downside the games story is absolute garbage (perhaps it was meant to be this way, Some of the scenes are so bad that they are infact funny). Also at time the game can be become tedious and boring (Such as sitting around waiting for trees to grow so you can collect more wood). Many people have complained about the DRM but I myself have found no issues with the product. Anyone who does not think that piracy is an issue is living a blinded existance, Ubisoft has the right to protect their product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=1378426">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Essentially, it&apos;s a good enough game. It has its supply chains, an extremely basic combat (Don&apos;t buy this if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after), and even technologies for you to advance your town. All of this in and of itself makes for exactly what I wanted.
<br>
<br>I played the entire game through to completion and abandoned it forever. Here&apos;s why: for some reason, I can&apos;t picture anybody finding a workaround for this, the games last HOURS of your time. Even basic campaigns. If the mission is to simply eliminate somebody, you have to first get X then Y to build X then N and G to manufacture Y and then T and Z to build G. When you do finally memorize the seemingly endless supply chain just to build the end products, it still takes hours of your time to set it all up. (I should add, this is at maximum speed. There&apos;s no issue about me playing it at low speed. The first thing I did in this game is find how to speed it up.)
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re playing through this and want easy wins, the way to do it is through the trade system. Make sure you secure your spots on the map for easy profit and commodities you yourself don&apos;t want to spend the time setting up.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving this a 6 if you&apos;re seriously into these games, which I am. If you don&apos;t have titanic levels of patience for the mere act of playing through a mission and don&apos;t have the time to learn all the supply chains, this game can easily be listed as a 1/10.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not done with the Settlers franchise. One of the very earlier ones seems to have a lot of people&apos;s interest and that&apos;s what I&apos;ll be buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=3116554">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics were hugely improved, the story hit just about every cliche as fast as Lara Croft empties a magazine and the gameplay sucked. The UI/UX was non intuitive and the whole thing was dumbed down to try and make it more attractive. Massive fail.
<br>
<br>I could possibly tolerate DRM if the game was absolutely amazing but with this pile of s**te I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t waste my money and got improved playability for it. Not that I played much. 30 minutes and it ended up in the trashcan to hell.
<br>
<br>Good riddance
<br>
<br>Good quality games are worth paying for  Good publishers inspire loyalty by fans  and reap the rewards. I pay for great games.

The logistic is broken, everything being centered on the warehouse. The industrial chains are extremly limited. And I encountered so many gameplay random problems I think the creators knew they were doing a bad game. We are far from the previous Settlers games </span>

<br>
<br>Story and characters are simple but quite fine, even enjoyable - for a game thats not concentrating on story.

<br>When I think bad story, I think Guild wars 2. The story and plot is huge. but done very poorly, particularly the expansion heart of thorns. Its really really really bad. The likes I&apos;ve really never seen in the history of my 23 years of gaming. Its my crown example of a bad story.
<br>
<br>At the moment, there is no better game I&apos;d rather play in this genre. Civilisation 5 maybe big, but the game play is boring as hell. This game on the other hand is lots lots more fun. You want to ride the hype train and brag about playing the biggest and newest games, go Civilisation 5, if you really want to play a good and fun game thats decently made and designed, play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-settlers-7-paths-to-a-kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=7061517">Expand</a></span>
