The Great Cow Race suffers from the same voice acting problems as the first game, and if anything, worsens them by having even more characters and dialogue to ham-fistedly fumble. The character models still look wrong, the graphics are still out of date for their time, and the puzzles are still tedious; the only thing that helps The Great Cow Race is the strength of the material it&apos;s drawing on, because it&apos;s just so much harder to improperly execute an inherently silly concept like a cow race compared to a journey through a fresh new land.
<br>
<br>This is subject to the same &quot;infant developer grace period&quot; phenomenon I mentioned in my review of the first Bone game, but considering what Telltale&apos;s put out since then, I&apos;d be surprised if the Bone games aren&apos;t at the same &quot;secret shame&quot; level as Howard the Duck is for George Lucas. Jeff Smith&apos;s graphic novel deserves better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bone-the-great-cow-race/user-reviews?user_review_id=3140744">Expand</a></span>
