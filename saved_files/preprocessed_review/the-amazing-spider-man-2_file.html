I&apos;m huge Spider-Man fan, I think he&apos;s greatest hero there is. And it sucks so much that this game isn&apos;t so good I hoped it would be. It&apos;s bad. Don&apos;t believe people saying it&apos;s 10/10. It&apos;s not. Seriously.
<br>
<br>PC version has a lot of glitches, graphic bugs, frame rates and whatnot.  Sometimes I cannot finish side mission, since the building where I have to save humans is gone. Game looks pretty bad to be next-gen title. And this new Hero or Menace thing is hard, if you skip one of those 10 missions in map, you suddenly became Menace. And I don&apos;t want to save citizens in peril during story missions, or when I&apos;m going to somewhere. And every time you finish one, you get annoying Daily Bugle news.
<br>
<br>The worst aspect of this game is that it tries so hard to be like Arkham games. And we have Spider-Man games that aren&apos;t and are still good (USM, SMSD, SM2). We have Spider-Sense that&apos;s basically detective vision except you don&apos;t scan anything. But it&apos;s blurry and I didn&apos;t want to use it. But I had to. We also have predator missions returning and that&apos;s not good neither. Enemy spot you through walls and on ceiling even though they don&apos;t watch in there.
<br>
<br>Combat sucks. You smash attack button until you have to counter. And it&apos;s hard. Even though I press counter button, it doesn&apos;t work and enemies hit me. And I&apos;m very good in ASM 1 and Arkham games. And there&apos;s no variations. Signature moves are the same. And enemies have super speed and strength and everything. It&apos;s very frustating, since it doesn&apos;t have any variation.
<br>
<br>Web-slinging is fun, when it&apos;s works. But too often Spidey goes inside building or suddenly changes to rotation where I&apos;m going. And the buggy came doesn&apos;t make it better. I didn&apos;t want to wall-crawl, because camera ruins it. And since web-slinging doesn&apos;t work, I just want to walk, which is very slow.
<br>
<br>Story is just filled with different villains. And there are too much of them. You start with Uncle Ben&apos;s killer and 15 minutes later, he&apos;s dead, you face Shocker, 15 minutes later he&apos;s beaten and it goes on.
<br>
<br>Also, Spidey&apos;s new voice actor sucks. He tries to be funny, but isn&apos;t. And he doesn&apos;t sound like Spider-Man, at all. We had great voice actors in the past
<br>
<br>Overall, game sucks and is huge letdown. And I didn&apos;t want it to be. ASM wasn&apos;t great, but it was okay and I thought Beenox learned it&apos;s mistakes. But it didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Last good Spider-Man game was Shattered Dimensions. It had good combat, voice-acting and humor. What it didn&apos;t have was free-roaming and interesting story. I bought this game with 16 &#x20AC; and I&apos;m still regretting it. If you want Spidey game with bad voice-acting, humor, combat, mediocre web-slinging, bad story and overall Arkham-clone this is it.
<br>
<br>What we need is next-gen only Spider-Man game, with SMSD&apos;s combat and voice-actors. Maybe with 4 different New Yorks to explore?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-amazing-spider-man-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4170345">Expand</a></span>

Swinging is cool as well, not spiderman 2 swinging, but still cool. Graphics are fine. It&apos;s not perfect but it&apos;s a good game that you will not regret buying.</span>

The gameplay is rather redundent and formulaic go there, beat up bad guys, fight a boss that even a monkey can beat (they are patheticly easy), repeat. Stealth sometimes feels impossible becuse of the AI being inconsistent sometimes the enemys will see you on the roof at complete night or they wont notice you when your standing behind a pole that doesnt even hide spidys body. The other problem for stealth is the controls, it can say that you can repeal from the roof but what spidey does is he jumps down to the floor getting instantly spotted. Fighting is like in Batman Arkham Asylum/City but less responsive you cant switch from an attack instantly to a counter becuse of a delay or downright unresponsiveness of the controls. Tho the game can be fun for the first hour or two but everything after that becomes pointless becuse fighting crime is tedious like I mentioned, colleting comics are only for the completionist or the Marvel fans and exploring Manhattan is pointless when there is nothing to do in the whole city after the main missions. The costumes are a cool idea, but I didint notice a diffrence from being original Spider-man, 2012 Spider-man, Vigilante Spider-man or any other costume it says that they give buffs but they dont seem to do a diffrence. Just stay away from this</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-amazing-spider-man-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4171746">Expand</a></span>

After all, I reviewed two other Spider-Man games a while ago, including this game&apos;s prequel.  I was anxious to play this game being the die-hard Spider-Man fanboy that I am.  I would pretty much buy anything that has his name plastered on it.  So, does this game measure up to the other two Spider-Man games that I reviewed, or is this Spider-Man&apos;s worst game yet?  Let&apos;s find out.  The gameplay of the original game was really repetitive.  It was still fun however.  Here the gameplay is much more repetitive, and much less fun.  This is sad because this game follows much the same gameplay style as the last game.  You control Spider-Man as he fights criminals and super-villains throughout the city of Manhattan.  Along with that there are also story missions you have to complete as the game goes on.  The gameplay is more redundant this time around, as there are now more random crimes that Spider-Man has to stop.  This time however, unlike the last game, these crimes don&apos;t disappear forever once you do them.  They do disappear, however, they reappear later on.  At first I thought I would like this, as I remember crimes appearing randomly in Spider-Man 2 the game for the Nintendo Gamecube.  While that was fun, those crimes were completely optional (provided that you didn&apos;t need to do them to progress through the story).  However, here I just found them annoying.  For one thing, in this game, there is now a penalty for not stopping these crimes in time, through the game&apos;s poorly implemented hero or menace system.  I was expecting something cool like an alternate ending for the game, like in Spider-Man Web of Shadows.  However, it ultimately results in &quot;If Spider-Man doesn&apos;t stop these crimes, then the Police will stop Spider-Man&quot;.  It basically means if you leave crimes alone for long enough, it will disappear, and the people of New York will hate you for letting the criminals get away.  This just got annoying.  Also, there is always a news report when you stop a crime, which can take your time away from this game&apos;s action.  This makes the game boring, and less fun.  None of this is to say that the game isn&apos;t fun at all.  It can be fun just to beat people up as Spider-Man.  There are also really fun stealth missions where you have to take out enemies who are trying to stop you from getting to an alternate costume.  If this was the entire game, I think I would have enjoyed it a little bit more.  Oh, and yes there are alternate costumes and other unlockables in this game which can extend your playtime a bit.  The alternate costumes are better in this game than they are in the last game, as they don&apos;t completely break the game when you unlock them.  They&apos;re supposed to provide you with boosts depending on the costume you use.  However, because the gameplay is so redundant I barely noticed any difference regardless of what costume I used.  Oh, and the gameplay is also way too easy.  In the end, the gameplay of this game could have been amazing, but due to easiness and redundancy, the gameplay falls into mediocrity.  As for the graphics, I think they look good...back in 2006.  This game also has really mediocre outdated graphics.  This game came out a year after Grand Theft Auto V, my new favorite video game of all time, which had fantastic graphics that really showed off what graphics technology of today is capable of.  Also, this game&apos;s lighting makes the graphics look even more dreadful than they already are.  While I&apos;d say this game&apos;s graphics are outdated, they are still pretty mediocre at best.  As for the story, words cannot describe how disappointed I am with this game&apos;s story.  It is absolutely terrible, displaying pretty much everything bad about video game story lines.  The entire story is pretty much &quot;Oh no bad guys are trying to take over the city, but of course Spider-Man is here, so everything will be fine&quot;.  There are also Peter Parker levels that I sort of enjoyed.  They still couldn&apos;t save the story from being a travesty however.  Overall, I will admit, I actually enjoyed this game at first.  However, that was because I am a giant Spider-Man fan, and I was willing to let that blind me to how boring the game really is.  That&apos;s exactly who I&apos;d say this game would appeal to: just the die hard Spider-Man fanboys, and no one else.  Everyone else should just play Spider-Man 2 the game or Ultimate Spider-Man for the Gamecube instead.  They are both much better games.  Or heck, just don&apos;t play a Spider-Man game at all.  Instead, play Batman Arkham if you want an excellent superhero game.  Just stay away from Arkham Origins!

All they had to do to make a great sequel would be to base more, better missions around that movement scheme.  It is pathetic that in 10 years no other Spiderman game has come close.  I got excited for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 because I had seen videos of them &quot;improving&quot; the web-swinging (i.e., restoring it to S2).  But the end result is dissapointing, a game that is worse than the 10-year-old S2 on almost every level.  In case anyone with the authority to make a Spiderman videogame is reading, I&apos;ll explain why.
<br>Most of the problem comes from the way they have simplified everything to make it easier.  For example, in TASM2, you don&apos;t die or take damage from high falls (unlike S2);  In S2, it was easy to get slowed down unless you timed everything properly, which made it fun to try and race across the city; since there are no consequences (not evern slowing down) for swinging poorly in TASM2, it&apos;s not fun.  The wall-running is accomplished by continuing to hold the web swing button (in S2, you had to consciously let go of the web line and press the &quot;wall cling&quot; plus &quot;run&quot; buttons); it&apos;s how the Assassin&apos;s Creed system of auto-jumping to make parkour easier has actually made its platforming much less fun than the Mario64 system of actually pressing a jump button.  And speaking of, you can no longer jump in between web swings, or wall-jump back and forth between buildings in TASM2.  They took out (or failed to code) all the options of S2 that made you feel in control.
<br>Also, the physics in TASM2 feel wrong, like you&apos;re moving at a constant speed.  The physics of S2 were alot sharper, like you were a weight at the end of a pendulum, moving with real angular acceleration.
<br>The one improvement of TASM2 in web-swinging is that there&apos;s a separate shoulder button for left and right web strands, which does work better than having the one web-swing button of S2.  But that one improvement does not compensate for everything they took out.
<br>The combat of TASM2 is much worse than S2, and it wasn&apos;t that great in S2.  TASM2&apos;s combat is a copy of the Batman:Arkham Series&apos; (or any recent Ubisoft game), minus the near-perfect &quot;feel&quot; that only comes with repeat playtesting, minus the different kinds of enemies that have to be approached differently, minus anything new at all in any way.  S2 had a better system: instead of a &quot;counter&quot; button, there was a &quot;dodge&quot; button, that you then followed up with different options (attack or web-grab).  S2 also let you web-grab, hold, and throw enemies at each other, which was pretty fun in a &quot;Minority-Report-Everybody-Runs more-of-a-toy-than-a-game&quot; kind of way.  My main gripe in S2 was that enemies would randomly block your web-grab attempts without visual indicators of when you could and couldn&apos;t grab an enemy.  In TASM2 your only option besides &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;counter&quot; is a web-shot attack; there&apos;s no way to grab enemies outside of an automated pre-animated finisher.  Again, S2 wins out over TASM2 in terms of combat.
<br>The stealth is functional but uninteresting.  Enemy AI is as simplistic as it can be without being broken.
<br>The segments where you play as Peter Parker are pointless, boring, and unskippable.  I can&apos;t imagine how they managed to publish TASM2 without anyone pointing out how much better all of those bits would have worked as (SHORT) cutscenes instead.  Yes, S2 had Peter Parker segments, but they lasted like 5-10 seconds, and even then they felt pointless.
<br>The graphics of TASM2 are average (so, better than S2), and the animations are better, but the characters no longer have rag-doll-physics; game creators, take note: physics always, always, always make the game look better in motion than just having more raw polygons or high-res textures.  So even in terms of looks, the 10-year-old S2 still wins out over TASM2.
<br>S2 was not perfect.  There was alot more S2 could have done with missions to take advantage of the movement system (i.e. actual character chases with AI instead of just get-to-the-checkpoint-in-time), the submissions got repetitive, the combat was a little simplistic and the plot was insipid.  TASM2 has fixed none of these problems and actually (by comparison) made the web-swinging and combat much, much worse.
<br>TASM2 is not average.  A higher-resolution verion of S2 without other improvements would be &quot;average,&quot; i.e., the least-they-could-do.  TASM is just a major dissapointment.  It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s an improvement over TASM1&apos;s web-swinging, this is just not acceptable.
<br>And incidentally, the metacritic-tampering (perfect ratings posted by people who created their accounts the day of release, writing in obvious marketing language?) was pathetic on every level, though it didn&apos;t influence my score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-amazing-spider-man-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4173397">Expand</a></span>

The game itself does require more than just one button mashing like one guy said, you do have to dodge, use your webs, etc to keep yourself from getting killed. If you even try to button mash in this game you&apos;ll get killed easily. The boss fights are eh... too quick. The story line is lacking a bit in this game compared to the first Amazing Spider-Man. The suits do offer different stat changes, not sure what the other guy was talking about. Anyways, it is a fun game if you want to kill time for a bit. Does require a pretty good gaming PC to run it, so don&apos;t try to run it on a dual core then complain cause you can&apos;t run the graphics very high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-amazing-spider-man-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4191438">Expand</a></span>

In a post-GTA V era, though, when the new consoles are out there, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 is definitely a step back technically, while the gameplay needs new ideas, if they want to continue to offer their &quot;amazing&quot; Spider-Man experiences.
<br>
<br>This game is suitable for the fans, who will have fun coming mainly from the highlight of the game; the villain interaction. The rest who liked the previous game, should also enjoy this package, while it would wiser to rent it, because of its short duration. The ones wanting a AAA Spidey experience should keep on waiting/hoping for the next games from Beenox, that will trully show the passage to next-gen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-amazing-spider-man-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4198539">Expand</a></span>

For starters the combat is way too straightforward and much more limited than the Arkham series, secondly we have the terrible story which never knows wich plot to develop properly. And then we have all of the potentially great ideas wasted, for example the hero/menace mechanic, choosing optional topics of conversation and the upgrade system. The bosses are very simple and quite boring and the hub world is almost completely unnecessary. But despite of all of this, i did find some positives: the web swinging is great and probably the best so far, spiderman is very acrobatic which makes the web swinging even more fun, and lastly i love that you can view comics in a comic book store owned by Stan Lee. But overall, sadly this game is not good, and only the biggest fans of spiderman will find it enjoyable, quite disappointing indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-amazing-spider-man-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6431653">Expand</a></span>
