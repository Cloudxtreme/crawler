<br>
<br>Each &apos;world&apos; introduces a new component that can drastically change the type of challenge presented by the level - from basic puzzler to a race against the clock and enemy drones - whilst keeping the core concept intact. This helps the game stay fresh and exciting and there&apos;s always an area of play that one can improve upon.
<br>
<br>Replaying to achieve gold medals in each level is also satisfying, and the co-op campaign creates some very exciting teamplay. While online play is still in the works, it&apos;s refreshing for a game to offer split screen again. Devs have also talked about implementing a level editor which will drastically enhance the game&apos;s replay value. As it stands now, for it&apos;s current price it&apos;s a steal.
<br>
<br>One of my top games of the year. Try the demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-virus-named-tom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563276">Expand</a></span>

Truly one of the &quot;Not-to-miss&quot; Indie games available. Love how 90% of Indie games are light-years better than the big budget Dev-Houses.</span>

It has a fast-paced nature that I have yet to see in many puzzle games, which was a pleasant surprise. Overall, if you&apos;re into classic arcade games and modern puzzlers, you&apos;ll enjoy it.

The Co-Op mode is well made with great puzzles, art, and all, and is a must-play for any puzzle-loving group of friends. However, even if you don&apos;t enjoy puzzle games that much (or even if you do enjoy them), I can tell you that the price of the game is worth it just for the versus mode. It does require some strategy, but you are competing directly with your friends, and it is just amazingly fun. Try out the customization options if you do play the versus mode, as you can often make hilarious scenarios. Lastly, I bought it mainly to play with my friends, but it is also a great single player game. The co-op and single player levels are both at the same level of quality (which ranges from good to amazing). The story (which is portrayed to great animations and a few messages) is well-written. If you like puzzle games, you&apos;ll want to pick this up.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, it is a must buy if you have a puzzle-loving group of friends, or if you just love puzzle games by yourself. The versus mode is still amazing even if no one likes puzzles, although I would not recommend the single player version of the game to anyone who does not like puzzle games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-virus-named-tom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2569835">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is very well made in almost every aspect. The puzzles are challenging, and require a combination of skillful maneuvering and careful planning. The game continues introducing a bunch of new elements as you play, taking time to introduce each, and it demonstrated the game&apos;s depth and its finesse in how it introduces each. The style of the game is really neat. I adored the game&apos;s art, and I laughed a few times at the humorous story.
<br>
<br>This game has local multiplayer, both cooperative and competitive, which is something you don&apos;t see that often anymore. On top of that, it&apos;s pretty fun.
<br>
<br>I hadn&apos;t heard much about this game before getting it, which is sad, because more people need to hear about A Virus Named TOM. This game is excellent, and it deserves a place among the best indie games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-virus-named-tom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2638737">Expand</a></span>

You take on the role of a computer virus that goes around messing with the circuitry of the scientists former creations. The game can easily be played single player, but the developers have included 4 player co-op and 4 player versus modes. The single drawback of the game is that it doesn&apos;t currently support online multiplayer. This is something that the developer is looking to add through a kickstarter campaign if he&apos;s able to rally enough support. I was going to mark the game down a point for the missing online component, but I realized that it might actually be a good thing at times. I have other games lacking that functionality and all it ended up doing was bringing friends over for a fun night of gaming. I have to say the game is refreshing because it is tons of fun and challenging at the same time. Many games today are only one of the two. Developers try to make a game challenging and instead make it frustrating. Other times they try to make something fun, and it turns out to be too easy. You can tell the devs took the time to balance this. The learning curve is just at the right point. Does the game get hard? Yes. Does the game get frustrating? Once or twice. Does it ever get too hard? Not in my opinion. The game had one moment of getting on my nerves, but I took a step back, thought about the puzzle, and then managed to figure it out. Someone else may have simply stopped playing, but again the devs were all over this problem. The game rewards you with the ability to skip stages after you successfully complete a level. Thus, after level 1 (which is practically a tutorial) you are given 2 skips. You can use these on any stage in any of the following levels. After beating level 2 you are then awarded with an additional 2 skips. I really thought this was a cool idea, but I was worried about using my skips and then running out at a REALLY hard part. Well, I found on level 3 I had to use a skip. After beating the rest of the level, I went back to beat my skipped stage. Upon beating that dastardly stage, I was given my skip back. I was shocked. I was stunned. But, most of all, I was impressed with the devs thinking ahead of a problem that could have come up. The game may also seem a bit short at first glance, but looks can be deceiving. The game difficulty ramps up in the later stages which will slow your progression through the game, but not really put a damper on the fun and excitement. If you like puzzle-solvers, I&apos;d definitely suggest this game. I do believe the game is currently selling for $10. Not a bad deal if you ask me. Also, if you&apos;re into co-op (which is huge for me) this game has the makings of a really awesome co-op extravaganza. Don&apos;t take my word for it though. You can go to their site and view the videos for yourself. Then you can head over to steam and grab a copy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-virus-named-tom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624027">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a paradise until the creator of all these marvels, having grown increasingly mad, is unseated from his position as inventor in this technological paradise. Seeking the utmost retribution, he creates A Virus Named Tom with the sole intent of wreaking havoc against those who would have stifled his creativity. Thus begins a journey through the computer systems of the World of Tomorrow with the intent of unhinging it all with grim prejudice.
<br>
<br>Presenting what could have been just another puzzle game, A Virus Named Tom quickly serves up a slightly different brand of challenges, keeping itself apart from it&apos;s contemporaries unexpected ease. Setting players loose in a computer system as Tom, a vicious little virus bent on infecting everything, the obstacles quickly become apparent. Players will need to be both quick of wit and steady with their hands if they want to move onto the next levels with any form of expediency.
<br>
<br>Selecting single-player delivers an experience typical of most puzzle-style games. The player will begin with relatively simple mechanics and, as progression is achieved over time in the form of accomplishing levels, the difficulty curve will slowly become greater as additional tasks get layered on. Typically, this comes in the form of adjusting paths so as to allow Tom to infect with maximum efficiency in a way that is exceptionally close to Pipe Dream. Added to the mix however are anti-virus that will constantly stand in the way of accomplishing this task.
<br>
<br>As time goes on however, things only get harder. Namely, that the anti-virus will become significantly more tenacious and the circuitry will become invisible unless connected to a source of infection. While this can get frustrating for players looking for an easy experiencing, causing them to walk away, there is a quality about AVNT that will keep most gamers coming back for more. Nevertheless, the description of the increasing difficulty stating, &quot;evolving mechanics which ratchet up the difficulty from lollipop to soul crushing,&quot; proves an apropos omen. You will fight the urge to toss the controller repeatedly.

<br>But this isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing. While the challenge is intrinsically inherent to what A Virus Named Tom is at it&apos;s core, there are outs to prevent gamers from completely losing their minds. Primarily, this takes the form of the ability for players to skip levels, pending they have earned the tokens to do so. Essentially, should a player be foiled enough by a given scenario, they are able to move past that level a la &apos;Splosion Man sans the pink tutu for doing so. Granted, there are those who may find this to be a cop-out, given the gratuitous difficulty in certain sections of the game, this can prove to be a necessity for some.
<br>
<br>Oddly enough, wrestling with how to describe A Virus Named Tom has plagued me, not just throughout the time drafting a preview, but since playing it for the first time. It seems to take cues from classic puzzle titles while forging ahead with distinctive qualities that set it on a path all it&apos;s own. Graphically, Tom and the levels each look distinctive and beautiful, leaving the player to happily focus on the tasks at hand. Controls are tight and require some snap movements at times, but will otherwise use those who prefer a keyboard in the dust. Otherwise, for all intents and purposes, AVNT stands to form it&apos;s own cult following complete with those who continue to hope for more puzzles once they infect their way through the first 50.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-virus-named-tom/user-reviews?user_review_id=2643343">Expand</a></span>

After a while it gets boring, as the levels progress, there is no variety. The strengths of the game is the sense of humor and the funny story. It was the only reason I wanted to finish the game.</span>

The aesthetics, the humor, the character design of T.O.M., the snazzy soundtrack (the one positive thing I got from this game) are fantastic, but ultimately the gameplay is where the game fails to understand itself.
<br>
<br>If you have played the demo, you might actually find the game interesting and fun with the pipe-linking puzzle game AVNT wants you to believe it is. But once you get to the middle of the second area/world/device, the game suddenly forgets the methological approach.
<br>
<br>The main problem with this game is it wants you to take your time to figure out the puzzles, yet it also rushes you to solve the solutions as your health is your time-limit. Some levels will slowly degrade your health while others will rely on you manuevering around enemies to absorb more health. And you have to complete the puzzle while doing that as well.
<br>
<br>What makes the gameplay worse is it makes you work under a clock to solve puzzles where you CAN&apos;T see your progress. There is a mechanic introduced fairly early that hides the grid away from you unless you can set it up to be activated by the other pipes. So that means you have to either brute force your way to completion. But some levels seem to demand that memorize each level, THEN do it as quick as possible while not getting hurt and losing time/health.
<br>
<br>Some might argue that the skip-tokens let you get past those frustrating levels, but the game just continues to get more frustrating for all the wrong reasons. The challenges at the start of the game do not prepare you for the trials towards the end. I couldn&apos;t even imagine trying to convince someone to play cooperative with me on the later levels.
<br>
<br>Controls. The best way I can explain my problem with the controls is that I always feel tied to an anchor. Whether you use a controller or the keyboard, you have to hold a button down to interact with a section of the grid. Combine this mechanic with having to dodge enemies quickly and you&apos;ll find yourself stuck on the same paths or you&apos;ll accidently slide into an enemy you were trying to avoid.
<br>
<br>If there is A Virus Named TOM 2, however slim the possibility is, I hope the devs choose one type of puzzle or the other. Testing your reflexes or testing your puzzle-solving is fine, but testing both at the same time is a challenge in frustration, not of fair difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-virus-named-tom/user-reviews?user_review_id=5469640">Expand</a></span>
