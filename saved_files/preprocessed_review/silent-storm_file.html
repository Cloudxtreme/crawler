Generally, turn-based combat games turned me off, with meticulous unit placement and dull graphics. Silent Storm just changed the face of turn-based tactical games forever. From the extensive custom character creation screen, to the totally destructable environments, I&apos;m loving this game. I played the Close Combat series a few years ago, and while the gameplay was definately fun, you were left with very poor graphics; your soldiers being tiny little pixels on a mostly-overhead map. The graphics on Silent Storm are wonderful. Fully three-dimensionally rendered, with a free-roaming camera to give you a view of the battle from ANY angle. (You can turn off the computer&apos;s &quot;cinematic&quot; auto-panning, which I found to be more distracting than useful.) Character graphics are rendered in great detail, including some of the &quot;load-out&quot; of equipment they are carrying, so you can see belt-clips of certain ammo, and hand grenades or tools hanging on their belt. I was even impressed the way a character would bend their legs and body realistically depending on what angle of a surface they were standing upon. The custom character screen and lip-sync technology system used have been the subject of many online articles. It is obvious a lot of attention went into the characters. Just about every &quot;fragile&quot; object in the world can be shot, blown up, or destroyed. Can&apos;t get to an enemy because he&apos;s behind a brick wall? Toss a grenade at the wall, and not only will the wall be damaged, but often the enemy that was hiding behind it. In one game, I had an enemy on the third floor of a building that I could not get to. I simply blew the floors out from under him, and the entire building collapsed, causing him to fall to the basement and die. I don&apos;t believe that any game before has given you that kind of freedom and ability to use the environment to your advantage. Certainly there are a few bugs, many of which are addressed in the 1.02 patch, but overall, the game plays well &quot;out of the box&quot;. There is an overwhelming number of weapons available, with you being able to pick up an enemy&apos;s weapons if you run out of ammo for yours, but there were some glaring omissions which might have been nice, like smoke grenades. The only major gripe I have is that the character phrases (which are different for each character) range from silly to downright lame. Luckily, they can be turned off. Because of the random placement on a map, and wide variety of options for character actions, you can really approach any situation in a number of ways. This has got to be the best turn-based tactical game I have ever played! Definitely a contender for Game of the Year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=373455">Expand</a></span>

I would rate this game a 9 or a 10 if I hadn&apos;t felt that the games physics and map-design could be a bit more polished too. I am sure a sequel/expansion would fix these minor problems. I would suggest anybody who enjoyed this game to go back and try JA again. In fact there is a new version out, JA2 Wildfire. I have been playing Wildfire and found a better tactical feel than Silent Storm, albeit the JA engine is REAL old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-storm/user-reviews?user_review_id=375243">Expand</a></span>
