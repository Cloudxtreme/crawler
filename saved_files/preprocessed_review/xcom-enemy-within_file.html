It adds a new minor human enemy, one or two new aliens, and a few maps.  That&apos;s it.  It calls itself an &quot;expansion&quot; and that is a lie.  An expansion would have added significant gameplay, an expansion or continuation of the story-line/plot...basically a new experience.  Enemy within offers none of those things.  You play the exact same game as before, only with a tiny amount of new &quot;stuff&quot; that costs almost as much as a full game.  If you never played XCOM: Enemy Unknown, then this is a great purchase as a stand-alone product (Steam requires you buy the original, so don&apos;t do it!).  I can recommend it as a first-time game, since it is a fantastic game on its own.  But don&apos;t buy this &quot;expansion&quot; if you already own the first game, or at least wait until this map pack is more appropriately priced ($5 max).  I was ripped off again by unscrupulous game publishers.

The AI seems to have gotten a bit of an overhaul and uses high ground, supression, overwatch, flanking more effectively. Tweaks to the meta-game like facility adjacency bonus&apos; are also welcome.  My minor complaints are that the difficulty curve can be a bit wonky at the start,  especially if you&apos;ve played through the campaign multiple times already and move the story ahead too quickly, the scripted story missions will start throwing very difficult aliens at you way before you&apos;re adequately ready to handle them.  This in combination with the accuracy estimates seeming to be being a little off or having a new hidden penalty,  it can get frustrating, especially on classic or higher difficulty.  If you loved Enemy Unknown you&apos;ll love Enemy Within,  if you didn&apos;t, it hasn&apos;t changed anything that&apos;s going to make you like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3816165">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Part of me still yearns for a more in depth experience as in the original XCom games, but this was also frustrating at times (how many ammo clips do I give each soldier?!). EU/EW greatly streamlines the experience and lets you focus on the more fun aspects, the battles, research, resource management, etc.
<br>
<br>Gathering meld now forces you to explore maps faster than you might otherwise (especially on harder difficulties) and introduces new upgrades for your soldiers: MECs, which are awesome cyborg soldiers, and gene modifications to improve your regular troops. The satisfaction of a MEC punching an alien through a wall never gets old, though be careful you don&apos;t also destroy something you didn&apos;t mean to! The only downside is that later in the game these allow you to really upgrade your troops and leads to most missions becoming quite easy (unlike the first couple of in-game months which are really difficult).
<br>
<br>The human Exalt forces are another fun new twist, offering a quite different experience to alien hunting. With no need to capture them alive and equivalent weapons/armour/tech in the early  mid game, they can be fairly challenging, or you can just grab rockets and grenades and destroy everything. I feel they could have built this more into a story with more cutscenes or backstory but I still enjoyed it.
<br>
<br>A few other great features: soldiers can speak their own languages, base attacks and enemy mechs are more robust than in the original.
<br>
<br>Some of the mechanics of the game I feel are a little too scripted, more so than the originals. While this ensures a more consistent experience, it also reduces the replayability significantly. I can&apos;t see myself picking this up many more times, though the recently added &apos;second wave&apos; options allow you to change a number of game mechanics  e.g. soldiers can have randomly generated abilities and stats.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve only experience two minor bugs during my playthrough, so I don&apos;t see any major issues there at all, and the game looks and sounds as good as ever with it&apos;s distinctive B-movie feel. I feel the price is fair for the amount of time you can spend on the new features. It&apos;s still one of my favourite games of recent years and this expansion just adds to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3807562">Expand</a></span>

Instead I was just glued to this title for two days. New aliens, new alien craft, new human enemies, lots of customization options for your soldiers.. the game is really worth it.</span>

Still, in most cases I don&apos;t play through to the mothership finale  I just see if I can get satellites over all countries w/no defections and research my way through both the Lab and the Foundry. At that point, the end of the game is a foregone conclusion, and I start a new one.
<br>
<br>XCOM: Enemy Within brings a whole new complexity and expansiveness to the game. I love the MEC and gene engineering options, and having multiple plot threads (aliens, EXALT, Progeny) makes the game feel a lot larger. Likewise, I love the new maps and the repurposing of some of the old ones; now, having an old map in the original orientation and use provokes more of a &quot;OK, I know how to do this one&quot; reaction rather than a &quot;[Sigh] Not again&quot; reaction. And, as others have noted, the Meld issue forces me to move a bit more aggressively and recklessly than I normally do.
<br>
<br>What I&apos;d love to see in future DLC (besides more maps and maybe a few more scenarios) is some form of &quot;Search and Respond&quot; mission that you can initiate at any time  in effect, to provide a setting to experiment in and to advance rookies. What you encounter could range anywhere from a stray cow (and maybe a Meld pillar) to an EXALT safe house to a standard alien encounter to an overwhelming flood of aliens (with you having to make a successful retreat while being pressed and attacked on all sides).
<br>
<br>I have a few complaints (spoilerish)  the EXALT HQ raid seemed a bit easy, while the &quot;Operation Progeny&quot; scenario comes a bit late in the game to have the impact that I&apos;d like it to have (in terms of adding talented personnel).

There is no question that this add-on is worth every penny of the $29 I spent.  By far the best &apos;expansion&apos; to come along since Heart of the Swarm for StarCraft II.  If you played XCOM in the past, this is definitely a must buy!</span>

<br>There are two kind of xcom players: those who play for hundreds of hours, on ironman, over and over again, and those who play the game once, because let&apos;s face it, life is short and there are hundreds of games out there. The first category, they already have the expoansion, and they are having a blast... I know, I became one of them... Now the second category, your category. You know going through the game again is a 20-30 hour journey, so is it worth the money to play the same game again?
<br>What the expansion offers is more of everything: more baddies, more mission variety, more gadgets and more ways to power-up your soldiers. Is it different enough to justify a replay? Do you like watching new iterations/reboots of superhero movies? Same idea. Similar enough that you know what to expect, different enough that it gives fresh sensations and even a few wtf moments.
<br>Your money, your choice. If you are not a hardcore XCOM player, and have steam, and you have already waited this long, I would recommend to wait for a sale, but then definitely get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3845913">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game gets a 9/10 since some of the problems haven&apos;t been fixed by Firaxis but XCOM Enemy Within is a great expansion with a great TU to the original game.

More maps. More campaign elements, more inventory to manage. While the new additions of meld and medals may make the endgame easier on easy setting, they won&apos;t help you on classic or impossible ironman so much. The criticism that this makes the game too easy are invalidated by the fact that the game has hard settings, and ways to even make it harder from there. Arguments that the expansion is overpriced ignore the fact that this is targeted at people who already play the game and want more. In this context the price is reasonable. Indeed I&apos;m surprised that fans of the game would not be happy to expand their play experience and support the developers at the same time, with a price that is good for everyone. If you like X-COM Enemy this is a no-brainer, get it today. If you are in here giving it a red score on the basis of price, you are a no-brainer, who probably needs to get a job.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3929276"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I really wanted to give this game a 7.5 but it wouldn&apos;t let me. The real reasons for this are quite obvious, if you have played the game. First and foremost, the AI (alien invaders) always get in range long before the X-COM defenders can even take a clear shot. Which means, basically, you&apos;re a sitting duck for at least a turn before you can engage in combat. This feature is also exacerbated by the fact that the aliens can shoot through, around, over or beyond anything I&apos;ve ever seen. They also get to move as soon as the X-COM team comes into contact with them, no sneaking up on the enemy and eliminating them like the Navy Seals do. That&apos;s something that the X-COM soldiers also cannot do, even wearing GHOST armor, The aliens almost never miss, at long range, which is frustrating, because if you go after them aggressively, they will get shots on your guys without them being able to respond or at a huge shot penalty disadvantage. This continues until, and even when the X-COM forces have advanced through the ranks to Major or Colonel. Even at that stage the aliens have longer range and better targeting than the X-COM forces. There is an awful lot of X-COM forces missing 94% shots at close range, leaving men exposed to one last hit by the alien enemies. One example was where I had played to the end of an alien ship landing and barely escaped disaster from an attacking Monstrous Sectopod and 3 heavy floaters, only to be suddenly ambushed by a muton, 2 muton elite, a muton berserker and a psi-commander before I had the opportunity to reload or use medkits for a couple of hits I took. Needless to say, I thought I had everything under control but 3 of my best guys missed 85% to 94% shots consecutively and one of my best guys got killed. How does that happen and why? These are supposed to be Elite X-COM super soldiers that have been genetically modified. What&apos;s up with that?
<br>Anyway, I happen to like turn based games but this one seems to be a little chaotic when it comes to being player friendly, so to speak. I don&apos;t think anyone likes getting killed just before they get across the finish line. One last desperate shot killed my X-COM Colonel. Dammit!!!!!!
<br>The game is good and entertaining but paying for genetic modifications (great idea) and MEC&apos;s (which I don&apos;t like) along with a couple of new aliens and a few extra missions , doesn&apos;t really seem like it&apos;s that much better for the money. Don&apos;t misunderstand me, I like what they did, aside from the MEC thing, which I think could have been turned into a different game altogether, but it could have been much better at the same price. I also think that basically having just one team of X-COM soldiers is a little short sighted and perhaps future DLC can adjust the narrow focus of this game.
<br>I also think that having a few more levels with a few more perks for the soldiers would have been good for the game, (like not missing shots above 80% perhaps) and adding a few more psi powers and maybe being able to choose rank upgrades from the start and more than just 2 per rank, would be a somewhat major improvement.. More customized abilities for each character/soldier and maybe a little higher attribute scores every once in a while. It&apos;s a huge waste of time and resources to buy and train soldiers to get attribute scores like 34 will and 55 aim. That is just not going to cut it in X-COM. And perhaps, a way of obtaining a bit more funding in the early game so it doesn&apos;t stagger the progression so much until there isn&apos;t anything left to research or build.
<br>Nevertheless, the alien attack on X-COM headquarters was a purely brilliant idea and a handful of creative ideas like that would have made this addition a blockbuster. I also think that the Exalt faction is a huge step in the right direction but could have been better and perhaps a little better explanation of what the icons were there for and why. But, alas it wasn&apos;t to be.
<br>Hope there is another DLC to this game from 2K soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3929276">Expand</a></span>

<br>p.s. I hate way of modern game developers - to develop a game than divide it into several parts and sell as dlcs. Please instead of one 20 usd game and 3 10 usd dlcs make 50 usd game with all dlcs included.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3925064">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For pc there is the digital download and if you already own the game there is no need
<br>to purchase it again  however even on the pc i find the price for this dlc to be a bit high.
<br>I payed 30 Euro&apos;s   40 Dollars  for this dlc and although it comes with a decent amount
<br>of content it still relies on  Xcom EU for the most part adding new items  a new class a good
<br>variation of maps and a new recource called meld wich lets you do some pretty awesome stuff.
<br>
<br>All of this gives Xcom a fresh look and its worth another playthrough tho i can imagine some
<br>of the veteran xcom players might be dissapointed by its price and by the fact that some of the
<br>the bugs are still present in the game and in my own playthrough it felt like the starting months
<br>of xcom enemy unknown wich also came with its bugs and quirks its a shame that these have
<br>not been fixed however it can still be patched in the future.
<br>
<br>All in all i had a great time with Xcom Enemy Within and i am still playing it as of this writing
<br>if you like xcom and you want more of it then purchase this dlc if you never played xcom but
<br>you want to then you will get the most value out of your purchase if you are on a budget
<br>you might want to hold off for a while until it go&apos;s on a discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3800606">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s where this title takes a hit on score from my perspective.  If it was standalone or about ten bucks cheaper, I&apos;d rate this a 10.  But the bottom line is that the add-on really fleshes out the original game and integrates superbly into it, adding hours of new content and fun to a game that already provides many hours of fun and tons of content.    7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801059">Expand</a></span>

These guys should be in the hall of fame for game designers. No kidding. The game is not perfect (bugs) but it&apos;s good enough to stand with the likes of Starcraft and other iconic games. It&apos;s really good. Enough said.</span>

The first Exalt mission wiped out more than half my crew then suddenly in the next mission I&apos;m up against some kind of mech-robot-monster with a shield and plasma weapons when I&apos;ve literally only just managed to get some laser rifles. I tried it on Classic difficulty and was summarily annihilated after three missions, then I tried normal mode on Ironman and could not get get my head round how even with scopes my team was missing 70+ percent shots and they were taking out my squad with one or two hits with carapace armour. Maybe I&apos;ve had a bad role of the dice, but I relatively easily completed Unknown, so I&apos;m not a tactical idiot. Basically, it&apos;s a nice add-on and I will try again, but the steep and rather unfairly harshness of the various challenges have proven to be a bit frustrating this time round. I also could not seem to find time, to get enough satellites and planes in the air to stop panic levels around various countries. I was investing in power and uplinks but the aliens were coming in too fast.
<br>
<br>Guess some of you who&apos;ve completed this expansion in a day will be chuckling to yourself. Rarely do I mark a game down for its punishing difficulty level, so if it were a bit more balanced/fair from the start then it would get an 8. I hear it gets easier at the end-game stage when you have all the upgrades and veteran soldiers, but alas, those pesky new enemies might prevent me from saving the earth this time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801495">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>*The new MEC class and augmenting soldiers gives you a wider range on upgrading your soldiers making them more unique in ability and performance instead of simply just equipping everyone with the same tech lvl armour or weapons.
<br>
<br>*There is a much greater variety of maps.  You don&apos;t repeat the same maps as frequently any more, particularly noticeable for UFO shoot downs since you&apos;re not always in the same spooky forest anymore.
<br>
<br>*More customisation for soldiers is fun.  In terms of gameplay it offers nothing, but its a fun little distraction to adjust how your soldiers look.  The addition of languages is also nice.  You could argue for more languages and maybe even English accents (Eng, US, Aust, etc), but again not important to gameplay, but cosmetic stuff.
<br>
<br>However, there are some things that prevent me giving it a ten.
<br>
<br>* Power creep: While the new classes and super-humans are great it does make the game a bit easier as you can get quite power troops quite early.  This isn&apos;t immediately countered by the aliens as the introduction to new stronger enemies is more of less staggered the same as EU.  Chryssalids are much less scary if you can one shot them with a MEC&apos;s kinetic strike.
<br>
<br>* Price: Of the two points I&apos;ve taking off this I weight less than the power creep above, but it is still a factor.  In my view it is overpriced for what you get, that at least 20% should be knocked off the price.  Not great value for money, but if I was overly concerned about it I&apos;d never buy any game until at least its 6 months old and the price starts to drop.
<br>
<br>On the bug side I&apos;ve only had one and that was on the release day where I went to mission control and it zoomed me in too close and got stuck.  Haven&apos;t had it happen since then though so I&apos;ve had a very stable experience.
<br>
<br>Overall, the expansion does what it should.  It expands the game in a overall enjoyable manner so that it makes it worth your time to return to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3796897">Expand</a></span>

The re-balancing of workshops/labs with all the new structures and economy is phenomenal: it&apos;s no longer a workshop spamming escapade. The depth in soldier customization is really good now and makes it even more personal which breathes new life into ironman mode. On top of that it adds a TON of new maps and scenarios and even randomizes some spawn points on old maps which makes it really fresh and exciting for experienced players. It puts that fear back into playing when you have no idea what&apos;s coming and will take a long time to memorize this many maps rather than 3-4 playthroughs like with EU. It is really fresh and anyone who even remotely enjoyed EU and doesn&apos;t get this is doing themselves a huge disservice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773794">Expand</a></span>

A new MEC Class which is essentially a big robot squad member, a new seeker alien which can cloak it&apos;s land strangle your squad members (very very irking, perfect for this type of game), new very much needed maps, and a new human enemy forcing you to fight differently than the original alien threat. There&apos;s also a medal system and biotic upgrades for purchase through a new currency called meld. Meld is obtained through canisters found throughout the map that disappear after a number of turns, forcing you to weigh risk and reward and move quickly to obtain them. For the price tag of thirty dollars on PC, it&apos;s worth.
<br>
<br>NOW MOVING ONTO CONSOLES
<br>If you didn&apos;t play Enemy Unknown, but you want to, just mosey on over to Enemy Within and get that instead. It comes with EU, EW, and the Slingshot DLC. Now if you already have Enemy Unknown on your console, I do not recommend Enemy Within at the price tag of forty dollars. Why? Well mostly because it doesn&apos;t share a trophy/achievement set nor do saves from Enemy Unknown carry over. But if you&apos;re anything like me you&apos;re starting over a lot anyway because you suck donkey dongle but you won&apos;t take the game off Ironman because you ain&apos;t no punk biatch. But I digress, if you want to shell out forty dollars, and you don&apos;t care about your trophies and saves, this update really really enhances the game.
<br>
<br>The verdict is a buy/10. Edge: PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3855517">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I had fun playing Enemy Within, just as much fun as I did Enemy Unknown, and that is the problem.
<br>
<br>I believe this entire DLC is very misleading and anyone who beat Unknown already is going to be as confused as me when they find themselves just playing the same exact game as before.
<br>I liked Enemy Unknown enormously and gave it a 10/10, but that did not give them the right to think they could resell me the exact same experience at a whopping 30 bucks.
<br>
<br>&quot;Oh you want a Mech in your XCOM game? We will add it as a new class, and then resell you the entire game with a new subtitle.&quot;  100% Genuine Real Authentic Firaxis Employee Quote

<br>Its a great game and fun experience, but If you played Unknown, you have already played Within.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3794659">Expand</a></span>

Enemy Unknown was an amazing reboot of a great game, and the team did a fantastic job make it engaging, entertaining and challenging. Enemy Within continues the trend of this newly-reborn franchise with a lot of new maps, a very challenging new opponent in Exalt (which wiped my entire team several times the first time around), new research, and apparently base invasions as well (I&apos;m apparently playing too awesomely to be invaded right now lol).
<br>
<br>Overall a great experience and worth the minimal cost for an expansion. I&apos;ve scanned some of the user reviews that complain about value for money, but it&apos;s an expansion and everybody else but them seems to understand that, so I&apos;m not sure what some people are complaining about. I paid almost $65 for the disaster that is Rome 2, and I&apos;m getting far more value for money from Enemy Within.
<br>
<br>In terms of stability I&apos;ve had only one minor &quot;hiccup&quot;, which was nothing more than a ~10 second lag that passed without incident, caused no problems and never occurred again, so my guess was it was background activity on my machine. The only legitimate bug I&apos;ve seen so far has been with characters who wear the skeleton suit and use the grappling hook  twice I&apos;ve had them hook to a roof and end up elsewhere. Once I ended up in a basement, the other time I went through a solid wall and ended up in a different room. Not a huge deal, and I&apos;m sure something that will get fixed  it happens. But overall, Enemy Within has been basically solid as a rock and performs reliable on maxed-out settings on my rig.
<br>
<br>In a year where both SimCity and Rome 2 experienced disastrous releases due to awful design decisions are poor technical implementations, Enemy Within is a breath of fresh air that&apos;s keeping me glued to my desktop into the wee hours of the morning. Thank you Firaxis!

<br>Anyhow, bottom line, the game is worth purchasing in general. And if you want to take it further, this DLC is kind of like icing, and a cherry on top of the whole cake.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll score it a 9/10, due to the occasional bug.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795546">Expand</a></span>

It is just a content pack to the same game, not second game of the series, however it adds more than some second games. I would pay this price for XCOM 2 without even thinking, and this content pack is definitely the next best thing.</span>

<br>
<br>Could&apos;ve been a great game, and honestly I don&apos;t have a problem with challenging games, I generally enjoy them (I got &quot;Golden God&quot; on the 360 version of Super Meat Boy, and I beat &quot;Terror from the Deep&quot; back in the day), it&apos;s that the way this game works means it needs to be *PERFECT* in design or else you&apos;re basically playing a broken, unfinished game.  Want to send your soldier in to flank an enemy for a guaranteed OHKO shot, so it can&apos;t OHKO one of your high-ranking members on the Alien turn?  Cool!  Charge up in there, get behind him, aaaand.... where&apos;s that flank bonus?  ****!  Now that soldier you just sent in for a guaranteed kill is actually dead next turn, and it&apos;s all because of a bug!  Hope you aren&apos;t playing on Iron Man!
<br>
<br>Want to toss a smoke grenade to provide units with some cover so they don&apos;t get slaughtered next turn?  Cool!  Throw that smoke grenade, aaaaand.... it fell through the level!  Cool!   Now you just blew that squad member&apos;s turn and at least one of the guys you meant to cover with smoke is gonna die!  Hope you weren&apos;t playing on Iron Man!
<br>
<br>All they really needed to do to fix 99% of the problems (since most are movement and LoS related) is make movement work like the original X-COMs, where you moved step-by-step and each movement took action points (let&apos;s say you have 100 action points, one step would cost 10).  So if you set up a flank and it fails?  Then take one step to the side and BAM now the flank works, cuz it was just a bug in that *one* square on the map (which is really all it comes down to).  But instead they decided to give you two action points in this game, one movement in any &quot;blue&quot; range is 1 AP and going beyond that is 2.  I guess they did it to make the game less overwhelming, but three cheers to Firaxis, because this simple change has made their game an unplayable mess, even though *EVERYTHING ELSE* has the potential to be good, it just isn&apos;t worth it.
<br>
<br>Now that the &quot;Complete Collection&quot; is out, they&apos;re obviously done supporting this game and are moving on.  I know my review is late, but if you&apos;re a latecomer and are considering this game, stay away.  Honestly, having this game in my Steam library now is like having a leaky tap in the house I can&apos;t fix.
<br>
<br>Aside from that, &quot;Enemy Within&quot; is a case of an unnecessary expansion, just like the Triad Character DLC was totally unnecessary for the base game.  None of the new content is exciting, the best feature is the new maps, everything else just seems to bloat the game.  They didn&apos;t have to rebuild a new engine, pretty much all the &quot;new&quot; assets are re-colored assets from the first game (that thing game developer&apos;s did during the late 80s/early 90s because they were limited on space, now some try and get away with it because they&apos;re lazy), yet for $40 you&apos;re basically getting what would&apos;ve been $10 DLC in 2006 (and had people crapping bricks over).
<br>
<br>If you *REALLY* need to play this broken mess for some reason, get EU and ignore this overpriced, unnecessary addon.  As far as I can tell, they priced it as high as they did so they could release a couple more patches to fix their broken game, without actually fixing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4136739">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Firaxis has chosen to go with big-ticket, flashy upgrades, while leaving the core play mechanisms alone. In fact, even the new gameplay mechanics boil down to reliance on tried and true XCOM formula.
<br>
<br>Remember bomb-disarmament missions? Well, they&apos;re back, except now when you click, your&apos;re collecting mind-goo, not disarming bombs. That&apos;s the crux of the DLC. Yes, it earns you cool, new stuff. The mind-effects and mech-suits look really good. Bad guys die really flashy, (though with a weird delay after you shoot them).

<br>But at the end of the day, you&apos;re disarming bombs. Except now its collecting mind-juice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3767178">Expand</a></span>

The expansion does a great job of implementing itself into the game by being a secondary storyline that slightly affects the main storyline by putting in Exalt which is an organization bent on mixing human and alien DNA. The design of Exalt is great and the creators leave subtleties as to their background such as their uniform and base of operations. Their clothing obviously shows these men just got off of work and are ready to serve Exalt at a moments notice and the fact their base is just a normal office building with fancy decor like your rich grandpa&apos;s house is a nice touch. Back to the game play the addition of meld is right off the bat it&apos;s on the first mission you play. With meld you can build Robotic troops and also genetically modify your troops to jump two stories or ensure they only get knocked out when hit with a fatal blow (without the loss of will if rescued) with the secondary heart modification. These troops make the earlier part of the game significantly easier as the new troops are admittedly overpowered; however they equal out as the game progresses. It is also highly satisfying to combo mec trooper skills together such as combining their proximity mine ability with the grenade launcher for high damage that kills most aliens. The addition of medals in this game is merely novelty as they only give a few low stats and they only give you 10 medals or less out of the entire game to award your troops with. The new maps are also a good add as they give urban ufo crash sites and a side mission that ensures you are given an entire squad (4) of people with psionic abilities. Onto the negatives this expansion is ultra glitchy which was surprising given the company that made the product. An example is the game freezing on the enemy turn as in you can still move the screen and click around the enemy just glitched and it won&apos;t end its turn or during a council event where enemies fall out of the sky. If they fall onto a proximity mine the game crashes. I also experienced crashes when an alien just coincidentally falls onto the same square a soldier is occupying. some visual ones too as my frame rate suddenly went down in the middle of the game causing some skips and my operatives&apos; arms swinging around or bending behind their back randomly. overall yes it is a fairly good expansion but it is not worth the price it is at given the current state of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797439">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-Medals(which you can award to ANY soldier)
<br>-MECs
<br>-GenMods(G-Mods)
<br>-2 new minicampiagns(3 if you have never played the slingshot DLC)
<br>-New maps
<br>-2 new enemys
<br>-some new researchoptions
<br>-1 mission were youll have to defend your base
<br>-A new resscourse called &quot;meld&quot;
<br>
<br>Lets start with the MECs.In short youll sacrifice 1 soldier and his skills.Hell become something like &quot;robocop&quot; but is useless without his MEC.Youll have to produce a MEC.MECs got 3 tech-tiers.With every stage youll have to choose what you want to install on the MEC.That cant be changed later.Which is stupid because at first you dont know how good the equipment is.Ok forget about it, you dont need to know about it because MECs are fare too strong.They can move VERY FAR and the weapons do good damage.They cant use cover but who cares?They got an amazing stock of HP and you can &quot;heal&quot; them.Plus they can repair themselfes.Later they can shoot twice(if you choose this skill which i recommend), fire at the first enemy that fire at them and they got some grenades or a medkit.Thats too much.In my case my best MEC got a aimskill of 105 in the end.Hit nearly every time and can shoot twice.Too much.Poorly balanced.The last stage is realy expensive when it comes to meld, thats the only thing.What bothers me the most is that you dont get a new researchtree.Youll get the upgrades through the old researches like autopsies.Cheap!!
<br>
<br>Ok to the G-Mods.Compared to the MECs the G-Mods are not that strong.Some of them are nice but youll need the MELD for MECs.They are better, believe me.
<br>
<br>MELD on its own is cheply implementet too.Its.....just there.On some maps you can find it.Why?Its easy to get meld later with the ghost armor.I think thats an issue too.Balancing is not good.
<br>
<br>The medals are nice at first look.But later youll realize they that the bonus seems weak at first but in combination the bonus is realy high.Balancing issues here too.
<br>
<br>The new maps are nice.No complains here.But why are there not more maps in the main-game?The base-defense-mission is in my opinion the best mission in the entire game.It lacks nothing, you have to fight hard on this map.Great work but here too, thats not enough(same goes for the new mission in a little village with crysalits).
<br>
<br>The new campaigns are poorly implemented as well.The Slingshot DLC was not that good and here youll get 2 new campaigns:The EXALTs and the campaign with Annette and her group(3 missions in total).Both offer nearly no story.EXALT is there, thats all you know.You beat them(Why?Youll never know), a lame cutscene, thats it.Thats so cheap.
<br>
<br>And thats my final verdict for this &quot;Addon&quot;:Too much stuff that is poorly implementet and/or bad balanced.Too much things where i dont know why was it not in the maingame?Makes the addon the maingame better?YES, if youve loved the maingame.The addon deals with no issues from enemy unknown.Some bugs are still there, games crashes a few times.Get it when its on a discount, not for the full price.Not enough value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3850460">Expand</a></span>

First of all it &quot;IS&quot; a game on rails. Everything moves up with time and missions. As you get stronger the aliens get stronger and you never see the low level one again except the poisoner thin men. No more low level floaters, no more squishy aliens you encountered earlier just harder and more numerous ones like the zerk mutons. You basically do the same things over n over, go clear this site, go bring back this guy go inspect this downed ufo that you just downed with new and improved weapons that you didn&apos;t have in the beginning. You knew they were coming and you knew you would finally down a big ship.. Wow big news huh? lol.
<br>
<br>They act like that guy that beat impossible did something famous. But, really cmon, in todays world with so much hacking save game files and modding programs. How hard would it have been to alter that final screen with the scores on it and alter a save game file to delete all memorial deaths? I wouldn&apos;t believe that chit without sitting beside him and seeing him complete it myself.
<br>
<br>But, once again this is just another rail game of fire and miss. No real tactics like the old X-Coms where you had aim and standard shot and auto shot and kneel for better aim. No early alien attacks on your ship as soon as you opened the door. No more grenade lobbing aliens who tossed grenades like candy. Oh sure there&apos;s grenade lobbing aliens in this game but they sure as hell don&apos;t use them like the older X-COms, You had to be a real tactician and strategist to play the old X-Coms. An 8 year old can play and win this new one. Just like all games these days getting easier and easier for 8 year olds instead of making them for adults who have the money to buy them.
<br>
<br>If the game wasn&apos;t so much on rails and you had harder stuff to fight before you got the good stuff it might be more fun. But as it is it&apos;s just another wannabe rail game of connect point a to point b in this manner and this manner of time. Follow that path and you can&apos;t lose. Just a waste of time make believing you are some sort of tactical genius when an 8 year old can be one too. lol
<br>
<br>If you don&apos;t wait for bargain bin price of $4.99 to maybe $7.00 you are just wasting your money and showing what the kid you are that you have to have some new pop gun toy to go pew pew pew with. lol</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4009425">Expand</a></span>

I do regret that they didn&apos;t add an additional story arch to the game, however.  While the addition of a rival organization was a nice touch, it was pretty well the only portion of the story that was added.  What it boils down to is if you have beaten Enemy Unknown, you&apos;ve beaten Enemy Within.</span>

<br>
<br>Now then, the first thing I liked about this DLC was the fact at some point or another you actually get to defend inside your own base. It&apos;s just like the old X-com from the 90&apos;s. The whole &quot;LOOK MA I&apos;M A  ROBOT&quot; with cool, chunky looking mechs that could have come from a anime is a great touch!!! I also love the genetic changes that even further customize the look and play of your characters.
<br>
<br>My biggest love for this game is the well balanced difficulty and limited resources that really make you think before you buy gear and sell stuff on the grey market. If your really good at the game, it doesn&apos;t really matter what difficulty you play. Must of the time I just obliterate something the same turn I see it. (Classic). Overall, I would strongly recommend this game for those that love turn based and strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4058008">Expand</a></span>

First of all, this game won&apos;t try to claim it&apos;s another game in the series. This is an expansion and it&apos;s meant to be viewed that way. It adds alot of new things to the table. New units, new enemies, new maps, new challenges, etc. It gives you everything a good expansion should. However, with all the new units and how powerful they are out of the box, it can make the game a bit too easy. The challenge of the original game is dumbed down a bit for these new units and an increased time on R&amp;D is not enough of a drawback here. The biggest thing however is that the story doesn&apos;t change. While you are given a new faction to play against (the Exalt), you&apos;re still doing the same old missions, in the same old places, with the same old objectives, barring a few missions here and there. But this is an xpac for a reason and it doesn&apos;t try to be a full game, even if it&apos;s priced a bit too high right now for an xpac. This content is easily worth 20 bucks and it&apos;ll give you a reason to go back through the Xcom story. But the end results are the same here as in the first game so don&apos;t expect a brand new story. Expect a solid expansion that adds onto what was already there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3925975">Expand</a></span>

And this is coming from someone who played the original series at launch. Yet I have to admit that all the negative comments about how little content the $30 Enemy Within expansion adds are true I&apos;m afraid. Admittedly this expansion does have some genuinely fun new features, such as the MECs and new maps, but the game still ends at the Temple Ship. Still no Mars, No Cydonia. No continuation of the story line. I&apos;m sure Mars is coming in a future expansion, but not until the publishers can nickel and dime their customers relentlessly. Enemy Within represents such a tactic; $30 for not much at all. Imagine how much the Mars expansion will be? And the &quot;Enemy Within&quot; part is nothing more than a single XCOM base invasion by the aliens. Indeed it&apos;s a fun map, but base invasions were common in UFO Defense; it was one of the risks that occured regularly. It was a fun part of the game, always having to worry about the aliens finding your base. The Exalt forces part felt very halfhearted; not much depth to that part of the game at all. And I really dislike the sleeveless armor look that gene-modded soldiers get. Your forced to use it, and eventually I just stopped gene modding to avoid it. And to address some reviews griping about the difficulty, I didn&apos;t find it any more difficult than the original, especially with the MECs. I beat Classic much faster using them. To conclude, I felt like I was just playing through the original EU again when I played with this expansion. The new features, which are fun in and of themselves (save for the EXALT part), don&apos;t stand out at all considering the $30 price tag. And if you&apos;re like me and you lament features from the old game, they will come eventually, but at a cost. After you&apos;ve invested $100+ in future expansions, you might have something resembling the original UFO Defense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878625">Expand</a></span>

Certo i soldati geneticamente modificati e i mec sono belli da vedere e divertenti da usare in gioco, ma questi ultimi risultano troppo potenti abbassando il livello di sfida generale, e dopo un po&apos; il tutto comincia a diventare monotono. Apprezzabile il tentativo di bilanciamento aggiungendo nuovi nemici, aumentandone il numero e rendendone alcuni pi&#xF9; resistenti, ma alla fine la maggior parte delle situazioni viene risolta con una facilit&#xE0; davvero disarmante. Poco da aggiungere sul comparto sonoro rimasto immutato da Enemy Unknown, l&apos;unica introduzione riguarda il parlato nella lingua d&apos;origine dei soldati. Sulla grafica invece &#xE8; stato fatto solo un veloce lavoro di miglioramento su alcuni modelli e texture. Purtroppo rimangono immutati anche i bug, di cui un paio davvero gravi e fastidiosi. La telecamera continua a dare grossi problemi rendendo i comandi imprecisi, questo vuol dire che a volte i soldati faranno spostamenti o azioni in punti totalemte diversi da quelli indicati, con consguenze molto spesso catastrofiche. Un altro bug molto fastidioso da segnalare, introdotto con Enemy Within, riguarda il fatto che posizionando i soldati in alcuni punti della mappa, questi non riescono a vedere nemici a poca distanza da loro senza che vi sia nulla di mezzo ad ostacolarne la visione di tiro. Concludendo XCOM Enemy Within e un dlc che consiglierei di prendere solo a chi non ha mai provato nemmeno il gioco base, mentre chi ha gia giocato ad Enemy Unknown dovrebbe pensarci due volte, e considerare di spendere quasi 30&#x20AC; solo se si &#xE8; veri appassionati della serie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3975886">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yet it does offer new stuff (like medals, genetic mods for your soldiers) and minor fixes/improvements throughout. If you haven&apos;t played Enemy Unknown, you can safely skip it and start with this expansion as it has the same campaign, and more. Apparently they listened to feedback and fixed issues which were easy to fix. Like, you will now see how many hitpoints an alien will lose after your shot. Or, there is a button to take off all gear from soldiers in the barracks so that you could easier equip the squad you are sending on a mission.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is fun (your team of soldiers fights vs another team, you can even play as aliens), yet I disliked that there is too much randomness - and this can&apos;t be changed because randomness is the core of this game. When you shoot at the opponent&apos;s mob with 75% accuracy and miss, and then they shoot with 80% accuracy and miss, it reminds a circus and not a strategy game... Though such events happen not very often.
<br>
<br>This expansion isn&apos;t worth to buy for almost a full price of a game. However, I got both Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within in a bundle on sale. If you get it as a bundle, it&apos;s a fair deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=5880468">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Tons of bugs fixed, improved performance and polished graphics/ fx  its well worth the money especially in this blockbuster era of 8 hours longs campaigns and 2 map 4 costumes DLC. ^^</span>

<br>
<br>its still to short. its pretty. has some nice elements, With little replay value, it is still a dissapointing title due to its campaign length.
<br>
<br>dont get me wrong you will enjoy it, its really fun, interesting and imersive. but its aimed at making money, releasing a game and then adding content and charging people to have it added is like doing the smallest amount of work possible to make money.
<br>
<br>This is a bad business model and may be profitable in the short term but damages the integrity of any games releases which were built with great pride and attention to detail in the future. when will companies see that making a quick buck and fobbing people off, will acctually damage their chance at making record breaking releases of significant status that can easily out gross a quick fix, fly by night ideas sometimes up to x20 times.
<br>
<br>Well my point is if you do it, even it it works and people love it, youve still done it and now you think its a good business strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3867788">Expand</a></span>

<br>1) Bugs Bugs Bugs, some game-breaking, some just annoying. Overall feel like the game lacks polish and/or time. The original already had some bugs, but the expansion added new ones to the mix (I&apos;m looking at you double mission freeze crash).
<br>
<br>2) As others have said, game is not exactly good value for the amount of new content. I personally found it lacking in many areas, especially enemy variety (EXALT doesn&apos;t really count, they are just humans), more aliens would have been nice.
<br>
<br>I think it&apos;s worth a buy if you want an excuse to return to XCOM, some new features are nice.
<br>
<br>My suggestion: wait until it goes on sale, in the meantime you can download some excellent mods off the Nexus (long war is brutal but very well done) for free!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795353">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately the game is very easy, even in the normal level, especially the last level could be a bit more difficult.

<br>XCOM:EW is a fine strategy game with some plot.
<br>Its mechanics work.
<br>If you like this type of games, go buy it.</span>

When I first played Enemy Unknown, I happily paid the full price for what I felt was a true spiritual successor to the original.  Actually, I&apos;ll go one step further: it was an improvement on one of my favorite games of the 90s.  They released a handful of updates that were a few bucks for some new armor, or a little more for a minor chain of missions (Slingshot), but all and all I found myself struggling to beat Classic on Ironman, while having a fun time just killing anything with a pulse using base weapons on the easy level.
<br>
<br>So this expansion came out, it cost a pretty penny ($30), but it wasn&apos;t unreasonable.  When StarCraft: Broodwars came out, it cost $20, Bill Clinton was president, and the price of gasoline was 1/3rd what it is today.  In terms of content, yeah this game doesn&apos;t have quite as much as some other expansions, but I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to call this light or lacking in any respect.  There&apos;s considerable new content, and moreover, it&apos;s a chance for Firaxis to justify the labor costs of their developers for a while longer.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a fun game, and this expansion is only an improvement.  This isn&apos;t the nickle-and-dime strategy seen by EA or even Blizzard, and while it has its bugs (frustrating at times), the most egregious ones that I know about have been fixed by now, and the core gameplay hasn&apos;t been ruined as a result.  You&apos;re good game is an even better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3852375">Expand</a></span>

<br>The management section has a number of new options including mechanical and genetic augmentation, for further research upgrades to your soldiers, the choices with these alone are

<br>Now here is the big but, Currently on Steam this game has so many stability issues as to make it near unplayable, you can not save enough times, especially during the missions to actually counter the number of crashes.
<br>
<br>As an add on it deserves a high score for bringing more to an already great game. But I can only give it a
<br>5 while feeling generous doing so. If this is fixed in the new year you may have picked up a bargain in the Steam sale, if not you are left with wistful thoughts of what could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894381">Expand</a></span>

The weapons are well done (they feel different in effects), so it does matter very much how you compose your squad. The alien enemies are quite varied and require very different approach; the battlefields are also very various (and random). The improvements you research for your guns or armour really make a difference,  the genetic upgrades not so much, but they still are an interesting addition. Th new stuff compared tot the original Enemy Unknown really does have a big impact on the gameplay.
<br>What i love most about the game? The feeling of really getting sucked in, getting involved, especially during the fight. And the non-combat part, about building a base, raising an air fleet, doing research. And also the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; setting, with harsh men improving themselves technically, genetically and mentally against tough odds and fighting back.
<br>What i don&apos;t like about it? First off, the thing i&apos;m sure many other reviewers already said: the most elite squad of the Earth has...the worst shooters ever. The missing is way too common, too extreme and very, very frustrating: and i think this could have been easily avoided while keeping the same general odds by simply making the missing shots fewer and the alien enemies tougher (with more life/armour). Second, while the story is acceptable and pushes the game forward, many times i found the voice-over just annoying (especially dr. Vahlen has a screechy annoying voice), and cannot be skipped. so if i try a battle a few times for different approaches, i must listen over and over again lengthy, non-useful comments.
<br>Because of these 2 annoyances that could have been quite easily avoided, i&apos;ll rate it 9/10 instead of a full 10, but overall a great game in the 2k tradition (i&apos;m a big Civ fan).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=4031287">Expand</a></span>

I mean it is the most fun game I&apos;ve ever played in my 43 years of life but only when it&apos;s working properly. Most of the time the game works ok but when playing a supply barge mission or a terror mission the game crashes like 70-80% of the time. I have to restart system to continue playing. It&apos;s gets very frustrating after doing so many times.
<br>
<br>However, as frustrating as that is it&apos;s not nearly as bad as the base defense mission messing up. Base defense mission goes black every single time at beginning of mission after Bradford finishes his speech. It&apos;s impossible to continue. It ruins an entire game. It was working well before last patch but now it messes up every single friggin&apos; time. Exalt missions go black at beginning sometimes also.
<br>
<br>Also, MP mode is 100% broken. I haven&apos;t been able to even connect for an online game in 3 or 4 months. I&apos;ve finally given up on trying. Even when I could connect, there were certain bugs that made game unplayable. Like floaters being able to go to max elevation and remain invisible for the entire game even when they attack. I sent a tweet to both 2k forums and Ananda Gupta (lead designer) regarding these issues and they both ignored me. So... Firaxis and 2k have lost this customer for life. I will also never buy another game with either Gupta&apos;s or Jake Solomon&apos;s (EU mp mode was never properly supported either) name on it ever again.
<br>
<br>Since this game is very fun up until base defense mission comes up and ruins game I give it a 4 rating. There&apos;s no way I can possibly give it higher than that because base defense mission halts the game and it can&apos;t be continued.  Maybe XBOX and PC players have better luck  but I&apos;m not the only PS3 player that has serious issues with the game. Just check out 2k forums to see the multitude of players that have exact same problems with game. Be careful, though... The moderators there are a joke and give out infractions and bans like they think they&apos;re on a power trip or something.

Unfortunately, this game is plagued by several game-breaking bugs which tend not to make themselves apparent until you have invested at least a dozen hours into it.  One bug in particular happens during a mandatory mission, wherein the game goes to a black screen during the mission&apos;s beginning, and stays there.  The only known workaround is to not install the latest patch.  2K has been made aware of the issue (months ago, in fact, and by dozens of users), but no further information has been forthcoming.
<br>
<br>With this in mind, and though I do love what little of the game I HAVE been able to play, I sincerely cannot recommend it.

Enemy Within greatly improves on the somewhat simpler version of Xcom that was Enemy Unknown.
<br>
<br>The series, for those unfamiliar with it, is based on leading a secret covert operations group, known as Xcom, as it attempts to secretly defend earth from an alien invasion. The game does allude to all of this being top secret, which seems a bit ridiculous as you play through the game, but that doesn&apos;t really matter to the gameplay. You act as supreme commander of the Xcom project, managing and building up a base of operations, sending out satellites to detect alien presence, managing the happiness of funding countries, researching and leading squads of up to six soldiers into battle that can then be leveled up as they gain experience.
<br>
<br>The game, like any other game, has evolved with its modern iteration. It is a sharp, fun and responsive squad based strategy game that has streamlined a lot of the annoying micromanagement features of past games, but has also simplified things and put a cap on squad member leveling up. It is a more accessible, but simpler game than past generations.
<br>
<br>The game, in the most basic sense, plays like this. You have a base that you expand with various modules that you can build into your secret mountain hideaway. As you research new technologies new modules open up for upgrades or more efficient research. You launch satellites to gain funding from the various nation groups across the globe and to spot alien incursions. When incursions happen you deploy a squad of soldiers into a tactical, squad based &quot;seek cover and advance&quot; type gameplay that dictates a methodical approach to combat. As missions are failed or ignored panic will rise. Victories reduce panic. There are a handful of main story missions for advancing the game that are unlocked by certain milestones in the game, but the vast majority of missions are procedurally generated battles with aliens. There are basic research items, but as you kill aliens and do autopsies, capture and interrogate aliens, or shoot down and capture alien ships more research items are unlocked to gain better weapon and armor and new gadgets.
<br>
<br>There are four basic classes. Assault, heavy (machine gunners), snipers and support (medics) which each have their own skill trees that you can utilize as they level up. All four classes are needed across the game to face different situations. Medics to stabilize downed squad members, snipers to provide cover, heavies to deal huge damage in short bursts and assault troops to act as front line combat soldiers.. Later in the game psionic abilities are added which add some more variety to your soldiers, but psionic abilities are rare and only have three tiers. In Enemy Within a new addition is Meld which can be used to upgrade soldiers genetically or cybernetically. This adds a lot more variety to the class structures, allowing you to turn your favorite soldiers into cybernetic MEC&apos;s or upgrade them genetically to improve their abilities and durability. Personally, I found MEC&apos;s not terribly useful and fairly resource intensive in terms of Meld, which is a very limited resource, but the genetic alterations had great affects and were well worth the cost.
<br>
<br>The Enemy Within expansion also adds a good variety of missions if you count the smaller addons with it. There are new covert operations to locate and eliminate a secret organization known as Exalt that is out to hamper your efforts. There is also another series of missions focused on a Chinese criminal orgainization. Overall, they are nice addition of scripted, story missions.
<br>
<br>The aliens you face are variations on a few base models, but the variations offer enough change that the game continually changes and evolves as you proceed. New challenges are thrown at you every few missions that force you to think more carefully about how you combat the alien menace.
<br>
<br>The game looks good. It won&apos;t blow anyone away. It has its own style, but nothing that really sticks out as uniquely distinct. The technical side of the graphics are good enough and slightly better than your run of the mill top down game. Sound effects are well done and add to the experience and the voice acting is well done with squad members reacting to the battle.
<br>
<br>The controls on the PC are very easy to work with. Consoles are also surprisingly good, though moving the cursor around with the joysticks can be slow. The iPad controls are cumbersome and you can end up moving soldiers to areas you don&apos;t mean to because you have to press an area twice to move there.
<br>
<br>Enemy Within is a much improved version of Enemy Unknown. It adds additional complexity, options, missions types and squad improvements to the game. Ultimately, the game is still on the simple side, but the added content really pushes the game into the replayable multiple times enjoyment level. I would recommend for strategy fans who may have been turned off by Enemy Unknown&apos;s simplicity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=5008390">Expand</a></span>

<br>Let me explain how my</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Enemy Unknown was a brilliant game and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. That one I played all the way on classic and without ironman, so for EW I figured I was ready for ironman. Well, frankly, it takes about 3 playthroughs to be &quot;ready&quot; per se. Wanna know why that is? Because EW surprises you with random **** that is guaranteed to be fatal for your campaign.
<br>
<br>Let me explain how my classic ironman campaign suffered a sudden death. It all started with a terror mission in the police station map (the one consisting of a large open two story building with a pillared facade, a one-story side room and an alley to the right). Now I&apos;ve had difficulties with this map before, seeing elite mutons, chryssalids, floaters and all kinds of crazy coming out of that building, but this round was rather special. There was nothing but chryssalids. Just 18 civilians and an estimate of 16 chryssalids. I would never in my wildest dreams have imagined such a scenario, so consider me shocked when I saw three chryssalids storming out of the side room and taking about 5 steps from the door, ready to land insane crits on 3 of my guys next turn. One already got pierced at the door the moment I ended my first turn (which also makes me wonder: this was the first time an enemy that was not triggered on my turn was able to attack me - the chryssalid who killed that unit was triggered by vision provided by the three chryssalids who barged out of the side room at the end of my first turn and enabling sight into the room that contained two more).
<br>
<br>As if the events in front of the side room were not bad enough, I had three-four more chryssalids jump down the walls and running out of the front side of the building.
<br>
<br>I barely managed to kill all 6 or 7 chryssalids that appeared on my screen there - only thanks to the heavy firepower from two of my colonel heavies.
<br>
<br>Guess what happens next turn. That&apos;s right, about 6 more chryssalids deicide to ignore the civvies in the building and just dash outside and in front of my units. Couple of turns after that I lose one corporal and another colonels who had been with me since the beginning. I&apos;m forced to dash to the evac and abandon another colonel, Zhang, who ended up being surrounded by 3 zombies because I needed his rockets to blow away the hordes of chryssalids coming at me every single turn.
<br>
<br>Fun mission, but I deicided to get over it and push on. Next mission I get one of those advent evac missions. As usual, I&apos;m very careful with my positioning, but with missions like these they matter jack **** Not only am I told these exalt troops are genetically enhanced (which is &quot;great&quot; news after just losing two colonels), their snipers can move and shoot at the same turn, despite otherwise playing on the same field as the xcom troops. But that&apos;s not the issue, the issue is the sheer number of those bastards coming at you. Not only does the game drop about 10 of them at the same time, they are also dropped in BEHIND YOU. That leaves you with two options: you somehow blast those flankers or you risk getting wrecked by multiple overwatches trying to find better cover (in my case going to the only other cover revealed three more exalts camping out at an alley...). Basically exalt had every single position covered and death ensued.
<br>
<br>But what I loved ABOVE ALL about that evac mission was the intel given to me by Central. BRADFORD YOU BASTARD. I **** you not: twice did he have the occasion to tell me &quot;That should be the last of their reinforcements.&quot;  BRADFORD U ALREADY SAID THAT AND I JUST FINISHED DEALING WITH THOSE PREVIOUS REINFORCEMENTS!!!
<br>
<br>The result of that mission was total wipeout and 7 xcom operatives dead - couldn&apos;t even evac because the evac zone was on the opposite end of the area I was supposed to defend. And the evac area was also out in the open.
<br>
<br>It didn&apos;t get any better from there - the game is so good at mercilessly punishing you for failing.
<br>
<br>After that failed evac mission I am approaching the end of the month. As I&apos;m researching the advanced interceptors I am once again surprised with three consecutive large or very large UFOs, which I all have to ignore because frankly there isn&apos;t much you can do with those figher jets, even with items. Month ends, I lose two funding nations.
<br>
<br>Ironically the month started with 666 currency with a monthly 666 income. In total I now have over 800 currency. Two days later I get sabotaged by exalt, who take FRICKING HALF OF MY MONEY. I&apos;m now left with just 400, which is not going to get me through the next month considering the number of recent setbacks.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not even going to mention all the bugs I never saw in EU.
<br>
<br>I suggest you don&apos;t try this in ironman the first or second playthrough. In my case it&apos;s the surprises that ruin the game entirely. It&apos;s only very late into the game that you can get some intel on what you&apos;re going up against, and even that is only in ufo crash missions. Otherwise you&apos;re going in fingers crossed</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-within/user-reviews?user_review_id=6156436">Expand</a></span>
