Mouse controls are just excellent, although some players complain that they&apos;re too good and make joysticks redundant in Arcade mode.
<br>
<br>Three realism modes  Arcade, Historical, and Full Realism will appeal to a very broad range of players. There are also single missions and campaigns (some of which you have to pay extra for..which is fine) but they net meagre rewards and are not worthwhile at the moment. And if you want to progress in War Thunder you really need to be earning those XP points...which brings me to the downsides.
<br>
<br>What stops me from giving it a positive score is what happens outside of battles, namely the progression and economy models. Although at first leveling up is a pretty quick affair, with each level it becomes more and more time consuming. It gets pretty bad, to the point where without paying for the game reaching maximum level in one nation will take you half a year. Some can live with that...but then there&apos;s the crew level problem. You can buy crew levels with real cash, all the way to the top, skipping that part of the grind entirely  which is borderline pay to win.
<br>
<br>Other aspects of the progression model are equally strange. Crew skills and their effect on plane performance are undocumented. You have 5-6 crews and each can qualify for a dozen planes on different levels which leads to heaps of confusion. You take a hangar of 5-6 planes into each battle, usualy they are at different tiers and some players tend to exploit this to get better matchmaking. Ah, yes, matchmaking....it doesn&apos;t work very well, mainly because it has to balance players bringing their tier 1 and tier 10 plane into the same battle.
<br>
<br>On top of everything else although the game just went on Steam and has all the aspects of an almost finished commercial product, the developer makes huge changes to the economy on the fly. You can sink a lot of money into the game and you never really know what you&apos;re getting, since the economy model can get dramatically overhauled at any time.
<br>
<br>I would strongly suggest giving it a try, the visuals and spectacular gameplay are things you really should experience. But don&apos;t stay too long or you may start to feel unwelcome. And think twice...no, think THRICE before opening your wallet.
<br>
<br>Fly safe!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3432711">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To be able to fly certain aircraft for a side such as the U.S  You start with a lower tiered aircraft such as the P-26 Peashooter. You gain &quot;XP&quot; as you successfully complete mission etc, When you have enough xp
<br>for a level you gain a new level, unlocking a few new aircraft you can fly.
<br>
<br>If you want to fly for the British, Japanese or Russians you have to start at level 1, just as above, and gain
<br>xp  one level at a time until you unlock all the aircraft.
<br>
<br>If you want to fly full real battles, be prepared for a wait.
<br>
<br>If you want to gain xp faster, you can pay to get premium account usage which will gain xp faster for you.
<br>
<br>When I logged on to write this, there was maybe 35 people on, mainly in the arcade battles. If you want
<br>arcade action this is the game for you.
<br>
<br>Had this been a paying mmo, with all the cut scenes taken out of the campaigns, xp done away with, and all the planes opened to the player base, even keeping the arcade, historical and realistic aspects of flight,
<br>maybe I&apos;d have subscribed, but I&apos;m forever done with this frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3817170">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you like to play with a joystick don&apos;t get this game.   You are outmatched by their mouse aim system, that is accurate but wobbles all over if played in Historical Battles.
<br>I asked the developers when they are finished with the beta and was told that War Thunder is a perpetual beta.
<br>The Gaijin company is a very poor company with a bad attitude towards its customers.  They are rude and dictatorial.  They censor the forums heavily.
<br>This game has or had potential.  It is about 33% of what I would like to see.   I therefore give it a solid 3 out of ten and the graphics are very nice.   Otherwise I would give it a zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515688">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>They simply copied the greedy wargaming games down to a tee business model and all even nailed the website it really is pretty hilarious and make no mistake about just because there&apos;s no gold bullets or other insane whale extravaganza this time around does not make it any less of the same old pay to win core mechanics to the bones so this will without doubt make the pay to win crowd a bunch of sad little whales.
<br>
<br>The imbalance between tiers nations gold planes premium accounts is at the very best incompetent at worst it&apos;s the same old you&apos;ll get so frustrated getting owned by horrendously overpowered whales that you&apos;ll pay up in the hope that the game will even out for a while or get better sometime down the road but it wont I promise you as it is in fact broken by design as generating maximum profit is what pay to win games are all about while hiding out under false pretences.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s quite funny how they get away branding these games as MMOs when all they are is first person shot em ups only close resemblance they ever had to any MMOs is the massive grind and the price point is straight up fairytale like now take Guild Wars 2 a real MMO that you can do for like 40 bucks which is a very fair price point while you&apos;ll have to pay infinity more for this half baked copy pay to win title if you don&apos;t like to waste double infinity time as whale fodder that is and yes you the player happen to be the actually game content remember thou it&apos;s just a money game in the end and that&apos;s no fun.

<br>now the negative points in short: **** community, **** gameplay, **** balance, **** mods/supprters/developers, **** premium (as in op and expensive as hell) and buggy as hell. it gets worse with every update and gaijin seems to care less and less.
<br>details:
<br>-**** community: friendly fire is the war thunder way to say hello. also you have to pay for the repairs yourself. also you can&apos;t disable friendly fire. also, reporting friendly firing teammates will make your team a lot weaker than it already is after all the quitters left. also there is no way of joining a normal game later. so you&apos;re pretty much **** if you have an **** on your team. i usually have 2.
<br>-**** gameplay: wow, cool, as if camping and sniping for hours without end in other games wasn&apos;t boring enough, you can now do it in a tank that takes 5-60 seconds to reload after every shot depending on how **** you are. **** yay.
<br>yay king of the hill mode, like i haven&apos;t seen that one before. yay domination, something new. yay, there is literally nothing interesting in this game, except if you like to drive 10 mins with a tank at 15mph to try to flank the enemy just to get one-shot.
<br>also: one shots. you&apos;ll get one-shot all over the place, doesn&apos;t matter if the enemy is right in front of you or a mile away. you&apos;ll get one-shot through buildings, the floor, debris, dead tanks, and even ricochet from a friendly unit.
<br>-**** balance: t34 best tank in the world. world war winning tank with stalinium armor and cryptonite ammo. nuff said. the russian bias is real - who would&apos;ve thought it, it&apos;s a russian game after all.
<br>interestingly gaijin writes about tanks at level 1.0 (&quot;battke ranking&quot;) that are able to deal with tanks at level 3 (which is true). but they dont change the level of that tank. nope. seems about right.
<br>also tank levels seem to change with every day passing and depending even of game type you&apos;re playing, but you cannot look up the real facts, when that very tank has what level, so that after you made a decent team and joined a game, you see that the levels are all over the place and your once balanced team suddenly has one very high level member and you now have to fight other players that have way stronger units, not as if one-shotting wasn&apos;t a huge issue anyway, now you cant even retaliate.
<br>-**** supporters/mods/developers: there is actually a forum where you can post all your bug reports just to have them ignored. yay. each update comes with new bugs. yay. old ones rarely get fixed. nay.
<br>-**** premium: how about you pay a **** of money to get great units to fight real **** ones? great, isn&apos;t it? you&apos;re invincible and can one-shot everybody for some cash. also, you can buy the whole game for millions of dollers. awesome. some people actually grind all the stuff for years on end. yeah, **** them, amirite gaijin
<br>
<br>also who the **** came up with these ideas:
<br>spawning points are not possible to get artillerized, but can very well can get bombed.
<br>airplanes should start out being built out of wood, so that you catch on fire the first 100 times you fly it until you have researched the last def-upgrade. same applies for tanks, except there you can&apos;t upgrade you def normally, but fire extinguishers aren&apos;t available from the start either. also you cant repair your tank from the start either, everything has to be researched
<br>you can help your squadmate repair, but not your other teammates. it&apos;s also not possible to repair a tank if you havent made that specific upgrade, even if your squad mate has the same tank as you do and is around to help but you cant start repairing.
<br>fires cant be put out under water
<br>your crew drowns literally in 3 seconds
<br>maps usually look like each team just came from their respective base to the battle, still you start out with tanks all over the place, srsly, noone drives a tank backwards to battle, not even the ai, not even 90&#xB0; tilted. also you spawn on/in eachother which gaijin only could solve by making your tank impervious to damage for some time at spawn - great, but useless against all spawnkillers and &quot;traffic jams&quot; at game start.
<br>if your tank&apos;s tires/chain is damaged your crew immediately refurse any orders for a second and stop driving to start repairing it asap. nice feature, right? nope, you cant hide like this from enemy fire, you cant put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire. you&apos;ll have to wait 4 seconds to be able to do anything. also, crew doesn&apos;t give a damn if literally everything else is destroyed, but hell brakes loose if the chain is loose.
<br>killing ai will not give you any points whatsoever for researching your already very weakly starting new units, so that it&apos;s even more of a pain to try and use new units. also, most matches have like 50% ai, which makes for very boring , since not very intelligent, play.

Also &quot;free to play&quot; can be questioned, while most of the premium tanks cost almost 50e each meta game have been made impossible to reach whitout subscription or spending money on golden eagles.</span>

<br>
<br>When I started to play this game, there were only planes from the start of the ww2 to the cold-war era planes. It was fun to play, had nice graphics, and good optimisation.
<br>You could unlock whole research tree in the less than a week, you had daily 2x exp bonus, sometimes even 3 or 5 during the events.
<br>
<br>But then the Gajin greed attacked, and everything changed. One day, they &quot;reworked&quot; research system, and made it super grindy, like 4 days of playing to get one Era 5 plane or Tank. They removed daily bonus exp, increased prices of all vehicles, and I dont even remember the last time they made some event with +% to gain.
<br>Of course you can buy premium to get 200% of &quot;Research Points&quot; boost, but I dont recommend that.
<br>
<br>They said that things like ATGM tanks will never be added, guess what ? they lied. In next update that you might call &quot;Flaming Wallets&quot; those machines will be added, and they will be ruining all the fun for you.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re reading this, remember DO NOT BUY A SINGLE THING FOR REAL MONEY. You will only waste it.
<br>
<br>Now lets go to the game play part. You have 3 modes, Arcade/Realistic/Simulator. And honestly ? all of them are arcadish, but in Realistic/Simulator you doesn&apos;t have unlimited ammo, and aiming help.
<br>Another thing is MM, you will be fighting against much better vehicles than yours, most of times. Especially on early Era 5 tanks, or planes(if you even get one of those, because it takes a lot of time).
<br>
<br>So now you&apos;ve been warned about methods of this company called Gajin. If you pay for something in this game with real money, don&apos;t cry later that you wasted it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=6452288">Expand</a></span>

But online gameplay has been destroyed over mixing very high rated players with very low rated players. And they have turned the game into a buy to win. It used to be anyone could win and get upgrades as long as they worked for it, Now it takes a free to play player forever and ever. And you now get burned out long before you ever get any upgrades or new planes. And to add insult to injury the game packages they sale are way overpriced! This is why I hate any online gaming scenario! Because in the end the greed of the devs always destroys the game for the players. And to add more insult to injury many players are using aimbots while Gajin continues to deny aimbots exist. And any member that mentions this will get attacked by several fan boys. You even get threatened of being banned for mentioning it. So it&apos;s safe to say War Thunder has been completely destroyed by it&apos;s own developers. You don&apos;t take away everything from the player unless they pay for a overpriced package! And you don&apos;t call the people who play and support your game liars and threaten them simply for pointing out about aimbots!  So it&apos;s safe to say War Thunder has been completely destroyed by it&apos;s own developers. The players become less and less each day. Eventually the snake will eat it&apos;s own tail unless Gaijin finally decides to get their heads out of their own sphincters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=6626803">Expand</a></span>

If it wasn&apos;t for the virus/Trojan it comes with I would probably have rated it a 6 due mainly to poor balancing and how.  I played it mostly for the air combat and found Russian planes insanely OP compared to all others. Big surprise after doing my research, it was a Russian company making the game.
<br>
<br>The Trojan it installs on your machine is called Gaijin.net . It enables itself w/o permission to start when you start your computer. It is a known problem if you google search it before getting the game and you will see the moderators act like you can just disable a check box and it will go away then they lock the forum thread to keep people from talking about it.
<br>
<br>So I unchecked the box they suggested, rebooted and it didn&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>I followed that by unchecking ALL the boxes on that page, but that also didn&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>I finally uninstalled the game because of it. After doing that I rebooted to find it still there loading up when computer starts. StILL THERE AFTER UNINSTALLING GAME, think about that for a second.
<br>
<br>I then had to turn on &quot;see hidden files and folders&quot; then go manually find it and delete that folder. And even after that, and to this day it is still on my brand new computer hiding somewhere inside my windows 10. Even had a guy from Microsoft using remote access and controlling my computer and he couldn&apos;t find where its hiding. Best I could do in the end is Win key + R, then msconfig and disable it from starting up when computer does.
<br>
<br>0/10, would NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VIRUS AGAIN!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=7387577">Expand</a></span>

The balance between ranks and tanks were acceptable. After a few updates, it got unplayable. There are some overpowered tanks that one-shot you no matter what tank you have and also everything got much more harder to achieve. So this is why I rated on 0.

They listened to the community sometimes, but now... too many bad changes and patches that don&apos;t seem to be letting up any time soon. Now they refuse to listen to the community. Even going back and playing the old planes isn&apos;t fun for me. The matchmaking changes have been horrible, and (as much as its overstated sometimes), there&apos;s a debatable Russian bias and they straight up retcon history sometimes.
<br>
<br>I love the game to death, but as long as its in the hands of such an unorganized and dysfunctional development team, that won&apos;t be happening any time soon. This game is the epitome of one of those FPS&apos;s that seem promising for the first few months, and then you realize how much of a grind it really is.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not even just the fact that it&apos;s a grind, it&apos;s not about taking forever to unlock planes, it&apos;s not about the fact that it will take the average user about a year to get their first jet, because it&apos;s possible to have fun in this game without jets. In fact, jets are one of the most unbalanced and un-fun parts of this game, besides ground forces. The early tiers are some of the most fun, in fact. That&apos;s why you so often see players with about 100 hours or less giving WarThunder positive reviews, yet as you go up through the hours, most of those players start giving negative reviews.
<br>
<br>The real issues lie in the dev team&apos;s unwillingness to listen to the community, their horrid, horrid, HORRID mod team who watch over their forums like hawks and strike down almost all criticisms of the game with impunity, it lies in the fact that they&apos;ve made some painfully obvious cash grabs in the game, like making it so you have to pay for country flags because &quot;teamkilling was an issue.&quot; We offer criticisms and ways to fix the issues, they give us bans, longer grinds, and horrible BRs.
<br>
<br>The dev team&apos;s unwillingness to not only fix the FM issues, but even their complete failure to acknowledge them, means that the game is doomed if it continues on the path it&apos;s currently on. BRs are complete trash, if you aren&apos;t flying the flavor of the month plane then you might as well not be flying. If you&apos;re not driving a Russian tank, you might as well not be driving.
<br>
<br>Now, because of Gaijin&apos;s failures, hundreds of veterans like me are jumping ship. Not because we don&apos;t care about the game anymore, but because Gaijin doesn&apos;t. Most bad reviews of this game are from players who has played for a long time, and most of the good ones are from complete new users who are still able to enjoy the game before they realize how truly bad the situation is.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also pretty mad at the fact that Japan gets **** over soooooo much. Germany has been getting pounded on, or at least was last time I played, Russia has always had curbstomping abilities over the other nations, and the US flip flops depending on the tier. British are just everywhere. I personally stopped playing consistently about the time when ground forces started having the issue with the foliage, where you would be at a severe disadvantage (and I&apos;m talking gamebreaking severe) if you kept your grass/foliage on. I have logged on a handful of times since, but only for 2-3 rounds and then I just get tired and sad. I want the game to be good. The sad thing is, though I have been playing for 2-3 even back then and through the years, I can never truly say the game has felt completely good. There have always been a number of broken FMs, the economy has gone through various levels of **** one nation is always curbstomping another, etc.
<br>Gaijin&apos;s PR is horrible, especially with their whole &quot;guys, don&apos;t judge, we&apos;re still in Beta&quot; excuse which has been **** bull**** ever since you&apos;ve been able to pay to get ahead in the game. It&apos;s been bull**** ever since they started using it as an excuse to disregard their personal flaws and using it as a way to completely shift the blame from them over to the community. It&apos;s been bull**** because most games in beta survey the userbase, asking for feedback, while Gaijin denies feedback at every opportunity. Ever since their PR team straight up quit the subreddit, calling it a &quot;toxic environment&quot;, most likely due to the fact that they were unable to control what was said (unlike their forums, where they have total control and use that control freely), there was no hope for their PR team. A development team that will readily call their community, who offers criticisms and only wants to help the game get better (though I do concede that a lot of the players will get pissy after a bad patch, but who can really blame them?) isn&apos;t fit to run a game.
<br>
<br>I really do want this game to be good. But as long as it continues on the path it&apos;s currently treading on, I will not recommend it, or play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=5511377">Expand</a></span>

There is a total disregard of the player base, changes that are proposed by the community not only are not implemented, they are actually changed for worse. Currently only certain groups of tanks are playable at all, most of the other ones will be matched against machines that are years more advanced. So if you would like to see how would it feel like to take a WW2 tank and bring it to North Korean war than go right ahead, assuming you can stand the ~300 hours of grind it will take to get those tanks unlocked anyway. Planes can be fun but suffer from the same matchmaking problem, later models might even end up fighting prop vs jet... Overall there is a lot of good things in this game but as an online game that is driven by its developer currently it has a very grim looking future as player base about had it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=5512775">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was hoping War Thunder doesn&apos;t fall down the same slippery slope pay-to-win game like World of Tanks, but it seems like they are thinking about money more than gameplay.
<br>The game claims to be a &quot;open beta&quot; stage for quite a while now. If you&apos;d do some research, you would find out that it&apos;s part of the money making scheme. Since being an open beta, while taking cash like a fully patched-finished platinum title encourages them to keep the game in a beta-stage and dodge complaints by claiming &quot;hey, it&apos;s a beta&quot;! &quot;What did you expect?&quot;
<br>I&apos;m not a conspiracy theorist, but logically thinking- and just counting how some companies trying to find a way not go under funded and loose money, the logical answer why this game is still in beta stages is: Because it&apos;s profitable. If you haven&apos;t figured this out yet, maybe you will in a year or 2. You can carve it in stone so you will remember that I said it first.
<br>So, Back to this free-to-play game.
<br>The pluses I give to credit where credit is due is just the game engine, graphics, and finding the compromise between realism and playability, when it comes to controls. The planes feel real. Medium/heavy bombers feel heavy and cumbersome, fighters feel agile - according to their tech level and design. You&apos;d expect a bi-plane to be highly manouverable, while you&apos;d expect a mid-tier  late &apos;40s fighter to be fast and well armed.  You&apos;ll find these in the game and it&apos;s done just as well as in many previous Russian-origin simulator titles, such as IL2-Sturmovik or the predecessor of WoT- Wings of Prey.
<br>The game can be quite addicting...for a while. The graphics, the sense of speed and satisfaction after a good bombing run or a well placed burst taking down an enemy bogey can make you want more.
<br>Unfortunately, my list of positives coming to an abrupt end, since the gameplay will get quite repetative, especially if you think, you can get away without paying for a premium account.
<br>Again, I&apos;m not revewing this game as a typical game, which usually go for 40-50 dollars, but the free-to-play &quot;beta&quot; game.
<br>Let me state this: You won&apos;t get too far without a premium account. And if you won&apos;t believe me, ask others, who played it forever. Watch youtube videos, read the forums. You CANNOT progress too far without a premium account, unless you are ready for the punishment of grinding for quie a long time and being stuck in the same aircraft, that you &quot;may&quot; not like or end up facing superior - upper tier crafts, which will shred you to pieces within the first 30 seconds.
<br>For those who have no idea what I&apos;m talking about.
<br>1. The game set up, so there are ties- depending on the aircrafts available for axis and allies. Starting with pre-war airplanes with similar capabilities put into categories, you can fly them (regardless of nationality or historical alliances) to do a team-battle against each other  in arcade mode. (the simulator mode and historical modes are different, I&apos;m writing about the arcade type of game, which is by far- the most popular part). After you return from the battlefield, you gain experience by shooting other planes or ground targets or completing game objectives (bomb the airfield, land and take the airfield etc). Once you gained some experienced, you have to &quot;research&quot; the next tier aircraft available and then buy it. After buying the next tier aircraft, you may be put into battles with planes with similar capabilities in the next tie.
<br>The problem is, that you may have worked on and spent and researched 1 aircraft, while you had 3 or 3 &quot;free&quot; tier 1 craft and now you got 4 aircraft , with one being tier 2, while the others are tier 1.
<br>And that will force you to either send your tier 2 craft to &quot;holiday&quot; - and keep fighting with your tier 1 planes against tier 1 planes and you won&apos;t be able to fly your new tier 2 plane.  If you decide to step up, then you gonna have to face the reality, that you got 1 tier 2 plane and 3 or 4 tier 1 planes, which are far inferior to be played on the map- designed to be played by tier 2 planes. And planes go down fast, I mean, you want to stay in the game for at least 10 minutes, then you need at least 3-4 planes available for each battle. If you are stuck with only one capable craft and 3 low-level planes, then you gonna end up struggling until you earn enough credits to replace all 3 - tier 1 planes with something better. If you can think you can play anyway - be my guest- I have done it. I have gone the hard way to earn my tier 2 crafts and it took me forever, not mentioning that many times my gameplay on a battle was no longer than 2-3 minutes, due to my tier 1 craft being a target practice dummy for superior aircrafts on the map.  Just think about it flying against BF109 or Spitfire with a bi-plane from the 30s. If that sounds hilarious, you&apos;re right. But this game will force you to do that, because - drumroll- you don&apos;t have a Premium Account to buy planes for real $$!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267239">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Grind: The grind to get new vehicles becomes almost unbearable once you hit the third tier of vehicles. Even with a premium account, you can expect to play at least 25 matches to earn a single tier 3 plane. And as you can probably guess, tiers 4 and 5 are horrendous. My recommendation? Up the number of research points by at least 5 times the current amounts, and then for free accounts. Premium accounts should be done at roughly 10 times the current rate.
<br>
<br>Micro transactions: Buying a premium plane simply is not worth it. Half of them do not even have the proper loadouts, and most never flew, or flew sparingly as test aircraft only.
<br>
<br>this game is not worth your time. Stick with actual simulator battles by a committed company, not one merely in it for the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=5210175">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played War Thunder for almost a year now.  Mostly it has been great, solid gameplay nice variety, etc....up until they changed the research tree to slow down progress of players.  Now, instead of choosing how research points are allocated, you choose a plane to begin researching, and even researching a tier 3 plane (out of 5 total tiers) takes nearly 100 battles to obtain, and because of game mechanics you&apos;ll want at least 3 of those planes researched.  As battles can take 10-20 minutes each, the game expects you to play 50-100 hours just to go up ONE TIER IN ONE COUNTRY.  Yet, it only costs $5 USD to research that same plane with &quot;free&quot; research points.  They turned an excellent simulator into an obvious money grab, and it is unacceptable.  Playing to unlock new planes is nearly pointless now.
<br>
<br>Gameplay would make this an 8 or a 9, but the money-grab tactics bring that down to a 6.  Only get the game if you love pumping at least $100 into a game to make it playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4052273">Expand</a></span>

The game overall looks good and has plenty of vehicles but the company is THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL i&apos;ve ever seen: they&apos;re telling lies within the &quot;news&quot;, they&apos;re actually putting into the game things that the whole community is asking ... but the opposite; and they&apos;re enforcing all that with misinformation, misleading and wild banning over the forums.
<br>
<br>DON&apos;T and i repeat, DON&apos;T spend 1&#x20AC; into the game. Play it if you like, until the paywall and grind is so high that you&apos;ll be forced to stop, then leave. Don&apos;t never ever think to go and actually &quot;care&quot; about the game by browsing the forums or participate at the &quot;events&quot; they&apos;ll eventually organize, 3/4 of them are just a trap and you&apos;ll feel fooled and ripped off at the end of them.
<br>
<br>If you like actual WoT style gameplay that&apos;s the game for you, with a tons of bugs ofc but hey ! From patch 1.53 onward there will be invisible tanks, camos, pay-to-win &quot;skill&quot; to see the enemy tanks and pay-to-win qualifications to boost that skill. You&apos;ll find absolutely no real &quot;simulation&quot; into the game (apart from the good 3D models): all the hidden &quot;numbers&quot; in the code are just arbitrary like a lot of the things in the game. You&apos;ll find that almost all the russian tanks perform &quot;extremely well&quot; without a real reason (the game is russian).
<br>
<br>TLDR: it&apos;s a trap run by freaking mongoloids that is sinking thanks to their incompetence.

<br>But things change and War Thunder has gone the bad way:
<br>-
<br>1. Community management is terrible. All those talks about forum dictatorship are true - even objective criticism is not welcome there. CMs allow themselves mocking comments like &quot;win&quot; in regard to the questions like &quot;What should I do on Me.262 versus far more advanced post-war jets&quot; or &quot;just donate&quot; and etc.
<br>-
<br>2. Economy/research has turned into a disguised cash grab. Unlocking mid- and especially high-tier units requires a lot of grind forcing you to donate if you want to skip it at least a bit. Worst thing is that from patch to patch the research efficiency keeps droping.
<br>-
<br>3. The praised historical and realistic focus of this game is mostly gone. Some historical units like A-26 or BTD-1 are premium only while standard unit trees got DOZENS of prototypes and &apos;paper planes&apos;. Also get ready for things like 1944 German planes fighting post-war aircraft they never met IRL. And they&apos;re doing it based on self-determined &apos;battle rating&apos; of those units for the sake of &apos;balance&apos;...
<br>-
<br>4. ...Which is by the way pretty broken despite they chose not to be bound by historical limits. You could see things like F-2H Banshee jet with 4 cannons and a thrust-to-weight ratio of War Thunder&apos;s TOP JET, MiG-15, fighting piston engine planes... That was fixed not so long ago, but it is just one example, many others remain.
<br>-
<br>5. Game is losing player base, new content is added pretty slowly, problems aren&apos;t solved and the general dynamic of things is negative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=5637365">Expand</a></span>

But as a game it kinda stinks, since game-play is totally repetitive (go into battle; shoot things down; get shot down; repeat; see the same map; use the same planes; repeat again; get bored; repeat again again) and since imbalances in favor of certain nations / airplanes are never addressed by the developers. The community of players is rapidly learning to shut up about the game&apos;s weaknesses, because negative feedback leads to immediately falsified records which support bans or similar control-the-community measures. Try to submit a bug report? Get banned! Ask in public why you got banned? Get banned again!
<br>
<br>Wait? What about money? Can they ban you if you paid something? Yes. See, War Thunder claims to be in perpetual Beta, but it&apos;ll take your money! And then change the game so that the cool new plane you just bought is no longer half as effective. Pay at your own risk ... a funny but futile attempt by members of a rather non-market-oriented culture to create &quot;market friendly&quot; goods, by DEMANDING that the market be SUPPLIED with their product. See, supply-and-demand? Right ... you silly Russkies, that&apos;s NOT how it&apos;s supposed to work!
<br>
<br>I think it could be a great game because it has such a great simulator-engine running behind all the airplanes. But because the people making the simulator don&apos;t know how to make a decent game, the only thing they&apos;ve got is an excellent simulator masquerading as an annoying game that will slowly die because of their dreadfully abusive attitude toward their player-base. Pay money? Get banned!

<br>Going from Tier 1 to Tier 2, or Tier 2 to Tier 3, is going to give you a kick in the teeth, as your amazing planes, fully upgraded, from the last Tier, are now useless, and you also have a just as useless new, higher tier plane.

<br>This game used to be fun (still is fun at most times) and something I&apos;d love to sink some time into, even on my own. But nowadays.. Eh, not really. The balancing is horrible, the progression is horrible, and if you want to be in a good plane, you have to play Russians.

Micro-transactions are actually rather &apos;macro&apos;.
<br>If you want to get your crew a bit better you may try to gain experience, but that comes so thinly that after days of fights you may at best progress 1% towards one fully upgraded crew. And you need more than one crew to play. Then there is the experience where free XP can only be used for progression after you pay Golden Eagles, which can be obtained for cash only. (unless you are BFF with the developers)
<br>So I thought &#xA3;50 would get me neatly ahead. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It was gone in a level or two; I was still stuck with crap planes. But, hell, you can get an F-86 on the end, and I&apos;m no quitter, so I&apos;ve payed again and again... and I ended up on blowing around &#xA3;200 on a game that was actually a crappy flight sim.
<br>Okay at this point you will say that it&apos;s just because I am a crap gamer. Which could be true, however the crap community, the returning frustrations proved otherwise. After 3 months one supposed to show some progress after all, shouldn&apos;t he? But then, after getting really upset at the game I have uninstalled it. Then, after 4 months I thought I would give it a last try, I would just log in to check my account and see if anything changed for the better. And this is what put me off of this scam forever.
<br>My crews plane skills were gone. Basically all the planes that I purchased were suddenly non-flyable, unless I spend another &#xA3;50-100 on purchasing new skills. Due to the constant modifications and &apos;perpetual beta&apos; all the progress I had were annulled.
<br>I&apos;ve learned my lesson. Coming from Hungary I know it&apos;s a well-established Eastern European ripoff. You&apos;ll end up paying thrice. The &apos;perpetual beta&apos; is the perfect excuse to constantly hinder players in any progress and rip them off with the promise of better content that will never materialise.
<br>Do not spend a single dime on this game. It is a ripoff and a scam. Rather try Guild wars 2 or SWtOR; or buy Flight Simulator, X-Plane, or Lock-on Modern Air Combat; all of them way cheaper and better both as games and simulators.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4019011">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all, Gaijin&apos;s development circle is bogus, for almost 2 years since the game went into &quot;Beta&quot; (the term Beta is used for marketing purposes here) the game only added around 150 planes, most of which are versions/copies of others. So whenever you hear about all the numerous planes in this game, it&apos;s a lie.
<br>
<br>Second of all, the updates are a nightmare, every update brings 1 or 2 useful features (that should have been taken care of during the conceptual stage, but whatever), but will always break something for sure. Multiple examples since March of 2013 to now would be, increasing place costs 10 times while reducing income by 2, making bomber gunners irrelevant, making bombers either structurally similar to pillboxes or paper kites, changing increasing rank of a plane while nerfing its performace at the same time, introducing JIP (Join in Progress) system that wasn&apos;t properly set up and brought chaos to the game, introducing new physics that cause tanks to fly over the skies, etc, etc, etc. A lot of &quot;ninja&quot; changes too, and those are big as they usually affect plane performances in a huge way, but they aren&apos;t mentioned in the patch notes, so you have to test every plane before figuring out what they did. Some planes even get broken, possibly on purpose. Several times some planes&apos; flight models were altered with over performing ones, exactly when the game introduced premium models of those planes. By the way, B-17 was a flying pillbox for over 1 year, only in July of 2014 it got fixed. Horrible.
<br>
<br>The third major problem is their balancing in the game. Apparently they are using some sort of statistical plane performance system in the game, what this does basically, is increasing price and matchmaking rank (BR) overtime, if the plane does really well in the game. This would sounds like a good idea, except it doesn&apos;t work. Me-262 (1944) has matched against Sabres and Mig-15s for years now, and they don&apos;t want to fix it, and trust me when I tell you this, 262 doesn&apos;t even come close in terms in performance to Korean jets. Some post-war props with amazing performance are tiered lower than 1944 German fighters, even some jets are. They don&apos;t seem to fix that, as some of the issues has been around literally for over a year.
<br>
<br>The forth major problem is how Gaijin is treating it&apos;s customers. Silent post removal, ban hammers, forum bans, and so on, apply to everyone who dare to criticize the game. This is almost as bad as Infestation: Survival Stories in this sense. They don&apos;t want to listen to the people, simple as that. There were multiple non-trolling threads on the forum by people who are familiar with airplanes, and who offered to fix the balancing of the game for them, but Gaijin doesn&apos;t seem to care. In fact today, July 24th 2014, they introduced the new update that made the game even worse. All the problems with the balancing, and all the problems with plane tiering got multiplied, as planes that were under-tiered and over tiered got tiered even lower and higher respectively. How is this even possible? They reverted the changes 2 hours later, after a huge backlash on the forum that even they couldn&apos;t hide.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game started great in 2012, got better around March-May 2013, combined with web-ads that they got running at the time, the game had huge player base of over 70k when I started playing back then. By the time 1.35 arrived in mid summer of 2013, the player base got reduced to only 30k. With the addition of ground forces, the game was able to jump to 100k at peak time, and was able to hold that number for a wooping 2 days. Right now there&apos;s only 50,000 playing daily during the peak time, and according to Steam data, the number is on downward slope.
<br>
<br>As of now the game is history, only players who invested too much time and money like me keep playing it, it has nothing to offer to the newer players. Games like IL-2 Battle for Stalingrad and upcoming Armored Warfare might have a better chance. The developer is trying to push for the Naval combat now, but I seriously doubt they can beat Wargaming. I wish they would focus on problems that the most players (the air force players, the original crowd) are concerned with, as they are still the core of the game, but it just doesn&apos;t happen.
<br>
<br>Right now, I will score it a 2, for old times&apos; sake. The game still has fun air combat gameplay, but it&apos;s just not worth getting into with all the frustration the developer gives you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383197">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Extremely steep learning curve - When you start out, you are thrown into combat against everyone - pilots with 1,000 hours under their belts and pilots who don&apos;t know the controls yet.  Seeing as how you&apos;ll start as the second type, you will be slaughtered for the first 20 hours of gameplay unless you are experienced at flight sims already.  If you want to be good, you&apos;ve gotta learn a lot of maneuvers, energy retention, different aircraft types, etc.
<br>- Reasonably priced for the most part.  You get a fair bit for your money, unlike Wargaming&apos;s model where each premium vehicle can cost $30-$50.  If you wait for sales, you can get a good premium plane for $5.  Free players aren&apos;t penalized in the actual game, they just earn less money for victories and unlock new planes more slowly.

<br>Although my review seems pretty critical, I should emphasize that this is probably still the best WW2 combat simulator out there, and it&apos;s the most fun I&apos;ve had playing a flight sim of any sort since Star Wars: Tie Fighter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4378420">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- Good graphics
<br>- Very good sound
<br>- Simple, yet precise controls
<br>- Many different planes to fly
<br>-Three different gamemodes / difficulty levels (Arcade, Realistic, Simulator)
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- XP gain (to unlock more vehicles) is extremely low, UNLESS you spent quite some real money (especially painful when trying to research vehicles higher than Tier 3 (out of 5))
<br>- Matchmaking is often unfair
<br>- You can&apos;t fly all planes / drive all tanks in Simulator difficulty anymore
<br>
<br>Why only 4 points then:
<br>This game used to be good, until:
<br>- Matchmaking got screwed up. Vehicles now have a &quot;battlerating&quot; which often has very little to do with its performance / historical era. So it can easily happen you are facing Korean War jets while flying a WWII propeller plane. You are also highly likely to face post-war tanks in your 1943 models, which means your skill doesn&apos;t really matter anymore, you&apos;re highly likely to get wrecked (literally). This ruins the realistic approach the game would like to have.
<br>- A few months ago you used to have a x2 XP bonus for the first victory WITH EACH OF THE 5 AVAILABLE NATIONS (USA, GB, Russia, Germany, Japan). (Similar to World of Tanks.) This motivating system was recently replaced by daily log-in rewards. They are extremely less powerful than the old boost, and those rewards even expire after 3 days. They do stack, so you can use them all at once, but their outcome is highly diminished upon stacking.
<br>- Pay-2-win slowly but surely gets more and more.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>Right now I would not recommend this game. It used to be a fun game, so two years ago I would have praised it and advertised it. But today, even more with the latest developments, I fear there&apos;s little point in playing it for fun. Unless one is willing to pay a lot of money...
<br>
<br>Still, PLEASE read other reviews too, because they will vary from mine! My point of view of course is different than other players&apos;! Keep that in mind when considering whether to start playing War Thunder or not.
<br>
<br>But I got of the worsening changes. (I&apos;m not tired of the gameplay though. So if one is able to forget about all the issues there are, this game can be great fun.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=5206642">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Warthunder is a decent flight game with very nice graphics and inconsistent but mostly good sound design.
<br>Now there is a reason why I dont call it a flight simulator, because it really isnt. Damage simulation and impact on flight-performance are semi-simulated at best with the damage model being very simplistic. Wind effects are poorly implemented (like flying in prop wash) and generally a lot of &apos;Simulator aspects&apos; you find in a real flight sim are not really modeled, for example control loss through compression isnt modelled at all.
<br>
<br>Nontheless it is a good game for people who want to take a quick glance at the world of flight games without spending a penny.
<br>
<br>The major issues atm are:
<br>
<br>Balancing: Most simulator players want somewhat historical match-ups. If I take a Hellcat I wanna fight the Japanese over some Pacific Island, right? Now lets look at the Hellcat in game. The Hellcat is modeled after one with 1944 modifications, so farely late in the war. Nontheless its Battle Rating (the magical number determining what it goes up against) is lower than that of the first Zero from 1941. Hmm. Its actually so low you will never run into any 1944 Japanese Fighter. What you end up facing instead may often be aircraft like an I-16, a 1939 pre-war soviet early monoplane. And guess what? Neither is that historical nor fair, because you might have figured, the Hellcat is far superior. Now there is historical events to enjoy historical matchups, however only one per day and about 40% of them are horribly broken, unfair or have wrong aircraft (example P-40E in the carrier battle of Midway)
<br>
<br>Inconsistency: There is a lot of different teams working on different stuff and there seem to be next to no guidelines on what to implement. One aircraft has control stiffening at high speed, the next one doesnt. One aircraft has realistic G-limits, the next one doesnt. Very few aircraft have Mach-numbers modeled, most dont. One aircraft overheats like it should which rather instantly kills your engine (for some reason), the next one doesnt although it was known for overheating. Inconsistencies like that can end up deciding the fight, which they really shouldnt.
<br>
<br>Overall its a decent game. Nothing spectacular, but there are no real alternatives, so for now its probably worth a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3908610">Expand</a></span>

(While the game mechanics are the same this review will be mostly focused on the planes side of War Thunder.) To put it simply; War Thunder is a free to play WWII flight game. Game is a key word, if you are someone coming from flight simulators you will not enjoy this game. The game runs on a progression mechanic; you unlock new planes and modifications for them as you play. Better planes fight the other better planes so long time players can&apos;t use their fighter jets to destroy your biplanes. I won&apos;t list all the positives, but a small sample include the easy to pick up control scheme and stunning graphics at a low load on your computer. (While this game isn&apos;t minesweeper, it can run on almost any pc and if you play any other 3d games I guarantee this will run on it.) However, the negatives may outweigh the positives for some people.
<br>
<br>The main negative to this game is the pay to progress style of grind. It is technically possible to get every plane for every nation without paying a penny, but in the same way that it is possible to swim across the Atlantic. I must emphasize that this game is not pay to win, it is pay to progress. If you are the type of person who would want to get every plane for every nation or even every plane for one nation, you would probably end up spending more than if this game cost $40 up front and did away with the &quot;F2P&quot; pay to progress style grind. As I stated in the start of this review I have over 1450 hours in this game and I would say that I only have 90% of the planes. (And I even went the pay to progress route!)
<br>
<br>With that said it is free to play, so give it a try and see if you like it. If you don&apos;t care what plane you are flying and just like the game itself, you might like it. If you are the type who would play just to fly some of the cool planes like the B-17 or P-51, don&apos;t waste your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=5436517">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Games ardent defenders claim that is is not pay to win, only pay to progress which is total **** Because progressing ones crew is paramount if you want to be able to compete with the hordes of seal clubbers that infest the game and ruin every chance for a good new player experience.
<br>So unless you&apos;re a white whale gamer, who&apos;s looking to seal club new players, which seems to be the stable of Gaijins customers, look elsewhere for a tanking game, this is not it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=7056333">Expand</a></span>

In 1.37 they basically turned the game into a massive grind (in hope that more people would spend real money on the game). When the update came out, everyone was outraged and there were tons of posts showing this. Gaijin decides to start locking lots of posts and many were ignored. I actually stated that I was unhappy with the way that Gaijin and the forum moderators responded to this and made a topic which discussed this. Then, I am told that I am not allowed to criticize the moderators. The game is still fun when playing a battle of 2 but it is too time consuming to get further in the tree. The ground forces was supposed to bring hope back to the game. The arcade of tanks was actually reasonably fun but the promised combined battles (planes and tanks) were bitterly disappointing. Another tool, the CDK which was to bring custom missions to War Thunder was another hope that became a disappointment. Gaijin attempts to block every single attempt to circumnavigate the grinding, requiring you to have a plane to fly it in a mission. The poor explanation and instructions of the tool are another drawback. Whatever you do in this game, don&apos;t spend money (real money) on this game as Gaijin needs to be taught a lesson.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4675997">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t want to pay a lot of money advancement is veryyyyyyyyy slow. Matchmaking system is driving you crazy cause it puts you against much stronger opponents if you play good and is not rewarding. Gaming that must be fun turns into stressful experience.</span>

<br>
<br>Missions for single player and dynamic battle are just retarded. Enemy see only my airplane. They act like swarm. That is the worst **** in this dumb game. Maybe for multiplayer it is playable but then there is controls that allow to use mouse with lots of assist so even worst retard can play. This game is made only for MP and is forcing to play MP and allows uneven combat where only simulation can be played in MP with decent fun. But as for me there is no fun in this game because I wanted to create my own missions and have fun and develop my skills. But no this game is forcing players to go into MP straight to boring battles.
<br>Biggest turnoff is lack of proper mission creator where player could build his skills instead game forces everybody to go and play in MP and any SP modes are retarded making AI swarm player.
<br>It is retarded when on my tail I see all enemies while my wingmens and other airplanes try to destroy that swarm AI. This looks simply retarded and that game is worth 1/10 just for good engine and good simulation in simulation mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4401868">Expand</a></span>

The planes handle well with keyboard and mouse but not perfect. Joystick is best when doing for real battles. There are a large verity of planes for all kinds of players. They are adding ships and tanks but that will not be for a while. Tanks probably by December. The cons are what lot of games face. The match making is a little bad but is ok most of the time. There are some control problems. Also there are some planes that are very unbalanced at high tier and low. For example Russia has a tier 8 fighter that has a 40mm on it that can one shot any bomber almost. This is good if you like historical authenticity but bad in some game modes. These are all fine problems which you can easily get over and in time they will have little effect on you. The Worst problem is ranking up. It takes along time to get jets unless you pay for xp conversion and a premium account. So it will require a lot of time. It is not pay to win however because you can shoot down just as many fighters as the people in premium planes. It is based on skill rather than money. The only pay to win is crew. If you buff your crew with say max gunners you can shot down many players fast but still if they enemy players are good they will know what angle to attack form in which they take almost no damage. Also again some fighters can one shot bombers by taking out wings. Not a lot of fighters can one shot but there are some which in a good pilots hands could make some go 10 and 0. Overall good if you invest time and effort into this game and practice you will overcome these problems. Hope I see you on the battle field.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3628350">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve been stuck 600k now for ages. so whilst a might have a couple of good games if I have a few bad games I basically don&apos;t advance. SO even in a few years where I earn enough research points to get a new T5 plane I sure as hell wont be able to afford it. Well Done Gaijin; you turned a pretty good game into a grind fest that really isnt worth playing anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4585519">Expand</a></span>

Secret police style banning and removal of anything not praising the game, the sickening bias towards Soviet arms and the slow nerfing of germany. A constant lock of Russia/Germany, nothing else.</span>

<br>
<br>I am kind of dissapointed, it wasn&apos;t bad game few years ago but they didn&apos;t make any progress with content, the gameplay is still same crap.
<br>
<br>You can be suck in with pretty graphics and easy to play controls which 5 year old child can play with you. But the game is really dumbed down version of competitions for 4-6 year old who think that one shoting everything is best fun ever.
<br>
<br>Stay away of this pile of ****
<br>
<br>When you play russia tank like as IS 3 you shot and kill everything but if you play german tank you see +1 hit, +1 hit, +1 hit, +1, then the noob finaly turn gun on you and boom you are dead.

The community is a lot of angry children with neckbeards &quot;omg my team sux!&quot; kind of comments.

World of Tanks is more thrilling gameplay for me.</span>

<br>
<br>Then we have bombers being **** carrying small loadouts ( unless american or russian), vulnerable, slow and incompetent AI that even with maxed crew can&apos;t hit a plane 100 meters behind it and don&apos;t forget that if they fire, from the constant &quot;gunner unconcious&quot; to reloading a mg which take more than one minute( even more than BOMBs!).Then you flight models and damage models, some planes downright suck at flying, can&apos;t turn, climb or throttle, you are easy picking while there are plenty of UFOs out there (especially russia) that also have a generous DM, granting the ability to soak ridiculous amount of bullets and sometimes cannon shots( just take a look at youtube, it is filled with evidence on it), for instance japan has piss por armor and equipment, can&apos;t dive well, can only turn fight good at low atitudes with Zeros( their fighters also suck, with exception with the first one with its UFO nature), can&apos;t take one shot from anything and have guns constantly jamming while the glorious slavs with their wooden planes can take any punishment, have miniguns that hardly jam.Another point, this game is very anti-german just like WOT, germans have horrible planes that can only BnZ if you dare try making any turn your plane loses all control( not only that but germans have horrible early tiers, if not one of the worse) while any one faction can with no problem BnZ and turn fight ( lets not count the Stuka and its paper mache tail).
<br>
<br>There is far too many to say, but to resume, this is a scam game, you pay to progress( sometimes it is the only way to get good planes), you pay for &quot;backup&quot; planes( the same op plane can be used twice), you&apos;ll suffer at the frustating mechanics as g-force in every turn making your scream go black and losing your target, you&apos;ll be ramed all the time by friend and foe, but the worse part is the without a doubt the before mentioned balance, it is just so bad you&apos;ll start to see every slav( count WOT with its &quot;Stalin was benevolent&quot; crap) as some sort of brainwashed loony.
<br>
<br>Do a favor, stay far away from this time consuming, frustating scheme</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4009828">Expand</a></span>

But it gets often overshadowed by the issues in the game (see list below).
<br>
<br>It seems the devs don&apos;t know how to do it exactly right, for just 1 example they just changed the perfectly working mouseaim system over night and made the game unplayable all of sudden. Then change it back because of the massive feedback. Its typical in the past the devs do 1 step forward and 1-3 steps back. Its like the game is a test server. It is in beta for a very long time, sometimes ground forces even feels like alpha. At this rate it seems the game is forever in beta. And potential is a meaningless word in the present.
<br>
<br>My list of issues:
<br>- Bugs. For 1 example like that you can shoot trough houses or objects, still possible here and there (and many more bugs).
<br>- Physics and collisions still VERY wonky. Garry&apos;s mod or HL2 had A LOT better physics in 2004.
<br>- Invisible tanks
<br>- Any sort of low quality setting advantages (ULQS or grass and trees)! Even in AB tanks i managed (testing reasons, i play without ULQS) to get an advantage because you can see the tank weak spots a lot easier. Big reason why RB/SB is unplayable in a competitive manner unless you can bear ugly graphics.
<br>- Cap balance and map design like Mozdok and Karelia is very poor.
<br>- Planes/bombers vs tanks they don&apos;t add anything in AB, just frustration. When i get bombed i cry, when i bomb i feel dirty. And in RB or SB they feel overpowered if you know how to fly. Planes usually top the SB score list (and RB). Like a month into the no marker events and you still get spawn bombed with bombers/attackers spawing right into a dive on an open spawnzone of player tanks, simply said you spawn you die... 100% ridiculous.
<br>- Gamemode design like Break with respawns and respawns in general, its to spawnkill or spawn and free kill. Can&apos;t turn side/back to the enemy spawn point at all times. For AB it is not all that bad but for RB and SB it feels ridiculous.
<br>- BR&apos;s or Matchmaker. Facing teams FULL of IS-2&apos;s and TigerII H in my max 5.7BR setup, you have almost no chance. Or the enemy team has 2 IS-2s and our teams highest BR is 5.7. Or in GFSB 1 team is all aircraft.
<br>- RNG bouncing on slopes. I saw Phlydaily bounce with his Zis-30 (122mm pen) on a locust with 26-32mm of effective armor not too far away just because of the RNG mechanic.
<br>- DM&apos;s (damagemodels tanks and planes) and FM&apos;s(flightmodels for planes). Penetration effects still at bit weird, armor holes, sparkles(planes). And including gunbarrels breaking too easy and the lack of spalling.
<br>- Economy. Don&apos;t like Wagers (do like daily rewards), they are too random, you are bound to do a task not to play how you want, and sometimes don&apos;t even recommend playing for the win but to do your task instead. RP and Silver gain feels too low. I can imagine a (new) f2p player is looking up an endless mountain to climb, could scare him away. Even with premium it is going slow.
<br>- Repetitive. In a similar fashion like WoT with AB battles(arcady gameplay), its not like &quot;Hey im gonna play some arcade planes for half a day&quot;. Games are just too chaotic in AB. Repetitive with RB because of downtime with takeoffs, return-to-bases and travel times. But RB still is a decent game mode.
<br>-Killstealing or rather the reward system, Killstealer goes away with all the credits+RP with 2 bullits taking the kill while you just shot your entire ammoload on the target crit it and set it on fire.
<br>-Pay2win or Pay2faster. Because you will have much better results (and stats) if you lets say unlocked everything with golden eagles. Not a huge issue because most people do not spend into this, but still makes the game worse. With Ace crews, training crews to the max instantly, skipping stock vehicles which are terrible (unlocking modules with gold) and playing any favor of the month at will.
<br>- There is more things i forget in this list that drives me away from the game instead of attracting me to it.

<br>The driving, damage and flight modules are a joke, if they are broke the will not fix it unless it is a Russian tank or plane under performing, then they will turn it into the beast asap. meanwhile a really bad design decision on the tiger tank had to wait 4 months to be fixed, i mean it only toke the dev 2 days to screw it up in the first place but fixing it was something that had to be done by expert. yes historically all Tigers fought with headlights on comrade, completely historically accurate, infact all german tanks came with builtin headlight anti-gun depression.... Oh this Sherman tank do not have this thick armor here it has to be fixed... wait we did something wrong, read wrong paper comrade we will fix it eventually... The Tiger and the armor &quot;fix&quot; on the captured German Sherman was just two example of one of the biggest problem with Gaijin and is the next point in this review.
<br>
<br>Extremely Russian bias, yaks, yaks, laggs and more lagg every patch. for other nations they will release one plane and then you have &quot;modules&quot; for it so can only fly it out once. but for russian the will make exceptions and will seperate it into different planes even thou it is the same plane except a gun change... just look at all those yaks and you get it. the German will have one plane with &quot;modules&quot; instead.
<br>
<br>The community is a joke with abusive moderators and a community manager that would have been fired if it would have been any other company. just look at the German tanks snafu, where the community manager called the community a bunch of whining *****. for being right, yes the community was right Gaijin had to revert their change eventually or trademarked soon. side note apparently the Russian forum section is ok with none abusive moderators but do not know if that is true so no plus for that.
<br>
<br>Nope that is not your kill. kill stealing is something you will find in all games but in this game it is amazingly bad. a player can take out basically everything on the opponents plane or tank and you can just roll in put a few round in the enemy and get a free kill. I have it done to me and have it done to other people, it is just that the system for kill counting is so bad you just abuse it to the max.
<br>
<br>Production server is beta server, beta server is basically alpha testserver, yes they are not runing a finished game on the, infact atm they are running a paywall &quot;closed beta&quot; on the production server. yes you to pay to get access to all the American tanks in an effort to &quot;test&quot; tanks before they are released in the public every other few day, ehh no weeks, no wait what did we promised them new tanks every other few days. hahahah stupid community shut your mouths we do not care what we promised you, we decide what you get so **** you. yhea that is the response from Gaijin when people ask what happen to the American tanks that is behind a paywall.
<br>
<br>Basically this game was ok back in the days like way back, but with every patch they just add more frustration and fix less and now im not supporting them anymore. im gonna wait for my premium to run out and then bye bye gaijin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4887032">Expand</a></span>

<br>- bad research model (after last patch),
<br>- bad economy model
<br>- it is still beta and it seems that it will stay like that for a long, long time...
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving low rate only because of research/economy model which is very annoying now.
<br>Anyway, it is F2P game so all of us can check it and decide if it is worth of playing and paying for premium content or not - that is positive side I guess.

<br>
<br>I know a few people say that the game isn&apos;t pay to win and i was able to agree with that (last year).
<br>But now you can buy everything.
<br>You can buy Silver Lions, you can buy Premium Planes, you can buy XP boosts and you can buy all   upgrades for the planes.
<br>
<br>So if you want to play this crap you should remember, if you don&apos;t pay you won&apos;t have fun play...</span>

<br>
<br>The worst problems are:
<br>Completly messed up matchmaking. The system that used to be clear and simple got replaced and now we have MM based on BR (battle ratings) of each plane. The spread is way too big and on top of that we have ridiculous modifiers.
<br>For example players that perform really well in a couple of games in the row will get matched against opponents with better planes. No, you won&apos;t get matched agains more skilled players, but rather vs more powerfull planes. Similarly, after a few bad games you will get enemies in weaker planes.
<br>The system is basically rewarding bad players and punishing good ones.
<br>It&apos;s not unusal to see players crashing their planes on purpose to eventually get matched against really bad opponents and dominate them.
<br>
<br>Secondly, money-grabbing system.
<br>It gets more and more ridicculous. The grind keeps getting worse and playing without premium account that speeds up your progression gets pointless after a certain level. We also have premium planes. Those can only be obtained with rl money. Way too often when they get released they offer incredible performance with low Battle Rating. The only downside, seems to be their price. Then, a couple of months later, their stats get significantly nerfed. But don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s new premium plane available - limited offer - great performance, great cost.
<br>
<br>Russian bias.
<br>Russian developers work really hard on making russian airforce the best one available. Realistic approach towards plane&apos;s stats is only used for other nations.
<br>Some tech trees (Japan) aren&apos;t completed and require a lot of work, but devs keep on adding new overperforming russian planes. It&apos;s been like that since the game got released so it doesn&apos;t seem like anything&apos;s going to change.
<br>
<br>Lack of communication between devs and players.
<br>Appearently devs have a clear vision what they want to achieve with this game. Player feed back is irrelevant. Positive feedback is allowed, neagative one - not.
<br>Mods go as far as removing posts, editing them, bannig people and locking+deleting threads that contain the posts they&apos;d rather not see.
<br>Latest bigger patches (1.37, 1.39, 1.41) that brought many negative changes caused a lot of pople posting it on the forums. Needless to say, all of the official topics where ppl discussed changes got deleted because there was a lot of negative feedback.
<br>Asking (politely) why my posts got edited to the point where no longer made sense got me a warning - without any explaination.
<br>
<br>I strongly advise to stay away from this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4277574">Expand</a></span>

<br>I love ww2 era history but this is just a big money scam and a waste of time.
<br>
<br>There is no ingame options to change graphical settings and not much towards any hardware configuration in game.  Even for a beta phased game this is a must have instead of closing it down and changing settings on the launcher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3923177">Expand</a></span>

That fact aside, it is incredibly fun to play and is absolutely stunning to look at. This is one of the most impressive looking games to ever be made. Flying is one of those things that is easy to learn yet hard to master, so everyone can play it but those who put in the time to get better can give themselves an advantage in combat. Planes all handle differently and have different roles which gives this game great strategy features. Planes have just enough customization options to give you plane personal flair without going overboard, and every plane levels differently. Now the problems i have with it i dont really want to effect the score given its beta phase but ramming is a major issue. I think if the devs could solve the problem of other players who use ramming to either a) dont know how to shoot or b) are trolling this game would improve a lot. Also, IMO, i think that the game should be more details on how you got shot down. Its hard to learn from your mistakes when you dont know what happened to your plane. Sometimes it tells you (like when you have a fuel leak) somtimes it doesnt. I just find it annoying to be fine and then suddenly your plane loses control and crashes. Overall i cant give this game over an eight simply because its an unfinished product, and i i wont let some of its problems effect its score because of that fact too. I cant wait for them to expand the Beta and get ground and Naval combat in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3474091">Expand</a></span>

<br>Few minor complaints, its not as fast paced as it can be. Flying to the &quot;battle zone&quot; takes way too long imo, plus, the only indication that you are flying fast is some low volume sound effect.
<br>Any  complaints in negative reviews as: the planes aren&apos;t balanced or the Japanese have fewer planes than the Germans. Yeah well that&apos;s because they did. I believe Gaijin did an excellent job of recreating the actual planes and their specs.
<br>Matchmaking is fine, sure you might come across one or two tier 10 planes when you&apos;re flying a tier 6, but that&apos;s because you have a tier 8 or 9 plane somewhere in you&apos;re &quot;hangar&quot;. That&apos;s what the matchmaking does, it&apos;s takes your highest level plane. Thus providing a challenge!
<br>Also, this is not a Play2Win game, I&apos;ve never paid a dime and I still kick *ss ;-)
<br>Last but not least, the mouse aiming is vastly superior to every other type of control, hence I would suggest to ditch that. It&apos;s still a fair battle now that everyone is using it but it would make the game more difficult, which is good.
<br>
<br>So in short, if you&apos;re looking for a an fun, REALISTIC WWII dogfight, this game is for you.
<br>If you can&apos;t get your head around the fact that a British Spitfire is better than Russian La-GG than you shouldn&apos;t be playing games like this at all.

But there is so much rubbish you have to deal with, I have a hard time believing anyone can truly enjoy this game without spending a bucket-load of cash into it. Including investments for joysticks and a 3d visor to make the first person view have any viable elements of enjoyment.
<br>
<br>To begin with, the matchmaking. You level up a certain faction and the higher rank you get, the more planes you unlock. And on these ranks they have built the MM to be 2 ranks each tree. As in, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 and so on. Sure, it may be a bit of a pisser to know heads on that you are gonna meet people that are one higher rank than you.. But the kicker here is you have a possibility to meet people from other ranks as well. Including a tier above you. Say, you&apos;re level 7. That makes you eligable to meet planes in the ranks of 9-10. And the same goes for lower planes at 5-6 being able to meet you. It would be an acceptable pool bendage if this game had some problems with the MM waiting time.. But it doesn&apos;t. The longest I have EVER waited is about 35 seconds which begs the question as to just why they allow imbalancement like this to exist when It is very clearly not necessary?
<br>
<br>The second disappointment is the balance. There are several factions/teams that are essentially just different countries which you gain rank in by participating in battles and gaining XP to unlock planes and for some reason, there are these huge gaping areas of designment neglect. Just an quick example would be the fact that the faction Japan got about 20-25 planes whereas Germany has about 50-70. This creates some pretty big gaps on how faction players in Germany have to pout out 5 times the amount of cash of constantly buying new planes in order to reach the ones they want whereas Japan&apos;s player hoard so much money, they can&apos;t possibly spend it all unless they jump to another faction. The overall stat balance of all the planes is down the toilet too.
<br>
<br>At most early stages of the game, England has an absurd amount of more superior planes in terms of everything be it manouverability/turntime, firepower/mass per second or raw speed/max rise and nowhere does this grow more apparent when the waiting time for US is 4 seconds, and the wait for England pushes at 35+ seconds around the ranks of 2-7. It has been like this for months and I fail to see any design philosophy that justifies it. Especially now since these problems have persisted through-out the beta and onto the official release.
<br>
<br>Third fault that personally lets me down the most is the neglect of Bomber planes. They are huge, clumsy, downright impossible to do ANY kind of dogfighting in (Manouver to hit enemies with the front guns of your plane) and they are designed to do one thing and one thing only. Go from A to B and drop bombs. Why is this a let-down to me?
<br>
<br>Because the developers figured a couple of months ago to majorly nerf not only the explosion radius of your bombs (rendering any load below 500lbs to be extremely unreliable/requiring needle-precision or close-range dive drops) but also neglect their overall ability to function by nerfing their gunners (Guys sitting in the back fending off planes on your tail). They are now almost completely useless except against straight-flying very light enemy planes that are  almost at blank range behind you. The decision to seal the crate shut, effectively burying bomber planes when they were already at an underwhelming position with massive outcries by the community in protest will be a developer standpoint I&apos;ll never be able to understand.
<br>
<br>But the nerf wasn&apos;t just global. There are several specific plane models have been made incredibly vulnerable, like, take 5 shots to your tail (the most attacked direction from behind) and you will crash &amp; instant die from not being able to steer, leaving the rest of the plane useless.
<br>
<br>Another example of this pure neglect would be how one of the game tips at the loading screen prompts bombers to fly high (achieve great height) to avoid enemy planes. Great philosophy. .Just one problem. A rank 7 bomber can have a maximum height of 8500 meters. Pretty impressive, right? Wrong. There are level 1 fighter planes that can reach up to 9000 meters and 5-6 rank fighters that go above 12000 meters. Once you take a stern look at the situation bombers are in and people that spent so much to try to be helpful to their team get smacked across the face so hard, It&apos;s enough to make you depressed.
<br>
<br>Fourth and last. (Yeah, I can keep going but the character limit prevents me from doing so.) Manouverability in this game. Even the most nimblest of planes utterly STRUGGLE to shake off very clumsy enemy planes off their six and nowhere does this get more annoying when you are playing with a couple of beginners, leaving any situation where someone fires at you from behind a death sentence due to teamwork neglect (no wingman) because of all the new players Steam are pulling in.

<br>but it&apos;s not the true intention of War Thunder.
<br>
<br>This is about WW2 dogfights and providing air support for the ground units, it&apos;s both casual, deeply engaging and well detailed.
<br>WarThunder captures the feeling of flying each plane beautifully, with looks, sounds, handling and tactics that showcase that each plane was unique and special in WW2
<br>.
<br>This is a very fun game, and far from pay to win like some &quot;critics&quot; are complaining about. Of course there are benefits for paying for things, as some planes cannot be obtained through gameplay alone but the majority can, and quite easily depending on your skill level. The plane unlock progresses seemingly along the path mirroring how technology advanced as WW2 raged. With more planes, weapons and parts, coming available as you rank up. All planes are fairly historically accurate with their equipment, so naturally some will be better than others, but every plane has a purpose and can hold it&apos;s own.
<br>
<br>The controls are whatever you choose, k/b and mouse, pad, or joystick, and all work quite well. Mouse and keyboard use for a flying sim, has been strangely butchered in flying games in the past, but in WarThunder it makes sense and is still a satisfying flying experience. People voicing negativity at the mouse being &apos;superior&apos; to use in arcade mode, are missing the point completely.
<br>
<br>The maps are varied and many are based off real WW2 air battle-spaces, like Guatamala or the skies of The Battle For Britain, Iwo Jima and many others.
<br>
<br>This is a great game, easy to get into, with optional tutorials for when you need them (such as your first bomber being bought) the menu system is not perfect but it&apos;s still fairly intuitive and friendly.
<br>
<br>My only criticisms are; the music can be a bit repetive after a while, but it is still not &quot;annoying&quot; and maintains the WW2 &apos;flavour&apos;, the sounds of the planes and explosions are quite satisfying.
<br>
<br>Perhaps this will be patched soon, but a small oversight in some of the &quot;suicide&quot; mechanics, especially in arcade mode. I would like to see is bigger penalties for those &quot;kimakaze&quot; attacks some people have no shame in doing, although some do make sense (if your heavily damaged and outnumbered, better to take an enemy to the grave with you)
<br>
<br>There is also a small oversight, in that if you shoot down a bomber and the bomb the ground before they hit it (the explosion kills/damages them) you are completely denied a kill due to simple bad sportsmanship. There needs to be penalties to discourage this kind of behaviour. Even in the real WW2 air battles, they had a certain level of respect for each other, and they [i] were [i/] trying to kill each other, or a least destroy their plane.
<br>People complaining excessively about bugs need to remember that this is a BETA! I am yet to encounter any serious bugs either, and I have put in 30 hours. Possible the smoothest beta I have ever seen.
<br>The fantastic code optimisation means some great and silky smooth visuals are the norm for this gem.
<br>
<br>The best free to play I have experienced, ever, WarThunder is up there as a solid game in it&apos;s own right even if it was a full price title. I wouldnt indeed buy this game for $50
<br>
<br>Graphics 9.5 Sound 9.0. Gameplay 9.0 Longevity 9.0 Total  9/10
<br>
<br>If you like air combat, WW2 or PC multiplayer games in general, I can recommend giving this a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=3602546">Expand</a></span>

Initially when I stumbled across War Thunder I instantly fell in love the with idea of an all-out combat &apos;simulator&apos; and as such I signed up and was surprised by the small user base. I learnt why it had such a small user base really quickly; Gaijin&apos;s inability to tackle problems and find solutions in a sensible amount of time.
<br>Where should I start? Let me do it at with the current existing game modes (Patch 1,41), currently there are 3 game modes; Arcade Battles (AB), Realistic Battles (AB) and Simulator Battles (SB). Tanks have gone into OBT and now all are free to play them, however currently tanks are separated from planes (Why? In the CBT you could play both tanks and planes together) however both tanks and planes have the same type of game modes.
<br>Let me start with the positive sides of War Thunder, nice graphics (For both planes and tanks), detailed tank/plane models, mostly accurate tank/plane models, some real life based settings and the massively improved Custom Battles. However right here is where I have to stop, there are just too many negatives that plague this game as of late. Currently the Battle Rating (BR) system (The MatchMacker uses the BR to fill games) is completely messed up, a Meteor F3 has a BR of 6,7 whilst it&apos;s German counter-part the Me262 has to enjoy fighting Korean era Sabres. You can see this across all the tech trees of all nations, e.g. the F4U Corsair (Late war plane) is rated at a BR of 3,3 and it enjoys fighting early war planes, am I the only one that finds this ridiculously stupid? Then there are other things such as repair prices of planes (My God take a look at the N1K2 for Japan and it&apos;s BR whilst it&apos;s US adversarie the F6F enjoys a low repair cost and low BR) as well as the damage output of all cannons of all planes/jets. Things like these, the fundamental of the game are broken, they broke it with this patch, previously it worked half fine however now it&apos;s simply broken which is just sad considering how much time I invested into the game.
<br>Now there is another glaringly obvious problem (Not the rotten community) but the corrupted, underage and childish moderation team. One might ask, well how do you know that they are corrupted? Can you show us evidence of this? Go and ask some of the older players that stopped playing the game (Guys from A01 for example) and they can tell you all about the lovely PayPal payments that some moderators received (There are even YouTubes videos about it). The Mods and GMs ban based on the players they dislike that is always fun is it not?!
<br>
<br>So how do we conclude? Well it&apos;s rather simple, don&apos;t touch the game until its major fundamental flaws have been ironed out and the moderation team has been subbed out for a more mature one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-thunder/user-reviews?user_review_id=4199238">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Switched from World of Tanks to War Thunder when they added tanks to the game. Best decision i ever made in my gaming life. Just give this one a try if you like World of Tanks. I assure you tank combat in War Thunder is 10x better. The progression system is a bit confusing at the start but once you figure it out you&apos;ll be hooked to your computer screen hours on end.</span>
