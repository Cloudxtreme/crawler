(You can jump to the main point below)
<br>
<br>The new class added into the game called &quot;destroyers&quot; broke the balancing in PvP. It has ridiculous firepower tilted the balancing in the game, especially the Federation destroyer which is faster than all frigates and fighters and imperial interceptors and has double the firepower of any normal ship.
<br>New destroyer modules eg Gravity Lens, which creates a black hole which sucks you in when you are slow and deals damage at the same time. It has ruined game modes like domination and beacon hunt. Just planting the weapon on the beacon makes it uncapturable for the enemy team. To give you a perspective of how unbalanced destroyers are, we can use a close example from World of WarShips which has a similar playstyle in some ways. Imagine a ship like the Yamato but more maneuverable than the best destroyers within WoWS.
<br>Destroyers are not the only bad news, a lot of updates introducing unbalanced weapon just to gain cash for the company have been heavily exploited by smart players, making PvP unbalanced.
<br>
<br>The matchmaking got so bad, to keep players joining a game within 1 minute with server options in any region, the developers decided to mix the ranks together, eg rank 10 vs rank 15, sometimes it goes extremely as rank 4 vs rank 14. They did this in the first place because they made tier 3 destroyer materials so accessible that everyone has a tier 3 destroyer. This resulted in PvP matches with everyone taking their destroyer, and to solve this problem the developers decided to only limited the number of destroyers is 3 per team Other parts of the gamely are still okay (they totally didn&apos;t toke any ideas from EVE online, like open space, combat drones etc.) it is mainly PvP which is messed up.
<br>
<br>To &quot;fix&quot; balancing problems, developers decide to create a new game mode called &quot;Survival&quot;. It is very similar to team deathmatch except the damage intake is multiplied to 300% and when you are being spawn-camped you lose more points because every death takes 2 points and the damage intake is increased to 600%!
<br>
<br>Grinding has become unavoidable very excessive. If you don&apos;t grind, you don&apos;t get anything, especially High Rank/Tier ships. This game won&apos;t survive long as the number of active players is slowly declining and the horrible balancing in PvP
<br>
<br>Looking at one angry comment talking about being chat banned for 24 hours. I feel sympathetic for him but calling other donkeys it not nice. This game got bad ratings from some critics due to excessive swearing from Russians. They add the chat ban to maintain discipline among players but they used it for a lot more purposes. They I got banned for a few times for swearing but once I was banned when the new destroyer was released. Some of my friends say it happens to the best of us, I believe it was because I was discussing loopholes in main chat, how unbalanced the game was and people should be building Federation destroyers instead of other mumbo jumbo ships.
<br>
<br>I do recommend you to play the game but DO NOT spend any money on it, it doesn&apos;t worth it because the game will die soon. Unless if you are like me and grab a T5 federation destroyer and fly in PvP and make skilled players rage quit the game and get 10 kills per match and 20 assists.
<br>
<br>P.S. Destroyers doesn&apos;t need a lot of skill, I am an average player and with the destroyer, I reached top 500 in weekly leaderboards.
<br>
<br>Dec 20th, 2016 UPDATE
<br>They just added a new faction, new ships and etc. The ships are customizable like destroyers which will lead to more unbalancing in theory. The money grab is real. I don&apos;t suggest anyone play the game anymore.
<br>
<br>Jan 30th, 2017 UPDATE
<br>The new faction, the new ship I mentioned earlier makes the game pay to win. Few of my friends have it. They paid for it and they spawn camp the enemy the whole time. The game&apos;s PVP is just pure horrible. A lot of people talk about other parts like PVE and Open Space. PVE is ok, works pretty well and is still fun and challanging with the new updates, however Open Space doesn&apos;t give you anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=6878349">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It used to be that the stuff you could buy were cosmetics, modest boosters for gains, and ships that were just alternate versions of what you could get from playing, but not necessarily better. Now they sell the materials to make stuff, and have at times increased the required volume of such materials multiple times over when putting them in the cash shop, without increasing the rate you could expect to get them from just playing. They&apos;ve also buffed various pay ships, will release new things as timed exclusives to help push people into paying to get the new OP thing in time, only to later nerf it when a new thing to spend money on is added, at which point the process repeats itself. If you don&apos;t want to pay, you&apos;d have to spend most of your waking hours to farm enough materials before the item disappears for who knows how long, or is nerfed into uselessness. Then they decided to put in restrictions on the volume of materials you can stockpile, which can be less than the amount needed to make some things, of course materials you bought with real money are apparently exempt from that restriction.
<br>
<br>A trading system has recently been added, but rather than a marketplace UI system like most games have, it works from a trading chat channel, and direct player trades. Such a system requires the player to both be able to communicate with others, in a given language, and actively advertise the things they want to buy, or sell, rather than play the game. With a marketplace UI language barriers can be removed by having the game translated in multiple languages (as this one is), and is far less cumbersome as you can for instance just post something for sale, then go back to playing while the UI handles the rest. Although, since they have this system in place, and as it uses the cash shop currency for trades, with even mandatory min values, they claim now everyone has access to the cash shop currency, without even having to spend money themselves, no matter how badly the system works out. Since everyone supposedly has access to the cash shop currency now, they can feel justified in putting in even more pay advantages.
<br>
<br>Finally there&apos;s their appointed player GMs/mods, which are all apparently white knights for the game on ego trips. If you speak out against the game, or devs, they hate you, and will likely at least threaten to ban you for supposedly breaking rules that may not exist, or just go ahead and ban you. If you try to report them for harassing you, your report just goes to other player GMs/mods, who may even identify themselves as good friends with the one/s you have a complaint against, so it should be easy to figure out how well that works out for you.
<br>
<br>_________________________
<br>Note:
<br>Pay to win (P2W) is a purely subjective term regarding if a person feels the pay advantages provided by a game are too significant, or not. While most may have not considered the game P2W prior to early 2016, with that change in development philosophy, now most feel the pay advantages have become significant enough to call it P2W.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=7223306">Expand</a></span>

<br>Recommended to anyone who likes space game though as all FTP games they want ur money, i personally see no problem spending 20-50 USD when the sales come up. After that its hard core grinding and moving along. :) Also highly recommended to join a Corporation since they will usually help u advance and lvl up. :) Ive been playing this</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Pls read to bottom for recent changes thank you :)

After that its hard core grinding and moving along. :) Also highly recommended to join a Corporation since they will usually help u advance and lvl up. :) Ive been playing this game for a few years and enjoy playing it every time :)
<br>
<br>For corporations to join if u like nice people, respect and NO DRAMA, I recommend checking out http://JungC.ORG
<br>
<br>Other game info:
<br>Game has dramaticly improved and is way better then it was a few years ago, though i hope they dont over do it now.
<br>
<br>PVP aka Skermish
<br>PVE aka VS AI
<br>Sector conquest aka t4-t5 ships battle it out sectors for their faction and Corporations
<br>Open Space aka some places pvp some places pvp and pve and some sectors can be captured by corporations
<br>
<br>UPDATE 27th march 2016
<br>Ok now we have pvp vs AI? and destroyers. Oh and it&apos;s definitely a PAY to WIN game. Sadly they over did it...
<br>
<br>UPDATE: 24th May 2016
<br>So the PVP vs AI thing (aka Co-Op) has its ups:
<br>- Less wait time for matches.
<br>- Can creat a wing (have 8 - 16ppls vs AI).
<br>- The Destoyers... Very nice well done. Best in open space with good team mates (Finaly can take out Predator :).
<br>- About the pay to win thing.... You can now get premium ships without paying real cash. yes its true, 3 of them to be exact and they are quit unique if i may add.
<br>- Though with all this, yes you can have nearly everything in the game for FREE, if you spend about, lets say 4hrs a day, 5 days a week, for 2 years.
<br>- Still very fun game love playing with the team. :)
<br>
<br>UPDATE: 29th July 2016
<br>- No more TEAM WORK or its been destoyed.... Groups may no longer use ships of the proper tier without being restricted to the players ship whos rank is lowest. Know the saying, &quot; ur only as strong as the weakest link&quot;... well now we may only use ships (in group) of the highest rank any player has. as in T3 battle if on player has R7 ship then u may NOT use R9 nor R8 ships only R7 or lower.... So practical for team battle? NOPE! PVE? NOPE! PVP sadly not gonna help players that are ekveing up or new only good for playersr who have all the ships or most of them...
<br>- Preety colors... yah no joke SC has updated to some fancy new graphics looks real nice :)
<br>- Change in Guards who now have more Anomoly generated missles, and some other new weapons...
<br>Conclusion: Anyway because of this recent update and NO LONGER being able to help my team mates efficiently i will change the review to a NOT recommended. Untill this is fixed, that is. :)
<br>- I want to have the ease of helping my team mates and joining friends in a group. I have had loads of fun, for it now to be taken away?... Just today i tried to joina friend that i ahve not seen in a while and we had little success other then open space... All that time... ;-; please fix this SC! :)- Penalizes new players due to the fact other players may not want to get the same rank ship as them which is lower.
<br>
<br>Update:12/13/2016
<br>Changed review to thumbs up. Just because... -_- Hopefully the devs can make better choices. im back in the game now and well... even though the game is changed alot i still have fun and im able to work it out with the team. :)
<br>
<br>Update:13/04/2017
<br>Changed review from thumbs up to DOWN! Sadly the game is lost. Open space servers arer lagging more and more. THe game is now &quot;destroyed&quot;(ing) my items i get from loot saying i dont have room in hanger when i clearly do... The updates have been proven only for the sole reason to rake in as much cash as possible before swtiching to another &apos;event ship&apos;. Example: R14 Vigilant was BUFFED to an extent it was supper OP 1 week befor it would no longer be availale to make and then.... just 24hrs after anyone could not make any more it was NURFed!. No joke they didint even wait a week. -_- then again they came out with the THARGA and the day after a NEW alien TAIKIN ship came out the THARGA was NURFED as befor it was OP as hell. The developers and Gajin company only care about your cash....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=7223291">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game was awesome and very promising 3 years ago. Unfortunately the game win to a grindy p2w way since the destroyers get released.
<br>Several social function got removed, so if you plan to play it with your friends this is not your game anymore, since only 2 ppl can play together as group and the waiting time depend on the time is horrible.
<br>
<br>With the new destroyer shipclass they introduced a pay/grind to win ships.
<br>The Russian devs simply just doesn&apos;t care about the English specially the US playerbase.
<br>
<br>After 3500h of playing I&apos;d say NO, this is not the game what are you looking for anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=6190781">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself was good in the beginning, I had a lot of fun with it. But everytime it became balanced and fun, developers just messed it up entirely. Since the game came out of beta, they didn&apos;t just make small balance changes to make the game interesting, they screwed up the core of the gameplay several times. They never listen to the community, the official forum is a joke and the grind is so slow, that everyone I wanted to invite to the game just gave up in the beginning. Since the 1.2.4. the game just became unplayable, they teared apart the community, no teamplay available anymore, since they took out 4-man-squads. The game is getting more and more bugs with every patch, the servers are terrible. I really liked this game, but now it reached a point where I no longer have fun anymore. When dev&apos;s can get their &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; together and finally listen to the community and concentrate on the most important things, not just fixing two pixels in the corner and put an air-conditioner into a space-ship, then maybe I&apos;ll change my review. But for now, the first two lines are perfectly describes the current state of this game.
<br>
<br>Update: 21th March, 2016:
<br>Now all tiers are terrible except T5, destroyers are unbalanced, they introduced more grindy ships what you can &quot;reach easier with money&quot; and still no 4-man squads. Getting better, isn&apos;t it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=6199957">Expand</a></span>

Very bad balance of the units. Autoaimaing weapons and abilities like &quot;press 1 button to kill&quot; fight off all the excitement and interest. Players count in this game is relatively small and there are all the associated problems like a long waiting in lobby and unequal teams, but administration concern to the users is like they are not needed.
<br>Any player can be banned for nothing. For example if you show high efficiency. This is cause for suspicion. The suspicion is sufficient reason for punishment. For punishment do not need proof, the burden of proving his innocence lies with the defendant, after bringing into force of the punishment. It looks absurd? But this is how the relationships between admins and community are working.
<br>Just imagine you start playing this game, spent the time, money, leveled up ships and weapons, became an experienced player. And suddenly permanent ban for your account arrives. Just because inadequate admin thought something or took it wrong into his head.

<br>P2W and cash grabbing go hand in this game. You want the best ship in game, with the best equipment? Just buy enough lottery containers and credits until you can build it...
<br>
<br>There was not a single event within this year, that wasn&apos;t aimed at pressuring players into buying those  lottery bundles through limiting the event timely. Shining example for that, the current Rank 14 destroyer &quot;event&quot;.
<br>
<br>There is no real balance left in the game, since the &quot;Age of Destroyers&quot; has gone completely off the rails. Missions were messed up to fit the destroyers.
<br>
<br>Reviews here and on the Steam page are either bought or just fake, to keep the game&apos;s rating high, too fool new players into believing, that this game is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;solid&quot;.
<br>
<br>The censorship on the Steam forum and the Star Conflict forum is real, and is a slap into the face of every honest player, trying to suggest good or solid game changes.
<br>
<br>The grind is real, and you have to grind for every single ship you want to actually play around with.
<br>
<br>The DLCs are way overpriced, even when they are at 50%.
<br>
<br>You need a subscription in this game, otherwise you won&apos;t be able to find something good in the so called &quot;trophy search&quot; after each battle. With a sub. you can open two more spots for some random loot.
<br>
<br>Every loot, no matter where you pick it up is RANDOM...
<br>
<br>PvP players get the new destroyers practically handed to them on a silver plater, while PvE player have no chance of getting enough resources in time to build those new ships.
<br>
<br>Which leads to PvE being practically DEAD in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=6828425">Expand</a></span>

<br>With quite nice graphical part and high potential.
<br>New friends have been found, and some of best time spent playing.
<br>Due to greedy managing and questionable developers all positive sides degraded into awful matter.
<br>
<br>This is not simply a Pay2Win game. This is a Keep Paying 2 Win. (&#xA9;Gizmo.mac)
<br>Greed is good. This is developer&#x2019;s motto.
<br>
<br>Development process was simplified: Create new IMBA ship which will dominate the battlefield.
<br>Make it expensive and available for real money. Make grind to new ship long and painful.
<br>As soon as ordinary players get enough resources to get this dominating ship - nerf it, and roll out new IMBA.
<br>
<br>Even investing 600$ may only grant you domination for a month or two, then your precious ship will be nerfed to brick.
<br>You pay more, or die from another &quot;happy customer&quot; as everyone else.
<br>
<br>Nobody cares about player&#x2019;s opinion. Player can be banned for little to no reason. But - if you invest enough money in game - your ban can be revoked, allowing you to scam, grief and cheat again.
<br>
<br>Forum ban can be gained just for having your own opinion, or not hailing developers.
<br>In-game chat ban can be gained just automatically - with no reason.
<br>Full account ban can be gained by cheating, or arguing with GM, or writing a negative Steam review.
<br>
<br>All bans can be revoked by writing a positive Steam review.
<br>Look at game time on positive reviews - how much players recently exceed game time of 100 hours?
<br>Targem just forges positive ratings by face accounts IMO.
<br>
<br>There is no control over GM&apos;s and CM&apos;s, with complete disrespect to players from their side.
<br>Example - Community manger calling me &quot;scum&quot; constantly on his stream, ended up treating to ban my whole team - because he was killed and we were clearly winning.
<br>
<br>Another example - league system discussion stream. Top corporation&#x2019;s leaders present, decision was made that leagues will be in 8vs8 format.
<br>Leagues were started as 4vs4 - nobody cares about player&#x2019;s opinion, even if they ask.
<br>
<br>For all years of the game existence I witnessed an ad less than five times.
<br>
<br>When the game was released on Steam - there were high online - for a month. Somehow people in charge wasn&apos;t aware that their servers already operated at peak power, and lots of new players just pushed the system to lag hell.
<br>No new servers were added, new players went elsewhere, and with maximum online of 600 I may get &quot;Server under heavy load&quot; message.
<br>
<br>Now, what will you get if you will try to play StarConflict now?
<br>Until you will reach Rank 4 ships - there will be a pale shadow of its former beauty and glory.
<br>Almost balanced, somewhat slow, with less options for modules but so nice.
<br>
<br>Progressing further will bring you into feeding frenzy of epic proportions. Unless you will invest A LOT in the game - you will be cannon fodder. Again and again, with progression slowed on purpose, hard caps on income unless by money investment and matchmaking weird enough to put you against ships 5 ranks higher than yours.
<br>
<br>Old days, when skill determined an outcome of the fight are gone. It&apos;s hard to overcome auto-aiming weapons, auto-healing enemy ships, and your team hiding under brown rocks whole match.
<br>
<br>Certain team compositions are unkillable on progression ships. Until you will farm or pay enough to get a counter-class ship yourself - you will be farmed. With little to no chance you will be stomped upon.
<br>
<br>If your stats become high - expect totally useless team as a boulder on your neck, have a happy time carrying these. And again. And again.
<br>
<br>And be prepared - some in-game activity can be accessed only through third-party site. There are no control about that site, but rewards and progression are counted on it. So pay no attention if there are shifts in final teams, or people not present in battles are rewarded.
<br>
<br>Latest addition - game items stockpile are limited now - so you can&apos;t stockpile resources now, you have no motivation to do quests, or everything you gain get burned.

All my DLC are next to useless now.
All my premium ships are next to useless now.
All my time spent on leveling progression ships is wasted now.

This is official cheating from developers.

Conclusion: Targem and Gaijin combined efforts have killed StarConflict. Not worthy of your time now, not recommended anymore.

<br>
<br>But for STAR CONFLICT if you pay money you get better ships and weapons than those not paying....in other words you pay money to get an advantage. Might as well be cheating. Makes every game uneven between the people who are paying and the people who are not.
<br>
<br>Why not follow the LoL pay scheme? I&apos;ve spent over 400 on LoL......and although I LOVE the gameplay on Star Conflict.....I won&apos;t spend a dime on it. Why? Because I hate &quot;cheating&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3159330">Expand</a></span>

WAY too easy to smurf new players. Makes the game unenjoyable for the new player, and keeps the veterans coming back. Nothing competitive about this game, just choose the lower tier if you want to win more to take advantage of new players trying to gear up.
<br>
<br>As for the game play, it&apos;s fun, but still not that great for space shooters. Using the mouse to control your ship AND aim your guns at the same time is quirky, and you frequently run in to objects trying to get around them because the camera doesn&apos;t always stay right behind your ship.
<br>
<br>It was fun at first, but until they add an intelligent matchmaking system, this game fails.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170061">Expand</a></span>

I absolutely love the gameplay design -- complete six axis controls, aim de-linked from navigation, environments that give rise to actual solo strategy like taking cover and getting your opponents to crash, and a few different gameplay modes and missions to boot.  A $60 game built using this gameplay engine with a complete single-player campaign and story in addition to multiplayer modes would be an instant buy.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s free to play, which is another significant bonus.
<br>
<br>Where I&apos;m taking off tons of points are:
<br>1)  An absolutely terrible matchmaking system.  Making the jump from one tier to the next is discouraging and frustrating.  While it&apos;s fun to dominate in a lower tier with a maxed-out ship and maxed-out weapons in that tier, once you move up to the next tier you&apos;re completely helpless.  Doesn&apos;t help enough to grind, because your synergy (experience) is based on dealing damage to and killing opponents, taking control of control points, etc., all of which are difficult-to-impossible to do against opponents who are an order of magnitude more powerful than you.  I went from a K/D ratio of over 10:1 in tier 3, to a K/D ratio of more like 1:10 in tier 4.  Frustrating enough to make you give up the game entirely.  PvE isn&apos;t much different.
<br>
<br>2)  Super crappy AI to fill in spots in relatively empty matches.  The AIs feel like they&apos;re just going in a straight line most of the time.  I can kill them quickly before they even seem to notice that I&apos;m shooting at them.
<br>
<br>3)  Super, super long wait times between matches, with absolutely nothing to do while you&apos;re waiting.  I&apos;m talking minutes.  It sucks the fun out of the game.  If they implemented something like spectating while you&apos;re waiting for a match, like they do in MarioKart 8 online, that wouldn&apos;t be so bad.
<br>
<br>Some of that might have been avoided by having a decent single-player mode.  Yes, there&apos;s a single-player mode, with some good area design, but what&apos;s the point of it if there&apos;s really nothing to do?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=6894020">Expand</a></span>

The entire system was changed, many ships were removed or switched to entirely different classes (removing them for me and making me have to re-buy them). In addition to this, they changed much of the leveling in the game, making it so players had to regrind to achieve the same level that they once had before.
<br>
<br>To make matters worse, their supposed &apos;balance&apos; changes make certain ships ridiculously overpowered and other ships massively underpowered. Certain weapons or modules that once made the game fun and easy to play now are nerfed into the ground and other modules were introduced.
<br>
<br>Unless you want an excercise in frustration, stay well away from this game. If you enjoy frantic air-based combat, ala HAWX this -may- be for you but it is unlikely as the player base is akin to League of Legends and they tend to scream HODOR whenever they can or insult others rather than give constructive criticism or advice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3233489">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As maybe the only one of its kind, it may initially be fun and addictive in the lower tiers. However, the mid/high-level game is completely broken, and gets more broken each week. Player retention is extremely low, and the player base slowly dwindles out of frustration with the game (2 months after official release there are less players than in beta), and the developers try to compensate with changes that favour the few remaining veteran &quot;elite&quot; players, allowing them to &quot;farm&quot; new players (called &quot;baby seal clubbing&quot;) and make the game less and less fun for casual players.
<br>
<br>Even 2 months after release, the developers still constantly change fundamental game parameters, such as how the matchmaking works, the PvE setup, etc.
<br>
<br>The actual ship building and optimization, as well as space-shooter gameplay itself, is solid and fun. Though there are some problems with UI design, translations from russian - and if you can get over the mid/high-tier 3 to 5 minute wait times until you are actually placed in a match, and the 80% chance that the match will be either completely unbalanced, only 2v2 or 3v3, or both (depending on the time of day, i.e. when the 7eet kidz, aka veterans, come out of school).
<br>
<br>As apparently common with this kind of games, the community is appalingly abrasive, with the veteran players overly protective of their advantages and privileges gained in Beta, and most of them unable to understand that they and their &quot;if you don&apos;t like being butchered then fly better&quot; attitude are an essential part of the problems with the game for casual gamers. The community is thusly split between &quot;veterans&quot; and &quot;noobs&quot;, and between &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;premium&quot; players, each blaming the others for the shortcomings of the game. It&apos;s especially funny if you see some of the advocates preaching against the purchase of premium ships fly those themselves...
<br>
<br>The game itself becomes ever more grindy, as the changes which allow the veteran players to compete with their fully developed ships in matches with &quot;normal&quot; players and their stock ships deny the non-vets the kills required to level (aka. &quot;synergize&quot;) their own ships. This seems to be intentional by the developers, to force players to spend cash out of frustration with the useless grind (with each change concerning game modes followed shortly after by an approrpriate &quot;sale&quot;).
<br>
<br>Out of theoretical 4 game modes (PvP, PvE, Sector Conquest, Open World), only PvP and PvE is initially available to starting players. Sector Conquest is reserved high-tier PvP for &quot;Corporations&quot; (similar to Clans/Guilds), dominated by Russian players. Open World is available for low/mid tier and initially interesting, but can become very boring very quickly, and a griefer/PK situation seems to develop only slowly (due to lack of player targets). Finally, PvE, formerly used by established players for &quot;farming&quot;, has now been basically closed to most casual/solo-players from the mid-tiers upward. PvE missions &quot;balanced&quot; for the best and fully developed ships in the tier bracket can now only be accomplished by players in cordinated groups, or very very good solo players with high-rank fully leveled ships.
<br>
<br>If you are a casual player and want to try this, be very careful not to spend to much money on it until you reach at least Tier 3, as the gameplay will change markedly for the higher tiers, and you really need to have a masochistic vein to endure the slaughtering by the veterans (and believe me, it doesn&apos;t get better - unless you&apos;re very good it get&apos;s only worse). If you still decide to spend cash, make sure to wait for a suitable sale - those are very common.
<br>
<br>If you are a very very good player, you may actually like this game... for a time... Even among the established veterans there is a tendency to leave the game in frustration and disgust, and some only seem  to stay aboard because they already have invested hundreds of dollars and/or hours in their accounts, and now cling desperately to their virtual status.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, there are very few viable alternatives currently available for MOBA space sim fans, so many of the SC players seem to simply wait for the release of Elite:Dangerous, Entropy, Star Citizen, etc. to head over there.
<br>
<br>+ship building/optimization
<br>+actual pvp combat (if placed in a balanced match)
<br>-community is disgustingly abrasive
<br>-matchmaking is now completely unbalanced in mid/high tiers, favouring vets, increasing grind for &quot;casuals&quot;
<br>-wait times are insane, 3-5 minutes for matches that last only 1 to 8 minutes
<br>-developers fail to understand what to do to stem player base deterioration, and strongly favour vets interests
<br>-random undocumented changes by developers even outside of &quot;official&quot; patches, with any criticism stricly censored/deleted by the inexperienced mods, as if not talking about a problem will make it go away...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588210">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The Combat in the game is very enjoyable with there being many different types of ships and weapons which will keep the combat interesting.
<br>- The maps available within the game are very 3 dimensional with there being large areas with many different features such as asteroids, destroyed space stations or space debris scattered plentifully throughout the map which makes dog fights become much more maneuverable, especially for faster ships which cannot take as much fire.
<br>- There are a lot of different game modes to play with PvP and PvE modes which both have different challenges and objectives. Within PvP there is an arcade mode in which it will randomly pick a game type for you to play which varies from generic capture the flag type games to more interesting defeat the enemy commander modes. There is also a realism mode within PvP which means that once all your ships are destroyed then you are out of the game and an up and coming sector conquest mode which isn&#x2019;t currently in the game. In PvE, there is a 4 player co-op mode which puts you in a randomly selected scenario with 4 people and you complete the objectives. This means there is a large variety of different mode in which to have fun with and will give the game a lot more longevity with there being a lot to do.
<br>- There is also an interesting contracts system in the game in which you pick a specific faction and you can complete some once a day contracts for that faction which will reward you with some extra money as a reward. As you complete more contracts you get faction reputation which gives you more and more quests for you to complete for the faction to grant you more money. The quests are also not boring and laborious like a daily WoW quest as these are very easily completable tasks which you would most likely of accomplished without having even accepted the contract.
<br>- Also with this being an MMO there is constant updates being added to the game and changes being made all the time so there is a reason to come back to the game every now and then to see what they have added/changed.
<br>
<br>The Negatives:
<br>-  The game is unfortunately fallen into the trap of being a pay to win game with the best ships acquirable in the game being only available to those willing to pay with the same case being that with weapons, missiles and modules. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that the items that you buy are completely overpowered and that you are unable to win if the opponent has them but the stats of these bought ships are clearly higher than others.
<br>- The matchmaking time is very diverse with times when it can take merely 10-20 seconds to join a game and others when it will take up or 2 minutes to join, and during this time the equipment and ship menus are locked so there is not much to do. This can mean that you are forced to just sit and watch the chat for the allotted time which i&#x2019;m pretty sure will give you brain cancer if you read it long enough. Take this with a pinch of salt however as this will vary from region to region.
<br>- Although this is a small complaint there are a lot of different maps however a lot of the maps are very similar to one another since, lets be honest, there isn&#x2019;t much to see in space.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>This is a very fun game with a very fun mechanics and combat and a lot of customisation options within the game for you to have fun with, however this game is held back by its pay to win model.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3101645">Expand</a></span>

Initially, i was horrified to see that this game is almost a copy-paste of World of Tanks, forcing your space ships to be locked into battle, even after you leave (which serves no purpose whatsoever besides limiting your ability to play for fun) but the biggest of my concern was shrugged off thanks to one very vital change that kept me playing which was the ability to respawn in the same game after dying in certain game-modes. Unfortunely, this change also falls short due to you being unable to pick what map/modes you specifically want, leaving me half-heartedly disappointed in the already impressive amounts of turd-flinging one have to swallow in order to enjoy the good bits of this game. I also haven&apos;t seen any lag in the gameplay itself but they managed to screw up the &quot;get back in game&quot; function you need if you disconnect because, yes, you guessed it: your ship will be unavailable as long as the old match is still going on which is to be expected after going through the horrible account creation procedure consisting of severely late email activations, automatic random passwords and steam-account linking issues. (You MUST log into the game through your steam account orelse you won&apos;t get in, another sh!t function with no purpose) I could keep on going about the mountains of flaws like balance, pay 2 win and lack of weapons but at the end of the day, this is just a solid space-shooter with good graphics all with solid controls being utterly demolished and pulled down into the depths of sh!t-olympus because someone had the bright idea to along with all the other horrid design decisions, include unlimited range and unlimited ammo sniper ships in SPACE (where small asteroids are the only scarce cover you&apos;ll ever find) and have them do insane damage on any kind of ship.

<br>2) Almost perfect free to play model. The grind is not too much (though it&apos;s certainly there), and the ships you can buy with money are not strictly superior (though they are better in some ways, just like every ship has their own quirks).
<br>3) Very nice gradual learning, you start with very few options, slower ships, only one game mode, and you ramp up the number of modules and modes you can use gradually through the tiers.
<br>4) Developing competitive side. Observer system already in place, tournaments are held, teams are preparing well ahead.
<br>5) Multiple game modes with their own interesting mechanics and multiple maps, some very imaginative.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s bad
<br>1) Low population, and all that comes with this. Sometimes long Q times for some modes.
<br>2) No skill based matchmaking, so everyone is thrown into the game as equals (except squads who have to be matched by an enemy squad), which sometimes lead to very unbalanced matches.
<br>3) The game is not really dynamic compared to shooters like Freelancer or even Moon Breakers, if you fly anything other than an interceptor than you usually strafe behind cover more than you dogfight, which is fine for frigates but a bit weird for a fighter.
<br>4) Somewhat lacking balance, one shiptree (graph) (Jericho) is considered strictly inferior in most areas to the others. Hopefully will be patched, and anyone can play anything anyways, it&apos;s not restricted, players don&apos;t belong to a side.
<br>
<br>All in all, a very enjoyable space shooter, even if somewhat grindy, but if you enjoy your game, you won&apos;t notice it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4189303">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, onto the game play. It takes a while to learn how to play, but it is not terrible, you get the hang of things quickly. If you like to be in the middle of the action, i suggest the quicker planes, if you want to be someone who can deal ton of damage, go with Frigates, that&apos;s what i do. Graphics are nice for a F2P, and, honestly, i do not feel like it is much of a pay to win at all, so, all in all, great game. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=2980979">Expand</a></span>

By &quot;deleting their account&quot; and never playing again they are missing out on what this game is becoming. The fact the developers are pumping out patches and tweeks to make this game more fun, shows they are serious and to give it a better chance.
<br>
<br>As with most new games, especially of F2p styles, there are multiple kinks that need to be ironed out in the beginning months that help shape the game. What the developers may think is  a fun idea, could easily turn out to be a bad one. As well, I would wish people stopped complaining about the fact you need to pay to get ahead. Firstly this is a myth, I so far have purchased nothing and I can easily go into a game and feel like a champ. I enjoy this game enough where I will be purchasing a subscription in the future however. This developer is building a product you get to play for free and never have to purchase anything if you so feel it, beggars cannot be choosers. I understand yes, that they rely on making the game fun to play  but they do this so you will pay.
<br>
<br>That aside, let&#x2019;s talk about the game itself&#x2026;.
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>I will start with Graphics. This is not a world changing game in terms of graphics, but they look good. Good enough to not turn the average player today away and by no means is that to be offensive, this game does well in the graphics field and I would rate that a 7/10.
<br>
<br>Sound
<br>In my opinion the game sounds good and the music sounds great. I personally enjoy the music that plays and when I am engaged in an epic battle of proportions with the enemy it makes you feel like you&#x2019;re on the battlefield.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>In brief, you are a star pilot. You command 1 of three types of ships, Fighter, Interceptor and Frigate. Each has their own abilities, stat points and style of play. You really should try all three for multiple games before you can make your choice on which one you like the most and please do not judge by how easily other plays kill you with that class of ship. As you play you earn experience, money and loyalty. As you progress, each branch opens up more ships, &#x201C;parts&#x201D; for your ship and abilities for your pilot. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to pay to progress these items  Just play the game normally and you will get ahead. Now if you do pay, you will notice an increase in all of the 3 features.
<br>
<br>Controls
<br>The controls for this game are surprisingly simplified for flying in space. You can go up, down, left, right, strafe, diagonal, reverse, and mix them together to outsmart and destroy your enemy. It&#x2019;s an easy game to play as far as the controls.
<br>
<br>Conclusion.
<br>
<br>I give this game an 8/10. I feel that this game excels in all areas, but there is room for improvement as well. There should be more weapons, upgrades and abilities. I do like however, that the game is not too complicated when it comes to these features. When I play a piloting game I want to be in the battle and focused on that, while having a fair advantage. I don&#x2019;t have time to worry about my Plasma Cannons causing &#x201C;X&#x201D; damage at &#x201C;X&#x201D; range, but he used a magnetic defector, lowering range to &#x201C;x&#x201D;, shielding was increased by 6 hypno points, while defense was increased using a hypo multiplier he had in inventory, so then I countered with an energy ray, a hypo spray increasing my range&#x2026;you get the point. Its more in your face action, with changes outside the battle. There are the few abilities you can change in game, but they help only so much. If you are into that kind of game play you will be unsatisfied with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3096079">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have only bought the minimum amount of coins or Galactic credits to get an advantage and it didn&apos;t seem to be worth it. The premium ships are alright in the begging but at rank 4 you can get tier 4 ships (rank 4 allows beginning tier 2 ships) Overall the game is great to look at, im getting 60FPS solid. its worth a shot to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3194449">Expand</a></span>

The matchmaker also has a bad habit of making very unbalanced teams.  The actual progression (synergy) of your ship doesn&apos;t seem to be calculated (or at least not properly).  Honestly it can be fun, and I would have rated it much higher if it weren&apos;t for the terrible matchmaking system.  Spending half of your time waiting to play, earns the game half credit from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375680">Expand</a></span>

I give it 7/10 because it is a very good game and I have had a lot of fun, but it can be better and I am hopeful that as time goes on it will continue to improve. Certainly worth a try if you like space combat.

<br>--Paying gets you--
<br>1. Special ships that are fully leveled up at the time of purchase
<br>- which lose the advantage once you level your ships up
<br>2. Permanent Exp(called &apos;synergy&apos;) boost
<br>- which lose the advantage once you have max exp
<br>3. Ability to take extra &apos;synergy&apos; earned to level one ship and apply it to another
<br>- if synergy is managed correctly, this perk becomes useless
<br>4. Visual Modifications to your ships
<br>- this offers no advantage to the ships (similar to skins bought in League of Legends)
<br>5. Elite ship Modules
<br>- better ones can be found through drops
<br>
<br>As you can see, this model can be compared to many other free-to-play game structures and the only advantage to paying is a faster ride to the end for the ones who don&apos;t want to spend hours in the game.
<br>
<br>As to the actual gameplay..
<br>I feel somewhat nostalgic flying through space, dog-fighting, saving fellow teammates from certain doom.  Then to only realize you are knee deep in enemy territory and you have to barrel-roll through narrow cracks in the asteroid fields just to dodge countless enemy ships and their, must faster, homing missiles.  This game reminds me many times of what a good Star Wars Game should be, but then, with the sheer number of ship-types and customization, turns it into a potentially even larger-than-movie-space-battle dream come true.
<br>
<br>In the end, it is free-to-play, and I think everyone to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3514944">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Star Conflict is a fast-paced space shooter. Star Conflict is a developing game, but there are already very many features already implemented and much more to come. The depth is also quite amazing and the gameplay is very tactical, but the story does leave a thing or to to be desired. Star Conflict also loses points for immature/profane pilot comms, and a slightly confusing UI.</span>

I must admit I find myself leaving this game for maybe months on end as well (and I&apos;m probably out of my Corp by now), so who am I to blame? the second problem comes with open space AKA Invasion mode. its almost enough to make it a true MMO, but you can see that unless you form a group with your friend, you can go into open space, find some one, both go into one warp gate, and never see each other again. it also makes the matches even more empty than before, so I repeatedly go back to lower tier battles so i can actually play with some guys looking to just enjoy playing this. overall though, best game since LEGO Star Wars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=5076138">Expand</a></span>

Best described as WoT in space, it does things quite different from WoT and I do like what it does differently...mostly.
<br>
<br>The things that differ which are nice are the combat, research structure, and modules.  The combat is relatively fleshed out:  there are small Interceptor ships, Fighters, and Frigates all with different abilities and different available special abilities.  Interceptors are essentially quick sabeteurs, Fighters are general purpose which can be used as a Interceptor/Frigate hybrid to put it simply, and Frigates are tanks or snipers depending on the Frigate (also support).
<br>
<br>Research is done by simply buying what you want as long as you are the right level for it (which you generally are since leveling up is typically done faster than gaining currency).  There is no owning ships, but you do have to buy a preceding ship if required.  The game does allow you to skip ahead with some ships but you&apos;d still need the level to buy that ship.
<br>
<br>Now, what sets this apart from WoT the most are the modules.  Similar to equipment in WoT, except more diverse, you can customize EVERY facet of your ship as you gain more advanced ships.  For instance, you could put focus on your hull then put a kamikazi secondary on your Interceptor that has a plasma gun.  This would let you drop the enemy shields, then if you are taking a larger percentage of damage, go all out on a suicidal explosion which would do more damage than a regular death explosion, possibly killing the enemy in the process.  Or, you could slap lasers on a Frigate, to keep it versatile and medium range...but you still don&apos;t have to.  And even then, it gets more diverse.  Do you want burst lasers, which do less DPS but have no overheat timer?  Do you want close range lasers which have a lower operational range than long range, but max DPS?  And this is merely scratching the surface.
<br>
<br>The biggest flaw Star Conflict has is simply that it is in Beta.  For instance, I saved up while casually playing for a week for a new starship, only to see that they raised the price from 850,000 to 1,250,000!  This really put me off of the game for now...but when it comes out, they should have this sort of stuff fleshed out.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is good as it is, but it has a massive potential due to the ridiculous level of customization possible, and fun combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3120523">Expand</a></span>

<br>At the heart of this game is fast action space combat.  You pilot three different classes of ships ranging from the ultra-fast Interceptor to the slower, sturdier and longer ranged Frigate.  Each ship type has it&apos;s own set of special abilities and each faction has it&apos;s own abilities that separate the ships and distinguish them from each other.
<br>
<br>The base shell of this game allows for so much potential that it makes me rather excited to wait for the future.  There are PvE scenarios in which a team of four try to defend/assault three stage encounters that often end in a &quot;Boss&quot; fight which is a super powerful ship or hordes of enemies.  The PvE can easily be expanded in the future and it bodes well for fans of cooperative action!
<br>
<br>The PvP is great with several different game modes that allows for a variety of strategy and ways to win.  You can pilot a faster Interceptor with a &quot;Micro-warp drive&quot; that allows for you to mini-warp around the map and take strategic points.  You could sit back and launch torpedoes to support your teammates with large chunks of burst damage to the enemy or you could run a front-line Frigate sending out recharges for shields and repairs for hulls of all your teammates.
<br>
<br>My ratio of time spent to when this game released is sickening but all worth it.  I have not enjoyed and kept coming back to a game in a very long time and the ability to expand all the modes, ships, modules, and adding new scenarios as the developers have mentioned bodes for wonderful potential for this game&apos;s future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3025817">Expand</a></span>

Much needed too, nice to be in a free roaming sim, instead of a &quot;rail-system&quot; *chough, SWTOR* *cough*. It is free to play, with a &quot;pay for it now&quot; aspect to support it. Every item &amp; ship can be bought with normal currency, but they have &quot;gold&quot; items that can be bought with cash, there are BLUE items that have the exact same stats as the gold, and those are purchased with in game currency. So there isn&apos;t a pay to win, just pay for it now, or you could just play normally, grind it out, and get something with the exact same stats. It has some issues, but overall it is a very nice breath of fresh air. Recommended for anyone who like FPS games, or space fliers like Xwing Vs Tie Fighter, or the mentioned freelancer &amp; tachyon.

<br>People who think this is Pay to Win, do not understand the concept, and it&apos;s completely obvious what the devs are doing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3064573">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m giving this game the thumbs up purely because I feel that the flight and combat style was the best I&apos;ve played. With the game seamingly more geared towards PvP (like most games nowadays) I felt like the PvE side lacked just a little. PvE had some great missions to play and with each new tier you jumped to in lvl&apos;s, you got new and harder missions. I would suggest going with a group of friends as per my experience, the random pugs sat and did nothing half the time just soaking up free XP.. unfortunate.. My biggest gripe with the game was how &quot;grindy&quot; it felt to get anywhere, even with the release of Free Roam (their open world concept) the missions for it felt very &quot;go here, fetch this, drop it here&quot;.. Outside of PvE and to the PVP, I don&apos;t have any real words other then Carnage and Chaos. Pick something that moves and kill it, before it kills you.
<br>This game rocks the world of space combat. Just mesmerizing graphics and you really feel the difference when piloting large ships *compared to the little mosquitos*.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Good graphics
<br>- Good handling of spaceships *compared to other non mentionable space games*
<br>- Fast paced combat
<br>- Many PvE missions require tactics. PvP too, of course.
<br>- &quot;Invasion&quot; and craft: modules, spaceships, weapons and guns.
<br>- That &quot;grinding&quot; feeling when you are getting higher tier ships.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Other players sometimes take this game too seriously.
<br>
<br>Summary: Well done game with surprisingly balanced ships and beautiful graphics. Try it!:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4628602">Expand</a></span>

When I saw the &quot;price&quot; I immediately downloaded it, and I have to say I did not regret it. This game is a space shooter with awesome gameplay. You can buy different types of ships and choose your alliance, which will change the gameplay a lot. There are five modes if I remember correctly, most treat with control points, and there is a refined team deathmatch mode which I enjoyed a lot. There are a few glitches present, I had a few major glitches that ended up being fixed by patches. This game is currently in late-beta so tolerance is recommended when it comes to some imperfections. Overall graphics are customizable and although they are not outstanding they do look good. The sound is okay, although the soundtrack isn&apos;t long and the sound effects aren&apos;t outstanding. My only true complain are the maps, they are good but they are few, I really hope more are added with patches. This game so far is extremely enjoyable, download it since there is nothing to loose and judge it yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3024537">Expand</a></span>

I promise you that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3018921">Expand</a></span>

I personally play it for a PvP part, i am not a fan of PvE or its version of &quot;Open space&quot;. If you progress a bit further in the game, PvP becomes some kind of blockbuster movie - extreme speeds/agility, cool visual effects, extremely dynamic and diverse, quite a few different builds can be used on each role and different interactions of those makes it &quot; fairly easy to pick up, but hard to master type of game&quot;. Did i mention ship designs? - simply awesome.

It isn&apos;t the MMO it claims, and isn&apos;t anywhere near being an MMO, but it&apos;s a fun lobby-based space pvp game.</span>

<br>But soon you&apos;ll realize that this game is unbalanced, matchmaking is awful and servers are terrible.

<br>The lack of players especially in non-Russian territories makes this game even more difficult to play with long wait times for matches.

<br>The open beta is going on for a year or longer and the game still doesn&apos;t have a release date yet. They plan to implement more features and game modes this year and supposed to officially release the game but all that seems far away with the baby steps in development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3969380">Expand</a></span>

<br>Forum moderators - are the best of the best. especially - Bazinga XD (beware)
<br>Game has &quot;open world&quot; wich based on more than 45 locations
<br>U can be a pirate  and plundered caravans ( read other players or npc&apos;s)
<br>
<br>But the most i like in the game - is chat atmosphere of russian schoolchildren&apos;s &gt;.</span>

<br>
<br>First of all: This game is not Star Citizen, or Eve Online or Elite Dangerous. It doesn&apos;t want to be either.
<br>
<br>This game is a lobby based, free to play fighting arena game, settled in space. You have several ships at your disposal, with different classes and a lot of modules and modifiers to customize their performance. Then you go into battle in teams against other people in several game modes like the usual team battle, king of the hill, capture points etc... So far really standard.
<br>
<br>We can say that it is very similar to Warthunder of World of tanks, but with spaceships regarding the pvp skirmish matches.
<br>
<br>Then you have also High end content for clans with rewards if you conquer some of the sectors, which is nice for hardcore players, since you can even win a few premium currency here and there.
<br>
<br>And finally, what makes this game very balanced is that you can also play missions or scenarios in a Co-op fashion with friends, or straight open world and do PvP (pilot killing) or PvE vs AI.
<br>
<br>The open world is not like Eve online, is more like a huge sandbox map, with some RPG like missions (go there, kill 4 wolfs, come back, go there, pick some asteroids and return) and people to interact with. But you have respawns and you don&apos;t lose your stuff if you are killed, so it is more arcadish.
<br>
<br>Good thing is that the open world comes with a simple manufacturing tab which allows you to manufacture special ammo, weapons and consumables with the resources collected in there, and also 3 top tier ships which can be configured as you want when you are building them.
<br>
<br>The business model is akin to said games (warthunder, world of tanks) so you have to play and unlock ships with experience, credits and several special currency to get better and better modules. Investing money in the game gives you economical advance, as it is usual in this games, but so far there is nothing you can get with gold that you can&apos;t get for free. You will just have it later.
<br>
<br>Concerning most of the complains about the pay to win in premium ships and crews, premium ships are not better than standard ships. They have the same slots than their credit counterparts, and the bonus are different, but not better. Modules can be shared between ships so there is no difference either.
<br>
<br>The problem is that in the tech tree, the credit ships appear with their level 1 stats, and premiums always appear with full level, because they are sold that way. But after you level your credit ships you will see that the premium ships are not better.
<br>
<br>Finally, crews don&apos;t give you any advantage over non paying users. Crews allow you to have different slots with different configurations, so you can max-min more ships, instead of flying all of them with a single set of configurations (implants, as they are called)
<br>
<br>But since you can respawn as much as you can with any of your ships in all but one of the modes, the difference in 1v1 situation is nil. You won&apos;t get any better implant of bonuses with crews, just different presets.
<br>
<br>So my final verdict is a 9, because they still have to include some content they promised this year, mostly the corporation Dreadnoughts, and balance a bit some of the new consumables introduced with the open world manufacturing system.
<br>PROS:
<br>- Good art and graphics.
<br>- Runs well in mid and low end computers.
<br>- Free to play, it won&apos;t hurt your wallet if you try it.
<br>- Fast paced action and a good number of game modes.
<br>- PvP, PvE, and a sandbox with both, all in the same game.
<br>- SPACE DUDE!! SPACE!!!
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- A good chunk of the population is russian, so expect longer than avg waiting times out of russian or european prime time.
<br>- Servers are a bit unstable sometimes, but this is something I&apos;m founding in almost any late game.
<br>- Population is not as high as in mainstream games like world of tanks or warthunder. You won&apos;t notice it in low - mid tiers, but top end content lacks a bit of players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4633184">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve only been playing it for a short time but the game play screams polished and definitely worth downloading into your Steam library. The action is fast paced and there are a multitude of variables that are available for customization within the game such as customizing your ship and using special abilities during gameplay such as cloaking devices and stuff like that. I will be adding to this review more as a play the game more. But i&apos;m pretty sure it will stay at a ten like Tribes Ascend because the game is free. The ability to join a corporation or clan so to speak will give you more options available within the game. The multiple ship types are a really great element to the game as well and while I am still in the beginning stages of the game, each of the ships have different strengths and weaknesses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=4018838">Expand</a></span>

The numbers do not lie and the numbers have always shown to those willing to look that the free to play space crafts are superior or equal in balance to premium ones. some premium ships have badass bonuses but what they fail to see is the weaknesses of the ship as a result. all ships have strengths and weaknesses no more than any other in this game, premium or not. after a year of being in beta. this game is kicking ass and taking names. anyone who has taken the time to learn this games mechanics and core structure (which is not easy or quick) will tell you how awesome it actually is under the surface most barely scratch. None of the cons i have read on this page still exist or did exist to the degree these people have claimed indicating most reviews were written after very little play time. after 3 months of playing i love this company and this game. this company is the opposite of SOE and EA....they reward their playerbase regularly for everything and nothing. they patch their patches to make sure new patches are implemented with minimal issues or bugs. they refuse to dumb the games massive offset system down for the stupid masses which i wholeheartedly support as a player and feel not enough companies have the guts to do that and since this one did i give them credit for not selling out. people who spend money on this game before learning the ropes will be in for a rough time. it is a very complex game. you should do your homework first. after all you are not some idiot who hands cash to people you have just met for something that you just found and know nothing about, are you? I could write much more but i chose to crap on the critics here in bulk cause their arguments are flatlined and in some cases straight up incorrect..... this game company loves its players and week after week their actions back up that statement. see for yourself...... add me in game as &quot;aBIRDof&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=3981327">Expand</a></span>

The art and design in the game, coupled with the need for great piloting skills makes it a game to play for hours on end. The only problems are that it takes forever to find a match and not enough people play.</span>

                                        <span>Amazing game. . . needs more people to play. Its hard not to love the game. . . however when you first start pvp stay in the T1 -t2 matches untill 700 games or so.  T3-T5 there is a very large skill curve.  With all the new updates like dread&apos;s it makes the game so much more fun !!!  YOU MUST PLAY. . . if you ever read this review look up Adam_West.</span>

<br>
<br>Star Conflict is an amazing game.
<br>
<br>Yes, I am aware that it is  part World of Tanks but I still like it
<br>
<br>.Unlike war thunder, It has brilliant matchmaking.
<br>
<br>I also think the ship designs are amazing</span>

Then it take a turn to the way that World Of Tanks functions with a MMO and a tech tree for your weapons of choice.  I have enjoyed the game for the period of time that I have been playing it. So far I have only hit Teck 6 out of 15. During these 6 levels I have become addicted to the game as a whole and have not put it down for a extended amount of time I have enjoyed the PvP battles in space, and the PVE missions that they have added into game to make it so you can fight alongside other players in a mission setting.
<br>The thing that made the game nice as you progressed into the higher levels you can modified your ships more and more to fit your play style. The amount of customization that is available in the game is very extensive. The fire team PVE missions that they have incorporated are fun to play through but a generic and have little to no story to the missions so that they become dry and boring.
<br>The PVP aspects of the nice with ho large, open, and they types of settings that they are placed in. There is a large range of game modes from most FPS games while this one is a third person flying game. The team sizes fell small for big the maps are with my average  game consisting of only 10 people the match can feel barren. The amount of time for me to find a match has averaged around 2-3 minutes which has felt overly extensive at times but for some reason it is a relaxing change of pace for once.
<br>The last other aspect of the game that made a big impression on me is that it actually has a added PVE mode that if a free roam where you can explore the galaxy that the game takes place in. With each governing faction having there own section of the galaxy that the control but as far as i have see there is no story of substance going on in the free to roam or the other PVE game mode.
<br>Over all the game is very well made and fun to play and a good experience in general. As with all things there is always room for improvement and this game is no exception but i would recommend this game to any one that has enjoyed World of Tanks and likes flying games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=5198137">Expand</a></span>

That means you need to unlock a lot of stuff and yes, it takes a lot of time. But it&apos;s fun to play, easy to learn, it&apos;s free and not pay-to-win as some often say. Would I play a year 2013 Star Conflict with just new tiers and weapons added? No, obviosly. A good game needs a shake to keep it alive and Targem manage to add some extraordinary stuff. 9/10, just because of some forgotten weapons and modules in the game that are underused and need a rebalance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-conflict/user-reviews?user_review_id=7224904">Expand</a></span>
