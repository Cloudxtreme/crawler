What I&apos;m truly lacking is a custom game you would expect in a god game like this. But there are none since the actual game elements are not developed enough to allow for this.

The controls seem to be a very, very lazy case of just slapping a control scheme obviously designed for an XBOX 360 gamepad onto a mouse--to the point that they are almost game breaking.  There are no options to change any graphic settings other than screen resolution.  And on top of this, the &quot;activate once&quot; DRM that Ubisoft promised seems to be (from what I can tell) an &quot;activate every time you play&quot; scheme, so you cannot play the game without an internet connection.  This wouldn&apos;t be such a problem, but Ubisoft specifically advertised the game as being &quot;activate once&quot; so I am not sure why they changed things.<br><br>Which is a shame as there&apos;s a very good game hidden in here, if only the interface could bring it out.  So if you are at all interested in this game I think you should wait to buy it for a few months.  If Ubisoft releases a patch fixing these issues, give it a go, as from what I have played of the game so far if all of these issues are fixed I&apos;d easily rate it a 7 or an 8 (especially considering the low price tag).  However, if they don&apos;t, then it&apos;s definitely not worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724544">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft have pulled a &apos;Spore&apos; with From Dust. Trailers and Interviews hinted at a powerfully beautiful return to the God game. Instead what we have is a tepid puzzle game that suffers from horrible camera, controls and lack of any reason to continue whatsoever. Altering the landscape turns out to be a haphazard affair, with the game ignoring some attempts, shifting the camera and getting in your way at every turn. The concept was solid, but what happened? Only a publisher like Ubisoft could mess something up so horribly. Jump cuts to pre-rendered cutscenes and forced camera pans jar you about, while the music cuts suddenly during transition.<br><br>Frustration sets in when the controls fail, Villagers are willfully stupid, and an invisible puddle of water somewhere impedes the construction of another village. Could we not move the village to a safer spot? No. This is where the game has railroaded you. The only winning option is not to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724157">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft has continued on their quest to show the world how little they care about PC gamers and From Dust is one of their worst showings yet. From Dust lacks any sort of graphics customization, only giving you the option of changing your resolution. Another huge flaw is the lack of mouse sensitivity option, causing you to have to manually go into your mouse settings and change your sensitivity just to be able to play the game (and of course you also have to change it back when you finish). The worst part about being a direct console port is that From Dust is locked at a maximum of 30 FPS for seemingly no reason at all. Once you get past how bad of a port it is, the game introduces you to a wide range of various bugs/crashing issues which should&apos;ve been fixed while Ubisoft was delaying the PC version of the game. Not satisfied with a buggy console port, Ubisoft has also tacked on their lovely DRM/social network features, requiring a constant internet connection in order to play your single-player game. The only plus I can think of is that the game is reasonably priced ($15) though I highly suggest to not buy it, the developers have already been paid and giving Ubisoft your money only influences them to continue abusing PC gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724298">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been troubleshooting for over 8 hours, and no luck. There is a lack of Ubisoft technical support, and a bunch of people are having the same problems. I&apos;m sick of this company, ruining the one game I was excited for.</span>

Moving terrain around for the sake of moving terrain around shouldn&apos;t be the entire game if it doesn&apos;t add some feasibly entertaining game-play.</span>

There is no depth to this game, like others have said there is no replay value.  I wouldn&apos;t even call this an RTS or even strategy related there is very very little game play to work with and well since there isn&apos;t a story that and the graphics are pretty much it. Oh I guess there is a story but some idiot decided to do it in gibberish and translate to English subtitles to save time which is really pathetic.
<br>The graphics that people say are so good much never have played hl2-crysis or any other major game title in the last 5 years.  The physics engine isn&apos;t that spectacular and there is absolutely nothing new in my opinion.  ALSO, you have to worry about Ubisoft&apos;s anti pirating software which is a paint in the butt in it self,  I really wish companies would stop trying to copy valve by hindering every user in any action they take.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521523">Expand</a></span>

Their pc ports are utterly worthless (that includes prince of persia). This game had so much potential and ubisoft had to ruin it. What a shame. Here&apos;s some reasons why this game failed: it requires you to make an account just to play this game. There are no changeable graphics settings except the resolution (and it seems there is a 30fps cap, and the graphics look absolutely terrible even though my computer is capable). Worst controls I have experienced in a video game and you cannot fix it no matter how much you fiddle with the sensitivity and etc. Camera control is sudden, jerky, awkward, and requires much effort. Ubisoft is borderline criminal. I gave this a 4 because I loved the concept of this game, nothing more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2070015">Expand</a></span>

All levels for the first 90% of the game could be solved by a lobotomized monkey, but then the game throws you a curveball level that has more a twitch minigame than a puzzle. Honestly, I would recommend trying before buying.</span>

Great game... mouse pointer very sluggish and inaccurate, but liveable.. THE MAIN and SEVERE POINT IS... level 7 &quot;High Tides&quot; is broken on the PC version... you can not finish it in 1 out of 100 attempts and if you do it was by pure chance. The XBOX version will show you the difference between it and the PC version, essentially there is a submerged land bridge that becomes dry and passable on the XBOX, but never becomes dry or &quot;walk-able&quot; in the PC version. This makes the game impossible to finish, even if you do pass to the island, the water-flood problem prohibits you from completing the final stage of this level. Other than that, it is a brilliant game... just that you can not finish it :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2073062">Expand</a></span>

I watched some youtube videos of xbox users doing it and it looks like a far easier level than what we get on the PC. I wonder if Ubisoft has tested this on the PC at all, it certainly does not look like it. Take tip, stay clear, it is a nice small game but its just not worth when you can only get half way through this short game anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115984">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s pretty enough and the campaign will have you scratching your head until you&apos;ve mastered the breath abilities.  Second time around there&apos;s little challenge but sculpting the stages into utopias for the tribe is fun.
<br>
<br>And that brings me to the games biggest problem.  The tribe.  Their path-finding and AI is awful.  Particularly in the challenge maps.  I&apos;ll see men stuck on the one spike in a flat landscape;  stop just before they reach a goal and be flummoxed by a tiny puddle.  Most annoyingly they will always try and take the shortest straight line which leads to lots of running back and forth as a passable path presents itself around an obstacle and then subsides causing them men to take the shortest path again and run slap into the obstacle.  Fix the path and repeat.
<br>
<br>Adding way-points or the ability tell tribesmen to move to a spot would have fixed this but as it stands it seems unnecessarily broken.  Not game breaking but irritating (and a lot more irritating than mediocre and un-skippable cinematics) </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=3126230">Expand</a></span>

If I buy a singleplayer game, I really see NO REASON, why I am forced to stay logged in all the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1740448">Expand</a></span>

Water not only flows realistically, but it seems to accurately fill up depressions, erode earth, deposit silt, and everything else it does in real life.  Personally, I could play with this simulation in sandbox mode for hours.<br><br>Which is a good thing, because the biggest negative with this game is that there&apos;s very little to it OTHER than playing with the physics.  The last few levels ramp up the difficulty to the point where I had to really try to save those idiot villagers, but overall, if you&apos;re just playing with the goal of completing the game, it can be done in a few sittings.<br><br>As I played through the campaign, I was mollified by many &quot;challenge map unlocked&quot; messages, which made me less anxious about the alarmingly fast rate at which I seemed to be completing the campaign.  However, I was severely disappointed when, after finishing the campaign and trying out some of the challenge maps, I discovered that these maps are tiny, with limited terraforming abilities, and can generally be finished in under a minute or two.<br><br>The real shame here is that they must have put an enormous amount of work into the technical foundations for this game, and it shows, but they really dropped the ball on things like interface (there&apos;s very little zoom range for the camera, for instance) and total amount of content (Just as the game seems like it&apos;s getting out of the &quot;tutorial&quot; stages, it&apos;s over).  Given the superb game engine and beautiful visuals, it&apos;s too bad they didn&apos;t put in the relatively minor effort to polish the much easier (but just as important) aspects of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1789186">Expand</a></span>

In the later levels with lava you&apos;re going to be dealing issues that you can&apos;t really fix, you&apos;re just working around problems, which isn&apos;t always fun.   For a game w/ sandbox elements this can be frustrating - often I just want the game to leave me alone and let me do what I want.  I got to one of the later levels and just got tired of dealing with lava on several successive levels and quit playing because of that.  The game started feeling more like a chore than fun for me.
<br>
<br>Pathfinding: The little people seem to have problems with path finding - or at least I can&apos;t figure out why they have so much trouble walking from point A to point B. They have quite a bit of trouble with changes in slope and slight changes in elevation that are hard to see. In all - for a game that keeps asking you to do things and get your people from point A to point B - this is frustrating when you can&apos;t tell what their problem is.
<br>
<br>Part of the issue with this game is probably my expectation - it seemed like it could be this cool little eco-simulator where I could build worlds, but it turns into a jump-through-hoops puzzle type game too often. That&apos;s not to say there&apos;s not fun - there is fun - but a true sandbox mode with various maps would&apos;ve been nice - but like other reviews have said - for some reason you can&apos;t just start a map and build like Sim City. There&apos;s a cool core idea though - it&apos;s just frustrating that it doesn&apos;t go where as a player you expect it to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=3967324">Expand</a></span>

From the breathtaking real-world physics to the simple yet intuitive idea that nature guides the world you shift, this game is a great casual title for almost any person looking for something beyond the simple games like Peggle.  You star in the game as nature, err a god who shapes the natural world around a group of natives, and your overall goal is to help the natives spread across the land; it is a simple yet charming story.  You can move, create and destroy land, water, and more, and can harness other abilities as well. You can also use some of the plants in the environment to aid you, like water-expelling flowers or fire trees; however, these can also work against you.  The mechanics of this game require often a beautiful mastery of balance.  Contrary to what some others seem to think, the controls are simple enough - usually just click and drag, but occasionally one can use special powers granted by totems to perform special powers; many of the challenges are easy enough with this set-up.  The camera does have a few issues, some of which are programmed a certain way and require getting use to; for example, the reticle that one uses is always to be centered on the screen, so even the slightest movement will cause the player&apos;s map view to shift; however, there are a few, though sparse, issues where the camera is just finicky.  The most impressive part of this game is the visuals, notably the liquid physics; water, lava, and even sand flow and interact with the environment so well and seamlessly.  The plants blow in the wind and burn within a fire, and the villagers have their own unique look (although their models are limited).  Really my only major qualm with this game is that the story mode itself is short; it took me about 5-6 hours to complete.  After that, there are many challenge maps to complete, but many of these are quick to beat.  Overall, I really loved the game, I just wish there were more maps and a longer story mode to it.  Also, a full- fledged sandbox mode that can be shared with other players would be nice too.
<br>
<br>To address the DRM, I agree with many of the people, but for me dealing with it and uPlay (Ubisoft&apos;s PC game platform) is not a big deal; I just don&apos;t like or understand why I have to launch another platform aside from Steam to play From Dust.  All that is really required is to set up a uPlay account and you&apos;re good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544069">Expand</a></span>

Manipulating the environment is easy and fun and the game can at times be extremely relaxing. There are some cool &quot;power-ups&quot;  in the game and there is quite a lot of maps. The game is also really pleasant to look at. The game do however have some problems. The developers have somehow managed to screw up the mouse control and as result controlling the game feels really weird. There is also a fps-cap on 30 fps which is a bit annoying. Gameplay-wise the biggest problem are your loyal minions. The AI is terrible and the pathfinding doesnt really work as well as it should. Which gets really annoying when time and manpower is crucial. Combine this with ridiculous fast-spreading fire, timed tides and annoying unforgivable maps and you are in for a nasty treat if rage. None of these faults are really gamebreaking but they do take the game from an above-average game to a below-average game. I would still recommend the game if you are into the genre and can get it for a cheap price since the game is by no means terrible. Just know that it is a little bit rough around the edges.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2931370">Expand</a></span>

<br>From Dust was quite an interesting game for me.
<br>
<br>I will say this. The gameplay itself is pretty fun. However each and every level is very easy except maybe for the last level before the final level.
<br>
<br>The physics for water etc were very nicely done. I definitely enjoyed the visuals from things like tsunamis and the way they interacted with the world itself.
<br>
<br>The big issue though is the game was sooooo very short and easy. There was rarely ever an actual challenge in the game. There was some times where I was required to think. But in a very short amount of time, I was able to figure out just how to overcome each level.
<br>
<br>The AI was for the most part ok, but there were some times where I would say they were pretty stupid and got themselves killed or I would have to be extra generous and help them even more, just to overcome a little &quot;obstacle&quot;.
<br>
<br>There were also some times where the tiniest amount of water would prevent me from getting them to build a village, which again was annoying since it&apos;s rather hard to find such a small drop of water.
<br>
<br>Moving about the terrain was for the most part good to me. But there were some times where I found it a little annoying. Probably my biggest issue was I could very rarely ever have the camera sit &quot;still&quot; I would always move forwards or backwards even if just slightly. So I had to constantly keep changing my direction just so I can zoom in and focus on an area that needed my attention.
<br>
<br>I was disappointed in the &quot;Story&quot;. I wouldn&apos;t call it a story at all.
<br>Every level played the same cutscene. I thought it was going to give us something interesting each level. But to my disappointment, it was the same thing. Over and over again.
<br>
<br>I think the game had a ton of potential to be great. But with the short gameplay, the lack of more powers/abilities to challenge you makes this game kind of a let down. There is very little content in the game.
<br>
<br>I did enjoy the game, but it&apos;s not something I would play again due to there not being any real re playability in it..
<br>
<br>For the price I paid, I suppose it was a fair-ish price.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you&apos;re looking for a fun and short &quot;godish&quot; game to play for a few hours to pass some time, I would say look into giving this game a shot. Just don&apos;t expect too much from it. The lack of more content and short gameplay is its biggest fall.

<br>Gameplay  6/10

It&apos;s a cool idea to be a kind of all powerful elemental god of an ancient tribe, especially for 15 bucks, but unfortunately it seems its just not that fun. While playing though this I just felt like i didn&apos;t have all that much to do. Every level seemed to play like a tutorial where you were learning some cool ability but never getting a level where you have the power to use them as you would want to or the choice on when to use it. I guess i have been pretty hard on this game and maybe i was expecting something else but its not all bad it looks nice and the control was good enough (mouse scroll could get a bit strange) but its ok for a dumbed down version of lemmings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729081">Expand</a></span>

I &apos;would&apos; recommend you purchase this if it wasn&apos;t for several things. This game suffers mainly because of the ubisoft actions. It&apos;s unfortunate really, because this seems like a potentially brilliant game. I love god-games (like black and white etc) and the trailers for this are amazing.<br><br>But it really seems as if Ubisoft have done no checking of bugs or testing what so ever. The game was also delayed a month, for &apos;polishing&apos; of the game, which makes the presence of all these bugs and glitches even more confusing. This seems like a direct and highly unmodified port of the 360 version.<br><br>The DRM is a major concern. Many people bought this because they were told it needed a one-time activation, but found this to be untrue. The DRM and ubisoft launcher also cause problems, preventing a lot of people from playing this game. The game crashes for a lot of people after the opening ubisoft logo. There is no guarantee that if you purchase this game that you will be able to play it.<br><br>I had preordered the game and so didn&apos;t know about any of these issues until I got it, but I was one of the lucky few who managed to get a working version. There are quite a few bugs though, which should have been found in the month this was delayed. Villagers are sometimes unable to find sensible paths or unable to change their path after deciding to do it. Sometimes entire villages of people stop moving. Villages are sometimes unable to be rebuilt and you cannot cancel the rebuilding of a village. The &apos;high tides&apos; mission is bugged for many people, becoming very hard and almost unwinnable.<br><br>The controls are very awkward. Moving the mouse from the centre of the screen moves the camera, making it very hard to pick up and place dirt. This can be slightly changed in the options to givce you a bigger space of movement but it&apos;s still annoying. And unless the mouse is in the centre of the screen, the camera wants to pan to it. Zooming out is difficult, and infact generally only changes the angle of the camera. It also occasionally gets stuck at one angle.<br><br>There are also other bugs popping up all the time. I would love to give this a higher score, but I don&apos;t want anyone to buy a game they cannot play. So really, do not buy until this has been patched.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1727362">Expand</a></span>

Patches could help, but as it is I&apos;m giving it a six out of ten, and 2 of those points are because I like god games.  I think the reviewers that gave this a 90% should be ashamed of themselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724650">Expand</a></span>

The problem is that there is not too much depth to the game, it&apos;s a very pretty physics puzzle, the interface is a little annoying but gets the job done. I&apos;m happy with my purchase.</span>

The game, thanks to the DRM, requires you to have the Ubisoft launcher. In order to launch the game, you need to make an account and tie your serial key to your account. For those buying the game through Steam or some other digital distributor, you&apos;ll need to make a new account on Ubisoft&apos;s end to even play the game. For many, this Ubisoft launcher is unstable and causes more problems than it should, which if encountered, won&apos;t let you run the game at all.<br><br>Once you load the game, you&apos;ll be greeted by a game with limited graphics options, with the only choice being to change resolutions. And once you start a new game and get into gameplay, the obvious lack of Anti Aliasing and the frame limited forcing the game to run at 30fps is noticeable, and hinders on the game graphically. Actual gameplay gets to be more disappointing, with mouse scrolling causing the cursor to spaz out, moving the camera all over the place and with mediocre camera controls overall. Luckily, the former of those two is able to be fixed, with the developers including an option to turn off mouse scrolling.<br><br>Overall, this is a great idea spawned from the great mind of Eric Chahi, but hindered by Ubisoft&apos;s troublesome DRM and the obvious lack of care put into this PC port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724534">Expand</a></span>

(check every map what magics are assigned to keys 1-4, it&apos;s not same!)<br>* Keyboard hints cannot be disabled (Ubisoft, I&apos;m retarded, I still don&apos;t know what to press on that object)<br>* You can&apos;t control your tribe people<br>* You can&apos;t control path where the people should go to totem (no waypoints)<br>* When one tribe member stuck somewhere and is not able to get to new totem, you are doomed unless you kill him somehow (you can&apos;t choose different tribe member and the game will not do that)<br>* Kites move affected by wind but tall palm trees not, why??<br>* When you pray to little obelisk or &quot;ending&quot; obelisk, you must always press Spacebar for confirmation, why?? I guess because of cut scenes. For totems and big obelisks it&apos;s not needed (there are no cut scenes)<br>* Repetitive and slow cut scenes that gets boring soon, so you stop listen to simple story (low resolution textures are very visible in cut scenes)<br>* No hotkey to cancel cut scenes like in Populous 2<br>* Sometimes it&apos;s difficult to take sand when a bit of water is onto it, because water is almost invisible (it may be frustrating)<br>* It&apos;s only you and scripted nature, so you may feel alone (not much suprises, no enemy)... implementation of multiplayer idea could be difficult since it&apos;s you and nature only<br>* Exploding and fire trees (for exploding and fire trees I would prefer instant magics, but consoles don&apos;t have more buttons, so don&apos;t expect it from Ubisoft)<br>* Exploding trees don&apos;t work when you put them to lava, you must put lava onto it<br>* Trees sometimes don&apos;t grow on ground<br>* When you challenge fire it&apos;s quite difficult to get rid of it (fire is very fast and needs a lot of water)<br>* Badly implemented map edges which may ruin gameplay in some cases, affect basic elements and give you permanent feeling that everything is in small square (even that you see that the map continues to fog)<br>* Tsunami doesn&apos;t look so good (it&apos;s like a flat wall)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1725288">Expand</a></span>

The mouse controls are just broken and frustrating, the game runs between 15 and 30fps for seemingly no reason and there are no graphic options to speak of except for the option to change the resolution. Awful controls and performance plus a complete lack of polish show the lack of effort Ubi Soft put into this port, something they are getting a reputation for, I would have derived more enjoyment and less disappointment from just lighting the $15 this pile cost me on fire.<br><br>Do not buy unless Ubi fixes it, which they won&apos;t, as usual.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724663">Expand</a></span>

Seemed a great idea but between the awful Uplay imposed on us by Ubisoft, combined with a very bad interface and hazardous controls, it&apos;s hardly worth a try as long as the price has not been divided by 4. A good idea and a bad realization.</span>

Early development videos showed promised something truly unique, and while there is a great concept behind the game, it was executed terribly. Ubisoft spit in PC gamers&apos; faces with their ludicrous DRM, and absolutely horrible console porting. A little extra effort on the developers part would have resulted in an excellent game.</span>

It does however have no story, and if you took out the mind searingly boring and unskippable cutscenes the game is only an hour or 2 long. Top that with ubisoft&apos;s customary crippling DRM and this game is just a big stinking pile.</span>

The Ubisoft launcher really annoyed me, making me have to create an account for some thing I&apos;ve never heard of nor will ever use again. Getting to the next level seemed more frustrating and tiresome than fun. I pre-ordered this on Steam and was really looking forward to it, but was ultimately disappointed. It&apos;s an okay game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724727">Expand</a></span>

Instead when I loaded up the game it demanded I log into disruptive DRM, I thought &apos;fine ubisoft are **** so this is to be expected&apos; and got on with the game. This is where I was the most disappointed, I played only for thirty minutes but in that time the game managed to completely fall apart. The graphics, gameplay, even music are all horribly ported.

Ubisoft have insulted me as a gamer, as customer, and as an honest man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1726850">Expand</a></span>

It does not have a massive amount of replay value once you finish the story missions(out of which maybe five are really interesting) and challenges, since playing around with fluids gets old fairly fast due to the lack of mechanics other than the terrain stuff to keep you entertained. Additionally the controls are awful, especially the TINY scrolling box(meaning the camera moves with the cursor almost all the time) and the poor pathfinding AI that gets stuck on the tiniest edge will drive you up the wall.<br><br>Overall the game was moderately entertaining but ultimately very shallow and the DRM absolutely ruined my overall experience of it. I have to go through TWO launchers to play it, geez.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1726211">Expand</a></span>

The drm and game launcher whilst not truly draconian like some does reduce the enjoyment of the game as you have to wait so long for the game to start up.

The premise is promising: using your God-like powers, alter and terraform the landscape of an ever-changing island to solve logistical problems for a nomadic, faceless tribe. However, the final product proves not only tedious to play, but hypercritical of the genre it claims to be: a railroad-like story which forces you to use your powers at certain times and intervals; a notoriously, somewhat-infamously stupid AI who, although yearn to live in an island paradise, for some reason cannot seem to grasp walking through a puddle of water to another island; and a constant shift in gameplay balance which, therefore, refuses you to control the game effectively. Moreover, Ubisoft&apos;s tyrannical, dictatorial DRM proves overtly annoying, forcing you to sign up to Uplay (what the?) to play - a Steam-like digital device, without the extra features, and with more of the propaganda Ubisoft enjoys emitting. That is, in conclusion, if you can actually get the game to run at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115471">Expand</a></span>

I was fascinated with it! I could deal with the horrible story line, so I thought I would buy the game as soon as I could. So I went out, got a pre-paid visa card, and bought the game (I don&apos;t buy many games at all) and I was really excited. The DRM popped up, I didn&apos;t know what those were at the time, but I know that they are really frustrating seeing as I had to download random crap I never heard of nor did I think that random crap was necessary to the game since I had installed that. So I figured, wow, this is inconvenient, but I can deal with this I guess. I didn&apos;t know at the time that it meant I had to suffer memory leaks and such from my laptop, my ACER LAPTOP! So it can&apos;t run games all that well at all, but now I have to suffer with this DRM taking up power I will need to run the damn game! Then I learned that they had no graphics options. So I am stuck with a game that cut my frames anyway with a cap, but added the insult to any gamer that doesn&apos;t have and can&apos;t afford a beast of a PC through not having any graphical options whatsoever! So I was able to finally run the game, after about 4 or 5 hours of dealing with issues from installation, the DRM, and the game launching. But, I found out that my laptop, which easily met the minimum hardware requirements, got all of 4 frames a second on the game. FOUR! When it is capped at a barley decent frame rate of 30, I am able only to view still frames of the first level which was marred by motion blur and crap.<br><br>Along with bad frame rate, I got horrible game lag as well! It took me at least 15 to 20 minutes to get through the birth of the breath cutscene which, if memory serves, should take all of 3 minutes maximum! My laptop isn&apos;t the best, but it isn&apos;t that crap. From the lets play of From Dust I saw on youtube I recommend getting it on Xbox360, it looks great and plays well on there, if you have anything less than a stellar PC or a really expensive gaming laptop, don&apos;t bother with this, you won&apos;t be able to run it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=2159230">Expand</a></span>

I find myself most intrigued by the physics, they are really good for such a small game. Since this is made by Ubisoft, I almost feel this is an R&amp;D title that went retail. &quot;Anno 2070&quot; looks to have the exact same engine, but is like Sim City.</span>

However, it looks like a classic &quot;god&quot; game and one of the challenge texts even names Molineux as an inspiration. Even the Metacritic summary calls it a god game. In reality, this game has little in common with a Populous or Magic Carpet where you always have to use some kind of strategy. From Dust is a PUZZLE in an unusually pretty package. Once you have solved the puzzle, you will always win this scenario by the exact same course of action. There is no AI and no challenge beyond that. There is no replay value. I can even understand that the console versions are rated quite favourably because there it does not have to stand up to the comparison against the GAMEPLAY of a Popolous 2.<br>Unlike others I did not have a problem with the camera or controls. They were awkward at times but never a game-stopper. The DRM - well, the online activation worked fine, I started the game once played it all the way through (no crashes!), played all but one of the &quot;challenges&quot;, then uninstalled it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1726193">Expand</a></span>

Only on the verge of a market collapse could a concept so promising be mangled so horribly. Now, I&apos;m not here reviewing the Xbox version, I wish I were, but this is all about the PC port. The camera is very sensitive, as is the mouse. The mouse controls your movement as well as the camera&apos;s movement. Seeing a problem yet? The refresh rate is fixed, making you wonder why it&apos;s in the options menu at all. When a disaster such as a volcanic eruption occurs, the screen cuts awkwardly back and forth between the game and a terribly angled shot of the disaster, or in some cases a flat field of color (that&apos;s when the camera view is smashed up into the disaster, I assume.) Even movement of the mouse is choppy, which is a massive disadvantage in a game calling for precise placement of elements and abilities. As I see, some reviewers are calling these &quot;isolated incidents.&quot; Consider the positive-negative review ratio, both from users and reputable gaming sites, and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll disagree. All in all, this clever, original game would be a keeper if they finished porting it and began work on DLC, but for the time being it&apos;s just another crushing mountain of defied expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1725500">Expand</a></span>

Unlike what many others are saying, you CAN control the mouse sensitivity in game, it&apos;s just under the wrong options menu. The biggest letdowns are that the developers didn&apos;t add graphics controls and you&apos;re stuck at 30fps, no AA, so while everything looks like it could and should be beautiful, it&apos;s simply not by today&apos;s standards. It just looks... alright. Furthermore, Ubisoft felt it necessary to bludgeon this simple $15 game with their DRM bat using their tried and tested and failed methods of antipiracy including requiring an internet connection to play at all times, despite being only single player.<br><br>In the end, it comes down to the simple question of whether you think a poor port is enough to hold back an otherwise great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/from-dust/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724529">Expand</a></span>
