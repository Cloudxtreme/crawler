Not the worse FPS I&apos;ve ever played, but not good. Some of the combat is not bad, but that&apos;s all it seems to be - one battle after another. Too bad, it looked like it might be good.</span>

The interface and HUD were a chore at best and a serious bother at worst, the plot line was fairly generic. This was supposed to be the &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to Deus Ex, but I found it to be just as disappointing as Deus Ex 2.</span>

<br>
<br>The setting is a near future and really reminded me of Deus Ex (from what I&apos;ve heard, it was initially planned to be a sequel to Deus Ex, but later turned into a standalone title). You play as military commander who gets injured in battle and implanted with combat augmentations, which become available for use over time.
<br>
<br>This is what I really enjoyed about the gameplay. It&apos;s not just your bog standard corridor shooter relying on twitch reflexes. It has a bit of a strategic edge, as you acquire a number of interesting augmentations throughout the game, such as the ability to slow time, ballistic shielding (temporary protection from bullets), cloak, enhanced vision, and so on. In addition to augmentations, you also find some cool gadgets to use in battle too, such as spider bots to act as your little pets and aid you in combat, deployable force field to act as cover, a large variety of grenades (most of the ones from Deus Ex), and even a nanoboost, which is like your emergency revive that you can choose to use if you die in battle.
<br>
<br>The game seems to have only one difficulty mode (I didn&apos;t see how to change it), but overall it&apos;s paced really well. I didn&apos;t come across any difficulty spikes and the game never throws anything unfair towards you. In some levels it&apos;s just you infiltrating some facility, in others the combat takes on a large scale assault and you have many of your squadmates with you and witness battles between large groups of soldiers. It&apos;s all really well done, even if graphically the game aged a fair bit.
<br>
<br>I only have one big gripe. The game crashes from time to time for no reason. It only happened about 5-6 times for me during my playthrough, but because you aren&apos;t able to save anytime you like, at times you could lose chunks of progress. Saving can only be done in special save rooms and also at the end of each level.
<br>
<br>Overall it was a fun game. Aside from the crashes, I thought it was well done and would certainly recommend it if you like FPS games with a story and a bit of a tactical edge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-snowblind/user-reviews?user_review_id=5633652">Expand</a></span>
