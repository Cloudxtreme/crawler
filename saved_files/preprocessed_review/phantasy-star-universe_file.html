First the voices: What were they thinking here? It seems like they tried to use good actors, but their voices kept cracking during production. Then theres the graphics. I played and owned the NGC version of PSO, and I have a had time distinguishing any differences; the poor textures, fuzz monsters, stiff animations, and muy mucho clipping really seemed to hearken back to the Dreamcast days. But not in a good way. In a bad way. The plot, like the graphics, is bland and flavorless as well. I mean seriously, it&apos;s 85% cliche. And the sounds are pretty bad too, as they often cut out, are repetitive, or low grade. This game wants to be good, but whenever it tries to say, get an A+, it spends all night studying the wrong material, doesn&apos;t get any sleep, falls on it&apos;s head in the morning, vomits up its breakfast, poops its pants, misses it&apos;s bus, and blames it all on the family puppy, which it promptly kicks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/phantasy-star-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=395671">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> By far one of the best games and mmo&apos;s to hit the market. Though with a few issues with content release, there is enough currently available plus much room for expansion. The game is streamline and cleaned up from it&apos;s predecessor Phantasy Star Online. Anyone who enjoy PSO or wants to pick up a quicker paced style of MMO, this is your chance.</span>

Does PSU have grandiose worlds for you to spend days exploring and still never see it all? No way. Does PSU have an engrossing backstory or offer rich roleplaying oppourtunities? Still nope. Almost everything that makes an MMO good is missing from PSU. So what DOES it have? The same thing PSO had. An immersive, entertaining, flexible combat system thats almost as fun to watch as it is to use and which has no learning curve whatsoever. You can focus entirely on getting the most out of every hit one moment and lazily coast along, still fufilling your job in a party but holding a conversation or two at the same time the next moment. The game should not be looked at as an MMO, for by MMO standards its terrible, but as a fun, relaxing, and attractive background activity to play with a few friends while socializing it excels, just as it&apos;s predeccesor did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/phantasy-star-universe/user-reviews?user_review_id=61060">Expand</a></span>
