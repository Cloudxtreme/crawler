Masterful multiplayer, perfect for the 4 of us friends to enjoy together, fantastic maps/weapons/vehicles, and the best graphics to date in gaming. If I could play it all day long with friends, I probably would. But I can&apos;t. Punkbuster took me out of BF3 all this week after a known security flaw was finally abused. The awful Origin web-based Steam-wannabe launching platform boots me from whatever server I&apos;m in about once per hour. The game freezes and crashes about once per two hours, separate from Origin. The amount of deaths sustained in any 4 hour marathon play session from bugs, glitches, and most notably from hackers requires constant effort to find an enjoyable server. Nothing from EA, Dice, or punkbuster has removed the massive amount of cheating on PC play. Just look at the leaderboards Origin gives you. None are legit.<br><br>This game was going to be absolutely huge upon release. Everyone knew that. EA was going to make a fortune on this game no matter what, and their preference to take extra net income over spending a few million bucks to make this game work is very obvious. Steam anti cheat has worked properly for many years, as has their delivery system and platform. EA elected not to use that system this time around, obviously to make even more money. The cash grab that is Origin is fine, if it works properly!!! It doesn&apos;t. At all. When the gaming community hands you a billion dollars of our money, we shouldn&apos;t have to deal with such issues. We should all be talking about balancing issues, new items, new maps, how to further improve such a great release, but the only thing the BF3 forum produces is complaints of stability, complaints about hacking, complaints about bugs, etc. We are far beyond the initial release kinks that every massive selling game will endure. EA&apos;s traditional business model of spamming out a game with a higher number behind the title to make more money on the franchise continues, and I won&apos;t be suckered into buying another unless I read how stable and flawless the game is 3-6 months after release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2117587">Expand</a></span>

I was a big fan of the battlefield series. starting from battlefield 1942. It is clear EA has a tight grip on DICE. A month after release I might had given this a 8/10. Fanboyism makes blind. But after a while I started realizing they have made the franchise utter sh*t by simplifying the game they obviously attracted a new user base. and by that I mean a bunch of casual COD kiddies. This doesn&apos;t Make anything better. I DICE even still had some of it&apos;s PC fanbase after battlefield: Bad Company. they have certainly lost it now. Also with EA&apos;s glorious DLC plan they have certainly stept in COD&apos;s footsteps. $15 for a couple of maps. With BC2 vietnam DLC they actually gave us a whole new experience. But the (upcomming) DLC&apos;s from BF3 are just ridiculous... It could have been in the original game. But no the allmighty EA had decided otherwise. DICE has literally sold their soul to EA. Lastly the Premium. as if the franchise hadn&apos;t copied enough of COD allready, EA wanted their own &quot;Elite&quot; service. It contains all the DLC that&apos;s going to be available, Ok that&apos;s pretty nice. But then they also have queue jumping. premiums get priority in queues over non premiums. So many knives in our backs, I can&apos;t keep track of it. I&apos;ve literally waited a half hour in a queue to get on my favorite server because I got pushed back the whole time by premiums. This is just so mean to everybody who bought the game. And wait there is more! double xp weeks!! (have I said casual allready?) . everything that Battlefield once was, is now lost. the franchise might have 2 more succesfull titles with their new fanbase. But then it&apos;s over. EA will throw DICE in the garbage bin, just like they did with Pandemic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509773">Expand</a></span>

I wish also that they would also use a queueing system to join servers and fix squad joining/creating since it seems more complex than helicopter controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1820062">Expand</a></span>

Besides the general &quot;There are guns, tanks, planes, cars, helicopters, epic scale maps and you shoot people.&quot; It doesn&apos;t. I have played many hours on both Battlefield 2 and 2142, and Battlefield 3 is anything but a sequel. I was severely disappointed when Battlefield 3&apos;s Operation Metro beta came out. It was a small map, infantry only and people would run and gun constantly. Not only did it seem nothing like Battlefield 2, It looked as if COD had rubbed off all over my favorite multiplayer series and ruined it. Then I played it.<br><br>Elements of COD are in plain sight, it is obviously not Battlefield 2, but it is undoubtedly the best shooter of the year. The tactical gameplay is preserved from Battlefield 2 and 2142. Even though running and gunning is a viable tactic, you still must be cautious, and have your squad to back you up. Vehicular battles are no let-down either, tanks and APCs own the roads, with frequent engagements with enemy armor, presenting high priority targets for AT and aircraft.<br><br>The customization for weapons, vehicles and soldiers is unparalleled, want a x8 scope on your assault rifle? No problem, go ahead and put a tactical flashlight on your sniper rifle as well (Why would you do that though?). Specializations grant your soldiers improvements in things like sprinting and suppression fire.  For the first time, vehicles get specialized traits as well.<br><br>With the new Frostbite 2 engine, Battlefield 3 can look amazing, in addition to preforming amazingly. The graphics are insanely realistic, making combatants stop everything in the middle of a battle to watch in awe as large pieces of a building crash down to the ground. The environments so life-like you can imagine cars driving down the street and people going about their lives (before you and the other 63 players got there that is). The thing that makes Battlefield 3 stand out the most though, is that it takes the good from previous games (and rival games) and removes the bad. Examples of this would be destructible environments, weapons doing more damage, and limits to power on some vehicles (planes, for one, are not the armor hunting invincible juggernauts of BF2). Some people might argue about what was &quot;the bad&quot; and what was &quot;the good&quot;, but you cant please everyone, no matter how good of a game you make.<br><br>Having never played the single player campaign in either of the Bad Company games, I was extremely pleased with Battlefield 3 adding a campaign mode. After selecting the hardest mode I could, I set out across a story that was both interesting and thrilling. The AI was nothing special, but it was good enough to kill me many, many times. The campaign mode takes you through many infantry engagements, some stealthy, some out in an open field with fire raining down on all sides. You get to control a tank in one section, blasting away at infantry and leaving only burning piles of scrap behind when you encounter enemy armor (my favorite part). The one part I had a bit of a disappointment, was the air section. You take the gunner position of a plane, but do not get to fly. The entire level consisted of holding your cross-hairs over enemy planes, and deploying countermeasures. In all, the campaign was no Crisis, but it was enjoyable.<br><br><br>The one issue I have with Battlefield 3 is Origin. Origin the steam wannabe, and Origin with the shady EULA. Some people have lowered their score for Battlefield 3 considerably due to Origin, but, this is not a review for Origin, is it?. *cough*1/10*cough*.<br><br>With that, I give Battlefield 3 a next to perfect 9.8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1810304">Expand</a></span>

Watering the game down more.<br><br>I expected so much out of this game, but it ended up being a conglomeration of BF2, BC2, COD and MOH that didn&apos;t &quot;NAIL IT&quot; on anything except a great running graphics engine and the greatest number of promises not delivered in any game I have ever bought.<br><br>As for netcode, most modern games use a hybrid server/client hit detection model that works quite well.  There are even free to play games that have better net code than BF3, which is just appalling.  Previous BF games were bad because they were server side only - with clients only having the option to increase or lower interpolation.  With pure client-side netcode, you get seemingly random deaths, opponents that die extremely slowly, and all kinds of other annoying frustrations.<br><br>I&apos;ve waited for months for those patches to come, but I&apos;ve realized some of them never will.  They&apos;ll never update the net code to a better model.  They&apos;ll never increase the destruction to make certain maps like Bazaar and Metro more fun and less explosive spammy.  They&apos;ll never add in-game voice (another thing common in many F2P games from small companies) And they&apos;ll never address another greater issue with the heart of the game - the vehicles are lackluster in implementation and integration into the balance of the game.  They&apos;ll feel like an afterthought that was just thrown in haphazardly.  They made an infantry fighting game out of a large-scale war game.  And even that is poor because of the bad netcode.<br><br>Sure, some bug fixes have come along.. They fixed the bugs that were in the beta that they said were already fixed for the game launch.  Like the laggy servers, falling through the world on metro, gadgets flat out not working...<br><br>But it&apos;s really just been one huge let down.  I can&apos;t say I&apos;ll be buying BF4 or BC3 or anything.  I&apos;ve learned my lesson that PR likes to make false promises and do anything to drum up hype.  They flat out lie sometimes.  I just don&apos;t know what to expect when I buy a game from EA.  There&apos;s no assurance of quality.  They don&apos;t realize that many are already boycotting them.  I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m boycotting them, it&apos;s more like someone who has burned their hand on a hot stove being cautious about touching it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2147837">Expand</a></span>

For the first time in recent memory I was not upset by the fact that the single player campaign was really short. The intterogation scenes dont add much to the story or the game in fact the story has some pretty big plot holes that could have been solved with one line of dialogue but were ignored, thats ok though because the actual gameplay delivers. The game starts slow. Going through the basic motions of a generic shooter at first, but then once the game has given you time to get acquainted with the mechanics, i kicks into high gear. The best comparison to the kick is COD2. The adrenaline works in the same way. Except instead of pure run and gun, the game forces you to stop and think. You can go guns blazing, but that will only mean youll spend more time looking at load screens than actually playing. The story is cliched yes, but this doesnt matter because it sets up some incredible set pieces and gameplay. Mix that with the presentation and it makes for one amazing experience. The graphics are fantastic. Yes the character models are nice, as are the lighting effects and such, but what really puts it over the top are the minute details. The suppression feature along with the laser sight and the flashlight, really do change the way you play the game. Slowing it down and making you think. But thats not even the best part. During the plane mission you notice the scratches on the canopy of the plane. These arent cracks, and they arent sticking out like theyre pasted on after, they look natural, same with the dirt and stains on your characters goggles. I havent seen another company since crytek do this so masterfully. Then there is multiplayer, which is the real reason to buy this game. If yoou like a shooter online that requires skill to master and play this is it. Where as COD is populated by kids with no life who spend hours to get the highest prestige but still lack the skill to be competitive, BF3 requires skill, patience and intelligence. Where CODMW strayed from the golden path of the original 2 CODs, BF3 has come up to the plate to fulfill the craving for fun, tense and addictive gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1810739">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t listen to the bashers who give low scores. This game has BY FAR the best graphics, gameplay, sound and overall engine of any shooter ever released before. It would get a 10, I mean a real, full-fledged TEN ON TEN which means nothing short of revolutionary and PERFECT  at the same time, if not for the two small flaws I reported on at first. EPIC GREATNESS I say, this can will keep you coming back for 1,000 hours or more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806608">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer itself is absolutely amazing. Everything has been upgraded from BC2; map size/player count, graphics, destruction, all the good stuff.  The only thing I don&apos;t like about BF3 is its association with the battlelog, and Origin in general. The battlelog is a completely uneccessary facebook-like application the PC version is run from and I&apos;m hoping there will eventually be a way to bypass it entirely. *edited to add* Most of the multiplayer bugs I&apos;ve encountered *seem* to have been fixed; no server disconnects or unexplained score losses all weekend, so I&apos;ve returned my score to an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1809993">Expand</a></span>

Like many people, i was super super excited.  I played Battlfield 1942, Battlefield 2 (and expansions), Battlefield 1943, Battlefield Heroes, Battlefield Bad Company and Bad Company 2 and the Battlefield 3 Beta.  I&apos;ve had a lot of Battlefield experiences.  I put it into my xbox and downloaded the 163mb update and installed it to my hard drive to get the HD packages (all that took about 20 minutes).  After I got my code activated (something i&apos;m not happy about (they don&apos;t allow free multiplayer basically i could be wrong though)).  I jumped into a multiplayer game and the first thing I did was jump into a jet and it was fantastic! I got into a dogfight with another guy and got my first kill.  I really missed planes in battlefield.  Ok, back to what I was talking about, when i finally got on the ground I moved the controller around and noticed the gun movement and overall movement was much more fluid then the beta.  I found a couple people and killed them, the guns felt great and the hit markers worked better then in the beta.  I jumped into a tank and took out a couple people till I was disabled and eventually killed by a couple bad guys.  The graphics are excellent, the guns look great, you look and the sun and the sun glare is very realistic and there is glare off of pieces of the environment.  Now, the graphics are obviously not as good as PC but if you play this for PS3 or XBOX 360, you will not be disappointed.  I was very happy with the multiplayer and if you enjoy first person shooter multiplayer then this is a must have.  One of the best multiplayer experiences I have ever had.  Brings me back to the times of Battlefield 2  I have no played the singleplayer campaign yet so this is simply a review for Multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1807434">Expand</a></span>

Double the fun! The game details are amazing, like many have seen in the beta you can customize your weapon every bit and do I have to explain more about detail if we talk about nozzle flash suppressors? :-) Furthermore, I really like the fact that lights can finally be useful in combat by blinding people (same goes for lasers).

If you are looking for a game that you can play for a while without getting bored, BF3 is definitely your game to pick!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806719">Expand</a></span>

<br>But quite honestly what I feel like writing about is all the frustration I&apos;m left with after having finished the campaign... A game is not supposed to ship in such a state - you are not supposed to have a browser window open to find solutions to the game breaking bugs, you are no supposed to give up playing the multiplayer game because you can&apos;t play for more than a few minutes before it crashes..
<br>
<br>Dice have created a really beautiful game that serious gamers should play, but they should wait as it&apos;s certainly not finished yet - it&apos;s no secret PC gamers are getting the short end of the stick in this console era, but dear Dice and EA - I think most of us would much rather have waited for the finished game in December than be given an unfinished Beta in October..

<br>Anywhoo, when it works it looks and plays awesomely - so do pick it up, just do yourself a favor and wait until the first couple patches are out as it will save you a lot of frustration..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1831151">Expand</a></span>

About Origin, it not that EA wanted to make more money on their platform it was due to service agreements with steam, not allowing EA to release patches as soon as they release and make everything complicated, this was also the case for games like minecraft not on steam. if you guys are not playing the game coz of origin then you are truly missing out on a great title. origin is not part of the game, it was clearly not DICE&apos;s decision to make, plus if you were really annoyed by origin there is always tools to bypass it. The game is designed to entertaining for hours on online multi player,  if all you gona play is single player than dont buy it. The game doesnt deserve a 0 score because of origin or battlelog its not even part of the actual game. and battlelog i personally think its more of  a pro than a con.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806158">Expand</a></span>

The day BF3 was released I came on here and posted my user review as a 10. Here&apos;s the thing, after you play 20+ hours of BF3, it&apos;s simply a lie to yourself if you rate it a perfect 10. BF3 has many patches to go before it (hopefully) approaches perfection. I joined the BF series with BF2, a **** masterpiece. I&apos;m still a huge BF3 fan and will still play because even with its faults, the moments of brilliance are not easily matched by any other competitive FPS. But the faults are (seriously now) SOME-OF-THE-MOST-INFURIATING-FUN-KILLING-EXPERIENCE-RUINING faults I&apos;ve ever witnessed. You must understand the degree of game experience ruined by several very specific design flaws and bugs. 1) Dying behind cover. This happens. In fact it happens every time you&apos;re capable of experiencing it, which is when you&apos;re running into cover. I don&apos;t mean cardboard box cover here boys and girls, I mean you&apos;ve rounded a concrete building, you&apos;ve jumped over a cement barrier, you&apos;ve dodged into an alleyway, yet you take fire and DIE 5 to 10 feet behind impenetrable cover. This anomaly has nothing at all to do with cover, it has to do with BF3&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806289">Expand</a></span>

<br>with 64 payer conquest I had amazing time with my freinds playing tactical it felt like one of the best gaming experience I have ever had every thing on the multi just feels right and plays in a fantastic way!
<br>There are still very minor bugs but with such a complex engine and game they are forgivable and probably be fixed.
<br>I  allso forgat to mention the sound is just orgasmic it makes every other shooter gun sounds sound like an airsoft gun, the bullet whistling the tanks everything is perfect.
<br>In shot buy this game it was ment for everyone and it is amazing fun and immersion !!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806593">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been a long time battlefield fan and couldn&apos;t wait for this game to hit store shelves.  Critics seem to rave about it and people who are wowed over by pretty visuals seem to love it.  I on the other hand have had more frustrations with this game and EA&apos;s piss pore attempt at an online distribution site than I think I have ever had in all my time PC gaming.  The game crashes, battlelog is an absolute joke right now, errors left and right, and glitches out the ass.  Not to mention the swarm of hackers already flooding the servers.  As of right now I have played maybe 20 minutes of the game and could honestly care less about it.  Maybe EA will fix these problems (which were also present in the beta, funny absolutely none of it was addressed upon release).  As of right now though I have had no fun with BF3.  But hey, they got my money like they wanted and the game looks great on my PC so I guess thats a plus.<br><br>Personally, I&apos;m going right back to BC2 and plan on leaving this in the dust until EA does something about Origin and the many bugs plaguing this game right now.  Maybe a good game in the future but I wish I would have passed for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1810966">Expand</a></span>

Not to mention the menu-system for the game is all based online which makes you feel like you really got ripped off because it looks cheap trust me the only thing nice about it is Battlelog which is kinda cool but it&apos;s EA&apos;s way of saying here run Origin or Don&apos;t play the game.

<br>This is an OK game as it sits for the time being but yet it deserves a 40% rating due to several issues right now - First being that EA has released a game that has many graphical, gameplay, multiplayer, map, vehicle issues for instance green-flickers and being able to glitch through maps on multiplayer its nowhere near as smooth as it was shown in the previews that im sure everyone has seen. Granted it is a new game but the vehicle issues and the unrealistic nature of Battlefield 3 due to vehicles not producing realistic amounts of destruction and damage really hurt this titles reputation.
<br>
<br>To best describe Battlefield 3 would be a cross between Homefront and Modern Warfare 2 - Homefront being due to the graphical and sketchy gameplay and Modern Warfare 2 due to BF3 trying to cut in on some profits from MW3 which currently sits at a total loss to people who have bought this game (and yes I bought the limited edition BF3). I bought 2x EVGA GTX-580 SC cards specifically for this game and yet the texture draws and polished look this game should have isn&apos;t there and not to mention the annoying lag on multiplayer games that are supposedly low-ping.
<br>
<br>It has potential to be an awesome game but as it sits currently I wouldn&apos;t invest in it until it at least drops $20-30 or they fix hundreds of bugs and errors. Well that&apos;s all I have to say hope you found this somewhat useful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1811489">Expand</a></span>

I own over 350 games and out of every game I&apos;ve ever played, Battlefield 3 is literally the best game I&apos;ve ever played in my life. If you consider yourself a real gamer, this is a game you must have. If not, you&apos;re not really a gamer.</span>

But what it does have, which is really the important factor is the best multiplayer Shooter to date. Solid mechanics, better gunplay and realism them what the arcady cod became. GOTY for pc multiplayer gaming.</span>

I&apos;d give the game a 6 or 7 out of 10 if it didn&apos;t require Origin, being honest I think the game is over-hyped and is an incredibly average shooter.</span>

The multiplayer - seems little bit to chaotic. Lack of server browser and so on. biggest downfall was the &quot;ORIGIN&quot; - the game gets 1 from me purely cause &quot;origin&quot; violates almost all my privacy.</span>

Aircraft/ vehicle controls are shockingly  bad and feel like they just imported the xbox 360 system. On top of that there are way to many bugs to list, poor hit reg because of the broken ass netcode that lets cheats rule the server because of the client side hit detection. In summary BF3 is nothing more than Bad Company 2.5 but not as fun as even BC2 and not a patch on BF2. Fans of BF2/2142 stay away, find something enjoyable to play, leave this **** to the COD generation, those that appreciate teamplay and proper vehicle combat on proper big maps will have to look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1811821">Expand</a></span>

Single player is a travesty, there&apos;s no flow you just wait all the time for your squad to catch up (and for you to find the exact right place to stand to trigger the script) and the next quicktime event to take place.  Coop is just a very generic horde-rush/nazi zombie like mode. MP is simply dull, generic and not much fun.  Maps are either chokepoint based or desolate empty spaces designed for vehicle only gameplay (even the sniper rifles have been gimped).  It&apos;s the very definition of all polish and no substance.  And that&apos;s before you get into the hell hole of the Origin/Battlelog/additional VOIP client system, slow loading times, annoying &quot;music&quot;.  Not worth buying, massively overhyped in the press.  Save your money, send a message to EA and don&apos;t buy this (also bug ridden) rubbish.  I&apos;m giving it 1 for the graphics at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1814813">Expand</a></span>

The campaign is short and unsatisfying, but then, the campaign have never been an important part of Battlefield. This might have been okay if the multiplayer was any good. The multiplayer is unbalanced and already there are several hacks for the PC version. Before unlocking flares or missiles, your jet has to be shot down again and again. Defenders in Rush have a massive advantage. UMP overpowered still. In close-quarters snipers are also overpowered. RPGs also OP. Massive glitches and server problems despite beta testing. The destruction was barely improved. Graphics difference from BC2 was about from Halo 3 to ODST. It felt like the game could have been like Vietnam (an expansion pack for BC2), had it not have had a single player and co-op. The teamwork is horrible. I&apos;m not sure if it is right to blame DICE, though, because teamwork is based on the players instead of the game. The developer can only encourage/discourage it. And I feel like it was discouraged (from BC2 anyway). Battlelog a massive annoyance. It has many problems (for example half the time I can&apos;t even join a game). The game crashes/freezes once in 15 minutes. Be advised that I have an all-purpose entertainment computer that should be able to run the game without any problems according to the minimum requirements. Being a Battlefield fan all the way back from 1942, I am massively disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1811944">Expand</a></span>

Now, for the bad... many weren&apos;t. Sometimes animations don&apos;t load properly and you will see some members of your team just hang there floating from point A to point B, other times after you land a kill the enemy will just stay there in ready position. I only encountered those bugs maybe twice each in 3 hours of gameplay, but it was still quite annoying. Then I have to mention the singleplayer. It was candidly... awful. QTEs every few minutes of gameplay, enemies spawned in two at a time from spawn points that were clearly in view, voice acting that was sub par. I know most people don&apos;t play Battlefield for the singleplayer, but every single other Battlefield game had a GREAT singleplayer experience attached, making it all the more disappointing.<br><br>Lastly Origin. Any game that forces you to use third party software for all gameplay immediately gets a a negative mark, but Origin is one of the worst offenders that I&apos;ve seen. It collects personal information about your hard drive and what games you have installs, what you play, and how long you play it. In systems like steam this is a non-issue, because steam doesn&apos;t collect and use this information, but EA does not have that moral hangup. If not for Origin this would be a solid 7/10, if not for the bad singleplayer 8.5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806838">Expand</a></span>

I have been waiting for this game for awhile and have been stoked just to play it. After playing the beta, i was severly disappointed. The glitches galoore made it insane and more frustrating then fun to play. I figured since it was a beta they would fix it, well they did fix some of the beta glitches, just not near enough for a final copy. The multiplayer feels rushed at best and hardly seems to work. The game is fun when its not glitching and the servers aren&apos;t crashing (which happen about every hour for the xbox). I give this game such a low rating because of the hype and expectations that the critics and trailers it gave, it hardly lives up to expectations. I love battlefield more then call of duty, but i will definently be picking up CoD now and probably tossing this game off until they fix the issues, which with EA&apos;s poor community service skills, will take quite awhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1814401">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;ve removed all the tactical gameplay that made Battlefields 1942/2/2142 so great, the game turns into a mindless grind with no balance or thought.  Some of the maps are better than others, but there are 4 or 5 out of the 9 that come with the game that are up with the worst from Bad Company 2, which was a sort of mini-console-Battlefield that Battlefield 3 wasn&apos;t supposed to be emulating.  Like, two of the nine Battlefield 3 maps are literally linear underground tunnels.  I was extremely disappointed that there isn&apos;t a single large-scale map up there with even the mid-sized maps from the old Battlefield games.  If you look at the promo videos which pretty much all involve flying jets (which have no effect on the rest of the game by the way, they&apos;re in the game mostly for looks and bullet points I think) the maps look pretty large but all of the capture points are clustered in one tiny area which turns the game into another Call of Duty.  They seem to have focused much more on adding a bunch of annoying leveling features, you start out with nothing and then have to grind your way up to get more gear, eventually you&apos;ll unlock weapons like an IR Scope that&apos;s basically a dev-endorsed wall-hack or gun addons that remove all of your recoil.  There are some really huge oversights like air vehicles not starting out with countermeasures, which means as soon as you take off you&apos;ll be shot down by one of the 12 players on the other team wielding missile launchers, until you grind enough to unlock something to defend yourself.  Nothing in this game is about being &quot;fun&quot;, it&apos;s about being addictive and fulfilling a lot of soulless corporate metrics.  Who cares if the game plays like crap, if you can compel players to grind out a bunch of silly awards?  If you&apos;re reading this review 3 months from now, you should probably just avoid, because I suspect it will be really miserable to start out in this game once you&apos;re going up against teams of experienced players with leveled upped gear.  I only tried single player for about 2 minutes, within that time I shot a few AK-47 wielding masked terrists and QTE&apos;d a man to death and then QTE jumped from an exploding train, which is way too many QTE&apos;s for me.  If you like games that try to look like action movies I think you&apos;ll really enjoy this one though.  The only positives I can think of are that the graphics and sound are very nice.  I&apos;m still holding out hope there will be some sort of additional maps or expansion or something that fixes some of the problems, but I really doubt it based on what I&apos;ve seen so far, Battlefield 3 has already sold like a hojillion copies so I do not think Electronic Arts gives a ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1824046">Expand</a></span>

Releasing a game that is locked to a third party software like Origin, and then have the application so broken and unfinished is just unacceptable. Not to mention one of the worst and most useless support chatlines in the history of gaming.</span>

If you look at any past game and compare it to BF3, you keep discovering the same statement over and over; there&apos;s nothing new. All BF3 does is remove features from older titles. BF3 doesn&apos;t have commanders, commander assets, large maps with more than 7 cap points, a more intricate squad command structure, more diversified classes, decent server tools, objective based gameplay, fucntional commorose, and options for veterans to play as we have been since 2002. As this is an objective review, opinions on decisions such as health regeneration, sound spotting, 4 player squads, etc are all irrelevant. What has BF3 contributed to Battlefield as a whole? There is nothing new about this game, just stripped down gameplay to appeal to console players and casuals alike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1807719">Expand</a></span>

I understand that the singleplayer is little more than an extended tutorial. Did an hour of multiplayer and it was really great. But you put the crappy singleplayer in there as well, so I&apos;m damn well going to address it. It sucks. I mean really, the lack of effort is glaring. Let&apos;s start with story. Ok, so we all know the story this entire genre of games has. Story. Singular. The only thing that ever changes is if it&apos;s nazis, russians or terrorists. What&apos;s even worse is, it&apos;s told as a flashback within a retrospective. This method is not avanguard. It&apos;s not clever. It&apos;s not artistic. It&apos;s a bad idea, and it always was. Now, remember how in Bad Company 2 you usually had multiple avenues of approach? You could take the buildings on either side of the street just go for a frontal assault or clear that sawmill in any sequence you wanted, or in the desert mission pick which part to do first? Yeah, Bad Company 2 was linear. But it made an effort to pretend it wasn&apos;t. This game? Corridor shooter. I mean quite literally. I tried flanking constantly, every single time I was told &quot;Leaving battlefield&quot; and given a timer. Every time. The game is a sequence of corridors leading to slightly larger shooting galleries in which you&apos;re given no option how to approach the situation. You do it exactly in the one place the designer meant you to and that&apos;s. Then, enemies. Oh God this part is terrible. The enemies are inexcusable. First of all, all the terrorists are one guy. No, seriously. Every last one of them. The same model. Exactly the same. No difference. In two shooting galleries one after the other I stood crouched next to their spawn point and for a full minute each it went like this: Two identical clones enter. I shoot them both. Reload. Two identical clones enter. Repeat. This for a full minute each time. And most of the game is like this. So yeah, I&apos;m sorry but if you didn&apos;t want people to judge this game on the singleplayer you should have stuck with the multiplayer, which is actually really good btw.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806189">Expand</a></span>

Things that they should have known people hated from bf:bc2 completely ignored.<br>The lack of basic things, no team balance, no option to select the squad you want. half complete features,  for example commorose, missing simple things like requesting ammo or health, but even the options there can&apos;t be heard by your team so it is pointless.<br>Game isn&apos;t built to be a battlefield any more, took too many ideas from cod. Now its suck in the middle doing a worse job then both and nothing better then either.<br>That&apos;s just the MP, the SP is linear, boring and so heavily scripted, you can&apos;t do anything the game doesn&apos;t want.<br>A hefty patch is the only thing that will fix this, thoroughly underwhelming and a massive disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1806232">Expand</a></span>

Commander?  Gone<br>Squads remain in the game but are limited to 4 players and all the functionality from before is simply gone.  Want to play with 1 or multiple other friends, on the same team, in the same squad?  Good luck with that.  You can&apos;t join the squad of your choice.  You can&apos;t join a friends squad and they can&apos;t join you.  You must rely on luck to get in the same squad.   In its current state BF3 seems to be designed for the MW2 crowd and they lost their identity in the process.<br>To top it off you have to launch the game through a 3rd party web browser.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is that all about?<br>BF3 has potential but they need to fix the teamwork features of the game.  Every previous battlefield title surpasses BF3 in the team play department.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1812780">Expand</a></span>

The graphics, animations and sound are top notch.<br>The campaign is mediocre but then if you bought BF3 for the SP, there&apos;s something wrong with you.<br>Now the reason for the low score is that the game is totally unplayable. Sure there are some people who haven&apos;t had a single problem , you are the lucky ones and I envy you but there are 10 more people for 1 of you who are not able to play the game for more than 5 minutes. The game crashes with a stuttering sound after 5 mins into a MP session. The stuttering on this game is unimaginable on certain high end cards as well. When i pay $60 to play a game i don&apos;t expect to spend 10 hours finding a solution to a problem running the game. Kudos to DIce and EA for not porting this from the consoles but your ignorance to customer grievances on Battlelog has to be brought to the forefront.<br>You had an amazing game in your hands and you messed it up. Stay away from this title , atleast on the PC until these issues are rectified.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1822465">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I&apos;d write a lengthy review but I already wasted enough time playing it. I&apos;ll just sum it up: Boring single player with a **** load of cut scenes and listening to people talk. Co-op is nothing more than what mw2 did with theirs, a complete bore. Multiplayer is a joke, as per usual with BF games. New Title: Crawl of duty. Don&apos;t waste your money.</span>

I would have way more recommended it if the developers really forgot about the single player and just focused on the multiplayer part, and now they didn&apos;t it filled with bugs and glitches which then you get excuses that it&apos;s a beta or an alpha.</span>

Granted the singleplayer leaves a lot to be desired but, then again, this is a battlefield game.  You have to expect sub-par single-player experiences in battlefield games.  Why did I give this game a 3 after praising it so highly?  Origin.  Origin is probably the worst idea to ever come out of the cesspool of bad ideas called EA.  It&apos;s laggy.  It&apos;s buggy.  It&apos;s slow. It crashes more than RAGE did on an ATI card at launch.  It&apos;s in no way, shape, or form user friendly.  It records and sends entirely too much personal information to EA.  Worst of all: all EA games released on the PC from this point will only be available on this utter pile of garbage.  Sorry DICE, you&apos;ve lost a long time customer by agreeing to use this sorry excuse for an &quot;online platform.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1807466">Expand</a></span>

So, if you miss a quick time event at the end of a level, you have to start it all over again. The sniper mission is particularly bad. The singleplayer story is contrived and nonsensical. I had no idea what was going on and honestly I didn&apos;t give a damn. None of the missions were any fun. Even the tank mission was quite boring. It&apos;s filled up scripted events and other CoD bull crap. I didn&apos;t bother playing the multiplayer since it&apos;s yet another modern themed shooter and I have way too many of those to begin with.

Battlelog was a nice idea but the person that coded that thing deserves a slap. Random disconnects, launching campaign when pressed &quot;Join Server&quot; and these are only the bugs I have encountered. The gameplay itself is awesome.

Gameplay is awesome but the tech support that cannot solve anything and fans need to find temporary solutions are killing it. EA/DICE needs to wake up and release a patch sooner than predicted 25th November. If the issues (random crashing, disconnects) will be addressed and fixed and if the gameplay will be smooth and without rubber banding, then it will be a true BF2 sequel. So far. It is only a jam of bugs.
