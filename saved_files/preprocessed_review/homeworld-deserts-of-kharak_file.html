This is more of a heads-up, rather than a full review. Cautiously take into consideration.
<br>
<br>With the exception of Starcraft 2, pretty much all RTS games that have been released in the past decade have had lousy single player campaigns AND underdeveloped/unbalanced/poor online components. Deserts of Kharak at least has a good single player campaign. It&apos;s not HW1-tier, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s just as good as HW2&apos;s, in term of its effectiveness.
<br>
<br>Is it worth the asking price? The answer to that depends on who you are. If you are a big fan of the atmosphere and storytelling of the series and are mostly interested in the campaign and maybe a few online matches with a friend here and there, then DoK delivers. If you are a competitive player that doesn&apos;t really care about single player, and that&apos;s looking for a SC2 replacement (for some reason), this is not it. The depth and variety just isn&apos;t even in the same ballpark.
<br>
<br>I belong in the first category, so I will score this highly. It gave me a good campaign, and I&apos;ve been growing increasingly sick and tired of ONLY Blizzard giving a crap about that extremely important aspect of RTS games, and then reading devs saying that people are not interested in the genre anymore. No. People are just not interested in bad RTS games. DoK is half-great, half-poor. If it receives post-launch support and even an expansion later down the line, it can become actually great. Let&apos;s hope for the latter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6027121">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Alright - so what do you get when you add gravity and a surface to Homeworld? - NOT just Homeworld with those features added ... you actually get a completely new gameplay. Although Homeworld played mostly on a flat plane ... it happens in space - and one of the major downsides of Homeworld was/is - that space can only give you so many tactical options. Maps mostly varied by background and available resources.
<br>
<br>Now however - we get real terrain - and not just cosmetic terrain - but one that matters. So the tactical aspect of DoK is much greater than Homeworld - at least from my pov.
<br>
<br>There is also the aesthetics of Homeworld with its kind of clean and modular - yet oddly realistic look - especially realistic scaling. - that works quite well for ground units. The sense of scale works much better than in games of the Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander series - that also features gigantic units along with realistically scaled smaller units.
<br>
<br>Graphics have been upgraded from Homeworld 2 (and/or the remastered versions) - but maintain their design aesthetics well. Music and sound is good - but the sound is not quite as powerful as the sounds in Homeworld.
<br>
<br>The AI works well ... but is still kind of predicatable and not able to mount massive rushes or other stuff that human players tend to do. But it is certainly on the better side of AIs ... and well worth it - even for single players without access to multiplayer battles all the time.
<br>
<br>Performance-wise it runs well on full detail on lower end computers - but then it is not really a &quot;fast&quot; game.
<br>
<br>I must say that i did not expect much - actually i expected a disaster when i first hear of this title - because i thought it would compromise mobile gaming with Homeworld. (not so sure why - but i think i do remember that mobile ports were at least mentioned in that article that i read about it some time ago)
<br>
<br>I d put this game up in the same league as C&amp;C Generals zero hour ... but not quite there yet. (Zero hour beats it with its vastly more varied and asymetric factions and game modes) - and Deserts of Kharak does not have the maps and faction variety to shine (yet).
<br>
<br>It is a solid 8/10 though - with great potential - considering the Homeworld modding community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6031565">Expand</a></span>

The campaign is surprisingly good with great little cutscenes connecting each mission, some great writing on the dialogue and the art style is fantastic, it&apos;s incredibly immersive and the radio chatter is amazing to listen to as it&apos;s so varied. Small niggles about the annoying camera controls, your viewpoint feels too close to the battlefield especially when hills and mountains come into view, it&apos;s missing vital features which every RTS cannot do without and several other things they need to tweak and fix, but judging by their official forum they&apos;re already hard at work on more maps and fixes and improvements.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good solid return to the brilliant setting of Homeworld and I hope BBI continue to add and improve upon it. It&apos;s a safe addition to the Homeworld series but I just wish BBI did more with the time they spent on this game, it&apos;s good but not as great as it could have been.
<br>
<br>So, basically. What&apos;s great is the story, voice acting, dialogue, music, gameplay, immersive both visually and through its audio and easily replayable either through mastering the harder difficulty of the campaign because the gameplay is so enjoyable or multiplayer to see how cunning other Homeworld fans can be!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6037394">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Combat is lacking depth, battlecruiser groups counter everything.
<br>No sub-module to destroy, with guns that spin really fast and hit hard with blast radius render smaller-fast-mover-craft-group useless.
<br>In Homeworld 2, I remember using bombers to disable battlecruiser&apos;s engine, missle silo, then position away from main gun.
<br>Here there&apos;s nothing such maneuver, just amass group of 4 battlecruisers to win.
<br>
<br>Overall, if I give Homeworld 2 a 10 then this only deserve 7.
<br>Still, I&apos;m glad there has been attempts to revive this great franchise.
<br>But please, if you can&apos;t give us hyperspace, then let us see some new innovative mechanic.
<br>Maybe the sequel could use some camouflage, boarders, sub-modules, line formation that snap on to dunes, etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6090074">Expand</a></span>

After a series of my recent disappointments like HotS (what they did to Kerrigan is abysmal if we take Brood Wars into account) and SW7 it is such a pleasure to watch the coherence with HW1&amp;2 story.
<br>
<br>Scenery is not as diverse as I wanted but it is okay for a desert planet. Unit design is sometimes cubic but I have no problem since it looks organic and intended: we have a really advanced and exotic race focused on hid and run tactics and slow but sure utilitarian design race. Which leads you to gameplay which is insanely addictive, watching the battlefield from a close distance can consume me for hours, excellent soundtrack adds to it and multiplayer... It is insane how many tactics you can use and how many builds you can choose since both races similar but plays different. Balance needs some tweaks but the core looks very promising now. The only thing I want to complain about is spawned enemy forces in campaign on higher difficulty, looks a bit cheap but who cares? It just intensifies the campaign :)
<br>
<br>It has small bugs but nothing game breaking and almost all titles have them these days so I am used to it.
<br>
<br>If you want a clone of Starcraft or Supreme Commander then this game is definitely not for you. And I am completely unsure about the e-sport part (since I personally don&apos;t care about it) so no input here. But if you can live with some rough edges and ready to invest into learning of this game&apos;s mechanics then you can find it just as fun as I am.
<br>
<br>Crossing my fingers and hoping for a long after launch support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6038729">Expand</a></span>

Its very small scaled compared to the original homeworld games. The progression into higher tiered units and the higher tier units themselves dont feel well thought out. But the animations are quite alright. Its not flashy or anything, just ok.
<br>
<br>The game retains the unique features of a homeworld game:
<br>
<br>1. You have a mothership carrier that serve as mobile base, builds units and have armaments of itself. The mothership in this game have level up points, you acquire them by gathering artifacts and you can allocate points to different systems - armor, repair, weapon damage, and range. A good system.
<br>2. All your remaining units and resources gets carried to the next mission. It makes the game flow better and the scenario more real. Unfortuantely the scenario themselves arent that well made.
<br>3. User interface and controls, you have a menu on the right to control your mothership to build units and research technologies and upgrades. The move command shows you a radius of movement. You can specify a number of commands which include attack a specified group of units. Unfortunately it does not feel good on planet surface as opposed to space. Homeworld was really special because you play space battle in a 3d environment, you specify 3 co-ordinates to move units instead of 2 co-ordinates on a 2d map.
<br>
<br>General features:
<br>
<br>1. Non-unique is all units in the game have some special abilities you can activate, I quite like them.
<br>2. Pace combat is slower than your average RTS, difficulty is easy to average. You can mine more resources than you know what to do with. You carry over resources from last mission and each mission they made sure there are enough resources for you to win. So your carry over resources stacks up over a number of mission and you just get richer and richer and can pump out more and more units.
<br>
<br>Problems I have with the game.
<br>
<br>1. User interface and control system. But the original homeworld 2 looked and felt better probably because because its set in space. It made sense in a 3d environment, and the textures also fit in better. you dont just specify where on a plain you want to move, you also select which verticalOn the surface, its nothing but a shell that offers a different visual display.
<br>
<br>2. Remaining units from each mission is carried forward to the next mission. It gives the game a good follow.
<br>
<br>My problems with the game:
<br>
<br>1. AI is really really bad, in skirmish you cannot play a game with uneven teams. e.g. have to be 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3. Only a few maps to play with as well. There are not many people who play the game so multiplayer you probably be hard pressed to find people to play with.

<br>2. Too many chit-chat in game, the script talks almost none-stop sometimes. But this can be good too depending on the person. It gives the game more realism with things happening real-time. no timeout.
<br>
<br>3. Some units fire like rail guns shoot through obstacles sometimes. sitting on top of a cliff and animation of the laser just shoots through ground. the ground takes no damage of course.
<br>
<br>4. Story was a bit weak. Ending was wrapped up too quickly and didnt have a lot. Didnt really feel a climax and finale.
<br>
<br>5. Units feels are too simple and not well thought out and designed.
<br>
<br>If this game is not homeworld I would probably only give it a 6. But been homeworld and with all its good and unique features 6 does not do justice. I think the crude feel of the game comes mainly been a small budget title and an old game running out of ideas.
<br>
<br>Having said all that I feel its still a worthwhile game to buy and support. Homeworld and its gameplay is really special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6075873">Expand</a></span>

However, there are too many negatives for me to give it a higher score.  First off, the need for AI to gather resources is removed from this game, all enemy units are spawned using scripts.  The ENTIRE enemy unit catalog consists of about 8 units (heavy railgun, assault railgun, assault platform, sandskimmer, production cruiser, honorguard cruiser, missile platform, repair frigate, air units only exist in the last mission) and with those it ends up being a contest of how long you can survive the endless script spawns.
<br>
<br>As to the campaign quality, the animation hearkens back to the original, but has improvements as it should be.  I loved it, but it was TOO SHORT.  They could have fleshed out this story so much more, and extended the playthrough.  The entire campaign takes anywhere from 9-12 hours to finish, and for 50 dollars for the basic version and 69 for the DLC packs, it is awful.
<br>
<br>They had so much potential to make this a game series better than the Starcraft empire but fell short, swing and a miss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6230996">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game was SO easy!, i completed in hard, and had 5000 RU&#xB4;s to spare. This game reminds me of the 90&#xB4;game Dark Reign? anybody remember that?

<br>Singleplayer campaign took me about 12 hours on the hardest difficulty setting, I got wrecked by the AI a few times and had to restart or reload from a save multiple times. The story is well written and executed, it is mostly fed to you through cutscenes and animatics. Even for fans of the original titles (who kinda know how the game is going to end, after all it`s a prequel) there are plenty of surprises!
<br>
<br>Multiplayer/Skirmish is fun but it suffers a bit from the low map choice (5 maps at release). At least in &quot;Artifact Retrieval&quot; mode (basically capture the flag) the AI can be very, very challenging actually, I can not confirm the experience of some reviewers here. Note that keys can not be rebound at the moment, though the standard layout of the quickbuttons is okay and usable.
<br>
<br>Performance was good on an i3 and a GTX 650 Ti, FPS did only drop in very, very, very intense situations (lots of units and boom). No major bugs encountered, except for an UI bug that caused returning from the options menu to be quite a wait (30 secs+). Only ever had a single crash so far, this occured right before loading a new mission.
<br>
<br>Although the title obviously still needs some work I am satisfied with this purchase and excited for upcoming new content (free maps have already been promised, further DLC are &quot;in the pipe&quot;).

<br>
<br>It could have been a good game if they added way more, now it feels a medioric year 2000 game.</span>

I&apos;ve replayed the SP missions in HW1, HW2 and Cataclysm multiple times over the last 10+ years.  I doubt I&apos;ll ever play this one again after completing it.</span>

<br>1. Graphics. It&apos;s realistic and furnished to perfection.
<br>2. Atmosphere. It&apos;s great! Immersive story telling that bridges itself wonderfully with HW1.
<br>3. Physics. It&apos;s definitely more polished compared to HW1 and HW2.
<br>4. Combat. Combat looks and feels authentic (at first), much like HW1 and HW2.
<br>
<br>The BAD:
<br>1. Interface. It&apos;s massively underwhelming. No escort patterns. No siege arrangement line-ups. No smart-formation movement and strategies. No firing distance preferences. No distance info when you press the move or even in the zoomed-out view. No ETA for units who are ordered to move from point A to point B.
<br>2. Clipping. There are noticeable clipping issues with units and weapon line of sight firing. Eg. Harvesters stack with each other. No harvester docking animations.
<br>3. Path-Finding. It&apos;s decent if you group similar smaller units together. Mixing them up however with slower heavier units then it gets pretty bad; horrendous even in tight spaces.
<br>4. Units. Same unit types for both sides plus the fact that there are very few unit types present. It&apos;s like a demo.
<br>5. Detail. No main-ship and carrier sub-system building. No specific unit part targeting, eg. Sub-system targeting to disable movement, weapons, or research.
<br>6. AI (skirmish/MP). The AI is nothing but an auto-pilot attack everything rush type. It stops building units and harvesters midway even in the harder difficulty settings. Single player AI is mostly scripted.
<br>7. Maps (skirmish/MP). It has what, 5 very uninteresting maps? really?!
<br>8. HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE. For such a barren landscape with so few units, performance is horrendous. The latter missions plummet to single digits even when i turn off every video detail. I play the game at maxed everything and I have a good rig, mind you. I run Witcher 3 and every other game that&apos;s been released on ULTRA settings at 2560x1080 just fine.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d give it a 6/10 for now, because it feels like a single player demo. Plus, it&apos;s unoptimized as fudge! Some missions run smoothly others take nose dive! It&apos;s definitely a step back from HW1 and HW2 when you look at it as a whole.
<br>
<br>Terrain height and line-of-sight gameplay isn&apos;t anything new in this genre. Company of Heroes, Dawn of War 2, Supreme Commander Forged Alliance/2, Ground Control 1/2, and even the classic Total Annihilation all have it. Company of Heroes and DoW2 do it better too as there is an angular projectile deflection modifier per shot that is taken into account. In this game, ballistics seem to perform like lasers.
<br>
<br>The game has... polish with its looks, most definitely, but so little content to be considered a true successor of the Homeworld franchise. (Until the paid DLC&apos;s come-out at least. LOL) It&apos;s way too expensive for its asking price with the content that&apos;s currently available in this initial release.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t understand why such an old engine with updated textures taxes current generation gaming computers. I don&apos;t remember a game this unoptimized since Neverwinter Nights 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6032007">Expand</a></span>

Luego de una decada Gearbox y BlackBird deciden transportarnos al desierto de Kharak para mostrarnos los acontecimientos que anteceden a la primera entrega de Homeworld. Bellos graficos, musica majestuosa, gameplay intuitivo siguen siendo el sello de distincion que caracateriza a un juego que paso del espacio, entre las las estrellas, a las dunas del decierto de un planeta moribundo. Logrando en el proceso lo que muchos consideraron imposible, mantener la esencia, el &quot;feeling&quot;. El juego peca en cuanto a contenido mutijugaror, teniendo disponible (por ahora) solo 2 facciones y 5 mapas. Se trata de una obra para los fans de la serie, solo la historia vale la pena el dinero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6029149">Expand</a></span>

I have both Deserts and Remastered on my PC and I always choose Remastered to have some fun.
<br>
<br>The units seem chintzy - the combat is cool, but everything is very deadly. Units feel less like tanks and more like missiles to be disposed of in combat. Gone are the cool and logical squadrons of small units; even the smallest throwaway buggy is produced one at a time. It feels like a step towards StarCraft or Command&amp;Conquer, the way the units interact with each other and react to your commands.
<br>
<br>The desert is ugly. It can&apos;t be ignored. I can appreciate the varied environments; a great job was done here to make the desert look interesting, but it&apos;s still a desert. In the best possible case, this is Homeworld without the stunning and unimaginably huge vistas.
<br>
<br>The sensor view doesn&apos;t work as well in the desert as in space. The various shades used by the map aren&apos;t particularly intuitive, but it&apos;s a workable setup.
<br>
<br>The graphics are similarly OK. Doesn&apos;t look particularly stunning, but it&apos;s good enough that you don&apos;t feel jarred. The art style is very appropriate for the Homeworld universe, but the same design language that produced the flowing lines and utilitarian towers of Homeworld&apos;s ships produces some believable but very uninteresting land units. The carrier Kapisi alone is an odd contraption, fitted with tracks that look much too small and a flight deck too large and superfluous for the futuristic craft it launches. It certainly doesn&apos;t invoke the beauty and awe of the banana ship.
<br>
<br>There are a weak points to the graphics, too. Some units clip together, some things seem like they could be fleshed out. Repairs are conducted by the ubiquitous &quot;health beam&quot; projected from support units and I found that supremely disappointing. Nanolathing was an awesome solution for Total Annihilation in 1997, but in 2016 it just looks like they didn&apos;t want to animate something more interesting.
<br>
<br>The campaign was decent. The story pulled you in enough, and the journey into the vast desert was interesting. That said, it wasn&apos;t AAA. It&apos;s slightly worse than HW2&apos;s story, and there are a few predictable and slightly cringe-worthy lines (this was my brother&apos;s ship...)
<br>
<br>Which brings me to our new main character. I like Karen S&apos;jet from HW2. She&apos;s very practical, but she displays these perfect twinges of emotion which give a lot of life to a very stoic character. The new chick, Rachel, is loosely similar to Karen, but she feels more like a mediocre imitation than a sentimental recreation. None of the characters in past Homeworlds were enthralling, but they were more than talking heads in the old games.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d recommend this game. It&apos;s not the Homeworld I&apos;ve been waiting for, but it&apos;s a fine and entertaining RTS on it&apos;s own merits and one of the better releases in the genre from the past ten years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6040385">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s wasn&apos;t enjoyable and I definitely have some buyers&apos; remorse, but I can&apos;t really point to anything particularly bad. It&apos;s just kind of bland -- I had zero investment in the story, the gameplay felt identical to older games in the series without feeling like there was much improvement outside graphics - and it is very pretty (but there&apos;s not too much opportunity to enjoy it since you need to be click-click-clicking).
<br>
<br>Persistence in campaign missions was nice. It gave more weight to what you were doing, rather than just asking you to spam a bunch of whatever until something works, no matter the costs. -But it didn&apos;t make the game fun, just more immersive in something I wasn&apos;t excited about being immersed in.
<br>
<br>The tech pacing felt completely unnecessary gameplay-wise and broke immersion. &quot;Oh, we discovered this ship we flew and lost a few years ago, and now we remembered how to build a particular early-game tank.&quot; The tutorial&apos;s rendered pointless by the very slow initial pacing. Maybe I just don&apos;t have the patience anymore for games that don&apos;t throw everything they have at me at once.

<br>
<br>This story is mostly jewish vs white/arabs in planet Arrakis.   Why?.  Let&apos;s me explain you.  This game uses the next sets of names:
<br>a) silly names = for name the ships.
<br>
<br>b) Random names may be pronounced in Klingon, such adding K, X and apostrophes at random.
<br>
<br>c) Jewish names for the main characters (the main character and his brother).
<br>
<br>And the enemies are exactly than a stereotyped arabs (their acts, believed and even their accent) with the difference of the masks and without the mask they are nordics.   And of course, some videos show arabs songs.
<br>
<br>BUT, its not the problem, the problems so far:
<br>-The story is stupid, the enemies found the technology but they do practically nothing in 3 years, while our good guys advanced exponentially in just days.   And in the end, the game explains nothing, but who cares, they killed the enemies (even when they was defending his soil).  And guess that?, the &quot;technology&quot; exists since forever. How?. Beats me.
<br>-Also, the story talks about the NORTH, and they should go to the NORTH but the maps shows the EAST. I know that its a rotate maps but its just a burden.
<br>-The game honors his name : its all deserts with little or not variation.
<br>-Technically the game is so-so, its not optimized and it lags here and there.
<br>-Visually the dunes are done fine but everything else is generic.
<br>-The units (as most players are saying) are disposable.
<br>-Its not the kind of RTS when you build building. Its one of those new RTS when you build units and collects resource.
<br>-It has a strategic map and its really important to use. But the strategic map doesn&apos;t show the impassable terrain.
<br>-The AI is simple :some units are suicides, other units hits and run and others just patrols around the map.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6041763">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Lots of people will hack at the gamers, like me, who want tactical pause for the main reason that it it makes the game look beautiful. My favorite part of homeworld was pausing huge battles or vistas to take in the graphics and let the imagination run wild. The lack of a tactical pause removes this key element.
<br>
<br>To be clear- I try to avoid tactical pause, because it makes the game much easier. I am not willing to give it up though, as it ruins the game for me to have to stay in the overhead view, and not be able to be the Director of my own space opera. The original games were challenging with tac pause. Why? Why remove it?
<br>
<br>The removal of tactical pause holds this game back from a much higher score, and it was a stupid decision to remove the option entirely. Sorry, I played the game for a few missions, but I will not be completing it because of this horrible decision to remove a fundamental gameplay element from Homeworld.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=7043419">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sepan lo siguiente, la mayor&#xED;a de los que pusieron notas altas al juego lo hicieron: 1) por amor a homeworld original (fan services) y 2) porque pusieron la nota despu&#xE9;s de jugar el primer d&#xED;a.
<br>
<br>Las primeras horas el juego est&#xE1; bien. Pero no pasa de ser lo mismo.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer nulo. A.I. NULA.
<br>
<br>Las misiones single player son lo &#xFA;nico que van a hacer, si bien la historia es interesante est&#xE1; llena de cliches y hasta la forma de hablar es repetitiva, di&#xE1;logos muy gastados de otros juegos y los &quot;twist&quot; son un remedo de ello.
<br>
<br>El juego no est&#xE1; terminado, no es lindo, hay pocas texturas, est&#xE1; mal optimizado. El juego en s&#xED; es muy lento y todas las unidades son innecesarias despu&#xE9;s de la 3ra Misi&#xF3;n. Usas tu base como veh&#xED;culo de ataque principal y saca unidades a medida que necesites nomas, ZERO T&#xC1;CTICA necesitas. La computadora solamente hace lo mismo una y otra vez, 1 tanque grande, + 2 o 3 o 5 unidades a distancia (railgun) + 5 unidades peque&#xF1;as.
<br>
<br>No hay estrategia y este juego sin terminar, sin muchos detalles es la prueba que el RTS est&#xE1; muriendo :D.
<br>
<br>Resumen:
<br>
<br>Gr&#xE1;ficas: 1
<br>Sonido: 1
<br>Jugabilidad: 1 (super l&#xED;mitada para el 2016, es como jugar Dune 2000)
<br>Historia: 1
<br>Nivel de Estrategia: 0
<br>Horas de juego en Hard solo modo historia sin Skirmish: 6
<br>con Skirmish: 10 (menos mapas que dedos de las manos y 2 razas exactamente iguales y la pc repite el mismo patr&#xF3;n de ataque siempre, te desaf&#xED;o a jugar mas de 4 veces sin aburrirte)
<br>
<br>En resumen, si gastas 60 dolares por este juego vas a invertir un promedio de 5 d&#xF3;lares/hora.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6183356">Expand</a></span>

At first i thought &quot; meh...homeworld on ground ? weird&quot; but as soon I launched it, I was stuck by the quality of the scenario and the artistic beauty of the cut scenes. The game it self lacks some depth in the gameplay, but overall it&apos;s quite addictive and fun. The sound is very good and the ambiance is perfect. Homeworld vets are going to really enjoy it. The game isnt built for mutiplayer (Sc2 is far better on this side), but the solo campaign is amazing (one of the best i played since.... Homeworld).. In fact, if the writing of a game is perfect , you can accept some defaults..
<br>I put 10 because of the surprise, because of the bravery to launch this kind of game, because it has been created with the hearth and with passion, and you can feel it directly after the first minutes. I also put 10 because of the 0 i saw or less than 5 ,with some crazy argumentations like&quot;the cut scenes wich are not skippable&quot;.
<br>&quot;Unskippable Cutscenes put the max score to 4. After 4 minutes of my time, I still could not play. Since they locked me out of the game with this choice, I can only give it Zero.&quot; are you serious ? this is the worst comment i red for many times.
<br>very good game, it reminds me the &quot;Mad Max&quot; game, wich was totally unexpected and revealed itself to be a great game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6785873">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I regret that they didn&apos;t include more capital ships like the heavy cruisers in Homeworld2 but yeah a really refreshing game.
<br>
<br>All in all I really liked playing this game even though the campaign lacked a litlle challenge and depth IMO. A bit expensive at 45.99 but yeah it&apos;s a good polished game.
<br>
<br>Didn&apos;t even try multiplayer homeworld is all about the campaign for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=6087580">Expand</a></span>

The first play-through I had no clue what I was doing but I beat the game at &quot;normal&quot; difficulty in about 8 hours. The second time I knew exactly the pro&apos;s and cons of the units and how to use them thanks to pro-commentary on YouTube. So I played it again, and again it took me 8 hours, but only because I wanted to exploit every little detail. I could have halved the time if I wanted to! And so can you.
<br>
<br>Next is the multiplayer: it&apos;s almost non-existent. What can I say. I don&apos;t care, but if you care then now you know.
<br>
<br>The AI is non-existent either. During the campaign everything is scripted, the AI doesn&apos;t even mine for resources. In singleplayer skirmishes against the AI, the AI does a standard job of attacking you early, but as soon as you settle down a bit you&apos;re in full control. At one point I decided just to spy on the AI, and it didn&apos;t even bother to exploit it&apos;s third resource location (out of 3 available). It was just sitting there to be finished off.
<br>
<br>Without giving spoilers away, I am going to demonstrate the simplicity of DoK&apos;s tactical setup:
<br>* Light Vehicles are fast and are made to hit ranged vehicles as Light Vehicles are too fast to be hit by them
<br>* Armored vehicles are excellent against Light vehicles
<br>* Ranged vehicles are good against Armored vehicles
<br>
<br>What do you notice? It&apos;s a straightforward rock-paper-scissor approach. Once you know this, the campaign even on hard difficulty will be a breeze.
<br>
<br>Then, you have additional cruiser based vehicles (expensive hard-hitters) but it&apos;s all rinse and repeat. Finally you have some flying gear, they are all meant to be hard hitters, just watch out for anti-air as they have no meaningful defenses. Major oddity: support cruisers (non-combat vehicles) have the most vicious anti-air capability of them all after an upgrade. Bit crazy right?
<br>
<br>DLC&apos;s are sold for &quot;nominal&quot; fees which offer nothing substantially. For example the DLC Soban &quot;race&quot; is nothing more but a copy of an existing race with a few minor modifications and the obvious graphic changes.
<br>
<br>The game is beautiful yet doesn&apos;t require much hardware (my I7 3820 with a GTX680 ran it on 1900 x 1200 like a boss on highest settings). But I suspect the producer planned to exploit the love for the old space based Homeworld game and made the price of DoK way too high (right now over $40 USD without any goodies).
<br>DoK is the prequel before Homeworld. Also, realize that DoK is a desert-based RTS, not space-based like the Homeworld series.
<br>
<br>The last good thing I have to say, is that in the campaign, the assets you have created are carried over. It&apos;s pretty unique. Also the mobile main base system (with extremely heavy defenses) is also fairly unique. But now a negative again: in my second play-through (when I knew what I was doing) I spent a lot of time making some of my units veterans (they can be promoted 5 times). But at one point those precious units weren&apos;t carried over! Another bug to note and another tiny disappointment to deal with.
<br>
<br>In short, the positives and the negatives:
<br>
<br>+ Nice graphics, also when zoomed in
<br>+ Offers good tactical overview (press space bar for full screen map with all functionalities)
<br>+ Good ideas such as carry-over of units and resources and mobile main platform
<br>+ Excellent performance
<br>+ Very (very!) nice back chatter such as status updates, battle warnings etc.
<br>+ Decent voice acting besides the back chatter
<br>+ It&apos;s not one of those frantic micromanage (*click* *click* *click* *click*)  RTS games.
<br>+ Base units have a clear and distinct purpose
<br>+ Tactical aspect of height if terrain really matters.
<br>
<br>+/- Advanced units pack a punch, but aren&apos;t that specialized. With just a bit of support they can hold their own in many situations.
<br>
<br>- Very short campaign
<br>- Non-intelligent campaign (every detail is scripted)
<br>- Almost non-existent multiplayer
<br>- Bad community management (reported bugs not fixed, no passion for this game)
<br>- Basic AI
<br>- Limited tactical possibilities
<br>- Relative high price all things considered
<br>- Non-inspiring DLCs
<br>- Long loading times of missions
<br>- No modding community
<br>
<br>5/10 because it needs a few notches extra to be worth the price. Thank you for reading all of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak/user-reviews?user_review_id=7064559">Expand</a></span>
