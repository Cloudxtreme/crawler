<br>
<br>The difficulty is very low in the first few levels and always gets a little higher from level to level. Nobody should have any problems getting into the game. And yet it is quite challenging later on. Escape Goat 1 offered some high difficulty levels after beating the campaign. I expect the successor to offer the same (I didn&apos;t finish it yet, so I just can assume it will).
<br>
<br>The main difference to the first part is the graphics style. Instead of the basic pixel art we got in Escape Goat 1, this game now uses a new high definition graphics style, which many people will like. I personally prefer the old art style, but I am fine with either of them. The most important thing for me is, that the controls didn&apos;t change at all. Despite the new graphics the game feels absolutely like the first part. Not all games manage to do that.
<br>
<br>I like it a lot. Both Escape Goat games are real indie gems. You will enjoy your time.

The game has improved slightly, however there are many problems that the game suffers.
<br>
<br>The graphics have really improved from the first game, although when I first saw the trailer for the sequel I was pretty dissapointed with the change of graphics, however I quite actually like it now.
<br>
<br>The music is as great as ever, I really enjoyed the music in the game and I would definitely buy the sequel&apos;s soundtrack just what I did for the first game!
<br>
<br>The length of the game has improved from just two hours, the game has been extended to five to six hours which is great. However, the game has changed a lot since the first game. Although I did like that the game&apos;s mechanic are not shown to you through on-screen instructions, but showing it to you by trying it out yourself and figuring it.
<br>
<br>However, the game is really frustrating with its &quot;trail and error&quot; which is really annoying and really bugged me, once you play the map then you find out you had to do it differently, I really got mad!
<br>
<br>The controls are annoying as ever like the first game and with the addition of new game mechanics, it gets frustrating, a lot! The puzzles are also very hard, they get hard very quickly and are very frustrating!
<br>
<br>Although the game is very frustrating from the first game, it is still a nice game to play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/escape-goat-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338169">Expand</a></span>
