The guards are like a mix of A.D.D and retarded. They are completely annoying and can not be permenately eliminated only stunned. Blue 52&apos;s (game creator) excuse is she is a thief not a lethal killer. But the Hi-tech gagets add a little trill to it but can be annoying when under pressure. She has a blowtorch, lockpicking tools, computer hacking(easy) and thats pretty much it. Still it is a cool extra. But if it did not have that the game probally would have recieved a 4. Graphiclly the game is not that great. The levels are designed big but no fun and Anya lacks the smoothness from the levels. The levels are basicly shades of gray. The movies kind of just pop in but are o.k. Graphic rating is a 4.9. Gameplay is kind of boring. The levels are long but tedious. You do get a feel of coolness when doing acrobatics and lockpicking but are overshadowed by the guards and tedious levels. The guards have flashlights which can be a threat but sometimes they don&apos;t spot you when the light flashes at Anya, they are idiots. The game takes about 8 hours to complete and you feel left hanging at the end. The ending is pretty predicable if you understand the storyline. Gameplay recieves in opinoin a 5.4. Sound quality, heard better. The music when spotted is annoying after awhile. But when ending the level the music is pretty entertaining(kind of sounds like james bond with the word Stolen said by Anya). The actors don&apos;t talk much only in the short movies. The voice acting is all right. Sound is a low 5.1.Closing comments: the game might have been a sleeper title had it not been for the mongolic guards, bad gameplay, and crappy looks. the best part of the game are the gagets (when in correct conditons), and Anya. In total game should in second opinion get a 6.1. The game is hard to enjoy. Replayability is moderately low. But I have seen worse games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stolen/user-reviews?user_review_id=380274">Expand</a></span>
