It&apos;s a short game, and there is almost no replay value.  My biggest complaint is the hyper nauseating camera motions.  Jumping over an obstacle, or pulling a lever causes the camera to wobble around drunkingly for a couple of seconds.  There&apos;s more than one scene where your vision is blurred involuntarily.

                                        <span>I was hugely disappointed with this game. Not only were the controls sketchy (though I guess you can&apos;t really expect anything less from a console port these days), but the gameplay itself quickly became repetitive and boring. Add onto that unrelateable characters and unnecessary cutscenes every other minute and you&apos;ve got one hell of a mess for a game. Definitely not worth $60.</span>

The action sequences are fast-paced, but if you like to take your time with shooters just lower the difficulty. The controls can be a little sketchy when you&apos;re in the menus and a Windows Live account is required, but I didn&apos;t find either of those to be a deal breaker. If you&apos;re looking for a fun shooter that you don&apos;t have to take seriously, look no further than Bulletstorm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501414">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoyed my time with this game. There are some really cool environments in this game and the visuals are for the most part really pleasant to look at.  The story and character interactions are surprisingly alright even though they hardly will win any awards. The campaign should take you around ten hours to beat depending on the difficulty. And the ten hours are actually quite varied with a lot of really cool moments even though the mindless shooting have a habit of getting a tiny bit repetitive at the end. The shooting is however quite good and the action feels quite satisfying although i would like to have seen more enemy-types, more bosses and more weapons in the game. The upgrade system could also be fleshed out more. Another thing i should mention is that the game is not only linear but also very much static. The inability to jump for instance will probably piss a lot of people of. Bulletstorm is by no means perfect but its a really competent mindless first person shooter and i do recommend fans of the genre to check this game out. I certainly had a lot of fun with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3072491">Expand</a></span>

You therefore have an incentive to combo together and search for new &quot;skillshots&quot; to gain points. Each skillshot was satisfying in its own right and you didn&apos;t have to go out of your way to achieve them. It adds a lot of complexity and depth to the game. The energy whip is an awesome core mechanic that&apos;s similar to the force. It&apos;s charge attack never gets old either. Each gun has a unique use and intensely fun to play. Unfortunately, you won&apos;t have enough time to thoroughly use them all. The game is pretty short, which is to be expected of a new IP, but it delivers a witty tongue-in-cheek characters and story. The story is mostly ignored in favor of awesome action sequences such as a giant flaming wheel in a rail sequence and a monstrous prehistoric mother pissed off at you. The ending is pretty abrupt but keeps players drooling for what&apos;s to come next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1495052">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a story, Bulletstorm feels like a frantic futuristic action movie, with ups and downs, twists and turns, and memorable sequences (ah ! the gigantic wheel !) and most of all : an excellent pacing.
<br>
<br>I think the pleasure I got from playing the game mostly comes from its pacing and the wild swings between tension and release, almost like a roller-coaster in a fun fair !

A lighthearted game that doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously for the 14 year old in us who just wants to shoot aliens and blow things up. The unique concept of skillshot points and environmental interaction has its minor flaws (mainly that weapons are just overpowered thanks to the mouse controls) but overall is a very interesting and promising mechanic for future titles of the genre. Setting and art direction are brilliant, you can really immerse into the world around you although the gameplay itself is very linear. In my eyes the game&apos;s flow doesn&apos;t collide with the extensive use of cut scenes. Plus the various special stages (such as Waggleton P. Tallylicker and the grind wheel thing, not to give away any spoilers) keep the player pumped for more action. Sadly the singleplayer campaign is relatively short and the multiplayer is entirely composed of singleplayer stages in co-op mode or on the hunt for more points so the replay value inevitably suffers. Also the PC version suffers from a few minor bugs such as being locked to 16:9 and therefore black bars for any monitor resolution that isn&apos;t 16:9. Might not be worth full price to you if you have a relatively tight budget for gaming expenses but if I saw it on sale I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to grab a copy because for the time playing it absolutely and almost literally blows you away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1565361">Expand</a></span>

What makes things worse is that loading screens for chapters often give away what secrets the game has to offer in advance. &quot;Hey there&apos;s that statue thing we just encountered and in that pic it&apos;s attacking us!&quot; etc,. They also gave FAR too much away on the trailer... so what might have been nice surprises were repeatedly spoiled. Initially the drunken antics of the protagonist and buddies do amuse, quite a bit but a few hours in an most of the buddies have fallen to one side and there&apos;s little in terms of character development in the other characters. The over the top profanity was fairly amusing and the back drops were pretty but it was very &quot;run and gun&quot; as well as linear. Weapons upgrades are limited to adding ammo capacity and unlocking an alternative fire mode. which was disappointing. I ended the game with masses of unspent skill points, and cruised through most of the second half of the game with over 9000! Models and graphics were nicely done and my ATI 4850 was able to keep up on full detail at 1080p for the most part, which was nice. If I had some groovy Directx 11 card, I might notice it&apos;s not quite as good as some other games, but I don&apos;t! The only part my PC seemed to have problems with was playing the opening movie smoothly! Some parts of the game seem unpolished e.g. the &quot;press space to jump over something&quot; often seemed a bit shaky. There was more thought required to clear the various killing fields and more possibilities for different tactics, etc in Dead Space 2. I am not against linear games but it&apos;s nice when you have to &apos;work out&apos; how to clear various sections. All in all, fairly amusing, inoffensive (unless you count the language!), nice. detailed if somewhat cartoony graphics, novel if ultimately shallow combat experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488207">Expand</a></span>

Awesome use of gratuitous foul language.  I enjoyed the jokes as well.<br>-Weapons:  So many great ways to kill people.<br>-Sliding was a blast!<br>-Linear FPS game: I usually prefer linear singleplayer FPS games because USUALLY the story moves better.  Usually.<br>-Act 5:Chapter 3 through Act 7 - Why couldn&apos;t most of the game move the plot like this?<br><br>On the fence:<br>-Difficulty-too easy, but maybe this made the skill shot system more fun?<br>-Surprisingly, I didn&apos;t miss the ability to jump.  I would hit my jump button out of reflex but it wasn&apos;t horrible without jumping.<br><br>What I hated:<br>-3 button presses just to get to the main game menu of the game.<br>-GFWL-20 minutes to get into the game.  Not game installation time, just getting GFWL to update properly and get to the main menu.  You see, it appears you can update GFWL in the game, but you have to restart the game.  But there isn&apos;t a way to exit the game at this point because you haven&apos;t gotten to the main menu.  Then you have to update GFWL extrnally but it doesn&apos;t tell you that.  You just have to guess.  Then you can get into the game.  This actually put me in a bad mood just to start Bulletstorm.  Games should really take off the GFWL tag.  they might get more sales.<br>-Horrible, horrible PC controls.  Did anyone play the PC version?  C&apos;mon.  The worst weapon switching ever.  You can equip 3 weapons but 1 button only swaps between TWO of the weapons.  Menu system for buying upgrades/ammo was pretty bad too.<br>-Editing the config files to correct the neutered graphics options and input settings was bad too.  The .ini files are encrypted so a third party program must be downloaded. All to fix settings like max FPS, FOV, mouse smoothing, mouse sensitivity, etc.  The game was unplayable on the lowest sensitivity setting in the GUI.<br>-Quicktime events.  Oh my god, the quicktime events!!!!  Make them stop.<br>-Villain wasn&apos;t really a villain.  Ok, so he had the protagonist assassinate innocent people, but it&apos;s such a trite motivation for a vendetta that it didn&apos;t really feel evil enough to devote 10 years in revenge.  At most, the villain hurt the feelings of the protagonist.   In the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas had his protagonist, Edmond  Dantes, wrongly thrown in prison for about 13 years.  Now that is motivation for revenge!  -Game never closed properly.  Win7 always popped up with a dialogue asking me to close the program because it stopped working.<br>-Act 1 through Act 5 chapter 3-really kinda bored with the story here.  Too bad this is most of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1562226">Expand</a></span>

That being said, I thought this game was alright. Most of the parts came across as just mediocre, though. Some of the parts should have been awesome (remote control in particular), but for some reason they came across as annoying. The shooting mechanics themselves were pretty fun, but some of the skillshots are insanely hard to pull off, and forcing yourself to memorize a formula and try it out on a handful of enemies until you get it right more or less takes you out of the &quot;fast-paced and frantic&quot; atmosphere this game tries to pull off. Add that to enemies that can take INSANE numbers of shots, and a field of view so narrow that you won&apos;t be able to see jack money squat to your side, and a great game turns merely good. The graphics are alright and the sound was well done, but holy CRAP is most of the voice acting bad. Ishi is completely and utterly devoid of emotion, even though he has tons of emotional lines, and Sarrano&apos;s dialogue sounds like it was written by an 11-year old that just learned about swear words. Even Trishka&apos;s acting is bad, for the 2 lines in the whole game that she expresses something other than annoyance. Hunt was well-acted, although I&apos;m not surprised since the voice actor is an absolute pro, and is in EVERYTHING. The second half of this game feels like it drags on forever, which is horrible, since Bulletstorm is NOT a long game by anyone&apos;s definition. Games for Windows Live (which is required even through Steam) is an absolute turd, and should never ever ever ever be used in a game again EVER. Overall, it was a fun little distraction, and aside from a few infuriatingly annoying parts, I had fun with it. I&apos;m certainly glad I paid $5 for it though. I&apos;d be upset if I had paid more than $10, honestly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2462575">Expand</a></span>

The campaign follows the story of Grayson Hunt some drunk,loudmouthed space pirate out for revenge against his former leader; General Sarrano who had him and his squad kill innocents for his own gain. So basically he finds his ship and suicidally takes him down and crashes over some planet failed utopia called Stygia. When he awakens him and his homicidal crazy robot human friend try to finish Sarrano going through hordes of crazy mutants to do so.<br>Anyway the whole thing Bulletstorm has going for it is the &quot;kill with skill&quot; feature which rewards players for getting creative with their kills with skill points to upgrade weapons. While this is very unique, the novelty soon wears off. A lot of the cool kill sections in the game are scripted or blatantly obvious. And the skill points system eventually becomes redundant as well, essentially being used as an ammo refill system soon enough. Because of this there just feel like any incentive to kill with skill, eventually I just became bored and ended up using the bullet slide/kick/leash trick over and over and over again. If the game featured something like destructible environments then that would be awesome, imagine it, leasing any kind of debris you want and kicking it in your enemy&apos;s face. Sadly though, not to be.<br>Still the game looks amazing running on the Unreal 3 engine. Huge vistas and excellent graphical effects really do make Stygia a convincing planet. That is also another point, Stygia really does feel like a failed utopia. Enciroments vary greatly with overgrown cities to mountains to sewers to industrial plants mean you never play through the same environment too much<br>Story wise however things aren&apos;t so great, Grayson Hunt just feels like a loudmouthed delinquent version of Marcus Fenix, Ishi (his robo buddy) is the only one who actually has a believible backstory, a soldier implanted with technology to save his life after the crash, only to have to battle it for control of his body. However his dialogue is just plain awful, it&apos;s not even cheesy it&apos;s just crap. With lines like &quot;Yes Gray, I will kill them all&quot; in some fake robot voice. And that can be said for a lot of the dialogue in Bulletstorm, the game over uses swearing and dick jokes with lines like &quot;What the dick?!&quot; and &quot;holy dick!&quot; . Don&apos;t get me wrong I&apos;m all for swearing and innuendos in games but not when every other sentence in the game is a dick joke (I&apos;m not even joking)<br>After you beat the campaign which is quite long might I add. There is anarchy mode, this is like horde only it isn&apos;t very hard and in some tiny arena while you fight the same easily defeatable enemys over and over. Anarchy gets stale very quickly, there is also an extreme lack of any features really. You can customise your leash colour, PMC skin and armour. That&apos;s it and it&apos;s not even really fun to play even with friends as it requires no teamwork at all. The very best you can do to get a laugh out of this is to do a Darth Vader style hold with the leash.<br>There&apos;s also echoes mode which takes the best bits of the single player and puts them in a time trial style test with a leaderboard. But again this quickly gets boring and after a while there&apos;s no reason to play it. In addition, the story is forgettable and the ending is just pointless, unnessecary sequel bait.<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I don&apos;t hate this game. It&apos;s not the worst game ever. Some of the guns are fun to use and sometimes the jokes are funny (SOMETIMES!). But I just got bored with this and it been on my shelf for a few months now.<br>Pros:<br>Fun guns<br>Graphics<br>Humour(if it&apos;s your thing)<br>Cons: Forgettable story and characters<br>No replay value<br>Boring additional modes<br>Lame ending<br>Terrible dialogue</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2013698">Expand</a></span>

The game-play feels allot like a First person Gears Of War with a style that is more insane than Borderlands. Its unique skill shot combined with the amazing guns gives an awesome and huge number of possible killing combinations. This will give you a new look on the FPS genre and bring a healthy change to the normal modern day shooters that flood the market currently. You will get many hours of fun from completing challenges and gaining achievements while enjoying an insane and over the top style game-play, scenery and audio. But there is a downside to this game as the Multiplayer is much to be desired, Being the challenges with others just lowering the difficulties and making combo moves more and more difficult with more people in the lobbies. I constantly found my kills being stolen and my combos being interrupted. The story is much to be desired as there is allot that goes unexplained and allot not explained well, This in the dark or need to know style of story telling didn&apos;t fit well with me and I stopped playing this game rather quickly. Would I recommend this yes I would it is entertaining and fresh but only if you have a large pocket of disposable income as it will not last long and gives around 2 - 3 months of fun before it for lack of a better term gets old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2281648">Expand</a></span>

When I saw the trailer for this game I was genuinely exited. I thought, OMG someone gets it, this is going to be the Unreal/Quake revival era of FPSs. Everything seemed to indicate they were making a similar fast phased/total destruction/chaos frantic FPS with a Sci-Fi Space theme that doesn&apos;t take himself too seriously. Theoretically, that&apos;s what Bulletstorm &quot;is&quot; or tried to do. Unfortunately I have to say it did fall a bit short of the hyped up expectations, but you also have to consider that it had some big shoes to fill. I mean this game was marketed towards the old Quake/Unreal fans, the classic FPS players (like me) that were craving for a good fast phased chaotic FPS like old times. While Bulletstorm is definitely in that ballpark, doesn&apos;t live quiet to the standards set by the old timers. Too many cut scenes, that while fun, they end up breaking the continuity of the game. Again, something that old FPSs didn&apos;t have. The campaign is incredibly fun, the art and graphics are beautiful, SPECIALLY if played in 3D Vision. The controls and mechanics were as expected and I was quite pleased with them, very responsive, fast phased and with that old Unreal/Quake touch (in a way, not entirely). Conclusion: Bulletstorm definitely breaks the mold of today&apos;s FPSs and &quot;tries&quot; to take you back to the old glorious days of campaign centered, fast phased, chaotic FPSs. Definitely better than any of the current &quot;junk FPSs&quot; like CoD, MW, etc, etc that kids like today. BUT, unfortunately, it&apos;s not a revival of Quake or Unreal, which is what most of us expected, the idea is there tough, so good hopes for the future of this franchise. Overall the game is very fun and well worth the price tag at launch, let alone the lower prices it&apos;s going for today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682395">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It starts off pretty slowly and honestly I wasn&apos;t enjoying it that much in the beginning, but it really does get better and better as it goes on and by the end I had fallen somewhat in love with it, in big part due to the characters which were just fantastic, all voiced very well with some brilliant and frankly offensive dialog that I just loved, it&apos;s not often you get a game filled with such language that actually pulls it off well instead of just being cringey. All the main characters really felt alive and it really helped push the story along, you didn&apos;t just feel like you were mowing down enemies for no reason, you knew their motivation and you wanted to help them get the job done.
<br>
<br>The combat itself was solid, sure the enemies were a bit bullet spongy but the weapons were all enjoyable to use and the enemies had decent variety. There were so many unique and fun ways to kill that it never got boring.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;m shocked how much I enjoyed it by the end as it started off really average IMO but it just kept on improving and the ending was well done. If it had been a better port I would have given it an 8/10, but they really did do the bare minimum. I highly recommend picking it up in the next sale, add it to isthereanydeal right now!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=6569888">Expand</a></span>

On one hand, the overpowered, foulmouthed, muscular heroes are reminiscent of Duke Nukem or Serious Sam (which is a good thing.) It&apos;s nice, after the stale Call Of Duty clone black hole games are falling into, to have something that feels like a throwback while still using beautiful graphics and fun, innovative gameplay.<br><br>The skillshot system is very fun, although the player tends to lapse into the same few kills over and over. The weapons are not hugely diverse, but there are still enough of them to bring several different tactics to the table. The environments are gorgeous, and the enemies and gore are plentiful.<br><br>Arguably the worst thing about Bulletstorm is that it is a console port - and it feels like one. The control scheme is very minimal and uses some rather odd configurations (like using space rather than enter in the menus) but you get used to it. Interestingly enough it borrows (or perhaps loaned) a few different moves from the upcoming Crysis 2, such as kicking and sliding, but I actually prefer the way Bulletstorm does it. The other big complaint is the cutscenes- there is a lot of pre-scripted action where you lose control, as well as key events that actually freeze the game until you do what you&apos;re told in an attempt to avoid that cutscene feeling and force interaction.<br><br>I don&apos;t personally consider Bulletstorm to be worth a full $60, but the game is still very, very fun, despite its flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1536018">Expand</a></span>

All you do the entire game is running through a level, kill everyone the most &quot;intuitive&quot; way and run again. You never re-visit an area, you never familiarize yourself with the environment, nothing your &quot;learn&quot; is of any use.
<br>
<br>It was indeed interesting to play and many times, I was just like &quot;Wooah!&quot;, but this quickly became boring. The ending was the most disappointing part. I expected something like &quot;Hardcore mode unlocked&quot; or such, but all I got was the &quot;Echo&quot; mode, which was basically just a &quot;high-score hunt&quot;.
<br>
<br>To summarize this: Bulletstorm is a nice and exciting shooter and definately something new with its &quot;over the top and even more&quot;-kills, but it&apos;s lack of depth, dynamics and content, which was just replaced by &quot;f**k&quot;, &quot;s**t&quot;, &quot;m****r**c**r&quot; and what not else, really reduced the fun of this game.
<br>I&apos;d only recommend Bulletstorm if you&apos;re really a fan of slaughtering and don&apos;t care about story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2488841">Expand</a></span>

I found the Skillshot to be very enjoyable and the fact that you can remap all your buttons a added bonus so any review that complains about the controls needs to be marked down. I did find the story to perhaps be a little bit thin as if made out of crackers but that was made up for with the amount of action presented almost right away. I did feel a little to overpowered sometimes like I was on a playground hitting little kids with golfclubs while they were throwing balls of cotton at me. All in all this game is worth the price of admission.

Even the cursing seemed as if it was either translated or curse words given to a 5year old to memorize and make a sentence with. Multiplayer has ZERO chat function via keyboard so unless you&apos;re telepathic, good luck getting people to understand what it means to wave your gun towards a target. Out of the box, it has NO startup screen forcing new players to download a completely new interface in order to verify your game and download 2 patches from dial-up servers on the MOON! It took a week of searching forums to find the way to completely install the game to play it. While PCF (People Can Fly) make great gore and gibs with slo-mo effects, that&apos;s pretty much where they&apos;re skill ends. An absolute waste of money. I really tried hard at getting my $60 worth, but with no way to talk to other players via the keyboard,  and a slow acceptance of people that would consider using voice chat to talk to strangers, this was a serious disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1718148">Expand</a></span>

The first thing about this game that guided me down the road to realizing it was a bad port was the necessity of signing into Games for Windows LIVE to play it. This isn&apos;t 2005, nobody uses that anymore. Use Steam. Secondly, and this was big for me, sniping is broke. You can&apos;t &quot;free snipe&quot; as you have to lock on to someone (the person you want to snipe) if you want to fire. And i found out that sometimes it doesnt lock on to anyone, especially on the later levels. Third, the story, though a decent length, still isn&apos;t something to marvel over and could have been longer. Multiplayer is boring and not worth your time. And on a side note, don&apos;t blame pirates for your game not selling well. Blame the **** job you did porting it over to PC. Now go sit in a corner and go think about what you&apos;ve done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2299714">Expand</a></span>

Kill with Skill, why nobody had done this before? Although pretty blunt and really fun, this is the true successor of the late Duke Nukem. As weapons are quite different and as you choose from a selection at start-up, the game has a good replay value so you can start by choosing different weapons such as for instance the head trap of the Saw movie (and make it explode). Or take fireworks to see the guys fly and explode into beautiful sparks. Each impact on the enemy is managed as well so you can shoot any parts of the body and have a different reactions (and various bonuses). The game is not too repetitive either in terms of worlds and different enemies, and there&apos;s a background story to discover. In short, a game very cool game to let loose!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816281">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll never pick this up again due to the ridiculous amount of bugs I encountered. Before the plant boss Tesheka* got stuck on stairs, that I had to glitch myself through. Then, I had to glitch myself through a branch that is supposed to be climbed over. Then, after beating the boss and spending a good 10 minutes on it, I was completely bugged and couldn&apos;t move on. Tesheka* followed me around the huge empty hole where the boss died, and I could not move forward with the game. This game can collect dust for all I care, and the only reason I&apos;m giving it a 2 and not a 1 is the semi-fun gameplay. The overused curse words, and stupid puns got old after chapter 3.

The skill shot system seems like a pretty cool idea at first, but the repetition shows itself more quickly than you might like. The enemies act like they&apos;re waiting to get slaughtered by your ever repeating kicks and leash attacks, the difficulty settings don&apos;t seem to change anything at all.<br>The story and storytelling are atrocious. It seems like the developers just didn&apos;t give a **** about an interesting and exciting story, bad clich&#xC3;&#xA9;s get followed by even more clich&#xC3;&#xA9;s. The game tries to take itself serious, which fails horribly. Unnecessary cut scenes which often contain boring quick time events, pop up every two minutes and interrupt the shallow run and gun game-play.<br><br>Bulletstorm does not deserve the praise it gets from all the big reviewers, and its definitely not worth the high price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2291413">Expand</a></span>

Yes, there is a bit of repetition but that&apos;s a weakness with any shooter. Due to that and the rather limited MP aspect, I can&apos;t give &quot;Bulletstorm&quot; a perfect score. But I would rate it right up there with the first &quot;Halo&quot;, or the first &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; release. Those weren&apos;t perfect either but both introduced a fresh style of play that rocked the gaming frontiers of their day.

To get the obvious out of the way, sound, grafics and level design are superb, among the best you will find in any game. It&apos;s incredible with how much detail the levels are designed, which tend to be very colorful and atmospheric.<br><br>But what makes Bulletstorm truly great is it&apos;s gameplay. Take the fast paced action of Unreal and Quake, and mix it with hefty dose of Street Fighter 4&apos;s intricate strategies and combos and this is what you get. Instead of just sitting behind cover and dispatching one enemy after another, the game actively encourages you to setup devastating skillshots that can obliterate entire groups of enemies with a single shot. Each encounter is a puzzle to solve in the most efficient and brutal way.<br><br>Bulletstorm is just as much a twitch action game as it is a thinking man&apos;s game. Bulletstorm is very fresh in it&apos;s approach, but at the same time also very oldschool with it&apos;s arcade like approach, where it&apos;s not just about winning, but winning with style and getting the biggest highscore.<br><br>Bulletstorm is truly a gamer&apos;s game, much more than any Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield or Killzone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488022">Expand</a></span>

This game reminds me of Dr. Rockso the Rock n&apos; Roll Clown.<br><br>Bulletstorm is just another shooter trying to differentiate itself by trying to seem edgy. Instead, it ends up being corny and kind of embarrassing. The question is never about graphics. The real question is how does this game differentiate itself from other shooters?  What features does it offer that haven&apos;t couldn&apos;t just be a clever mod for Quake 2?<br>The answer: Nothing really. Story doesn&apos;t make up for putting a month of modelling effort into some new guns and terrain. This stuff is cheap to produce. It&apos;s the complex and innovative rules and game mechanics that push the envelope.  Something Bulletstorm doesn&apos;t even come close to doing with it&apos;s messy hair and only-big-boys-can-act-bad (for kids) attitude.<br><br>This game isn&apos;t very good, I feel weird listening to the dialogue and the action is over the top in such a way that it&apos;s bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1550776">Expand</a></span>

Game is hands down BEAUTIFUL as far as graphics, every set piece is well designed and simply awe inspiring. As far as story goes, pretty straight forward, you&apos;re a space pirate formerly part of an elite military squadron that went rogue when you find out that your commanding superior is just a straight up dick. Some time later, You being a drunk space pirate, decided to take on your former commanders battleship with your puny pirate spaceship, therefore crashing both ships into a deserted resort planet run by former prison inmates who built the resort. The beauty of the game comes in the form of its &quot;SKILL SHOT&quot; system in which you find the most creative ways to kill your enemies, whether you leash them with your whip, shoot them in mid-flight and proceed to kick them into an environmental hazard such as giant cacti, huge walls of rebar, or explosive barrels. I found myself barely shooting my gun and using the leash and boot as the most effective yet hilarious ways of dispatching my foes...As far as the enemy AI goes, they&apos;re dumber than a box of bricks but I imagine the enemy AI is purely there for you to destroy them as many ways as possible. The games path itself is very linear, and does not allow for any stray paths, you are pretty much just running from place to place with dialogue scenes in-between that tense up the story. The ending itself is very weak, but it leaves it wide open for a sequel. As far as replay value goes, its very high for a short time, until you unlock all skill shots, and it just gets boring, the MP is very limited and doesn&apos;t offer much more excitement, especially when you can only advance if your teammates cooperate in &quot;team skillshots&quot;. I give this game a 7 because of its intuitive and genuinely fun gameplay mechanics, it lost points because of a weak MP portion and the replay value of killing your enemies in a number of ways DOES grow old, no matter what all the &quot;PRO BULLETSTORMers&quot; say..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1596493">Expand</a></span>

The biggest selling points for the game, being the &quot;leash&quot; and &quot;kick&quot; abilities are amusing but sadly not fun enough - or useful enough - to hold your interest throughout the duration of the game. These two features were initially touted to be crucial to gameplay, promising endless and creative kill combinations but sadly end up being for the most part mildy useful &quot;utilities&quot;. Gameplay is your typical arcade-esque action shooter spliced with regular cut-scenes and well-scripted boss events, which are entertaining but not incredibly involving. Action is very comic-book oriented with exaggerated gore, massive ammo-clips and plenty of dismemberment all combined with a bus-load of profanity, corny catch-phrases and even momma jokes. The much hyped leash enables you to execute some interesting kills and awards you points (skillshots) for creatively slaying your enemies. There are many award kills you can obtain, but unfortunately sometimes I found they did not register. I particularly enjoyed running into a mob, pulling them one-by-one though the air towards me,  removing their heads, then booting them off a precipe or impaling them onto a set of conveniently placed spikes. The moderate selection of guns are limited but fun to use - mowing down a group a punks with a minigun and watching them quickly turn to gibs and detached limbs is a guilty pleasure, and one you&apos;ll indulge in often. There is of course a gun sight but it aint really that useful - with most guns you can pretty much get the job done with the standard reticle and ignore the sights altogether. Level design is clever and thoughtful, but unfortunately completely linear and filled to the brim with invisible barriers. There were annoying instances where I got stuck on the edge of a 2 foot-high ramp and and couldn&apos;t drop to the floor - which as you would understand caused me to swallow a few loud curses of frustration. These sort of things become a problem when no jump button is available, only a keypress to leap over preset obstacles. Graphics are a definate strongpoint of Bulletstorm and the game regularly places beautiful vistas with massive draw distances in front of your eyes. You will notice the Unreal engine at work immediately, and while it&apos;s starting to show its age it still never fails to impress. Eyecandy is everywhere from huge river gorges, detailed alien cities, gloomy caves, dusty mines and flashy spacecraft interiors. Colors are vibrant and textures are sharp, along with fluid character animations and of course plenty of colourful blood to splash over it all. There is never a scenario where the game looks dull. It&apos;s a shame the &quot;corridors&quot; of linear gameplay are so restrictive.. it would have been nice to explore some of that scenery further. The multiplayer is a basic, but rather suitable affair consisting of two modes, &apos;Anarchy&apos; and &apos;Echo&apos;. Anarchy mode is similar Gears of War 2&apos;s Horde mode. You and three other players fight off increasingly difficult waves of enemies trying to get the highest &apos;skillshot&apos;. Echo mode is a solitary affair. It lets you play through the single-player map of your choice trying to get the highest score possible. The scores are then posted on a leaderboard in which you can compare with all your friends. Multiplayer lacks options and depth but is still fun to play and meshes with this type of game nicely. In conclusion I think I expected too much from this game and can&apos;t help reflect my disappointment in this review. Its 9 or so hours of gameplay are still enjoyable but never provide you with a feeling of accomplishment or even inspiration to keep playing. The boss fights are always something to look forward to and the story meanders between interesting and cheesy,  but I still enjoyed it enough to recommend it. If you need a break from your try-hard realistic shooters and are looking for something a little more colorful  and offbeat, then Bulletstorm will undoubtedly be just for you.  Just don&apos;t expect the game-changing experience it promised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1487048">Expand</a></span>

I have to say though, there were some really amazing and extremely fun parts to this game.  From controlling a robot dinosaur and running from a giant wheel, well, there are definitely kick butt aspects to what this game &apos;can&apos; deliver.  I didn&apos;t like how the Leash has to be charged to use the Thumper, and also that the upgrade system for guns seemed grindy as well as having to buy ammo.  I think that the XBOX live culture is encouraging the achievement obsession way too much and this is getting into games in all the wrong ways.  It definitely didn&apos;t sever Bulletstorm that well.  It&apos;s funny for a while to get some of the achievements in this game, and to also punish your enemies with world objects, but in the end that is the whole game.  It is too much of the shooting and not enough of the mind blowing game play I was hoping for.  The most annoying part was the teenage immature types of voice overs you keep having to listen to over and over again.  I mean really it gets old after the first few times, and yet you are stuck with a Duke Nukem wanna be.   This game could have been way better, perhaps the sequel will deliver.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1491356">Expand</a></span>

Theres not much I can fault with Bulletstorm. The engine doesn&apos;t run quite as fast as it should but without any AA and on highest settings it still easily keeps at 60 on just a 6850/70. It looks great, nothing insane but some nice views and good effects, the story is solid, nothing ridiculous but it still has one which is better then most gameplay oriented games already. Then we come to the gameplay, this is where Bulletstorm shines, there really is nothing like it out there, if I were to compare i&apos;d say Bioshock 1, simply cause of the huge amount of options you have when it comes to destroying your enemies, but Bulletstorm takes it a step further adding a &apos;rating&apos; system that allows good soldiers to restock and bad ones to die. The more interesting your skillshots the more ammo and weapons you can buy. The guns are crazy, 4 barrel shotgun for example, and their charge shots are a load of fun, lots of environment kills as well and some epic boss battles.<br>The game also has an Echo mode where you can replay the most action packed fight scenes for points to compete on leaderboards, and it also has an Anarchy mode which is up to 4 player co-op fighting against waves.<br>I finished the game on normal, then immediately played all the echo missions then finished the game again on the hardest, and enjoyed every second the gameplay is that enjoyable that it last through 2.5 playthroughs without any break in between. In summary you have the best combat of any game i&apos;ve ever played wrapped up in a decent story with a decent graphics engine and a very solid frustration free experience. One of my top 10 games for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1562793">Expand</a></span>

The story is downright boring, and the graphics are less than marvellous, but the game is fun for one key reason, humour. This game is hilarious, and the kill with skill feature only adds to the hilarity, characters will constantly make smart ass jokes and make fun of each other with actual wit, I had a couple of burst out laughing moments a few times in this game. And if your a fan of Epic&apos;s previous games such as Gears of War, you&apos;ll feel pretty much at home here, with their trademark Unreal Engine in full effect, the blood coming from enemies torn torsos looks almost identical to that if you were cutting a locust in half with a chainsaw (although a bit brighter in Bulletstorm). I&apos;d like to describe this game as a &quot;Funnier, more happy approach to Gears of War&quot;, and thats what you can expect buying Bulletstorm.<br><br>Final notes: Fun game with lots of Humour and blood, perfect for any action junky who likes a good laugh, bad for everyone else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694674">Expand</a></span>

<br>The cut scenes could be enjoyable if the plot and characters were good but it&apos;s the exact opposite.
<br>
<br>The way of killing enemies doesn&apos;t sound creative to me. Basically, Dead Space or The Darkness II allows player to kill enemies in a more creative manner, yet they never pop up those stupid words and scores again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=4432959">Expand</a></span>

The team based MP mode is a lot of fun too. It changes up the rules by reward players for cooperating. Fantastic!</span>

I play games through STEAM all the time and don&apos;t have any issues, how is it that Games for Windows Live can cause so many crashes.  I tried to play it all the way through, but uninstalled it after about an hour.  Don&apos;t waste your money.  Any game that uses Games for Windows Live is an immediate deal breaker for me.</span>

I had heard people saying the storyline was weak and that the gameplay was boring. However, I found the game to be hugely entertaining. The point system made you want to play in a different way to how you would normally on an FPS. The pacing of how certain weapons got introduced was nice, allowing new weapons to be discovered right until the end, keeping experimentation alive. The on-screen HUD was also a nice touch, allowing you to never be too confused. I also found the humour placed between the characters funny, and not too stupid. On the other hand though, the controls for the PC were a little clunky - I wasn&apos;t able to jump over a wall that easily here and there, but nothing that truly frustrated me. The story was shorter than you might expect - about 9 hours of play, not always as long as some game campaigns are. Also, the story wasn&apos;t as strong as it could have been, I wasn&apos;t always entirely sure who was attacking me and why. Though, it mattered little as the plot of the whole game was clear, and the on-going action-packed scenes of gameplay, from a bursting dam to a toppling building to a huge dinosaur, were extremely fun to play. I would recommend this game to anyone thinking about buying it, especially as it is now selling online and in-stores cheaply - rarely above &#xC2;&#xA3;10 (Or $15). Great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2287358">Expand</a></span>

When I begun playing it it seemed like a standard first person shooter, but later events in the game convinced me that this is indeed a bit different from the rest. The game play is borderline survival, kind of like left4dead, because hoards of enemy attack you and you have to kill them fast before they kill you, but you are free to use your reflexes to spot pieces of the environment and your own tactics and gun skills to kill them in gruesome ways. The are bombs, cactuses, throwing off cliffs, electrocution, headshots, sniping, bombing, dropping things on them, kicking them into plants ect ect ect. But you do this at such a fast pace that blood and pieces of enemy splatter everywhere. There are also different types of enemies, ones that charge, one&apos;s that carry assault rifles, ones that ride helicopters, and even one&apos;s that attempt to strap bombs on you and blow you up. Anyway, it&apos;s all very fast paced and fun.<br><br>The one thing I like the most is that it is very runnable. I am playing it at 60fps with 8xaa on an aging quad core processor! I am glad that I do not have to upgrade anytime soon; and also a wireless xbox360 controller works like a charm, it even shows the buttons on screen and everything. The Storyline is linear...but like I said if you compare it to a game like l4d, which is also very linear, true, bu the sole purpose is to survive, same to some extent with this game, but made easier by upgrades as you go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490140">Expand</a></span>

It has plenty of ups and downs but nitpicking at a game like this doesn&apos;t get you anywhere. You can enjoy it regardless.<br><br>I&apos;ll start off by saying that the graphics are pretty awesome. The game looks pretty surreal at times. Seeing an entire city along with a sublime-looking sky with celestial bodies floating in the sky (like nearby planets) never gets old; and you usually get time to sit and stare at it all, regardless of how fast-paced and hectic this game is. You&apos;ll be trudging through a dark sewer then you finally come out of an opening to the outside world and are greeted with a refreshing, atmospheric vista.<br><br><br>Anyway, on to gameplay. Bulletstorm is definitely a run-and-gun style game, but anyone who bought this game thinking otherwise should have researched it some more. It was blatantly obvious when they originally showed it at E3. The skillshot system is actually very fun to use, but I feel that it was too forced. The only way to play effectively is to kick bad guys in to environmental hazards or do fancier things like shoot an explosive flail on one bad guy and blow up a group of them with it. It&apos;s honestly very sloppy at times. You might fire a cannonball from the bouncer in to a huge crowd of enemies and end up inadvertently unlocking 3 new skill shots at once while racking up hundreds of skill points. The only way to enjoy this game is to acquire skill points then stop at one of the many drop pods that are littered throughout the levels to buy ammo and upgrade your guns. These menus are simple enough to navigate, but it really kills the pace at times. You can literally access a drop pod in the middle of a massive battle and it just pauses the game for you while you buy a bunch of ammo and charge shots. In my opinion, this tends to break the continuity of the game. This game smells of console port, but I honestly stopped caring about that ages ago since it&apos;s so common. The only thing I dislike is how you&apos;re limited to carrying 3 weapons at once, and the assault rifle (which is useless) can&apos;t be exchanged for a different weapon. Trying to kill a guy with conventional bullets in this game is about as effective as shooting someone with raisins, it just doesn&apos;t kill them. The charge shot on the rifle is good, but it&apos;s boring. It&apos;s just a perfectly-accurate, disintegrating round that kills any normal enemy in one hit. You have to stop by a drop pod if you want to exchange weapons, unless a special enemy drops the one you want (which isn&apos;t too often).<br><br>The skillshot database is also a bit annoying because you have to bring it up constantly to review any new skill shots you&apos;ve unlocked so you can earn enough points to keep your guns loaded. If you play on easy it&apos;s not really difficult to do this.<br><br>Another little issue I had with this game was with the quick time events where you have to hold the E key at specific points in the game to focus in on an event that&apos;s occurring. If you react quick enough, you are rewarded with 500 skill points. The points are nice, but it interferes with gameplay, and they throw these quick time events at you like every 5 minutes and it gets really annoying after the 3rd time. You can choose to ignore it, but you don&apos;t get any points.<br><br><br>But like I said, nitpicking doesn&apos;t get you anywhere with a game like Bulletstorm. All in all it&apos;s a decent game. It wasn&apos;t worth $60 when it first came out, but It&apos;s only $20 on Steam now, so anyone who&apos;s considering trying it shouldn&apos;t be worried about spending too much money. There&apos;s a demo available on Steam as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1767723">Expand</a></span>

Such as controlling a mechazilla and many, many gatling guns which prevent most of the kills to be achieved anyway. After the first-half, you are invested and likely slosh through the rest of the game when you&apos;ve paid $60 for it.<br><br>The characters were awful, the script made zero sense-- even for an FPS-- and the liberal language was entirely unnecessary.

Everything from linear levels with no exploring ability, health regen, sprint to aimdownsights is present in here. It doesn&apos;t differ from Call of Duty in anyway except the aesthetics. Gameplay is from Call of Duty.

<br>Highly recommend staying away from this.</span>

The story is quite original, as are the weapons and enemies. I thought the new skillshot system pretty much addressed the deep-down desires of everyone who ever played an FPS (c&apos;mon, who doesn&apos;t aim for the balls at least once?), and the addition of environmental hazards is a great cause of many &quot;f-yeah!&quot; moments. Where Bulletstorm loses points from me is the fact that there simply aren&apos;t enough things to shoot! I played through several levels where I encountered maybe two major fights, and spent the rest of the time listening to dialogue, walking, and responding to quick-time events. Not only does this make the entire fancy-pants skillshot system feel like a bit of a waste, but it also really breaks the immersion: You&apos;re on a planet populated by an endless mutant horde, but only 50 of them can be arsed to come after you? Then there&apos;s the cramped level design, which I suppose is necessary for the environmental kills, but it still would have been nice to have some large, arena-type areas as well. The game does feature some beautiful, expansive cityscapes...but you&apos;re always seeing them from some narrow pathway. I mentioned that the story is original, but it tends to wrangle control from you much too often with quick-time events and &quot;ooh, look at that!&quot; moments. Seriously guys, your game&apos;s motto is &quot;kill with skill&quot;, not &quot;skillfully push buttons when we say so&quot;.
<br>
<br>Despite it&apos;s flaws, I&apos;d recommend Bulletstorm. We need more games like this, with a sense of humour about themselves and which reward you for shooting things in the ass :p</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488175">Expand</a></span>

I purchased the Prima guide and reviewed it before and during the game and was able to get a lot more out of the game than I would have otherwise. Those who are giving this game a low rating are probably just rushing from point A to point B so fast that you can&apos;t possibly appreciate all of the differences and subtle nuances. Plus...the guide helps with Skillshots, Collectibles and Achievements. How about looking for the good in something rather than always looking for the bad? I really liked this game including the crude humor. I think it&apos;s a solid 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1487789">Expand</a></span>

I like the skillshot system, it pushed me to achieve more interesting kills and while doing so it let me buy more fun ammunition to use on the enemies. Basically just a cycle of fun :) My advice: try to achieve as many skillshots to get the most out of this game. I could see the game getting repetitive if you sat down to beat it in one sitting, however I played it in several 1-2 hours sessions and I never grew bored. I will go back later in time and beat this game again. Exciting enemies and boss fights, fun weapons and hilarious characters. A very good and fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570757">Expand</a></span>
