I even created a Metacritic account to write a review.  This game presents itself as a suspense/mystery/thriller.  Even the trailers indicated such.  My boyfriend got me this game for Christmas, because I had been interested in trying it out.
<br>
<br>It starts out with a creepy feeling, what with the music and the storm.  The house looks like it was ransacked.  The lights flicker.  The house creaks.  No one is home, and you don&apos;t know where anyone is.  You find out your father had a psychopath for an uncle, and it might possibly run in the family.  Your mother is on the verge of having an affair. The house might even be haunted!  All of these are the ingredients for a perfect casual mystery thriller.  But no, this ends up being a young lesbian love story, and a pretty stupid one at that.  The house isn&apos;t haunted, your father is completely sane, your parents are in couples therapy, and your teenage sister just ran off with her lover.
<br>
<br>It was a complete waste of two hours, in my opinion.  I only gave it a &quot;1&quot; because I finished it.  Silly me, I thought the story would develop further than it did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3887642">Expand</a></span>

And I&apos;m going to leave it spoiler-less so people won&apos;t be inclined to skip it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m seeing a lot of hemming and hawing in this review thread about why &quot;professional&quot; reviewers were going nutso over this game. I think I can boil it down to two things: Nostalgia and Originality. These are great qualities in a game, but this game relies almost entirely on them.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also seeing a lot of talk on here about the gameplay being &quot;non-gameplay&quot;. It&apos;s an adventure game  they don&apos;t traditionally rely greatly on twitch or other tired game types. And it clearly doesn&apos;t want to be a game like that. In fact, the game does a pretty good job at being simply an adventure game, in that it unfolds in front of you and gives you plenty to interact with.
<br>
<br>Where that falls short is that there are no interesting puzzles in the game at all. No head scratchers, nothing you even have to figure out on your own. It&apos;s not Myst, not even close. It had plenty of opportunity to be that kind of game, but I think the developers were more interested in telling their story.
<br>
<br>Of course, I&apos;d even be fine with that (a la Heavy Rain), but it fails miserably at being an interesting story. It&apos;s true that it&apos;s not a story you often see depicted in video games, but it&apos;s been done to  in Hollywood and literature for decades. The climax itself is so trite and overdone it&apos;s almost laughable. The game tries to look at you with this wry smile like, &quot;Aren&apos;t we bold and interesting? Look how progressive we are!&quot; to which I just shake my head in confusion.
<br>
<br>And the length? When I finished the game, Steam smirkingly showed that I had done so in 99 minutes. By my math, that&apos;s about $0.20/min. Parking in San Francisco is cheaper than that, and at least I&apos;d see more interesting things wandering around the city for an hour and a half than I did wandering around this game.
<br>
<br>I promise you&apos;re not missing anything here. Wait for a Steam sale if you must, but I promise your money is better spent on just about anything else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447977">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have no problem with games that are nothing more than interactive stories.  The Walking Dead game by Telltale Games is phenomenal and does the genre the correct way.   Gone Home falls flat because there is no reason to play the game more than once and it does an awful job of getting the player to care about the people that are NEVER seen in the game.  It&apos;s intriguing at first, but the story is hackneyed and presented poorly.  Without posting any spoilers, I can say that the &quot;build-up&quot; in the story is completely wasted by the ending.  It&apos;s a shame too, because with better writing, this game could have been terrific.  As it is, there is no reason to care about the characters.
<br>
<br>My other beef with Gone Home is the $20 price tag:  Massive ripoff.  The Walking Dead games were $5 per episode and a single episode is longer than Gone Home.  I explored the game carefully and still finished in 2 hours.  I could go back and look for the hidden doors, but I have NO motivation to do so, as it doesn&apos;t change the story.
<br>
<br>Instead of wasting money on this story, try one of the better done interactive stories, such as The Walking Dead or Dear Ester.  Even the point and click adventures of the late 90&apos;s (like King&apos;s Quest series) had better storytelling and re-playability than Gone Home.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3471688">Expand</a></span>

Your local library also most likely has a bunch of sappy teenage romance novellas that you can read for free. It&apos;s not that I hate a good story  Silent Hill 2 is a game that combines excellent, moving storytelling with a chilling atmosphere  but this is amateur, cringeworthy nonsense. When she said &quot;the morning sunshine is the saddest thing I&apos;ve ever seen,&quot; I had to hit the mute button. It is extremely hard to feel sympathetic towards a character that does absolutely nothing but whine, whine, whine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3448444">Expand</a></span>

You would think that this would be exciting and riveting if the mystery solving didn&apos;t focus on walking around a poorly designed house reading notes because, well, that&apos;s all there is to Gone Home. It&apos;s simply a hour of you walking around a house, rummaging through cabinets and drawers, discovering poorly hidden secret passages that, if found prematurely, can make the game as short as 45 seconds.
<br>
<br>It tries hard to tell a interesting story  which it does succeed in one point, the voice acting, which is the best part of the entire &quot;game&quot;. The other point is the completely forced story involving a closet lesbian finding out her true self. The game tries to be subtle, but it manages that as well as someone trying to hide a blood stain on a dress with ketchup.
<br>
<br>The game simply does not hold up to the raving reviews it is receiving by critics across the board. It doesn&apos;t captivate you emotionally, it isn&apos;t entertaining, and it sure as hell is not worth $20 dollars.
<br>
<br>Yes, a game that can be completed in less than 45 seconds, that consists of nothing more than walking and turning on lights, is worth $20 dollars.
<br>
<br>20 AMERICAN DOLLARS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3457032">Expand</a></span>

This &quot;game&quot; is a supreme disappointment. Like a lot of indie titles, it has great promise at the start: interesting and novel storyline, realistic characters...that quickly dissolves into the player wishing that a larger game company would have come along and taken over the game so it could live up to it&apos;s potential.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Great voice acting and interesting characters.
<br>- A big, empty house to explore with lots of attention paid to the design of the objects you can pick up
<br>....
<br>Cons:
<br>- A storyline that starts out with promise and fizzles quickly into a dull, anticlimactic ending that seems rushed and devoid of any real tension.
<br>- Character stories that go nowhere and have zero closure.
<br>- No real scariness or tension, even though there was plenty of potential for it.
<br>- Overly simplistic gameplay.  Actually, you can&apos;t call it gameplay. It&apos;s more like you are walking through a storyline picking up pieces of the narrative as you go. You can look at objects but rarely do they serve any additional purpose.
<br>- A VERY SHORT GAME THAT IS OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT IS!
<br>
<br>You should buy this for $5 max. Seriously, you will be done with it in 2 hours and kick yourself for having paid any more for it.
<br>
<br>P.S. I loathed Dear Esther, and this is just a couple steps above.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599698">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s at this point that I mention how most indie games last more than that time and often sell for less. It&apos;s insulting to sell a game at this price for it&apos;s length. It tries to excuse itself from this by stating that it&apos;s a story driven game, when the only thing of note in this generic drama, and the reason why everyone is giving it high scores, is because the main character is female and lesbian.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise, the game is a first person &apos;Adventure&apos; game. You arrive at your house, your family has apparently gone missing and you must uncover the mystery behind it. Now, I like games with mysteries, I like exploring environments and finding clues and reaching a conclusion that is correct and won&apos;t direct me to the bad ending (Or just be wrong and give me some penalty) but with this game, the writing was awkward and it felt like reading a generic drama. The only difference was that it took time to turn the page because you had to search for the next one in the house, which is the reason why this is called a &apos;game&apos;.
<br>
<br>Graphics are okay. I don&apos;t judge games based on graphics, but considering the short duration of this game and poor story it&apos;s something I have to point out. It&apos;s an Indie game with good graphics and that at least pulls the score up a bit from the effort that was put on that front.
<br>
<br>However, this game has no replayability. Nothing changes when you replay the game, and if you check a certain wall the moment the game starts you can finish the game within 47 seconds of starting it.
<br>
<br>The thing that bothers me the most about this game though, is how it has a Metascore of 90 for a game that isn&apos;t a game, for as much as one may praise a story and like story driven games, lasting two hours isn&apos;t an excuse when you charge 20 bucks for it. Want a good story driven game? You can buy the Soul Reaver story arch and Defiance from the Legacy of Kain series from the same price as this game, Three games lasting at least 8 to 10 hours each with proper voice acting and a compelling story. That amounts to 24-30 hours of gameplay for around 20 bucks, compared to 47 seconds-2 hours of gameplay for 20 bucks. Make your choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447924">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The length if the game, with each and every stone turned, everything read, every cassette heard was exact 2 hours. The graphics are bearable, but not very good. The atmosphere is a little bit spooky, but otherwise it&apos;s just an old house with tons of cups, pens and rooms. While every review tells you it is not a puzzle game, it is: search for the next key to unlock the next door. A key might be a special year as a lock combination or just a key.
<br>
<br>So: nice story, super short, old graphics, absolut not replayable (except hearing the message machine again). For 5$ I would have said: yes, it&apos;s an interactive (very) short story. Let&apos;s give it 7/10. But for 20$ on Steam this is a joke. Compare it to true storytelling treasures like the Walking Dead episode game. And then PLEASE tell me why you would rate this game more than 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447592">Expand</a></span>

<br>You&apos;d expect like a more serious back story as to &quot;why the hell is nobody home after I arrive from a long ass trip to another continent&quot; other than a bunch of sweet love stories and meaninglessness. Don&apos;t listen to people blindly praising this for &quot;being different&quot; (which is not an excuse to be crap). You&apos;ll even notice that some people are praising this for homosexual relationships. Truly the end of times this is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447112">Expand</a></span>

<br>See, here is the real twist, were I a lesbian, my morning routine would be deemed as &quot;IMPRESSIVE&quot;, &quot;OUTSTANDING&quot;, &quot;GRANDIOSE&quot;, or any other adjective truly devoid of meaning when it comes to modern gaming.
<br>
<br>Almost no game-play, a so-so story which is only viewed in high regards for the feminist inquisition takes no prisoners and we would hate to be labelled as a chauvinistic people, and a length that makes angry birds seem as long as a first play-through of Skyrim.
<br>
<br>I would suggest avoiding this one, or waiting for a Steam sale of under a buck; 20 dollars for a movie ticket is excessive, then why is it not for a game which provides with little more?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439660">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I bought this for $20, expecting an ambient psychological horror story, as the game presented itself in the trailers as eerie but not filled with jump-scares, so I obviously expected creepy rather than scary. The moment I went in, I got chills down my spine at the sound design. Every little sound and movement sounded fantastic.
<br>
<br>Ten minutes in, and I&apos;m enjoying the references, I feel the build-up coming towards me and I wonder if I&apos;ll walk into a room of a ghost, maybe a hastily closed door. But as I drag on, I realize the new initiative of the game: a girl who, as she ages, begins to show sexual confusion and melodrama. It&apos;s become a girl&apos;s cryfest. Fun.
<br>
<br>An hour in, and the only thing roping me in now is the detail they put in everything and the side stories, hoping they will lead to new tunnels. Nope, it&apos;s like introducing side characters that get used once and are never talked about ever again. At this point I&apos;m pretty sure I know what&apos;s going to happen.
<br>
<br>Two hours in, I&apos;m staring at my screen, thinking, &quot;That&apos;s it?&quot; There was no twist, no increased conflict, no actual ending. The girl just up and went with her lover, there is no chase, there is no panic enunciating from HER OWN SISTER, who would rather keep rummaging through her missing sister&apos;s  junk. Then I think, &quot;Come to think, what the hell about her sister?&quot; The sister doesn&apos;t do anything, other than being a reason to walk around the house. No input from her was disappointing, definitely a letdown.
<br>
<br>Three hours in, and I&apos;m uninstalling the game. Uninteresting, scatterbrained story and the budget was put into all the wrong things. I don&apos;t care about the price of this pen, or how your lesbian lover is in the army.
<br>
<br>Verdict: The game had an interesting idea, top-notch voice acting and sound design, but these points are null when you poorly execute a story. It&apos;s like trying to immerse yourself in a multi-million roller coaster ride that goes 3 miles an hour. The way to pick up stuff and move them is interesting, but certainly nothing innovative. The only way you&apos;ll enjoy and relate to this story is if you are a teenage adolescent, have never picked up a book in 3 years, and enjoy generic, predictable outcome melodrama. I do not recommend thisgame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3586127">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have a problem with this being a &quot;interactive story&quot; instead of a game. But I do have a problem with the story creating lots of situations that doesn&apos;t solve.
<br>
<br>Why is the house called the psycho house? What happened with the morphine addict uncle, why was he in that situation? What about the Grandfather, why was his painting defaced?  Is the father an alcoholic? Does the mother have an affair with a co-worker?
<br>
<br>The sister is lesbian, great, I already understood that before I entered the basement, but what about the rest of the family?  The conclusion was sooo disapointing. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3467997">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In short, this is NOT a game. This is not worth 20 bucks, this is not even worth 2 bucks. It&apos;s an interactive walk and pick  up simulator, on a backdrop of 3deep5me nonsense. Just another case of how big time reviewers don&apos;t give a  about the quality of the game at all, just the bull**** they can get out of it.</span>

<br>There is literally no gameplay here, and the developer makes a selling point of it, saying &quot;No Combat, No Puzzles.&quot;  I got the game from a friend and didn&apos;t read anything about it before playing.  There was some tension before I realized that nothing in the game world was going to kill me, but once that dawned on me the sense of suspense drained away.  I was still curious about where the story was going to go, but I figured out what was going on about a third of the way through and wanted my character to just go to bed and talk to people in the morning.
<br>
<br>This is an interesting experiment in alternative storytelling, but that starts to fall down as it progresses and relies less and less on user discovery and more and more on linear narration via voiceover.  It shows hints of what can be done with this approach, but it feels experimental.  As such, it isn&apos;t worth paying money for, even if you you&apos;re not looking for an actual game.
<br>
<br>The story lasted me about 3 hours, and while it was initially engaging it became more and more tedious as I continued.  There&apos;s a good bit of 90s nostalgia scattered about, but that only goes so far when the main experience falls flat.
<br>
<br>Ultimately this is an art project, and like most art projects reviewers are afraid to give it low scores for fear of looking like they don&apos;t &quot;get it.&quot;  I think genuinely good things could be done with this approach, but this is essentially a prototype for the process.  A promising prototype, but charging $20 for it is frankly insulting.  Calling it a game is misleading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3470077">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Your sister is a lesbian and your mother is cheating on your father...whoopdeedoo.
<br>
<br>I do like how it played with my expectations but besides that it was very bland. I think people are really getting onboard with this game because of the sister-is-a-lesbian-who-runs-off-with-her-military-lover story-arc. This may be enlightening, endearing, or perhaps even shocking to some people. However as a person who is already comfortable with same-sex relationships this game loses its impetus. It merely becomes a rather ordinary (and ultimately boring) experience.
<br>
<br>I do believe that there is a need for games like this to be played, especially by the ignorant. But for someone that lives in a place like, oh, PORTLAND  OREGON, this game is a hideous waste of time. I felt like it was trying to teach me something that I already knew, to impart some piece of its marvelous &apos;wisdom&apos; upon me and help me be a better person. Too  late. That&apos;s ultimately what this game is, it&apos;s late to the party. Not just hours late, but decades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3445860">Expand</a></span>

This thing would be no different if it were a movie or visual novel. You may or may not enjoy the story, but a good story isnt a game, it&apos;s a book. If you want to play a great story centric game, play Planetscape Torment, The Longest Journey, Myst, even Penumbra.
<br>It&apos;s a crime that this game is being fawned over, I hope capable developers don&apos;t try and emulate the success that this thing has received instead of developing real games because at that point Gone Home actually begins to have a negative impact on gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447640">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As a visual novel, it&apos;s more of a thing. Gameplay doesn&apos;t matter in visual novels, so let&apos;s talk about a story. It&apos;s nothing to write home about either, and the ridiculous reviews given to it by &quot;critics&quot; are most likely due to the hip agenda the game addresses.
<br>
<br>As a game, it&apos;s a 0/10. As a story, it&apos;s 3/10 at best. That amounts to 1.5 average, but I&apos;ll just give it 0 to balance out all the 10/10 reviews that COMPLETELY ignore how terrible a game it is..

<br>
<br>I am feeling mixed emotions at the moment. I literally just finished the game about twenty minutes ago. I downloaded it about five hours ago, but my Steam in-game timer says I have only played it for three hours.
<br>
<br>First things first: I barely read any reviews at all. I think I skimmed either Joystiq&apos;s or IGN&apos;s or something, I cannot recall. I saw some of the screenshots, and then I checked the game out on Steam.
<br>
<br>Missing family members? Check.
<br>Resident Evil-like mansion? Check.
<br>1995 spooky period setting? Check.
<br>Detective emphasis where you pick up items and look for clues? Check.
<br>
<br>So this game is obviously about either a murder, a haunted house, or some sort of missing family detective game, judging by the screen shots and Steam profile, right?
<br>
<br>I boot the game up. Title screen is pretty spooky and ominous. I bet my family&apos;s bodies are in that second floor left window because it&apos;s illuminated on the title screen!
<br>
<br>The game opens with a &quot;Hey don&apos;t mind me, I&apos;ll find my own way home&quot; phone call. I have an inventory system and a map. I&apos;m digging it. It&apos;s dark, stormy, the lightning and creaking noises are scary and ominous. This giant Resident Evil house is deserted and abandoned. I decide that I&apos;m going to hug the left wall the entire game, and check every nook and cranny. And I do.
<br>
<br>I learn about my &quot;father&apos;s&quot; failed book sales, I learn about the creepy voice message on the phone, read about my great uncle&apos;s will. I enjoyed the X-Files references, and the Street Fighter stuff was great. All right, every thing is pretty cool for now. I bet my family is dead upstairs or something. The atmosphere is awesome. I get genuinely creeped out the dark hallways and the thundering and lightning. I keep thinking there is going to be a dead body or a zombie or something every time I enter a new room.
<br>
<br>After a great first hour or two of scary lightning and ominous noises, things start to get a little weird once you get to the second floor. The first girl punk rock cassette was okay I guess, but now these other ones are annoying me. Oh, here&apos;s a story about a pirate captain    uh    cool? I&apos;m not really feeling it, though.
<br>
<br>And then &quot;it&quot; happens. The moment that makes me say &quot;Uh    what just happened?&quot; Remember the trailers for Iron Man 3? Remember how it seemed so dark and ominous? How Tony was all alone? How the Mandarin was such a powerful and evil guy? And you see it and like it at first, but then the Mandarin reveal happens? And following that scene, the movie just loses all appeal. You are no longer invested. What you thought and expected is completely replaced with confusion. That moment happened to me in this game.
<br>
<br>&quot;Dear diary I like Lonnie.&quot; Uh    okay. That&apos;s cool, I guess? Seems a little unrelated to the dark and ominous feel of the game. My family is still totally dead and murdered, right?
<br>
<br>Nope, all the ominous darkness and set-up is basically for naught. After that reveal, it turns into a high schooler&apos;s interactive &quot;Dear Diary, me and Lonnie let&apos;s be pirate punks blah blah blah.&quot; The game attempts to return to the &quot;dark and ominous&quot; setting with cryptic clues about your deceased great uncle and stuff.
<br>
<br>A little further, I get a little more hope when I find out there&apos;s a pagan ritual going on and some Ouija board talk. I thought to myself, &quot;Awesome. She&apos;s totally killed herself in the attic, right?&quot;
<br>
<br>Nope. Your parents are away at a couple&apos;s retreat because your mom is probably cheating on your dad, and your sister at the ripe age of 17 with all of her wisdom runs off with a now AWOL Lonnie and the game ends.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m terribly confused as to why they marketed it the way they did if the main story line (your sister is gay and ran off) has nothing to do with the dark and ominous setting.
<br>
<br>Did I enjoy it? That first hour or so going about the house was great. Scouring corners for clues, attempting to find out what happened to my family, old creaky noises, Resident Evil flashbacks, etc. But then after the &quot;Dear diary&quot; event, I just stop caring. It got to the point where the game mentions a Kate/Kaitlin, and I honestly forgot that it was my character&apos;s name. Other than a few postcards, I am just a boring uninteresting protagonist going on a easter egg hunt for my sister who is apparently a master at setting up cryptic notes and secret passages.
<br>
<br>Does it matter if Sam was gay or not? Not at all. Even if Lonnie became Lenny, I don&apos;t care for a high school girl&apos;s 3 hour version of Dear Diary.
<br>
<br>The game is misleading in its tone and advertising. Do I regret my purchase? I don&apos;t know. $18 is a bit much for a 3 hour game I will never play again. All the hype and great reviews are a little misleading. This game could have been a great spooky detective murder mystery. You could have been a protagonist that mattered. But nope. You are just a boring older sister that no one cares about it seems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3430858">Expand</a></span>

But what it essentially boils down to is an hour and a half or two of reading notes.  The plot amounts to the same vapid 90210-level writing that the game itself mocks multiple times, with several cringe-worthy lines that carry a rather clich&#xE9;d story to a forced, unrealistic end.  The roughly three dozen pages of notes could easily be read in ten or twenty minutes on their own, and amount to something you can already find all over on Deviantart.
<br>
<br>But you can&apos;t charge money for that, can you?  The slow plod of having a player-character who must trudge around the mansion picking up these scraps simply serves as a vehicle to slow down the pace of this reading.  The graphics and atmosphere are initially enticing, but they quickly become irrelevant, comprised of empty rooms that requiring you to poke at something before the next bit of storyline text appears.
<br>
<br>The game looks nice.  The premise is intriguing.  But unfortunately, it amounts to an hour or two of unnecessary trudging around and clicking around for the next bit of text, mere padding that allows them to charge $20 for a few pages of generic drama.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437627">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gone home... does not really do anything wrong. It does not anger me as many games did in the last time... And I do enjoy games that tend to be very calm and with a minimum of interaction (Myst) or narrated movies (Walking Dead). I also identified with the main character (who has such few characteristics that this is not hard.) and enjoyed the fact that 2 girls are the center of attention here.
<br>Myst has a compelling world and culture, the Walking Dead tells a gripping story of multi-faceted characters (yeah, stereotypical some). Gone home is also story centered  and the story in my view is utterly standard and told in a very boring way. So  does this just boil down to my taste?
<br>In the beginning i was very intrigued: I had not read anything and expected suspense, maybe horror (x-file tapes lying around, the name &quot;Steven King&quot; popping up). I hoped that this was the way the story would go. Or if not, that i would be cleverly cheated out of my sheepish reasoning.
<br>The 90 points on meta critic also did their fair share. I have to think carefully if I can afford buying a game  the screenshots, trailer, soundtrack and meta critic score convinced me. Also I love supporting a genre that really needs more good publishers.
<br>Now i really, really regret having spent 20 Euro on this game. I still would have liked to play it  but not for 20 Euro. I would recommend it to people who like interactive stories (not really interactive... the story does not react to you  you cannot influence anything but the pacing), the sound is nice, the voice acting as well. I especially liked the effort put into the handwriting. But this is simply... not enough for a game. Where Journey captures you with mood and also some essential game-play and difficulty  here, there is absolutely no difficulty at all. I could have picked up the (well written) diary of a 15 year old girl instead. I have no reason of &quot;playing&quot; this a second time or watching somebody else playing it. I could not even talk about the game with friends. I actually feel cheated... There does not have to be a shocking twist or compelling tragedy in every story, but the whole set up, the premise is so intriguing, that the very banal 1000times heard  many times told better  story with 0 interaction disappointed me a lot. Maybe I would have liked that story more, if i was 14 or 15. But then the time period the game is set in might not have been so interesting to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441496">Expand</a></span>

The 90&apos;s atmosphere is incredibly well rendered, and anybody who grew up in these times will smile at the VHS, audio tapes, old TVs, and overall looks of the house. The attention to detail is there, and is part of what compels the player to hear the whole story.
<br>
<br>But let&apos;s face it  As a game in the strict sense of the term... Well, Gone Home is simply not a game. It&apos;s a VERY SHORT interactive story, that might be of interest to 15 years old girls.
<br>
<br>Video games are at a turning point, the indie market has grown, huge and mature, and I am the first one to rejoice at that fact. But Gone Home falls flat on his face when it comes to telling an interesting story. The ending is nothing more than pure disappointment, leaving me behind my screen, thinking &quot;What  That is all  Am I supposed to feel something right now  I had absolutely no sense of accomplishment when I got to the end of the story. No last minute twist, nothing sad, nothing happy. Just a big nothing.
<br>
<br>This game represents everything that is both good and bad about experimental storytelling. Its puzzle-driven narrative and great atmosphere makes you want to go deeper into the story... But it&apos;s shortcomings and lack of interactivity makes you wonder why is this a game and not an audio book. As part of a bigger game, it would have been incredible. Imagine that instead of having a cutscene that just unfoils the story to you, you would have to explore, read, listen, solve (easy) puzzles and just be attentive to what&apos;s going on around you.
<br>
<br>What I don&apos;t understand is how can a serious reviewer give this &quot;game&quot; a 9/10 or 10/10  The 7th Guest, the 11th Hour, Beneath a Steel Sky, Day of the Tentacle, Sam &amp; Max... There are so many great adventure/puzzle games that manage to deliver a good story, and that actually make you feel like you accomplished something at the end, that I don&apos;t understand why Gone Home is apparently deserving of such high scores from the &quot;professional&quot; critics. Ironically, all these games are from... The 90&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Gone Home is simply an experiment in storytelling. Like many games are trying to do nowadays: Convincing people that the video game can be a great media to tell a good story. But Gone Home is very far from being the most interesting one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3443262">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t waste your money. I love independent genre bending games, but a game this is not. Nor was it an experience worth the money and particularly not my time. It&apos;s a shame that such a seemingly lazy effort is being rewarded by the reviewer community.

<br>You want a unique game that tells a gripping story, here are some games that do this better...Flower, Journey, Catherine, Braid, Limbo, PORTAL!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3435595">Expand</a></span>

All you do is walk and look at stuff and it can be beaten in less that 50 seconds. Why does this cost $20 again? To give you an idea of how bad this is, FEZ was more of a game and Dear Esther was more engaging. It really is that bad. Only buy this if you get off to burning money.</span>

Every time the story made me believe something amazing was going to happen, it turned out it was just a typical story of an angsty teenage girl who was mad at her rich daddy and mommy. Typically people don&apos;t buy &quot;games&quot; to experience something they could otherwise do by breaking into the house of an upper class high school girl and pilfering through her drawers. If you step back for a moment and think about it. this interactive story is creepy as all get out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436125">Expand</a></span>

There is no game.
<br>The much lauded story (the ONLY thing this game is dependent upon) is nothing more than someone&apos;s Live Journal or probably a Fictionpress short-story that I read 10-15 years ago.  Story has nothing to do with the gameplay. You aren&apos;t even part of the story that&apos;s being told. You are told someone else&apos;s linear and melodramatic story while you pick up a random object and spin it around just so you can trigger the next voice over.
<br>Voice Acting is good and I did like the creepy ambiance (even though its a complete lie), but nothing in this &quot;game&quot; is worth the $20 price tag. I bought &quot;The Graveyard&quot; and I didn&apos;t feel as ripped off about it than I am right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434634">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you think this game is unique you&apos;re wrong, there are plenty of games similar to this with most of them being games that are free to play in your browser. Of course you don&apos;t get the excellent voice acting but most of the game is text so it&apos;s not a big deal.
<br>I&apos;ve heard people say this game has good atmosphere. If night time and bad weather is enough for a game to get praised then standards have seriously dropped. So if you agree that the gameplay is pointless carry on reading this; or if you think the gameplay is an essential part of the experience then write your own review explaining why, I&apos;d love to read why someone would enjoy the gameplay.
<br>You can buy 2 books for the price of this game and which has more value? If this game had been a book then I&apos;d be giving it a positive but as it is I can&apos;t recommend anyone spend money on this. You&apos;re better off watching a playthrough on youtube. After beating the game once there is no point in ever replaying it. I was very disappointed by this game after seeing all the praise it&apos;s been getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3433616">Expand</a></span>

And, while Indie efforts are usually worthy of praise because they strain to do something different, Gone Home is clearly a case in point that stresses different is not always a driving point for a game. While it&apos;s true there genuinely isn&apos;t an experience like this &apos;out there&apos;, most gamers out there will probably suggest there is a reason for that.
<br>
<br>The critical acclaim is quite baffling, but I doubt it&apos;s worth trying to figure out. Just as critics felt like they had to give room for post modern art, it seems game reviewers here are doing the same thing. They see something unusual, something that tells a story a different way, they say it has emotion and involves the player.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the thing, though, Gone Home doesn&apos;t succeed on any of those points. There have been games this year that have evoked emotional storylines, and still given you something to physically do. Gone Home&apos;s only hook is that you allegedly have to piece the story together, from aeons of crumpled up notes and journals. The rest of the two, yes, count it, two hour experience is spent picking up items which either have no use, or make vague nods to what&apos;s going on in the house, or to pop-culture of the 1990s. Know how games put the odd easter egg in here and there? That&apos;s Gone Home&apos;s idea of a fully interactive experience.  And the less said about the overall tone and theme/message of the story, the better. It&apos;s as if the writers decided on this subject to make a point, a point they had obviously done little research of.
<br>
<br>Thing is, regardless of how unique GH is, there really isn&apos;t a need for it. This is a once in a lifetime game that will hopefully fall off the radar, or find a niche of gamers that would be happy doing this. I can&apos;t imagine anyone wanting to go through such an experience again, unless the same gimmick was improved vastly beyond the non-game GH is.
<br>
<br>And, the final point, as people have mentioned, is the price. 20 bucks for a 2 hour game is laughable.
<br>
<br>There are plenty of better interactive story games. I point you to 999 and Virtues Last Reward. A story that surpasses anything told in GH here, and one that truly makes the player think far beyond when the credits roll, so much so, a replay is almost a guarantee. These games are 40 hours long, and barely cost much more than what the guys who made GH are asking for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441247">Expand</a></span>

You get Gone Home, a games that&apos;s equally as pretentious, twice as boring, but with the added bonus of a cliched story with very little substance.
<br>You come home to an empty house and a mystery. Where is everyone? You look around, you find notes, listen to a few monologues and unlock the story. Now I could&apos;ve ignored the fact that this game is basically a point and click for complete idiots if the story at least had something interesting to offer, but it doesn&apos;t. What&apos;s the story? Your sister comes to a new school where she feels like an outcast. Then she meets a girl who &quot;gets&quot; her and the two become a lesbian couple. The parents object, but she commits to her love, but then her lover reveals she&apos;s gonna join the military after high school, effectively ending the relationship, but then she decides to back out at the last minute and the two live happily ever after. So, it&apos;s basically &quot;boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back&quot;, but with two girls and no boy, which I assume is supposed to add something to the story, but not really.
<br>Now, I don&apos;t mind if you use a formula to tell your story as long as you can present it to me in an interesting way that makes me see it in a new way or challenges me. Gone Home does neither. The lesbian relationship adds about an ounce of drama and that&apos;s about it. Otherwise, it&apos;s just your standard romance with nothing new to add or surprise you with (unless you have a problem with homosexuality or something).
<br>The whole thing will take you about 2 hours to complete and the game will run you about $20, which is about $20 more than it&apos;s actually worth. If the story had been good, I&apos;d have ignored the gameplay. If the gameplay had been good, I&apos;d have ignored the story. Gone Home failed on both and left me unsatisfied and underwhelmed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437533">Expand</a></span>

The concept was sound enough, walk around a house mashing your use key on everything that glows white and looking at it from all directions to piece together a story. It would be great if they actually ran with that. For most of the game you aren&apos;t really piecing together a story as much as reading some notes and looking at a convenient book on the floor and reading a teenage girl&apos;s diary. I expected that I would have to actually think about what happened without having a definite answer, but no it&apos;s basically throwing the story at you like a book or a movie. This leads me to my main problem with this &quot;game&quot;. There is no challenge. This is not the holy savior of video games, this is not someone redefining a medium, and this is definitely not a game. At best this is an interactive story and the story part of it feels uninspired and lazy. You can guess the ending 20 minutes into the game  and there are no curve balls in the main story.   Some of the side stories are interesting but not enough to carry it. Maybe with proper execution it could have become something great but unfortunately all we have is this little tech demo that squanders what great potential this concept has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434688">Expand</a></span>

Yes, this game is &quot;different&quot; but in the end, is it really even a game? It&apos;s an interactive experience, no doubt, but calling it a game is just wrong.
<br>
<br>Presentation: Everything looks well enough and you can interact with almost everything. Rummaging through your house and searching for clues. However this is also one of the biggest detractors from Gone Home. Just because you can mess with everything, doesn&apos;t add depth to the game. It clutters everything up. And on top of that, everything you find, only a select number of things have any use, making it a tedious task to go through everything to find the random key or mcguffin to continue on... but I&apos;ll get to that in the gameplay section.
<br>
<br>Sound: Sound is nice, nothing too special though. The music isn&apos;t bad, but it&apos;s a bit bland. I ended up listening to the songs a few times before I decided to turn it off.
<br>
<br>Theme: This is probably the main drawling point of this game, and damn if it doesn&apos;t screw that up in some way. I love the idea of &quot;Gone Home&quot;. The idea that a home is never without secrets. The idea that a familiar place is no longer familiar to you and even has a sinister tone. That everything is off and nothing is as it seems even though it&apos;s only your paranoia... and that&apos;s the problem. While nothing is as it seems, and everything &quot;might&quot; be a bit off, nothing really is. The tension that builds up, the teasing the trailers give you, showing that &quot;something is up in this house&quot; all in all, is an empty promise within an empty house. All you are doing is going through the old house finding out about the main character and her family and how everything just feels off to her.
<br>
<br>However that is also a big flaw. It does feel off to her, but at no point do I feel like I am in her shoes. Sure, the protagonist feels odd in this place that was once her home, but what&apos;s the point? I can&apos;t get drawn in. I distinctively felt like it was her life, not mine that I was looking at. This negated almost all of the tension created. &quot;I&quot; wasn&apos;t going home. She was going home and I was just watching her do it.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: This is the final nail in the coffin for me. Gameplay is virtually nonexistent. The game prides itself on it&apos;s story, but that doesn&apos;t give an excuse for making the gameplay poor. I can respect what they are doing though, trying to make an interactive experience. However this feels more like an experiment than an experience. It&apos;s not polished, it doesn&apos;t draw in the player. It just shows them things and expects them to react as if they were the protagonist. And even then, there is no way to lose, no way to fail your goal. You just keep plugging away until you find the secrets of the house... which in the end is a huge anticlimax. It also has zero replayability, considering you can beat the game in less than 2 minutes if you know what you are doing.
<br>
<br>Summary: While the game as a lot of good ideas, very few of them are executed well. A majority of them fall flat on their face. I can&apos;t feel connected to the protagonist, the gameplay is nonexistant and short, the experience doesn&apos;t draw me in, and it&apos;s an expensive game for what it is. Right now it&apos;s going for around $20. Don&apos;t waste your money. Wait for a humble indie bundle and try it for yourself. It might be worth a playthrough if you get it for 2 bucks, but not 20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436197">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I found the story itself and ending really underwhelming considering that was the focal point of the game; it just felt like a playable, albeit forgettable and predictable, Lifetime movie. So I just can&apos;t get on board this hype train. By the end of it, I felt like having no gameplay was more a gimmick than anything else. What happens when more &quot;games&quot; likes this with similarly decent stories come out? Are we still praising it with perfect 10&apos;s? It&apos;s different, I get it, but that doesn&apos;t make it a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429635">Expand</a></span>

For a game that is $20, its far to short (2 hours); the design/architecture of the house is oddly in-normal and amateur, and the story just didn&apos;t do anything for me. I guess this one just fly&apos;s over my head as I cannot understand the critics answers for a 100%.  I give it a 3 for its creepy atmosphere.</span>

I swear to God that the gaming media has lied to me for the very last time.

BEAT beat. It&apos;s getting perfect tens by professional reviewers for lord knows what reason, I assume they just don&apos;t want to get called sexist or homophobic since the game deals with fairly delicate social issues that internet activists get extremely riled about.
<br>
<br>Whatever. It&apos;s not worth twenty dollars. It&apos;s barely worth two dollars. Do not buy this game if you care about the industry. Do not buy this game if you are sick of people deliberately making high-minded, &apos;socially conscious&apos; non-game &quot;&apos;experiences&apos;&apos;&apos; (there really aren&apos;t enough quotation marks in the world) specifically to score pander to reviewers who obviously can&apos;t distinguish art from pretentious faffery, and so claim any game with a plotline deeper than &apos;shoot the space alien&apos; is Citizen Kane so they aren&apos;t accused of not &apos;getting&apos; it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434440">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gone Home &quot;twist comes less than 10 minutes into the games so if you want to know why this games such a big deal you might just want read a spoiler and see the rather shallow reason for a lot of this games positive reception.
<br>There are no real puzzles, sometimes you collect a key and the game tells you were to go on the map to use it.
<br>The rest of the time you just walk from room to room and pick up highlighted objects to unlock audio diary&apos;s,
<br>Sometimes your need to place a tape in a tape player but that&apos;s about as complex as it gets, there little to it passed that.
<br>The games story is of course it&apos;s big selling point and since the game is being sold as something you have to come into with no knowledge of, I can&apos;t talk about it without it being seen as a spoiler.
<br>What I will say is if this story were told in any other medium it would be a total non event.
<br>There&apos;s little to it and you can guess most of it before your halfway done.
<br>Overall I can&apos;t recommend Gone Home to anyone but the most hardcore fans of the quirky, the story while rare in games is uninspired and shallow and there&apos;s hardly any gameplay to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3433986">Expand</a></span>

I hate teens going through puberty and their stupid useless lives with useless decisions and i want to spit in the face of the guy who thought this would be sensational in any way. Technically the game is an unoptimised piece of toot. It has reused models, mspaint textures (especially in small areas they are obvious) and what not. All in all, avoid buying or even pirating this at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436183">Expand</a></span>

Literally all you do is rummage through the house, look at notes and listen to audio logs. You just walk around and look at things.
<br>
<br>Its supposed redeeming feature, the story, is not some masterpiece critics praise it as. It is actually extremely bare bones and simple, and doesn&apos;t even follow story telling 101 with no conflicts, twists or even a resolution. Not the mention the subplots go absolutely no-where. The only reason the story is considered to be great and &apos;deep&apos; is because it involves lesbians. Just because there are lesbians are involved doesn&apos;t automatically mean you are dealing with deep or heavy themes.
<br>
<br>Not the mention the game only takes 1-2 hours to complete, and can actually be finished in 2 minutes without any amount of skill. It also only takes place is one setting. Despite all this it still somehow costs $20. This game is quite simply overpriced, pretentious garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434684">Expand</a></span>

<br>Probably the worst part is that, for all its emphasis on story, Gone Home doesn&apos;t say much. It provides limited commentary on a social issue, but nothing that hasn&apos;t been said before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428865">Expand</a></span>

You will spend at least 2 hours digging through drawers and cabinets to find mostly useless scraps of paper, most not even relevant to the main plot of the story line. While this game does have a good story it is simply not worth the twenty bucks, or the time it takes you to dig through the game.</span>

All you do in this game is explore a house and examine the notes, pictures, documents, and artefacts contained therein. The house is big, and is well done by the developers, but to make a good game in today&apos;s video game industry, you&apos;re gonna have to make a bit more than a house.  The story is very uninteresting and uninspired. It is also very predictable, as you can probably predict the ending around 10 minutes into the game. That is not to say that Gone Home&apos;s story is generic. Actually, this game is actually quite original. But at the end of the day, originality is overrated if you can&apos;t produce good gameplay, story, or atmosphere. It also doesn&apos;t help that this short, excuse-for-a-game, costs $18 on steam. So, if you are looking for a cost-effective game to purchase, stay away from &quot;Gone Home&quot; like the plague. Perhaps this game&apos;s only redeeming feature is that the voice acting of the ONLY character that speaks is done well (Yes  well, not amazingly, but well nonetheless).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429567">Expand</a></span>

But my main gripe with Gone Home is the complete and utter lack of gameplay itself; it&apos;s only mechanic is simply walking around and picking up notes. There&apos;s no conflict, no character development, nothing that would make you care about the characters or the story other than the fact that her sister and her friend are lesbians.
<br>
<br>Had the game not featured a feminist and LGBT agenda, I&apos;m confident that it would not have achieved a high rating from any critic. But nobody wants to be wrongly labeled &quot;misogynist&quot; or &quot;intolerant&quot; nowadays- it would kill business.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446810">Expand</a></span>

There is hardly any interactivity at all. I mean, sure, you can flip a switch and lights will come on, and when you pick things up and they&apos;ll move, but that&apos;s hardly anything to write home (no pun intended) about.
<br>This, uh, thing, has been given great reviews because of it&apos;s supposedly &apos;deep&apos; and &apos;insightful&apos;, but it&apos;s not. It&apos;s about a teenage lesbian running away with her girlfriend while her parents are on vacation. Whoop de doo.
<br>To top off this dinner of garbage, the game is 20 USD. 20 dollars for a game you can literally beat in less than 2 minutes.
<br>To summarize, Gone Home is an overpriced, pretentious, and sad excuse for a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434242">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is no game-play really, you just explore around. Exploration is not bad but comparing it to old point and click adventure games they have puzzles as well thrown in. There is no re-playability, once you uncover the story that&apos;s it. The &apos;game&apos;, if you try to stretch it out, will last maybe an hour or two, and if you try to rush through it, is beatable in literally 2 minutes(look for it on youtube).
<br>
<br>This is the sort of thing that should have been embedded in a web page, given an appropriate url, and virald itself around the internet. Not something claiming to be a game that people are tricked into paying for. As a sort of artistic thing like that it would have been quite good. But as a game, the only positive thing about it is its atmosphere, which is why i gave it a 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434415">Expand</a></span>

Unneeded/useless crouch function. Unneeded right-click and object rotate function. Besides Sam&apos;s notes, all other notes added nothing but bore. No puzzle solving or anything, game is about reading paper notes. Denying access to the most interesting (dirty) note was NOT a good idea. 99% of objects were useless and did not need a pickup function, they were not even interesting (pens, magazines, toilet papers). Game was promising a twisted ending but delivered nothing at all (yes... you are so smart and unique!). 2 hours later, conclusion was my sis has gone gay and has fled, but not a single foke was given by me, at least if it was Terry I could have laughed about it.
<br>
<br>Positive points: Game keeps you interested from start to finish, because it promises you with lies! Sam&apos;s story unfolds well and her voice journals are good, pretty shame it&apos;s rather basic. The bit in the first secret room, I picked up the cross and as i was reading it, and the light bulb went out, that bit sh!t me up real good, if only there was a lot more of that in the game.

It shows you that games with a huge focus on story can be made and that they have potential.
<br>Is this game worth $20, though? Absolutely not.
<br>
<br>The graphics are alright for this type of game. Nothing spectacular to be sure, but adequate. More attention given to the lighting would have really helped the atmosphere, though.
<br>The sound design is passable as well. Sound and music are used sparingly but appropriately. Nothing that will wow you, but fitting for the game.
<br>
<br>The two major problems, then, are the story and the &quot;gameplay&quot;.
<br>I applaud their effort to completely focus on the exploration and ditch enemies and puzzles altogether. It&apos;s just a shame that the exploration really isn&apos;t all that fun. You can walk around, pick up objects and examine them. That&apos;s it. A bit of variety would have really helped. How about a flashlight to let you explore dark, long abandoned rooms inside the house? How about some semblance of interactivity between items? ANYTHING to break the monotony of slowly walking from room to room.
<br>I realize that the exclusion of typical gameplay elements was a conscious choice, but it wasn&apos;t a good one in my opinion. A game focused completely on exploration should make exploration fun.
<br>Then we have the story. I have to admit it&apos;s well written and indeed somewhat interesting, but it&apos;s just out of place and not fitting.
<br>The tried and true (but nevertheless interesting) setting of the old, spooky mansion at night with a storm blowing outside would have lent itself much better to a real mystery story. I&apos;m not going to spoil anything, but in my opinion they should have stuck with a tried and true (but interestingly told) story to go along with their tried and true setting instead for going with a story that simply feels out of place.
<br>The fact that the &quot;big reveal&quot; is obvious 20 minutes into the game doesn&apos;t help, either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3432846">Expand</a></span>

After you&apos;ve gathered the information packets and diaries and such one time, you have nothing left to do. No alternate ends or paths. No replayability. No real reason to collect the collectibles. There is no conflict. There is no threat. There is nothing to hold the interest of the player, unless the player is a twelve year old girl. The atmosphere and advertising is extremely misleading. The creators are probably laughing at all the positive reviews and revenue they made from people purchasing this &apos;game&apos;. Gone Home should never have been sold to the public. If this &apos;game&apos; was released in any form, it should have been as a free flash game on the internet. This abomination of gaming is worth no amount of money and only adds to the success of games that aren&apos;t games. The &apos;professional&apos; critics that rated this &apos;game&apos; so highly should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves. There is absolutely nothing about this game that warrants anything better than a 4 out of 10. The let-down factor after seeing what looked like a true detective/horror/mystery game in the trailer knocks the score down to a 1. And the padding of the reviews by the huge amount of casuals can only lead a gamer to give this a 0 in an attempt to get the word out to the rest of the community that Gone Home is not worthy to lick the dirt that true games have just tread upon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434389">Expand</a></span>

<br>Normally I would appreciate a game with a good narrative, I believe that the industry needs this kind of game, but a game is not a mere narrative it has to be the combination of sounds, images, story and interaction and Gone Home manages to fail in every aspect except for the story.
<br>Poor graphics combined with very bad textures and a terrible light effect makes the environment a lousy place to navigate through and that is a pretty important thing here since walking around the scenario 50% the game mechanic.
<br>The sound is average there really isn&apos;t much to complain but there is nothing to praise either.
<br>The gameplay, if you can call it that way, consists basically on walking around reading messages and notes.
<br>Gone Home is a pretty good narrative born in the wrong medium it would be a much better choice to release it as short film.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427599">Expand</a></span>

<br>On to the game. The story is nothing special. Some say it is the best told story ever. Are they serious? All you do in this game is walk around the house and turn objects around when suddenly a narrator voice reads a part of her diary to you. I can tell you that is not even necessary you might just find the paper clips and keys since that is the only thing needed. This game is made for the simple minded and it is over in 2-3 hours. This game in no way makes you think there is not a single moment that you stop to think about a puzzle or anything.
<br>
<br>Is the game industry turning to movie industry? When some game maker makes a game that you can barely call a game it gets 9-10 reviews. You can clearly see what the normal consumers think about this game with the user score being so low.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3434719">Expand</a></span>

I was tempted to give this a zero for the same reason  I love stories. And this one sucked.
<br>
<br>Gone Home is a literary bait and switch that promises a spooky mystery, a haunted mansion with secret passageways, misguided teens who dabble in the occult, and a family gone missing. It has a dark and stormy night, creaky floorboards, and mysterious pentagrams and candles. And while all of this sounds good, it&apos;s not what this game delivers.

<br>And where are the missing parents? They went away for the weekend  presumably to add a little spark to their marriage. And where is my lost little sister? She ran off with her girlfriend. That&apos;s it. No ghosts. No mystery. No plot twists. Nothing.
<br>
<br>Yawn.

Also with only 2 hours of gameplay and literally zero replayability  it is quite a steep price.</span>

You arrive back home after a year abroad in Europe learning in the first few minutes that your house is known throughout the small Oregon town setting as the &quot;Psycho House,&quot; and that it might be haunted by your dead uncle.  The house is big, the lights flicker, the noises are offsetting, and there are secret panels and passage ways.  However, all of that is a big red herring.  About 30 minutes into the game, you learn that you kid sister is probably a lesbian, and that&apos;s the big reveal at the end of the game  you learn your sister ran off to be with her female lover, Lonnie, to the chagrin of your dysfunctional parents.  Throughout the obvious but slow &quot;coming out&quot; of your sister through reading her diary entries and listening to her very Sleater-Kinney-esque mix tapes, you learn that your mom is probably having an affair with a park ranger and that your father is a failed aloof scifi writer who enjoys his whiskey.  I did enjoy all the 90s indie music, x-files, twin peaks, videogame, and movie references, but really the whole game came off as an interactive version of Tracie Chapman&apos;s song, &quot;Fast Car.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427224">Expand</a></span>

Your role is to go through the large house and look for letters and tapes to decipher what has happened to your family while you&apos;re gone. There is no action, and there is little puzzle solving. Nevertheless, as you can probably judge from my score, I really liked the game, and I will tell you the reasons in order for you to decide for yourself if you want to play the game or not.
<br>
<br>First, there are some glaring &quot;flaws&quot; to this game, if you could even call it that, which are the length and the price. The game takes less than 2 hours to finish, and cost me 18 dollars. For me personally it was definitely worth the price of admission, but for those who can only purchase one game once in a while, this might not be a very good investment even if you end up loving the game. Read what I will have to say in the following paragraphs and then decide.
<br>
<br>The controls are simple but responsive, you can walk and look around, click on things to pick them up, rotate things while observing them, and zoom in on objects and the environment. While reminiscent of a pixel hunt adventure game, objects that you can interact with are instantly recognizable due to the in-game effects and also because of the attention to detail that the makers put into the graphics. You will occasionally find some bland textures, but the sheer amount of objects you can interact with is tremendous, and you can pretty much read the fine labels on the smallest, most ordinary objects. The technical graphics might not win any awards, but the love put into the most mundane objects show a quality that few other games reach.
<br>
<br>The sound of the game reminded me of the ambient noises from the best horror games. There is technically no background music, but the creaks of the floor boards, the humming of the light bulbs, and the rumble of thunder outside comes clear and crisp through the headphones/speakers. The voice acting is also tremendous; you can feel each emotional passage uttered with true passion. All of the sounds and voices combine into a very immersive environment, and combined with the detailed graphics, it actually creates a very believable empty house for your to explore. I never knew an ordinary house could be so terrifying with just being... there without inhabitants.
<br>
<br>It might be obvious at this point that, without any action and puzzle solving, the game is about the ambiance and the story telling. And while I have laid praise to the former, the latter is where the game truly shines. The in-game story is mostly conveyed through the letters, notes, invoices, and tapes that you pick up and observe. Combined with that is an occasional narrative that extends and reveals a different angle to the story that complements the experience. And let me tell you, as mundane as reading letters are, it is a very emotional experience.
<br>
<br>It has been a very long time since I have felt unadulterated terror at the ambiance of a game. I expected things to show up at any moment, and with the opening of every single door, the fear of a child-dreamt booeyman leaping out from the closet was all too real. However, I have never felt a more genuine sense of dread, not fear nor terror, at what I -thought- I would find as I followed the story. What my imagination brought, it startled and then it ebbed, but what existed in the narrative world is what made me perspire and weep. Paired with that are well timed scenes of utmost joy and warmth that pulled at my heartstrings. These two opposing groups of feelings combined to form a emotional force that I was entirely unprepared for; this is a triumph in storytelling.
<br>
<br>It is fine for you to not know why or what made me feel what I felt from a simple point and click adventure game, but just know that this game is capable of delivering all these emotions if you let it. I cannot recommend this game enough, as it is up there along with other great indie storytellers such as To the Moon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428502">Expand</a></span>

I was borderline in tears at the end. This game contains strong, emotional writing. Although the main character may not be entirely relatable to some people, it still demands a huge amount of empathy and feeling for the protagonist as the game documents her struggle. Simply an amazing game that is perfect for these modern times where new social issues are brought into spectrum and we have to learn to be more accepting of others. Truly a great game, think of a tape hunting love story. It is, all-in-all a love story. So if that&apos;s not what you&apos;re into, you might as well not buy this game. Although it&apos;s so good, it might be worth considering.
<br>PROS:
<br>-Strong, emotionally driven narrative
<br>-Excellently done soundtrack that fits in perfectly
<br>-Great interface
<br>-Exploring the house is fun and rewarding
<br>-Perfect atmosphere
<br>-Great love :)
<br>CONS:
<br>-Could have been longer
<br>-Would love to have seen other supporting characters more fleshed out, less as side roles
<br>CONCLUSION:
<br>EXCELLENT GAME! Definitely put it somewhere on top of my list of favorites. If you&apos;re into romances, this is your game, otherwise, your 18$ may be best spent somewhere else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3429945">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The premise of Gone Home is that you&apos;re a girl named Kaitlin who has returned home from an extended trip around Europe. You arrive on a stormy night to find the house seemingly deserted. You explore the many unique, detailed rooms trying to find out where your family, most notably your sister Sam, has disappeared to.
<br>
<br>Now let me get one thing out of the way right now; this is NOT an action or horror game. There are no enemies to fight, you&apos;re never in any danger and there are no jump scares (well there is actually a tiny one that many are likely to miss and is a clever joke given the context for it). This is a game about exploration, moving from room to room picking up a wide variety of interactive objects. There are locked doors that block your primary path, but finding the keys to open them is not difficult in any way. As long as you keep and eye out and examine the environment carefully, you&apos;ll never get stuck.
<br>
<br>Gone Home is here to tell a story and the story it weaves is well told, personal, believable, touching and easy to relate to. The main focus is on your sister Sam, who provides voice over from her diary when certain objects are found. The delivery is perfect and it&apos;s impossible not to get attached to her. I was smiling as she talked about making her first real friend and getting her butt kicked at Street Fighter, and generally upset when she described obstacles in her life. I was strongly invested in Sam&apos;s story, hoping out loud numerous times that my predicted outcomes were incorrect. For a character only seen in pictures and heard in voice over, she is extremely well developed and easy to care for.
<br>
<br>While the focus is certainly on Sam, she&apos;s not the only character. As you explore the house, you learn about your parents and even alittle back story about the home&apos;s previous occupants. You&apos;ll get insight into the state of their marriage, obstacles in their careers and their interests solely from looking around. The game treats you like an adult, giving you the pieces and leaving you to draw your own conclusions without ramming it down your throat. It&apos;s possible to miss or ignore these details if you want, but they only immerse you further so I&apos;d recommend reading everything you can.
<br>
<br>While this is not a horror game, the atmosphere is certainly eerie. The house is large and feels believably lived in so wandering it all alone is somewhat unsettling, especially as claps of thunder come from outside, lights flicker and walls creak. Even knowing that nothing in this house is out to get you (which has been stated by the developers), it&apos;s hard not to have this small unnerving feeling as you look around, especially since someone in your family is interested in the supernatural and has left books abut hauntings laying around, planting the idea of ghosts in your head as you walk down a dark hallway. Don&apos;t be surprised if you find yourself rushing for the nearest light source each time you enter a room just to calm your nerves a bit.
<br>
<br>I came away from Gone Home feeling refreshed and knowing that the experience will stick with me. It&apos;s currently $20 on Steam, which some may find steep for a 2-3 hour experience, but I think it&apos;s worth it for a game this special. If you&apos;re looking for action or scares then don&apos;t bother cause this isn&apos;t the place for either and you&apos;ll just be bored. It requires patience since, again, your sole activity is searching every nook and cranny of numerous rooms and taking in the story, but those that give it a chance are likely to find an experience they&apos;ll think back fondly on. And if you&apos;re on the fence and don&apos;t want to take the hit just yet, then make damn sure you pick it up should it ever go on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428402">Expand</a></span>

Those aren&apos;t necessarily the best games I&apos;ve played, but they are the most perfect, if that makes sense.  And that is a word that I would use to describe Gone Home: perfect.  It is a game purely comprised of exploration and discovery, with virtually no other gameplay components with the exception of some very simplistic puzzles.  And yet, Gone Home manages to make seemingly mundane exploration into some of the most engaging and emotional storytelling I have ever seen.  Gone Home will be remembered for its brilliant design and execution, but also as a game that bravely led the charge in addressing contemporary social issues that have not as of yet found much representation in the medium.
<br>This game is not for everyone.  If all you play are shooters and fast paced action games, then Gone Home will bore you.  However, if you like slower games or games with interesting ways of telling stories, such as Journey, Heavy Rain, Dear Esther, or even mods like The Stanley Parable, than Gone home is certain to grab you and not let go for its 3 hour duration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gone-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427610">Expand</a></span>
