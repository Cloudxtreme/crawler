I love the OFP / ARMA series, but 3 games, all with the same bugs and problems, quickly becomes boring. This game, on the other hand, doesn&apos;t seme to have the same problems. In fact, I prefer it. The graphics run smoothly on my PC in the way that OFP, ARMA and ARMA 2 never did. They felt delayed, even if at a constant 60 fps. The aiming is easier on this game, the controls are more responsive and the levels are, frankly, more fun. I don&apos;t know why Mr xbox review is rating this in the PC section, or comparing it to Arma 2 which is still buggy, despite being released for MUCH longer than this game. I agree about the vehicles. They bounce a lot. Personally I still prefer them to Arma 2&apos;s fake rollercoaster ride. COD is a plague on the community. Stop comparing games like OFP to COD. They&apos;re not the same. ARMA and OFP aim for realism, and the only reason that this game is easier than ARMA is because playing tactically on this game allows you to complete a mission. With Arma it&apos;s pretty much chance. Also, it&apos;s easier to aim in this game, it feels as if it&apos;s programmed for a mouse instead of ARMA, which seems to think it&apos;s reading desktop mouse movements and trying to convert it into a FPS viewing engine. Give this game a chance, people, and I guarantee you you&apos;ll find it rewarding and fun. Think of it as a smaller, polished version of ARMA2, with faster (if lower) graphics (though it&apos;s more artistically balanced, compared to Arma&apos;s polygon frenzy). It&apos;s a decent game and is actually an alternative to the Arma series. it isn&apos;t a clone and in all honesty I think that this is the better game. As for realism... well, who cares. I only want realism so that I can annoy the hardcore veterans on multiplayer, and I think I&apos;ll still be able to with this game. Good game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86259">Expand</a></span>

That being said, however, you will have fun playing through the single player campaign.

Also I really like it when game companies spend time making things accurate and I feel they have with this game. Ok, you will always be able to find things that are a bit dodgy but Codemasters have done a good job here. I think I should also mention that this game is quite difficult and I can&apos;t help but think that many people who disliked it were simply not playing the right game for them. If you want to run around following tightly scripted checkpoints like an idiot firing from the hip killing scores of bad guys and never running out of ammo then play a COD game and not this one.<br><br>Another thing I like about this game is the difficulty system. The enemy AI doesn&apos;t change whether you&apos;re playing on easy or hardcore, you just get a lot less help from the game.

Graphics are good but nothing special these days.. Too many things that doesnt feel right about this game, including no dedicated servers, no joystick support, bad vehicle physics, no leaning, no smooth mouse, not much of gameplay options, no balance between infantry and vehicles, no good FOV etc.. Really hate this game as it is right now, and I do not have faith in that they can do much about it to solve all the things needed to be solved.. It coulve been so good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86138">Expand</a></span>

The game-play feels very fluid and keeps your heart pumping. I love the option of going wherever I want to go to complete a task. I&apos;m not stuck to the path that someone else has chosen for me. The graphics are beautiful and believable. The sound effects are absolutely amazing. I put on a pair of nice headphones and was blown away by the immersion I felt from the sound and graphics. The command system takes some getting used to. In order to command your squad mates you hit the &quot;Q&quot; key and it will bring a central display that has 4 directional choices which can be selected using &quot;W,A,S,D&quot;. The only problem I have with this system is that you have to stop moving in order to issue simple commands. Other than that, the layout is very intuitive. I have played ARMA2 quite a bit and find that it&apos;s too simulator like for me and feels obtuse and unnatural. Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a great balance between simulation and fun game-play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85558">Expand</a></span>

I have been waiting for this game ever since i finished the first one and its everything I was hoping for. The graphics and audio are second to none. It runs so smoothly and fluidly that it leaves you only one thing to think about - staying alive, rather than how much your gonna have to spend on a new PC to play it. Which is good, as staying alive isnt as easy as it sounds. The a.i is very convincing and it feels more like your actualy fighting people rather than fighting robots which is how Arma seems to me. I see a lot of people are saying that it has fallen victim to consolitis and that it shouldnt have been dumbed down for the consoles, and a lot of people are saying the opposite and that its to realistic and not enough fun... I feel that codemasters have made an excelent compromise here between realism and fun, and the fact I can play it on my 360 and my PC i can only see as a bonus! This game is utterly fantastic! It brings back all the good memory&apos;s and aspects that made the original game so undeniably awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85756">Expand</a></span>

The hyper-realism is just a moniker to sell a game that is only one step past the drawing-boards. Completely unplayable - please save your money and play flash-based web games, a much better use of your time.</span>

Incidentally, the most &quot;realistic&quot; shooters were made in the late 90&apos;s and have only veered away from it since. OFDR continues this trend.</span>

Needs a couple of tweaks, but apparently theyre due to be fixed in a patch that is due in a couple of weeks. The game is best played in Co-op with friends. It is seriously good fun, and I cant wait to see what the community produces with the built in editor.</span>

OF2 is excellent, and exceeds all my expectations. The gfx are brilliant, the AI is spot on (for me anyway), everyone has a different experience with the AI. The atmosphere aswell, is also spot on. Best game ive bought for a very long time for pc, however the console versions arent very good at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86048">Expand</a></span>

My sniper rifle has a MAJOR FLAW! it only seems to work with a direct head shot!...try shooting at the legs or torso and its as if the bullet dont exist!...no damage at all..only head shots do any damage..instant death....hit the body 10 times and nothing!!..now that surely is a major issue.... As for your medic..Duhhhh!!!..mr dumb himself he is! i lay on the floor bleeding...shouted MEDIC!..he pops over gets his trusty bandage out then just proceeds to look at me like he&apos;s dazed and transfixed ...he stays like that with me while i continue bleeding and shouting medic to ask for his assistance!..all the time my health is draining away!....eventually he gets shot in the head and we both end up on the floor dead...and i have to re-start 35 mins of gameplay all over again!.Arghhhh!!!!.. These bugs are bad,, very bad..it spoils the immersion and realism no end! I shot a lorry full of soldiers and the thing swerved and crashed off down a small hill and stopped on a boulder next to the beach..all the soldiers just stayed inside and made no attempt to get out...i walked right up to it and they were all looking around out the widows like it was a old pensioners day out!...the dozy muppets!!!.. some missions are very irritating whilst others are just great...when it all hangs together it outshines arma2 in many ways, graphics seem smoother and the grass and vegetation are awesome, as is the starry night sky and full moon missions lol...but after a while it all gets a bit samey..and the awful round team control interface you need to scroll through when issuing orders is just a joke and so slooooww!.... Arma2 is better in so many ways and more realistic also in a sim way..which is what i hoped this would be... Its good but only in a 7 out of 10 way!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85645">Expand</a></span>

You really have a realistic GREAT game that can kick some a**. If you cant take to die alot and dont like when shoots are falling in the air i recomend counter strike for you.... But if you like a fantastic real time fighting simulator you should defenetly play this game! You can also try call of duty but its more like counter strike. Call of duty shoult be voted 5 if this game is 7! Go operation flashpoint! buy I only give 10 if thee are not possible bugs and you never get tired of playing the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=740219">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is easier than any of the ARMA series, but harder than say Call of Duty. I think it is stuck somewhere in between. The biggest attraction I had to it was the Co-Op. That alone simply made the game worth buying. Played co-op with my kid and we had a great time figuring out how everything worked while  covering each others back,and killing the enemy before they killed us (most of the time. As long as both of you don&apos;t die at the same time you can respawn. If you are looking for super simple blast em up carnage then I suggest you play Serious Sam HD Second Encounter. If you are looking for super realistic, go buy ARMA 2. Now that game is so realistic I think you have to get a crew cut and eat crappy MREs to play it! I WANT to like ARMA 2, but I can never actually locate the enemy like I can in say just about every FPS out there. I know that is probably realistic, but I&apos;d rather have SOME fun! If you are looking for cool co-op along the vein of Ghost Recon (but a bit harder) then you will probably enjoy this game. To me it truly is a dumbed down ARMAish type of game and I for one appreciate it. And they really did a good job with the sound, you see the large distant explosion and the sound of it realistically takes a second or two to get to you. Vehicles are not realistic, but I wasn&apos;t buying a driving sim, so that seemed secondary to me. Funny how codemasters is known for their realistic driving sims and they managed to make such crappy vehicle physics.
<br>I tried some multiplayer, but due to my god-given talent of sucking at multiplayer, I am sure I did not hurt anyone&apos;s feelings or even make them call a medic (except maybe to get something when their sides started hurting from laughing at me so hard).
<br>So while the game is far from perfect and gives people from both sides of the aisle to gripe about, I am glad I bought it and played it. Heck friend me on steam (greghile) and we&apos;ll play some co-op!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=1616263">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a sad reality that the big companies like EA, Codemasters, etc do not really care about their customers, they just care about their shareholders and making that number every Q. Codies are also a publishing house so they are putting out games from other software houses as well as their own, so there is a very small window of interest after a game is released and then its history. I will be surprised if we even see a patch for dragon rising on the PC cos there is no money in that. The only way this will change is if the gamers vote with their wallets, but as half-decent FPS releases are so few and far between that will probably not change anyway - I certainly have been put off of anything that comes from Codemasters because of the lack of the LOOOOONG awaited 8ball DLC for the PC, and what happens with this game will compound that. Maybe I will avoid anything CM in future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85934">Expand</a></span>

Wasted on eliminating features rather than embedding them into the game for phenomenal gameplay. The sequel itself removed the &quot;Operation Flashpoint&quot; spirit, and seemed to be more of a Rainbow Six Vegas with vehicles and bigger island. The island is also one of the downfalls of this game. It&apos;s quite desolate. There are no cities, only small villages and more vegetation. The game is empty in soul and spirit, and lacks any immense story. The controls are adequate, but no where near stellar. There is no leaning, whatsoever, which contributes to the elimination of &quot;realism&quot; in Dragon Rising. The game is a flop in my book. Don&apos;t forget that the developer was different and steered way around the way Operation Flashpoint was meant to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86039">Expand</a></span>

I have ARMA and ARMA II and a beastly pc and they run pathetically.  Dragon Rising is extremly stable on pc.  There are some AI bugs, and certain checkpoints (that you can&apos;t see luckily) when initiated suddenly spawn more enemy, sometimes only a few metres away!  This does detract from the game slightly.  But on the whole this is a very exciting well made tactical shooter.  The graphics are very good, sound is amazing!  Even when near wire fences bullets make different ricochet sounds, talk from team mates is great, and it seriously feels like combat.  I think all the negative comments are from very shallow console gamers who don&apos;t really know what a tactical shooter should be like.  Don&apos;t bother comparing them to COD4 etc, totally different genres really.  And multiplayer is quite stable too.  Come on everyone jump into the fray, but remember to get your keyboard commands sussed first!!  Good game!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=1367703">Expand</a></span>

In addition the AI is terrible, and the medical &quot;system&quot;, which allows you to tank enemy straight up the middle, with few worries, is insulting. On it&apos;s own though, this would earn for me 5/10...6/10 on a good day. However. This isn&apos;t just a standalone game riddled with bugs. This is the end product of a 2+ year hype fest, using the names of one of the better games of the past decade, whilst having no relation to it. So, on the grounds that Codemasters are cashing in, hyping up a game under a well known name, then delivering an end product that (aside from looking prettier) doesn&apos;t even match, let alone exceed, the achievements of a game made in 2001, i&apos;m downvoting this to a 1. Some would argue i&apos;m voting too harshly, but at the end of the day, the benchmark we must compare OFP:DR to is OFP, and aside from the graphics,this game is behind in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86081">Expand</a></span>

No dedicated servers are in development leaving P2P networking for multiplayer, which results in a terrible lagging mess most of the time. Also no cd-key and no anti-cheat system leaves this game wide open for both hackers (if they can even get online due to the rubbish P2P system) and pirates because there is nothing to stop you playing online with a cracked copy of the game. All in all the game brings something new to console users but PC players will be very disappointed. This is NOT worthy of the Operation Flashpoint name brand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86082">Expand</a></span>

On the PC it fails and fails badly... There are a lot of things wrong with it, The physics for vehicles are terrible, more like driving a car on an ice lake, you can empty a full clip into a jeep and it doesn&apos;t even make a mark. The AI switches from mind numbingly stupid to super human (normally 1 minute before you reach a check point, forcing you to play a large part again) the 11 missions are short, you can finish the game in 4 hours or less. But the biggest failing point is the MP experience... It uses P2P for all MP modes of which there are 3, Assignation, infiltration, and Co-op. There are no dedicated server files and CM have confirmed they wont be working on any. So therefore your only games online require someone at home running the game on their PC. Lag and dropped connections are a MAJOR issue. Couple to the fact there is no anti cheat (and lots of people cheating already) no CD key so they couldn&apos;t be banned even if there was. Do not believe the hype videos from CM there are nothing to do with the game. Oh and as for teh huge open world? sadly no, you are forced along a pre determined path, which if you stray out of results in a mission failed, so you can not go exploring in missions as advertised. This is a Xbox game directly ported and not changed at all except to allow you to use a keyboard and mouse (which is also not very responsive) If you really want this game wait a month or two it will be in a bargin bucket soon. Very Very poorly implemeted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86050">Expand</a></span>

Why oh why games like this are made multiplatform? This was a poor man&apos;s Operation Flashpoint. Reminded me more about Battlefield Bad Company than OFP. Consoles has their great limitations, so why bother to make this kinda game for them? Biggest disappointments in this game: disappearing bodies, cannot move when using inventory, crappy unit commands, too short campaign, general AI and the cherry atop the cake: vehicles in cameo role. YES, forget the vehicles in singleplayer mode! If you wanna wreak havoc in battlefield with every thing on the arsenal, play multiplayer. In singleplayer you had to do with few jeeps and a static tank. The good thing in this game was the atmosphere, generally nice graphics, especially artillery barrages and sounds. But that was it. Big bad BOOOO for this game.

No it&apos;s not, rather it feels like work, just go play AA if you need something similar. If it had a better networking multiplayer system the score would be higher; ran up to a player point blank unloaded on him he turns around from his stationary position and just pops one shot. Dead. Just trying to navigate through the menus take unnecessary time and in some cases will get stuck in certain option displays and pressing esc does nothing. There&apos;s a lot of running involved and the AI are not marksmen, you can pretty much shoot them down in a single shot while watching them flail their weapons like retarded offspring. Should of waited for BF:BC2, and i wish i could return this bore fest. Ya this was with the PC version. On the bright side, there was a few notable features that I did like... But looking back I can&apos;t find anything that makes it stand out except it&apos;s combat realism-ish. Don&apos;t let the trailers fool ya, it never gets intense in multiplayer. Once a vehicle is gone you can&apos;t get it back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85748">Expand</a></span>

Even theough the game looks and feels pretty this is nothing out of the ordinary, and every other game provider will be able to provide more interesting gameplay, more game time on single player and a fully functional multiplayer environment upon release. There are also issues with validating genuine players from pirated players. Currently pirates and game cheaters play along side valid players, causing the multiplayer aspect to falter even more. The AI is not impressive and a patch production was set in motion prior to release, but the game got released anyway. Dont let graphics only indicate that the game it self is great. I will say this though, the game holds some potential, but only if many of the serious issues are addressed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86051">Expand</a></span>

However, if you you are expecting a relatively fun 4 player co-op campaign, and are willing to overlook the glaring problems present in the current release of the game, you might actually enjoy yourself. There are many problems that detract from a fun experience. It is well known by now that there are no Dedicated Servers for this game, and the last official word from Code Masters was &quot;this feature is currently not being worked on.&quot; There is also no mention of intent to release a SDK for the modding community to fix the problems with this game. The enemy AI, even when the game is set to &apos;Hardcore&apos; is pathetically unrealistic in the way they respond to combat. Vehicle physics are simply a joke, vehicles tend to flip, the turning radius of most of the vehicles in the game is unacceptable, there is no way to use brakes without using a &quot;handbrake.&quot; Your weapon seems to fire from the center of your model, so in some situations even with clear Line Of Sight to your target your rounds will impact objects you are using for cover (inexcusable for a shooter released in &apos;09 ) The AI can track players and other AI through smoke, burning buildings and wrecks, as well as tall grass and vegetation, something a human player can not do without the assistance of optics. Weapon damage is unrealistic, plenty of examples of enemy AI taking a high caliber round to center mass, going prone, and then standing back up as if nothing was wrong with them. &quot;...engaged against the full force of the Chinese PLA on a scale never previously experienced in a military action title...&quot; I had to laugh at that one, most missions present very few targets, for example the opening mission of the campaign asks the player to disable anti-ship and anti-air installations on a small island off of the coast of Skira, to secure safe passage for a landing on the main island. Such a strategically important location seems to be defended by approximately 50 PLA soldiers, most of the players time is spent walking, or attempting to drive, through the bland and vastly empty landscape. There are many other problems that detract form the stated goal of this game, feel free to visit the Code Masters Forum pages on this game and see for yourselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86058">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately they ruined the Operation Flashpoint name by turning it into yet another run-and-gun game. Oh, and multiplayer will be dead in months. I&apos;m sure most of the other comments here cover what the title was meant to have but was conveniently left out, or grossly exaggerated.</span>

The game does not live up to any of the claims of the developers, The trailers are complete lies, anything you see in them you do not expect to happen in game. The game play is slow and clunky, the feild of vision is narrow, you need to shoot enemies in the head if you want to kill them instantly, otherwise it will take 4 to 5 shots to kill them, ingame colour scheme is horrid the colours are all washed out. You have to stop to order your squad, multi player is slow, kind of like the in game sprinting, and there are no dedicated servers. The port from console looks just like that, they&apos;ve hardly put any effort into it at all and the list goes on. If your looking to a sequal to Operation Flashpoint that is a war sim then obtain ARMA2 much better game play and less buggy (and also made by the same developers who created operation flashpoint).. Codemasters this was a really disappointing effort, lots of hype for a wholly unfinished, boaring buggy basicly unplayable game.

Game is not simulation as ARMA or arcade like COD, but some sort of renegade hybrid in between that have gone wrong.Not worth $39.99, more like at most $19.99, if you really must have it.

Visuals like textures, model detail, terrain detail or visual distance are HEAVILY reduced for the game to be able to run smoothly on consoles (yet it&apos;s the same on PCs) and it is covered with overusing &quot;fancy&quot; post-processing effects, concealment like bushes disappears after you move from it a couple of meters (making anything hiding behind it exposed), most of the animations are weird. The 63 entity limit completely blows the expectation of a mil-sim (as this.. thing.. was marketed) as well as the pathetic MP player limits, play area limits and the sad maximum distance between players in coop. Very little MP maps, NO SINGLE MISSIONS (you&apos;re only able to repeat missions from the campaign). The keyboard controls are horrible, the radial command control is very unfriendly, the field of view is very narrow and thus makes you sick, it has no real balancing (the difficulty is the same on all levels, you just lose some HUD gizmos). The AI is bad, sometimes it spawns right before your very eyes,  sometimes the enemy is looking at you but &quot;isn&apos; aware of your presence&quot; until you shoot. This thing is in NO WAY a military simulator and NOT EVEN a tactical shooter. It doesn&apos;t come close to new ArmA series, new CoD series, new BF series... and not even the old Delta Force series.
<br>
<br>Marketing this thing as a milsim and a successor to the original Operation Flashpoin was a baad move. I give it 3/10 - for the sounds of explosions, which were cool, and for a couple of laughs I had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85738">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like the earlier Ghost Recon games but with updated graphics. I.e lots of retro design and aged gameplay. Unfortunately this game also suffers from an extreme amount of bugs and fact errors. It is on par with ARMA2 release, and almost S&#xF6;ldner. Completely useless for multiplayer. Console port is obvious in menus, it is unlikely they&apos;ll sidetrack it more. I can say this, it&apos;s the last game I&apos;m buying from Codemasters that isn&apos;t a car game. They certainly know nothing about this FPS thing everyone is chatting about. Touch and feel is Colin Mcrae 3 + guns. Except vehicle handling takes the skiddy feeling of CM-games to an extreme. The vehicles flings around like you&apos;re sitting on top of a spring. AI has lots of flaws, and is best utilized as flanking bait for the enemy because they respawn whenever you reach a checkpoint. They&apos;re annoying as hell if they stick around and sometimes they treat you to a SMAW round in the back of the head... or whatever weaponry they currently equip.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85676">Expand</a></span>

CM have delivered a game with *no dedicated server* and horrible disconnect issues. If you like multiplayer gaming this isn&apos;t the game you are looking for. They have no intention of providing a dedicated server either so I anticipate this one being dead on it&apos;s feet inside of a couple of months. That aside it&apos;s a passable single-player/co-op game. It certainly has it&apos;s moments and if you pick it up for 20 quid or something it&apos;s possibly worth it. I&apos;ve been regarding it more as a Ghost Recon sequel than an OFP sequel and taken like that it sort of works. The graphics are kind of ugly and blocky up close but seen at a distance it looks pretty decent and has very little in the way of slowdown even looking over an open field covered in smoke and exploding stuff. I suppose the 64 unit per map cap helps out here and the effects aren&apos;t that technically impressive. Taken together though, it is kind of cool advancing behind smokescreens from friendly artillery or sneaking around avoiding patrols with your thermal sight. Animations are a bit dodgy. They look weird in places and considering how much of a song and dance they made about making it all &quot;as real as it gets&quot; they&apos;ve got a lot of stuff wrong. Sound design is basically competent although the guns sound kinda hollow and plasticy. It&apos;s especially noticable that the heavier calibre weapons lack boom. Voices are less robotic than ArmA2. The AI has some really nice touches (they pop smoke and run away :D ) but is kind of inconsistent in places. They&apos;ve also toned their accuracy right down so they now shoot like Star Wars stormtroopers. The missions are mostly quite well thought out. Unlike the recent Ghost Recon games the recon team you play for half of the missions actually recon stuff and sneak around calling in airstrikes. The assaults actually feel assault-y in that you have friendly units backing you up. There&apos;s a few places where bugs or poor checkpoint placement had me punching the wall in frustration though. Also, there&apos;s only 11 missions and after you&apos;ve played those, what then? Controls are a bit weak. It&apos;s obviously a console control scheme ported to PC. The command interface is clearly designed for d-pad. On PC you press a key to bring the menu up and then use the primary movement (ASWD) keys to give orders. It feels incredibly clumsy. Considering you have number, f- keys and a keypad on PC it seems like a poor choice. There&apos;s no lean keys... because the d-pad is being used for commands. Vehicle controls are laughably bad. Considering this is an engine developed for racing games the jeeps handle like hippos on rollerskates and the steering goes straight to full lock so you spend most of the time sliding/floating along above the ground. I should also say a word about them claiming this is the &quot;true sequel&quot; to Operation Flashpoint. It really isn&apos;t. It&apos;s much, much more limited in scope. It&apos;s really only about squad/fireteam sized infantry shootouts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86047">Expand</a></span>

The good things: It&apos;s slightly more on the realistic side compared to the pure run-and-gun shooters, and the performance is good. Negatives: The realism they advertise just isn&apos;t there. Starting from extremely poor physics down to an invisible shield(!) that makes sure the AI won&apos;t hit you with their first shots, or if they&apos;re more than a few hundred meters away, and they have a very hard time hitting you even after that. Vehicle handling is an absolute joke, and there&apos;s not much to say on the flightmodel of helicopters(or the lack of one). Both friendly and enemy AI do a poor job at soldiering, and as already mentioned they can&apos;t hit the famous side of the barn. Weapons are very arcadish, and hitting targets at full auto is no problem.The good performance comes at the price of very outdated graphics, and for god knows why they&apos;ve applied strange color filters everywhere. Nights aren&apos;t dark at all, but look like daytime with a blue filter. Other times the whole world is yellowish or greenish, but never natural. The SP campaign is short, easy, repeative and gets boring very soon. MP is severely limited and just doesn&apos;t function properly at the moment. Conclusion: Use your $40 on beer. The entertainment that results lasts longer and is of better quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86084">Expand</a></span>

Corridored play ( no open dynamic world here ), unbelievabley broken MP with no dedicated servers for PC, constant disconnects when in game, no cd key authentication, no anticheat ( the game has already been hacked to bit&apos;s and the leaderboards rendered pointless ). Maximum amount of entities in any one mission = 64 /= massive large scale feeling. How magazines rated this game highly is beyond me. Maybe they just didn&apos;t want to loose the advertising revenue. In conlusion - OPFDR is average in SP, completetly pants in MP.

Just make some civil missions without guns where you just walk all over that island.. omg i still have that feeling of huge disappointment.. And thoughts are like it will never happen again, the kinda game OFP was.. Will be forever in my heart!

First off I cant get it to run on my XP64 at all, gladly there are already forum threads concerning that issue - sadly none of them got a solution ... . On the other hand I got it to install on Windows7 64bit Laptop and it actually works. However it is not possible to force it to run with the native resolution of the LCD so its all blurry. After several hours/days of trying to install and set up the game the way I would like it I had to resign and admit that the game and I are not compatible and that the game is way more persistent than I am. As for the few minutes I played this game with the settings I was forced to accept I have to say that it totally does not deliver what it promises graphically and technically.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=742095">Expand</a></span>

The decisions are baffling.. For example, you have this huge 250 km open world, and ideally your one set soldier that&apos;s part of one set squad roaming the open world taking out enemy defenses and any objectives that are radio&apos;d in by HQ, but the developers decided rather than that they just load you up as random soldiers in different parts of the map for each of 11 missions. The objectives are in the general area you&apos;re loaded into, rarely do you travel over a kilometer, so you NEVER get immersed. You load in complete an objective and then you&apos;re a new guy in a new place that has to do an objective in that place. Also, you have NO say in your class/loadout. I like beinga sniper, but no, the game makes me a rifleman in every mission I&apos;ve done so far and you have no choice in what equipment you want to role out with. The MP is practically the same deal.. you all race to pick a class that the next guy didn&apos;t already take and I&apos;ve never got to play as a sniper yet in mp. These aren&apos;t things that just feel through with limitations, the developers has all the ingredients set out and just used them all wrong. I really don&apos;t understand it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85539">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a nice game in here but it sure does suffer from a bad case of consolitis. The entire multiplayer part of this game screams console game, and that&apos;s a very bad thing. There are no dedicated servers, you can&apos;t join games in progress, the loadout selection menu is very unfriendly, and even the game&apos;s menus which you are forced to repeatedly navigate to play multiplayer games is slow and demands you press enter key instead of clicking too often. All that said there is some real potential with this game. It&apos;s main competitor is ArmA2. There are some parts of the game that are better than ArmA2 and some definitely that are worse. The sounds are definitely better in OF:DR than ArmA2. Much better. Game performance is also much better. The game is GPU bound, not requiring much nearly as much CPU as ArmA2. Also I&apos;d say the game is far less buggy than ArmA2 on release, but there are bugs to be found. The single player game, what I&apos;ve played of it so far, seems decent. My impression is the AI is decent or even nice to play against. This is not a twitch shooter like CoD. You&apos;ll need to take a steady aim and the gameplay isn&apos;t along narrow corridors. Some people are comparing this to BF2 but it really isn&apos;t like BF2 much at all. BF2 is much better for what it does, PvP and BF2 has a great client/server system which OF:DR does not. Also BF2 isn&apos;t a sandbox milsim. For you BF2 players out there, stick with BF2 for PvP, it&apos;s far better for that. And Project Reality mod for BF2 is in no danger from OF:DR. OF:DR is a terrible PvP game because it lacks dedicated servers and also because the consolitis interface. Really, don&apos;t even think of this game as being similar to BF2. It isn&apos;t. BF2 does urban settings far far better than this game. Is this game worth retail price of $40? It depends on what you want and how attached to the money you are. If you are OK with enjoying OF:DR for 10 or 20 hours and then putting it aside, go ahead and buy the game. I highly doubt without real servers that this game will offer you or almost anyone much replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85548">Expand</a></span>

Game is not simulation as ARMA or arcade like COD, but some sort of renegade hybrid in between that have gone wrong.Not worth $39.99, more like at most $19.99, if you really must have it.

The short is that if you feel like participating as a BETA tester for OFP2DR then go ahead and spend $40.00 or $60.00 on the console side. If you want the Long explanation than keep reading. First I&apos;ll let you know the positive side. The game is open and has great graphics for it&apos;s scale. But that&apos;s where the positive ends. Artificial intelligence: Codemasters bragged a lot about AI but there is simply a lack of intelligence of any kind, if you order a NPC team mate to do something chances are you&apos;ll be disappointed by the result and feel like killing them. They often don&apos;t move especially in multiplayer, they are pretty much useless and cause you to loose the battle online because they are standing around getting shot meaning more points for your enemy without a challenge. -1 point* Multiplayer: Simply put it sucks, there are only two game types Annihilation and Infiltration and for the two game types there are only 2 maps each about 2000 meters across... Far from open world and pretty much making helicopter action boring and impossible. Then there is the bugs... The multiplayer is plagued with many glitches and you&apos;ll often find yourself not able to find a game, and if you manage to find a game it drops you mid game, and if you manage to make it through chances are someone else wont and you won&apos;t gain any XP for ranked matches. -2 points* Controls: Vehicles are very choppy when moving, and ground physics are the worst I&apos;ve seen since &quot;Mario Cart&quot; (the original) Pretty much when you hit a pebble on the ground your vehicle launches in the air about 30 to 40 feet and flips over, if you run into a tree you bounce off it like a toy car off of a rubber ball, and if you manage to avoid the pebbles and trees long enough and steer the glitchy moving vehicle then you run into another problem; there is no free look making the right thumbstick on a 360 completely unbound and your &quot;realistic&quot; inside view of a vehicle feels like a cops dashcam chase. Helicopter controls and physics are equally stupid, as you soon find out that in order to fly you constantly have to hold the right thumbstick up on the throttle while also using the same thumbstick to steer the helicopter left or right, at the same time your left stick is for yaw and pitch, there is no way to change this control without changing all of the controls together at once for ground, ground vehicle, and flight. Personally I like to have inverted helicopter flight and normal FPS combat, but there isn&apos;t any way to do that. And if you get off the ground and get used to that setup no matter how painful then your faced with small arms rifles being able to shoot you down almost the moment you take off and get close to an enemy target. Enemy AI has super-targeting and takes a super uber expensive chopper to the ground without breaking a sweat. -2 points* Campaign: There are many objective bugs that often make it impossible to finish your mission making for a long game based of repeating not based off of having fun. After you finish a mission it can glitch causing you to loose progress, and your AI team mates are pretty much useless but to be a distraction to the enemy while you attempt to surprise the all knowing enemy. But at the same time enemy AI glitches making it all too easy often and unrealistic. Also the story doesn&apos;t seem to co-exist, and you are faced with loading screens from mission to mission making the open world codemasters promised non-existent. -2 points* (the campaign is very important, and lacks attention to detail. An additional -2 points* for lack of customer service and initial release of a buggy game. Until this game gets recalled and reworked or the use of MAJOR patches it will be a mega Fail. I recommend if your looking for this experience on a console then don&apos;t, but if you&apos;ve got a good rig get ARMA II for $50.00 the game is far better and although suffering some bugs, rest assured that the community on ARMA II is very active and the team at Bohemia Interactive listens to it&apos;s consumers and does actually work very hard at fixing bugs in the game. There have been enough patches to date now that bugs are rare, especially when compared to Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. If your on a console then go ahead and get yourself CODMW2 when it releases at least you will have fun and have the confidence that the game has been tested prior to release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=85889">Expand</a></span>

If you love COD type play only, this isn&apos;t for you. No spawn/kill/die in this. Most missions you will go something in the way of 15:1 K/D ratio and played well might take 30 minutes to an hour. 11 missions plus 6 bonus missions are available. Tons of user created missions are already out and more on the way. Plus you can make your own in a near drag and drop way. Plus you might enjoy the ability to fly transport and attack helos, drive tanks and APCs. I truly enjoy this game right out of the box and have high hopes for a few minor bug patches, so AI tweaks and the clan server files. If that happens and this is an easy 9-10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=86037">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not a sim either, like the original Flashpoint (made by Bohemia Interactive). Codemasters cut so many features and straight out lied on so many points with thise game, for the sake of gaming do not buy this game. If you&apos;re looking for a good military simulator go buy the original Operation Flashpoint, or the spiritual successors ArmA and ArmA 2. Both ArmA games are made by Bohemia Interactive (the makers OFP 1), and is better than OFP DR in EVERY single way.

Glitches/Bugs, The game was designed for 360 ported to PC and PS3. The PS3 has the worst graphics. All games have problems though, mostly in Multiplayer. It is a FUN game, but this is ruined in minutes.</span>
