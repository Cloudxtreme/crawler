<br>The game is even more tactical and the large maps add a whole new strategic dimension to the game.
<br>
<br>The new factions are all unique in their own way and add alot of character to the game.

<br>The best strategy game without any doubt since both multiplayer and single player are now extremely fun and provide many many hours of gameplay.

<br>Once again players have to think about troops and how they are used. Infantry in the open will be mowed down by anything, but in a forest they are a worthy force. Players will always need air support behind their Offensive/Defensive lines, supply trucks must refuel and re-arm units and so on.

The scale, relative realism, camera freedom, level of detail and graphics are amazing compared to other RTS games.  Company of Heroes is the next closest thing but even then units can&apos;t hide in the jungle and the zoom is limited.  Being able to seamlessly go from the entire map view to zooming in to see infantry crawling through the jungle is awesome .
<br>
<br>Moreover the deck system, logistics system and resource system in WG:RD is superior to the arbitrary and nonsensical resource mining, tech trees, base building and off-map support of run-of-the-mill RTS games.  Never have I heard of a military that produces all its equipment on-site by mining resources, it is an absurd premise born because of technological limitations of the time.  This basic formula however has little evolved.  Wargame however is the next evolutionary step in RTS gaming.  In wargame you select units for your army then draw upon this pool of units as reinforcements after choosing a starting lineup.  When you run out of a type of unit you can&apos;t call anymore for the rest of the battle, like a real army.  Vehicles also run out of fuel and ammunition so logistics and supply lines are well simulated compared to other RTS games.  Careless players can get stuck without fuel and ammunition behind enemy lines leaving even the most powerful and expensive units useless and easily destroyed.  Logistics also heal/repair your units and can be attacked to reduce the opponent&apos;s endurance.
<br>
<br>I could say much more about this game but long story short it is a fantastic piece of work and worth purchasing for anyone who&apos;s a strat gamer or interested in cold war era military.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615277">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve always loved and played RTS games but the Wargame&apos;s are way too.. Complex and confusing. There are no guides to help you in-game, no tutorial mission, nothing - aside from very small guides that are only a sentence or two long (not to mention the only thing that they cover are the things that hardly matter.) The AI is insane in this game. On easy you will get screwed. AI just randomly pops units out of nowhere in your secured territory - I can understand minor stealth units, but when tank battalions randomly pop out of a building it makes me wonder. AI always has an advantage over you. I just can&apos;t figure out this freakin&apos; game, all my play time is mostly just me watching ally AI and how it works. Which ends up not being helpful because even your Ally AI goes bonkers. So I don&apos;t know, it looks good, plays well most of the time and is pretty intense but - it just needs a tutorial mission to help newcomers understand this game. For the veteran players that understand this game.. I probably could recommend it, however nothing has really changed from the previous game aside from the Naval units.
<br>
<br>Recommended on sale, around the &gt;$10-$20 range.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5934260">Expand</a></span>

<br>It was an unpleasant first experience, because i got pretty much destroyed at the start of the easiest campaign.
<br>
<br>Anyway, i played it for hours, figuring it out, watching youtubevids, until i got a decent knack for it.
<br>
<br>As stated often, you dont play this game for the singleplayer. It is rather boring, even annoying, when you play on the same map for the 5. time, it feels like the campaign doesnt make progress.
<br>Anyway, a big bonus here are the starting videos, creating a nice atmosphere.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is actual fun, be it against AI opponents or actual human opponents.
<br>
<br>But there are a couple of things that i need to mention that lead to a position that i cant rate this game above 4/10:
<br>
<br>The realism. You expect this game to be realistic, but is not. Sometimes weird things happen without you realizing why.
<br>Here are the 2 examples that stuck the most:
<br>Tanks run out of fuel after like 5 KM. This just doesnt make any sense, even if they were using the roads, on the big maps tanks are not able to cross the map diagonal even once.
<br>The vision of the units. As stated, in the campaign you fight several times on the same map, me even more since i had to restart the first campaign a couple of time.
<br>I just couldnt explain myself why my infantry got so utterly destroyed by my opponents, even if i chose the ones specifically against enemy armor.
<br>
<br>Well here is the solution: I had no scout unit nearby. Even with no tree, an enemy tank on an open bridge close to the city my infantry was in, will not be attacked until a freaking scout unit is nearby. Then suddenly my infantry crushed the enemy armor. It was a joke.
<br>
<br>It may sound like little stuff, but it just keeps piling up.
<br>However, it was an engaging experience, and the game is definitely worth a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5702445">Expand</a></span>

So in my review there will be no comparisons between RD and its predecessors. It will only be based on my impressions as a new-comer after 90 hours of gaming. Also I have only focused on single player since I enjoy the campaigns very much. Furthermore in multiplayer there are many premade teams that steamroll new players, and morons that when they rage they attack their allies. Not my cup of tea.
<br>Actually I am having a blast at the way this game is not based in numbers or sheer force. Many games managed to overcome the numbers factor (Total War series comes in mind) and implemented more depth in the fights. But even then sheer force was most of the time the way to win. In RD, organization wins.
<br>Understanding the mechanics of the game and reading the units&#x2019; attributes carefully is the first step towards victory. Afterwards you will have to study the field of battle. Buildings, forests, hills will change everything as the units&#x2019; field of view is very realistic and you might not be able to see a hidden tank behind a wall 50m away, while at the same time you can see a helicopter 2km away. That said you may prepare some nasty surprises on an enemy who just rushes in an urban area without taking precautions. Flanking a vehicle column marching on a road and destroying it in seconds or scattering AA batteries among the buildings and watching them shooting down 1 enemy airplane after the other is going to make you love cover.
<br>In modern warfare it is impossible for an army to just throw his weapons and flee like in Middle Ages. This is why every unit has its own morale which affects directly its fighting capabilities. If your unit gets panicked it will fight awfully. Morale drops from many factors like rocket/artillery barrages, many sudden casualties, napalm bombs and others. Morale will recover just by staying out of battle for a short time. Another factor that affects units is the stunning. Most of the time when a unit gets many direct hits it gets stunned. For that short period of time it is unable to react and gives you the opportunity to destroy it effortlessly.
<br>Considering all above, having a balanced force of tanks, recon, AA, infantry (only in buildings please) some artillery and light vehicles with AT missiles (they hit tanks really hard) is a must. Recon units are very important since you might see the enemy when he cannot see you and hit him unseen. Make sure to destroy enemy recon units as fast as possible, which is not that hard.
<br>Another way to win which is funny is to cut the enemy&#x2019;s land/air routes by backstabbing him with some cheap tanks. The units that are in those areas are mostly artillery, command units and AA. They die easily, cost many morale points to the enemy and if the last command unit gets destroyed you automatically win, no matter how the battle goes. Morale points determine the number of casualties you and your enemy can take before losing. This is why you should protect your expensive units and keep them away from the frontline (but not too far away from their allies as well).
<br>AI is really cunning. When it is unable to attack head-long, it surrounds your position with support units and fires from all directions. It is painful to see heavy artillery bombarding your heroic units to the Stone Age. Also AI may send some light cheap units to cut off your supply lines and killing isolated command units. From what I&#x2018;ve seen in the campaigns it can surprise you and lay waste in your forces if you do not stay alert. It knows how to use cover very well.
<br>Naval battles: I damn like them. You should allow the opponent to waste their missiles and keep yours until his ships are nearby and have no time to bring down your missile rain. Hiding behind islands and bottlenecking the advancing enemy ships is also a good solution when you are outnumbered.
<br>This game allows you to resupply and repair your units. Cargo vessels and forward bases do the job if you place your units nearby. But their supplies are not unlimited so you should choose WHAT supplies you need. If you resupply some specific units (mostly rocket-launchers) on the right moment you will change the course of battle.
<br>This game in my opinion is a jewel. It is complex, realistic, and this is why you will get destroyed hard by easy AI at first. When you learn to identify the role of your units and your enemies everything will change. Oh&#x2026;the graphics are state of art, but most of the time you will be zoomed out and unable to enjoy them. Sound is unimportant &#x2013; but who cares. Campaigns offer some interesting alternative history.
<br>Try this game if you want a challenge. 9/10, simply because they should&#x2018;ve made a batter matchmaking system in multiplayer and ban asshats when they get many reports. Also some minor bugs. Every other aspect is just great. The haters simply did not spend some time to understand the mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4214829">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only bad thing about the game is the horrendously high learning-curve for anyone who haven&apos;t played such complex titles before. It is highly advised to get a few friends to play with and watch a few guides before heading off into the wild!

<br>
<br>Single player is much improved, and the new asian factions are interesting. Also unlike most other games of today, Eugen offers free DLC updates with new and interesting units for the factions, offering ever-changing tactics as new and powerful units enter the battlefield.
<br>
<br>The game also introduces naval battles. While interesting, are seldom played in multiplayer, since you will mostly be playing on land maps.
<br>
<br>With the new asian factions, introduction of naval battles, epic 10v10 battles on new maps and great soundtracks Wargame: Red Dragon is a worthy successor of the wargame series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4204180">Expand</a></span>

Well im happy to say that the single player has been as far as im concerned been tuned to perfection, and whats even better is that it&apos;s gonna only improve as the patches are released. And im am completely stoked for the future DLC that will focus entirely on a second Korean war in 93&apos;. This is the absoulute pinnicle of what command and conquer had began over 2 decades ago. The French may stumble from time to time in real warfare, but they are the elite commanders of digital combat.

The new naval mechanics adds an interesting twist to multiplayer maps with both naval and ground forces on one map.  Truly, everything you liked about ALB and more!</span>

<br>
<br>Multiplayer is where this game truly shines. The single player is just ok, so in my opinion you shouldn&apos;t buy it just for the SP. Multiplayer has a steep learning curve, but is well worth it once you understand the game play and functionality. Just don&apos;t go in to it expecting another Command &amp; Conquer!
<br>
<br>The deck building function of the game is also great fun in its self and gives you the option to build your own unique forces. You&apos;ll be constantly trying to perfect your deck to be the best it can be, chopping and changing as your tactics change.
<br>
<br>Endless fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4149654">Expand</a></span>

The first focused quite narrowly on a possible Cold War gone hot scenario in Central Europe, the traditional Fulda Gap/Soviet tanks rolling into West Germany kind of war. It&apos;s gone far beyond that now, encompassing new theaters (Scandinavia, the Far East), new nations and new fields of engagement (air, naval).
<br>
<br>Eugen&apos;s Iriszoom Engine is a masterpiece of scaling and design. You can run this game (with blocky, rough graphics) on integrated-GPU Intel laptops, or load it up on a 780GTX with stunning graphics that allow you to effectively zoom from satellite level to individually animated tanks and infantry fighting, deploying smoke, firing rockets and taking fire.
<br>
<br>There are a few rough edges, but given the scale the fact that you will sometimes zoom in and see a tank clip through a tree or the wrong missiles mounted on one of  100 different military aircraft isn&apos;t much to complain about. There are always going to be some grognard-y types who get upset over improper radio antenna placement.
<br>
<br>First and foremost, it&apos;s created and balanced as a multiplayer game. The campaign efforts are commendable but will never be on the level of something like Total War (although I&apos;d argue the AI is actually better than Creative Assembly), and the balancing, patching and tweaking focus heavily on trying to create a competitive forum.
<br>
<br>The &quot;deck&quot; system is one of Eugen&apos;s great innovations, and it remains pretty awesome in Red Dragon. Rather than simply taking a faction or a coalition, you build decks within those categories using &quot;cards&quot; of units at various levels of training. You might stack your deck heavily with powerful main battle tanks, focus on an airmobile helicopter-deployed force or build a peerless air force.
<br>
<br>With over 1,400 units, a dozen factions and multiple deck and unit categories, symmetric balance is out the window. However, good players using teamwork can fight to victory with nearly any deck, and so much of the game revolves around positioning, counter-play and recon that no one unit can dominate the battlefield. Even the most expensive ships, loaded with AA missiles, anti-ship missiles and protective systems, can be taken down if not properly escorted.
<br>
<br>Certain members of the relatively small community can be a bit harsh on new players, but there are plenty joining every day and some of the most helpful players I&apos;ve ever met, as well.
<br>
<br>Red Dragon can be frustrating - when you get stomped by a coordinated team, slightly unpolished at the most detailed levels and will drive to you distraction when your carefully assembled assault gets clusterbombed into the stone age.
<br>
<br>But without the aid of any tacked-on progression mechanics, no paid DLC and a simple public+ladder multiplayer system, the series remains far and away my most-played PC game in Steam, and Red Dragon looks to set the record yet again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4143020">Expand</a></span>

<br>Best strategy game at the moment for sure. beats COH2 and MOW series easily In making sense and realism category.
<br>But its not enough to give it 8 or 9. Especially when they wont learn from previous games.
<br>
<br>Really huge maps and beautiful maps. Again plains and now Ships!.
<br>Rivers can be crossed now by swimming units - no choke points.
<br>You can really go crazy tactic now. It became much harder game since tank spams are not that successful any more. I personally stopped using tanks at all.
<br>Def. you have to be much more smarter and careful with your units.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately instead of fixing basic issues they just keep adding more and more units.
<br>Looks to me they spreading they attention on everything ships, planes and miillion units and nations.
<br>Instead of narrowing and making it flawless.
<br>
<br>After 2 games they finally added some features people were asking from beginning &quot;:
<br>- map view in lobby,
<br>- ban option from room ,
<br>And it only took them 3 games to do it! Congrats Eugene! You are fast learners hehe.
<br>Ask yourself a question why it took you soo long. What kind of people work at Eugene that don&apos;t what&apos;s going on in multi games that you need to sometimes BAN people.  Once again, it took them 3 games to do it!
<br>Stupidity of that team is pretty much visible. Yeah add more units to counter that.
<br>
<br>But that would be it. Still no black list, still no availability to see what kind of deck your team-mate have.
<br>And other simple things that should be straight forward for strategy game.
<br>
<br>Looks like they hit their mind capacity and ideas limit.
<br>Good to know its last game from this series.
<br>
<br>Still no strategy level in multi. It is in single player, but in multi ? nope.
<br>Just one map game where everybody throws units on each other mindlessly without bigger picture option.
<br>
<br>It seems nobody from strategy games devs can do it these days. Wonder why is that?
<br>Would that mean people who make strategy games have no clue about those games and are not fans of them.. like Eugene.
<br>
<br>Eugene studios had potential and some great ideas but it run out of them long time ago.
<br>Since then their motto is &quot;ADD MORE UNITS&quot;. Only because of the  forum they were improving game.
<br>This is just sad.
<br>
<br>Still you should buy this game  despite my harsh review .
<br>Its only playable strategy game going towards realism atm.
<br>But don&apos;t expect miracles here.
<br>And like always in Wargame series - good team-mates. Without them you are screwed.
<br>
<br>I say like this On W:ALB I had 812 hours. On W:RD I have only 100.
<br>So if you didnt played before in wargame series. BUY IT you will love it.
<br>If you did played before in wargame it wont have that initial sparkle to keep you long on it like me.
<br>
<br>Eugene - make good strategy game! Hire some people who actually have good idea about strategy!
<br>I dare you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4544633">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- No UI improvement, like showing the exact road a unit would use when deployed.
<br>- Radar SAMs becoming overly costly with a 50% price hike.
<br>- Decreased detection range against choppers, which combined with the point above and more open maps contributing to helospam.
<br>- 20+ frontal armor tanks being horribly trolled by all the HEAT weapons in the game, as those can engage any value of armor and still cause 1 HP of damage minimum and cause suppression. Where&apos;s the authenticity when one knows the latest tanks of that era were generally optimized to defeat HEAT weapons in real life ?
<br>- Couple the above problem with the proliferation of low-cost (40-pt or less) vehicles with high accuracy HEAT weapons, and you got a recipe for disaster.
<br>- Laugh at how much firepower SMGs have ; under 455m, they utterly outclass assault rifles and battle rifles.
<br>-  Artillery and MLRS becoming overpowered, the former being able to reliably kill anything that isn&apos;t a tank without any spotting, and the latter easily destroying armor.
<br>- Infantry getting shafted by HE weapons because the new formation is extremely tight compared to the previous ones. Get a good laugh when a single RPO shot kills an entire squad at around 300m.
<br>- Useless unit additions such as the CAESAR or the Il-102 ; CAESAR being added, as in the words of an Eugen moderator, because France needed a high-end arty unit (implying the AuF1 wasn&apos;t one), while everybody was expecting West Germany to get a truly-needed high-end arty piece. The Soviet Il-102 is a completely useless addition, as IRL it was completely outclassed by the Su-25.
<br>- Laughingly strong French bias in the game, stronger than in the 2 previous Wargames.
<br>- Ships being horribly unbalanced and coming in numbers you shouldn&apos;t expect in a *realistic* game ; you can deploy more frigates than you can deploy high end tanks. And don&apos;t get fooled by Eugen/Focus&apos; marketing ; there are no NATIONAL navies. &quot;Your&quot; navy are the assets of the side you&apos;re on.
<br>- MGs on transports still unrealistically underpowered compared to the MGs carried by the infantry.
<br>- Cluster bombs having reached a new level of uselessness with the change to damage computation for 0-1 armor...and for still doing ZERO damage to infantry.
<br>- Wheeled APCs still being incredibly overpowered because of their mobility advantage for nearly no cost penalty compared to tracked ones.
<br>- Recon units detecting nearly nothing.
<br>
<br>I probably forgot some other stuff, but if you also read Lemonadrian&apos;s comment, you&apos;d know what a lot of Wargame veterans feel about this new release. The conclusion is Eugen/Focus had potentially a great game, but they&apos;ve wasted their manpower on always more units instead of focusing on the truly important things that make a great game :
<br>
<br>- UI
<br>- Realism
<br>- Game mechanics
<br>- Balance</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4142919">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Eugen seems to have taken one step forward and two back since AirLand Battle. The maps are much more interesting and help prevent the trench warfare found in ALB, however the layout is the same, whether you are fighting in China, Korea, Japan or Vietnam, it&apos;s always gentle hills, slight vegetation and clusters of villages. No swamps, no urban sprawls, it&apos;s like the just changed the art style for the Scandinavian maps.
<br>
<br>The units are a let down as well, there&apos;s no effort with minor details. The Australians and Canadians use the British voices. Every French MLRS has &quot;Friedland 1807&quot; written on the side. Ships glide soundlessly through the water and their massive deck guns use the same sound effects as the small autocannons on an APC.
<br>
<br>Eugen have also seen fit to play favourites, with the French decks recieving a huge variety of vastly more advanced and powerful units, extending well beyond the games time frame, and when coupled with the new &quot;Coalition System&quot; leads to an unstoppable Eurocorps faction that 99% of players will be using online.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is also a frustrating mess, with most games consisting of one team of extremely skilled players, usually Eurocorps players, waiting endlessly for desperate or new REDFOR/PACT players to join their matches. Overall, the &quot;REDFOR&quot; factions seem rather underpowered or largely forgotten, a left to a disadvantage in multiplayer. Realistic, perhaps, but unless they&apos;re improved it will have negative effects and lead to players ignoring multi altogether.
<br>
<br>The campaign is the only improved aspect since Airland Battle, but it still feels underwhelming, with no satisfying conclusions, merely a little box saying &quot;you won.&quot;
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s still a pretty game, and definitely better than most RTS/RTTs out at the moment, but with so many steps back from it&apos;s predecessor, a poorly implemented Naval aspect and a development team who disregard or outright mock player suggestions, this is definitely not worth buying over Airland Battle or European Escalation.
<br>
<br>Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4142651">Expand</a></span>

This game somehow got attention through steam-hype and mysteriously gets a drastically unrealistic user rating presented here. The entire Wargame franchise is quite bland, it doesn&apos;t even bring solid graphics, which would alleviate the mundane burden of control and actually make the game worth putting up with. Please keep in mind that the graphics here are not even on par with games that are 7 years older than this, but rest assured that it&apos;s the gameplay that ultimately ruins it. Although simpler and more arcade-like, World in Conflict is much more fun. More &quot;depth&quot; (lol) does not necessarily equal more fun, especially in the case with the Wargame series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4404081">Expand</a></span>

<br>Would hands down recommend for multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4547060">Expand</a></span>

The game world serves immersion only as an extension of combat. Players are able to custom design their regiments/task forces with detailed data on each unit and multiple transports for the same unit making each unit slightly different from even the others in the same type and kind of unit. These contribute to a feeling of involvement with the task force (10/15)
<br>
<br>Difficulty: Difficulty is adjustable, very coarsely only. Additionally, a lack of precise tutorials also contribute to the difficulty. This contributes to a sensation that the game is difficult as much because the user doesn&apos;t know how to execute commands as much as the base difficulty.  This lack of information drags the game down, players shouldn&apos;t feel like there is a great game they&apos;re missing out on because they don&apos;t understand enough (6/15)
<br>
<br>lasting appeal: If the game does not grab the player immediately and inspire them to look for better tutorials the game will not last long at all. If the player does seek tutorials and let&apos;s plays the game will have staying power for about 3 months. This makes the game mostly average in lasting appeal. Customisation would help but the player must be interested  enough to persevere(6/15)
<br>

After playiing a pair of dozen of battles and an entire campaign, it continues to appear to me as an unbalanced mix between a complex real tactic simulator and a too fast arcade game, with very little maps, where all is a confused mess and you can lost half of your units in a pair of seconds. Really disappointing.
<br>In brief, this game is too complex to appeal to the RTS fans, and too &quot;arcadey&quot; to appeal a real wargamer.
<br>Besides, there also lacks a medium NATO power like Italy, but are instead present very minor powers. A very bad choice to appeal the italian market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5551065">Expand</a></span>

As a moderately experienced RTS gamer, I spent eight hours in-game and several more hours out-of-game reading manuals and watching replays, but this game overwhelmed me and I never got past the original learning curve. This is not a game for casual players.
<br>
<br>Pros: Graphically impressive, very complex tactics, amazing level of detail in unit design (including visibility, perception, armor, range, damage, etc. etc.). Probably the closest thing to real-time realism on the market right now.
<br>
<br>Cons: Extremely steep learning curve, zillions of units and game mechanics to learn, and the developers didn&apos;t support it with a tutorial. The fan community has brought up various resources to help, but general feeling is that to get a proper designer tutorial, you&apos;ll be looking at getting the first game.
<br>
<br>The game is very complex, which means it&apos;ll take time even for those familiar with the older games in the series to pick it up. (First game was purely land, second game AirLand Battle introduced aircraft, this game introduces naval units.)
<br>
<br>I&apos;m fairly experienced with other historical RTSes (although none are as realistic as this one) and I found the learning curve unworkable with the limited time available to me. I put eight hours in-game, trying out guides and putting what I&apos;d learned from fan manuals into practice: my victory or defeat still feels entirely arbitrary.
<br>
<br>The fan community does have folks who are willing to tutor you, and there are efforts to put together a , and if you have a lot of time and attention to put into this game, it may be the game for you. (Likewise if you don&apos;t mind buying the first game and working through that as a prelude to playing this one.) Folks who find analysis to be fun in its own right, or who are detail oriented, may enjoy this game too.
<br>
<br>I found the time demands of learning the game to be too heavy. I disapprove of the designer&apos;s decision to essentially shortchange new players by removing the tutorial on the assumption that they&apos;ll have played the prior games. The fan support is very heartening, but it seems to reinforce the designer&apos;s laziness so they can get away with it.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s all the hallmarks of a good game in here, provided you can devote the very significant time and focus requirements to crack the shell. However, thanks to abysmal tutorial support and an unforgivable assumption that you&apos;ll buy and play the prior two games in the series (a business model that was already proven defunct in the 1980s with the Wizardry series), I couldn&apos;t recommend it in good conscience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wargame-red-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6034236">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>With more than 1000 different units, you can set up a lot of individual decks to play with.
<br>The game is really fun, if you are into RTS.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer, especially the tactical multiplayer maps with low income are really fun.
<br>I just wished, there were more maps that people would play with low income...</span>
