It one of the best games I have ever played, the story drew you in, the characters were developed well, the level design was gorgeous, the soundtrack was brilliant, the acrobatics were great, turning back time was just freakin awsome... But if I just had one gripe, it would be the fighting mechanics. It didn&apos;t annoy me too much, but after a while you get over how cool the Prince is as he continnously jumps obver enemies, it wasn&apos;t as refined as Warrior Within&apos;s freeform fighting system alloying you more freedom in using the environment and style of play (that was the only good thing about WW). But this dosen&apos;t tarnish POP:SOT, it is still one the most brilliant games I&apos;ve ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=1404835">Expand</a></span>

Plus, this game wasn&apos;t much of a challenge. All in all though, it&apos;s one of the better games that I&apos;ve played recently.</span>

There&apos;s one bit in the game where you can&apos;t use it and it makes you appreciate it so much more. It&apos;s almost as if that section of the game mocks all other platformers! I had several happy nights drinking apple cider and playing through this game. It&apos;s magical and you really grow to like the characters. Just like Final Fantasy or Call of Juarez, this game&apos;s story actually stayed with me. Most games don&apos;t manage that. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=740519">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>this game has an story that is fun to follow with excellent written characters (basically 2 characters but better 2 great character then a million horrible ones, yeah elder scrolls I am calling you out) anyway the gameplay is very smooth mostly because you can rewind time when you die, which will happen a lot the combat is a little repetitive but it is okay. overall an amazing game</span>

There aren&apos;t many issues with the game. The combat is fun despite its lack of depth, but if you look at more modern games like Assassin&apos;s Creed, even PoP SoT does a much better job at making the action feel lively and fluent. Rewinding is also a a feature which was years ahead of its time, and was to be adopted not by action-adventures or platformers, but racing games. Graphics  for this game&apos;s genre at the time remain unmatched too. The level design deserves high praise too, with innovative challenges that don&apos;t take a genius to work out what you&apos;re meant to do. The gameplay elements are well-balanced so you won&apos;t get bored, and will want to keep playing to find out what happens next in the story. This is well-done because cutscenes aren&apos;t too long and the story is told gradually to keep your interest. This game to the genre in 6th generation is what Batman Arkham Asylum is to 7th gen. Truly a well-designed, market-leading game in every aspect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827876">Expand</a></span>

In other words, I really don&apos;t think the combat ruins the game, or even lessens it. It just doesn&apos;t make it better. Still a favorite game, and definitely one everyone should play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=3858056">Expand</a></span>

The control of movement is based on camera position so when the position of camera is changed(this happen as you are moving through) you just start running in different direction than before. In fights sometime camera so stupidly placed you see big pillar and you and your opponents are hidden behind it. But that is not the worst problem of fights, that is definitely auto locking of targets. It is quiet terrible, you have to finish your opponent with your dagger when he is on the ground, but even when he is in front of you and is the closest thing to you the prince actually start attacking somebody else who is not not even next to you nor are you facing his directions instead of finishing that poor sod under your foots. This is pretty annoying as the opponent just stand up while you try retake control over prince. Also  jumping and rolling is on same button and the action is taken based on context so it is quiet usual prince is doing something else that you would wish him to do.  All the other things as graphic(taking the age of this game into consideration), soundtrack, originality of location and game play are pretty good and I really enjoyed cooperation with that girl who is following you, the puzzles are fun maybe little bit to easy and overall the quality of this game is really good, but the problems of control system is drawing it down  and I cannot make myself giving it more than 6 points.
<br>If the control system was working properly a would give it 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032791">Expand</a></span>

The controls and camera are perfect, waaay better than in the other games of the series though it is the most ancient. Graphics haven&apos;t aged much but the game doesn&apos;t support HD resolutions. The story is amazing too. Instant favorite.</span>

On newer computers at least on mine I have to set the graphics to low in order to play it. I guess my 16GB of ram and GTX560 is too much for it to handle. The fighting is good but I can&apos;t play the game due to the horrid controls.

TSoT have a great puzzle design, and in terms of free-running, definitely a lot more challenging than AC, as you need to press the button for the corresponding action, not holding three buttons at the same time and let the PC do the obstacle-clearing for you. At times, the puzzles are so complex you&apos;ll spend 1 hour+ finding your way through. But when you do get them, it&apos;s extremely satisfying. However, as most console-to-pc games, they have bad controls and camera movement. Dodging from enemies is very hard. Talking about enemies, they&apos;re very hard and complicated. The enemies won&apos;t die easily, and furthermore when they die, you need to absorb the enemies&apos; corpses into your dagger, otherwise they will rise again and you have to fight them, again. Things got even more complicated when there&apos;s 4-5 enemies at a time, and when one enemy is killed, another one will come and replace him. If you&apos;re planning to buy this game, expect your patience level to be tested to the max (and your bladder XD).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=1658028">Expand</a></span>

Taking advantage of the &quot;sands of time&quot; system is a wonderful, creative way to implement lives. However, the camera panning is simply horrible. The camera jumps when entering certain areas, forcing the player to use different movement keys to move differently. The gameplay also gets quite repetitive after a while... Running, wall-running, jumping from here to there, etc. Enemies are all the same as is the combat. I am trying to complete the game, but I keep quitting in frustration due to the increasing boredom I receive from playing for too long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=3129309">Expand</a></span>

During combat you often attack the wrong enemy (like you use special attack on a standing enemy instead of finishing one off). It&apos;s an old game (and games evolve quickly), but it&apos;s not too bad, and it still looks okay (it&apos;s not like the early 3D games which are pain to look at). It works great on **** computers too because of that. I&apos;m using the GOG version, I heard they fixed a few bugs. I&apos;m not sure how widescreen works, maybe it stretches it, but I didn&apos;t see it unstretched, so I don&apos;t know. Story&apos;s great. It&apos;s a great game, you should play it, you should play the whole series. I played the other games when I was young and I loved them, that&apos;s why I decided to play this now, and I&apos;ll replay the other games after this too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=5390521">Expand</a></span>

Each room and area has a gorgeous design and the platforming has been done well. The combat can get repetitive once you are long in the game even though they have tried to keep it fresh by introducing new enemies as we progress in the game. The story line is romantic, charming and gripping with its sense of adventure and loneliness. The puzzle solving is downright fun and the voice acting is awesome. This is one the best games ever to grace the consoles and PC. The score is extremely good with the Persian chorus and music; will have the gamers immersed completely in the game forgetting about the real world. A must play game.

<br>
<br>Slashing through hordes of the same enemies that spawn over and over and over and over and over using the same move that works on all enemies was tiring as hell. Solving puzzles using acrobatics felt cool at the beginning, but even those became a bore after a while.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is atrocious! At times it was so cringy it hurt my ears.
<br>
<br>The camera, oh god the camera... changing angles at the most inappropriate times causing you to suddenly start running the wrong way or fall off a ledge and die. Die. Die. Die. I must&apos;ve died about 600 times. This game really played with my nerves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=7440595">Expand</a></span>

Though our hero is the acrobatic kind, do not expect having to do accurate jump sequences or anything of the sort. Sections with falling floors serve a purely dramatic purpose - you don&apos;t actually fall and you don&apos;t really need to pay attention. This is more of a puzzle game where you have to find the accurate path through a series of obstacles and/or traps. This isn&apos;t so bad in itself, but if you&apos;re looking for a platformer, this is probably not the game you&apos;re looking for.
<br>
<br>This game has several issues, however.
<br>
<br>Context-based gameplay: Only a few buttons are used to control the prince and he pulls off amazing stunts and a lot of different moves. This is all context-based, meaning he will do a different thing depending on what&apos;s in front of him. Having said that, it&apos;s difficult in some places to make him do the exact thing that you want him to do. When your angle to the wall isn&apos;t correct, he will run along it, instead of running up. When in battle and you&apos;re parrying and suddenly the enemy is too far away, he stops parrying and might run up a wall if you&apos;re close to one because these actions are controlled with the same button. This comes along with fairly poor controls where the running direction in enclosed spaces is hard to control. Since the camera occasionally changes perspective automatically, the prince will suddenly run into a different direction, which is very annoying.
<br>
<br>Camera system: To be honest, I have never seen a game with such a poorly implemented camera system. Some people say it&apos;s an issue with the PC port. I do not care. It&apos;s bad. The camera bounces off off walls and make &quot;swooosh&quot;ing noises. Who came up with that? Sometimes the camera moves into the exactly opposite direction than I move the mouse. What the heck? The camera is jumpy, suddenly changing perspective (making the prince suddenly change direction -.-), but sometimes moves so slowly that I have to lift the mouse several times. Horrible. And then there are those places where the camera is fixed in one spot. Although the intent of the developers was to point the player to the next step of the puzzle and to simplity the controls the seem not to realize that all sense of 3D is lost when the camera doesn&apos;t move. There is first-person view to overcome this, but it&apos;s stil annoying.
<br>
<br>Combat: The combat looks interesting, but ultimately is mostly button-mashing. Just keep pressing buttons, the prince will do SOMETHING. There&apos;s no skill or tactic involved. And the battles are too long with respawning enemies. This kind of combat is a major turn-off.
<br>Auto-aim: No, I want to attack that OTHER guy! Oh, forget it. He just does what he wants.
<br>
<br>Pipe levels: Some levels must be called that, because you just keep going forward, avoiding traps and overcoming obstacles. Forks in the road appear only very occasionally. Some levels in later stages of the game, however, have a very interesting level design and it really takes a while to figure out how to get through.
<br>
<br>Gameplay segregation: I just made up that word. The game is very clearly divided in combat and puzzle sequences. Instead of occasionally running into an enemy while making your way through the palace, there are combat scenes, where you have to defend against several enemies at the same time. And then there are actually 20 of them! I would have preferred a more mixed solution where you run into enemies more frequently, but only have to fight a few. This game, however, feels like it&apos;s actually two different games...
<br>
<br>&quot;Sands of time&quot; also has several good points:
<br>The visuals are very appealing. I have to say that the game aged very well. It&apos;s still very nice to look at. The palace looks very realistic, the textures are nice, the monster design is good. Wonderful.
<br>Puzzles: The puzzle sequences are easy in the beginning, but become more challenging as you advance in the game. The puzzle elements (puzzles, pillars....) blend very well into the surroundings.
<br>The story is quite interesting (though I&apos;m not through yet and don&apos;t know how it evolves). The interaction between Farah and the prince is nice - she will actually react to what he is doing, like holding her breath when he is about to fall. Very nice.
<br>
<br>To conclude... I think &quot;Sands of time&quot; would be a great game if there was no combat and if the controls and camera weren&apos;t as horrible as they are. But unfortunately, these blend directly into the gameplay in an action puzzle game, so I give it a fairly mixed score. It&apos;s not fun to play for me because of the controls and camera system :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/user-reviews?user_review_id=4816888">Expand</a></span>
