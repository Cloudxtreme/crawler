Second, it is a half-buttocksed port; a game with massive hardware reqs and fancy shader operations and other junk, and it doesn&apos;t even support widescreen resolutions. It&apos;s hard to fathom why a game released in 2007-- and 2 patches later-- would not have widescreen res support. And that&apos;s the thing: you can download .bin hacks that will get those resolutions working, and you can play with settings. A lot. And when tweaked, the game looks pretty good-- the first few levels are very reminiscient of the HL2 universe, but not as pretty or as well done.. All that said, the maps are BIG. Where you might have as many a 5 zones load in the Source Engine, in R6Vegas it&apos;s seamless. The size of the seamless world, and how the player finds cover to shoot, rappels, and controls teammates is the best thing about R6V. The stiffness and awkwardness of the NPCs, particularly the enemies you face, and the ever-present HUD, is the worst. I can&apos;t say much for the storyline, since I haven&apos;t played much of it yet, although it seems somewhat juvenille.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=394886">Expand</a></span>

This is the first FPS game that i have played that actually made you feel like you were a highly trained expendable government asset. The player animations were very realistic, almost too good. One of the only problems I saw was with the graphics. They seemed a little grainy to me, and there weren&apos;t enough options in the menu to mess around with. After trying different combinations in the graphics menu, I was able to get 20-30 fps and still make the game look pretty darn good. The port job they did to get this over from PS3 and/or Xbox360 was a 4. (on a scale from 1 to 10.) The control scheme was great, the recoil system was good, everything about this game makes it a winner. The storyline was great. It all had a feel of a real terrorist attack. Oh, and did I mention the fact that this is also the first FPS I have played that featured Co-op that was not mentally retarded? Most FPS games have friendly AI that don&apos;t do anything except stand there and shoot, and leave you to do all the work. Not the case here. The friendly Co-op actually worked with you, and got the same amount of kills you got. They seemed as good as you were. The enemy AI on the other hand wasn&apos;t as good. They seemed coordinated, but not challenging enough. Realistic difficulty does help though. Not as much as it should. I also enjoyed the way you take damage. A lethal hit (to the head) kills you instantly, but anything else goes into your body armor, and you get dazed but you recover. None of this armor points and hit points crap. That also added a sense of realism. Overall this game is a masterpiece that has it&apos;s few flaws that will be corrected in the future, and the developers really knew what they were doing when they made this. I give this game an 8.9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=395505">Expand</a></span>

I have to run it in 800x600 mode, although I have a GTX go and 512 MB of video ram, 2 Gz of normal ram and a core 2 duo. The graphics are a bit gratuitous when looked at from this angle, but the result is really amazing. The blood splatters nicely as you plan out the perfect headshot, even leaving nicely textured wounds in your victims. The Vegas levels really portray the glitz and false glamour of the city. I have only played a couple minutes online in coop mode, and have been surprised at the quality of the maps and gameplay. Think Gears of War on this one, if you have experienced that. The only problems with this is the lack of good servers, but this won&apos;t be a problem with VS. mode. Overall, this is a wildly good game, picking up the rotting corpse of the RainbowSix franchise, injecting it with magical reanimation juice, creating a strange and morbid freak of nature more like a mixture of Full Spectrum Warrior, Gears of War, and a little bit of Soldier of Fortune. Oh, and they fixed the AI since Lockdown. It actually works now. I was getting sick of shooting my AI teamates before each mission in that last game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=394147">Expand</a></span>

I agree with Erwin that they are not as good as they should be. I first thought , it was some setting I forgot to turn on but everything was already set to the maximum. Even battlefield 2142 looks more smooth (although it uses an older engine). Besides, the video options are extremely limited. It&apos;s actually sad for a game like this. My AA is already set to 4x with 1240 x 768 (19&quot; screen) but it still looks like I don&apos;t even have it turned on at all. The reason why I still gave it an 8 is because it&apos;s a good game. The controls are superb, the scenery is great and colourful and it&apos;s a joy to play. The sounds are very good on my X-Fi although the in-game sample rate could be higher. My advise: don&apos;t by it to show off your graphics card or to try the Unreal engine. Just buy it for the gameplay which is outstanding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=394433">Expand</a></span>

<br>Many of the general game play is very good. Hiding and being able to peek and shoot or just hold your weapon round the corner and blind fire, abseiling (rappelling). Carry loads are reasonable but a very limited choice of weapons. The one glaring thing every reasonable PC gamer hates, checkpoint saves, there are no player saves. so loose 7 points automatically for this.
<br>
<br>The enemies are trigger spawned and often simply appear from nowhere so it is impossible to &quot;hunt&quot;  as in a true RPG. When they do appear they are not completely stupid and do not just blindly rush. which is a bad side when there is no player save as it restricts initiative. Trial and error, which lets face it is the basis of most shooter/RPG gamer strategies, means doing the whole Bstrd sub-level from scratch if your plan is even slightly off skew.
<br>
<br>Solo play means that unless you want to just sit back and send in your AI team mates, who on the whole are quite well scripted, you are going to spend an entire weekend to complete one section of one level because you will get randomly shot over and over and over and over and well I think you get the drift.
<br>
<br>So Solo game gets a 1. (See no save game would have been an 8, think about that game designers)
<br>
<br>I never play coop or multi but will add 5 as I cant say if it is a good or bad aspect. Although other reviewers do say these aspects are excellent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5183882">Expand</a></span>

Sure enough, Vegas cannot be compared to the old classic for its shallowness and Hollywood style action, but sadly even without this comparison this game doesn&apos;t impress much. With tactical part amputated and action part half-baked we&apos;re left with a bleak and jarringly repetitive gameplay (burst open the door, do all the necessary killing, proceed to the next door, repeat ad infinitum). If this is what the &quot;new genre&quot; brings us I&apos;d rather see it stifled to death in its cradle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=401902">Expand</a></span>

The graphics aren&apos;t too good, the singleplayer is ok and the multiplayer is most of the time horrible. This game is nothing like the earlier Rainbow Sixes and is not the great realistic tactical shooter the earlier PC releases were. The gameplay in general is ok, but the plot is even worse than in Raven shield. Peeking behind corners is replaced by unrealistic third person camera, which shows everything that happens behind the corners and this encourages camping in the multiplayer. Pistols have unlimited ammount of ammo. It isn&apos;t a big problem but it&apos;s still unrealistic. Player characters regenerate after beeing damaged, but atleast there is some blur when beeing wounded. Character customization is kinda nice, but compared to Raven shield and other earlier Rainbow six games there is much less weapons and the weapon stats make little sense (for example 5.56mm is often more powerful than 7.62mm NATO. In real life 7.62 NATO has almost twice the ammount of energy than 5.56mm, meaning that it is often more accurate, with longer range and greater damage). Sound suppressors silence the weapon almost completely and without subsonic ammo. Characters also can no longer go prone. While singlplayer still beeing kinda playable, multiplayer screws everything up. The multiplayer suffers from great ammount of different bugs, which in a way or another makes the playing a lot worse experience. One of the bigest and perhaps the most visable bugs is that you can&apos;t see your ping or the ping or others, including the servers. Server browser is very very bad and servers can&apos;t even have names. These two bugs combined you might rather easily find yourself playing on a korean server with a quite high ping. To addition, the game&apos;s netcode is horrible, causing that you have to shoot several meters in advance in order to hit anything (even on a server with a bit smaller ping) and sometimes a bug causes the bullets to actually hit a bit left or right from the sight of the shooter, even if it looks to him that he is hiting in the center of the sights. There are also several sound bugs, graphical bugs and crash bugs. Long story short: This game is a bad port from a console to computer. It is nothing like the Raven shield or others were and if you are thinking about buying it because you liked the earlier games or you like the console version, you should forget it. Singlplayer is ok, but realism has been mostly forgoten and multiplayer has tons of bugs and lots of lag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=402652">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, that isn&apos;t the case. If you plan on playing this in &apos;Single Player Story Mode&apos; you will be initially very impressed by the eye candy, and eventually wind up disillusioned with everything else. My graphic settings are maxed, and even so, the enemies &quot;pop&quot; onto the screen when you trigger scripted events. This ruins the immersive quality of the great graphics. The friendly AI does work much better than previous renditions of the game, but they still tend to block your line of fire when following you -- this will sometimes get you killed. The most painfully obvious vestigal appendage however, is the &quot;checkpoint save&quot; feature notorious in console gaming and despised in PC gaming for years. If you buy this game and want to LEAD your team, (rather than simply send them in to do all the fighting for you) plan on playing, and replaying (and replaying and replaying) the same parts of levels over and over again as you are not allowed to save when you want -- only at the aforementioned checkpoints. This essentially ruins the single player game because you spend more time replaying the same levels than you do enjoying the storyline. What&apos;s worse, you replay so often that you begin to memorize very quickly where the scripted spawn points of your enemies are. The saving grace for this game is the fact that the multiplayer game modes are quite fun. Both cooperative and competitive modes allow you to enjoy a LAN game with local friends. Because you can set the respawn option to true, you will only respawn at checkpoints if everyone on your team dies in co&apos;op mode. A down side is there are also realatively few weapons in the game. Gone are the M-14, the M-16, the AK-74, and the M-60. While these guns may have been out of place in the story mode, it would have been nice to see them in multiplay. In the end I&apos;d rate the single play version of this game a 2, and the multiplay version of this game an 8. It&apos;s a sad testament to how starved the PC gaming industry is for real talent that gamers have to make due with console ports if they want to play cooperatively with friends in a game. Either way, this game is a decent multiplay value. Micasa - As a friendly aside - you might want to look into optimizing your system. I currently run an Athlon 3700+, a Geforce 7800GTX with half the video ram of your card, and 1 Gig of system ram. With this configuration I can run the game at a 1280 X 960 rez with all settings maxed and virtually no lag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=394301">Expand</a></span>

In classic early 2000&apos;s Ubisoft/clancy style, the locations are both contemporary, atmospheric and ultimately immersive. The game could have definitely used more contraptions and tactical approaches but the trade off means that the action keeps moving forward in a pure 90&apos;s SPEED movie style. That said, you can forget about storming a room in pure FPS style, you will learn to be very cautious about  your every move; This is an aspect I particularly respect about its design philosophy and what makes it ultimately rewarding. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a seriously bad case of cheap deaths and when paired with the downright atrocious checkpoint system, the experience ends up suffering from it in a significant way. If you can get past that, there is an engaging formula that knows how to satisfy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-vegas/user-reviews?user_review_id=6272665">Expand</a></span>
