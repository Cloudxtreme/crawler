I wouldn&apos;t mind the console port that much, if it&apos;s done properly. However, lack of leaning, custom game saving and quite deteriorated shading (yes, shading) even when compared to the first game released 5 years ago, back in 2005, have affected the final score. On the positive side, the ending wasn&apos;t that bad, comparing to most of today&apos;s FPS and other popular genres. Sticking to the original story, settings and weapons is also for commendation, although I find it way too sci-fi comparing to the &quot;mild&quot; sci-fi atmosphere of the first part. Graphichs are mostly good, except for the shading which probably suffered due to consoles. I&apos;ll mention a few more bad moments that ruined the game to an extent: glowing enemies in SlowMo mode, tagged and glowing stuff (intel, weapons, grenades etc.), bad level design in about 1/2 of the game, playing on hardest level is still too easy even after the patch (which should fix it), AI is often not very bright which has been compensated by the quantity... Generally, I don&apos;t like killing zillion enemies and have a feeling that I accomplished nothing, which is exactly what awaits you. I&apos;d rather kill 5 guys each level, but they should make me sweat till I do it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=746868">Expand</a></span>

It just doesn&apos;t live up to it&apos;s predecessor, it actually took steps backwards. It&apos;s a disappointment for any fan of the first installment and really doesn&apos;t offer any original twist, creativity or innovation. Like I said though, it&apos;s a solid shooter, just not one that you&apos;ll remember.</span>

A word of warning : this game does NOT support 4:3 and 16:10 monitor ratios (90% of the PCs), it will letterbox your screen instead!! It&apos;s an unfinished product so I suggest you wait for a patch before buying.</span>

I&apos;ve got multiplayer shooters like the Battlefield series for that pleasure. That said i won&apos;t be giving lower points to the online multiplayer part if it&apos;s not that great &apos;cause i simply don&apos;t expect it to be.<br>Having played the first game i can say F.E.A.R. 2 continues the series with good effort, although it&apos;s not as good on all points. To start off with the good i will say that the story and the given setting is the best part of the game, even though the plot can be a little difficult to follow sometimes the story and places your visit will keep you interested and make you want to finish the game to see what happens, which won&apos;t take you very long, 9 to 10 hours of normal play. But it&apos;s long enough in my opinion. If a game is too long a game like this can eventually lose your interest in which case you&apos;ll most likely never finish it at all. Just Cause 2 being a fine example of this.<br>Gameplay wise not a lot has changed since the original, only improvements on some of the core gameplay mechanics and a few new gameplay elements  like iron sighting and the ability to operate a mech suite. In the end nothing shocking really, which can also be said for the gameplay itself, but it&apos;s satisfying enough.<br>The graphics never really stand out above other titles in this genre but it&apos;s more than adequit to satisfy the ones who love graphics. Design and environments play a mayor part too in this and deserve an extra notice. The levels are well detailed, dynamic, destructable and have a good layout and some nicely placed scripted events too. Most noticable level to back this up would without a doubt be the Elementary School.<br>So what&apos;s bad about the game than? Well, it isn&apos;t as scary as it used to be for one. Let me put it this way, if  F.E.A.R.  would be the Japanese horror movie Ringu (which was probably a big inspiration) than  F.E.A.R. 2 would be an episode of Ghost hunters. Maybe that&apos;s a little exaggerated but you get the point, it&apos;s not as scary as you would like and expect it to be in a way the first one was. Next to that the i found the overall sound a bit lacking. In most part this was fine like the music which created some nice tension but i&apos;m talking about the sound effects with the gun sounds in particular. It all sounded a little weak for my taste, especially the shotgun. But these are just small things. In the end there isn&apos;t really anything wrong with F.E.A.R. 2 , the problem lies more in what&apos;s good. It&apos;s just that, good, nothing more. F.E.A.R. 2 never really pops out in any way. So eventually you could say that F.E.A.R. 2 is an above average shooter. Nothing really special, just good.<br>My advise would be that if you liked the original F.E.A.R and it&apos;s installments and you digged the story as much as i did or if you&apos;re just looking for a good shooter to pass the weekend i&apos;m positive you&apos;ll enjoy F.E.A.R. 2. But for those of you who are looking for something new and groundbraking or want a good scare i would recommend to pass on this one, it&apos;s not that special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=1464564">Expand</a></span>

Infact no longer be able to hoster weapons. Still no prone. Be able to crouch, jump and stand. Melee attack (gun butt), able to jump-forward kick or slide-ski-kick across the floor, I think the player only able to do that after he has that critical operation? Press the X key to switch grenade types, but sometimes you need to press the X again to be able to throw out a grenade, though there is only 1 type of grenade to choose from by then (bugs?). New feature to the grenade&#x2019;s explode time, now you can hold onto a grenade in hand, it&#x2019;ll kill you if you don&#x2019;t throw it out in time before it goes out with a BANG. There is a &#x201C;seconds&#x201D; meter in your crosshair when you&#x2019;re holding onto a grenade. Slowmo, when ever you use the slowmo, there is a &#x201C;slowmo&#x201D; meter in your crosshair when it&#x2019;s resource drains, it auto recharges the slowmo when it was all used up. Now the player has a new trick as to move chairs and tables (or other obstructibles) so as to use them as a shield (hiding behind them). The tricks on the chairs and tables are: Slide Cover, Flip Cover, Topple Cover, etc  Has those shotgun and other gun models copy-styled from other games such as Sin and Crysis, Quake Wars, etc  Has changed the gameplay to more the like to other games like GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, Half-Life 2 and SiN Episodes: Emergence. It&#x2019;s turning to more console-favoured game. This is a very good hybrid game, but all hybrids has a limited score</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174600">Expand</a></span>

It then takes the bad bits and makes them either better or worse depending on how you feel about things. F.E.A.R 2 is not how you make a shooter. However the game has a stronger story focus and looks a lot better than number 1 which is always nice.</span>

<br>Visually F.E.A.R 2 is impressive. It features some terrific maps (although it&#x2019;s still a bit too much of a corridor shooter), cut-scenes, and in-game animations, the character modelling is good and it has a host of nice atmospheric touches. It also introduces some imaginative new enemies not seen in the original, including the reanimators, who bring dead grunts back to life as flailing, gun-toting zombies, and pesky, shrivelled guys in shorts, who scurry about like Gollum on speed. F.E.A.R 2 is also pretty creepy at times  it actually made me jump once or twice. It&#x2019;s a shame, however, that these jolts are isolated to brief sections of the game with long gaps between. The story&#x2019;s okay though unremarkable. The combat ranges from quite easy to pretty tough (on the normal setting). The tasks are typical: finding keycards and whatnot  nothing particularly inspiring. So far so whatever  it&#x2019;s a good game but not a great one. On to my main criticisms. The PC controls are a bit twitchy, but more of a problem is the way your character moves. The amount of head-bob is insane. I mean truly bonkers. Beckett bounces along as though on a pogo stick. It irritated the hell out of me and significantly reduced my enjoyment of the game. Then there&#x2019;s the lack of humour. Aside from a few quips within the intel reports there is none. Overall this is a visually and technically striking game that&#x2019;s well worth playing but won&#x2019;t linger fondly in the memory or have much replay appeal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171736">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Recap then, it is excellent FEAR content, if you like the first trilogy as I did. It looks fab, gets livelier sooner, and plays like a dream. Only it&apos;s just too short.
<br>
<br>My real overall rating is probably 7.5/10, but 8/10 is too much given its length. I&apos;d estimate its probably slightly more than half length of any of the first three games.
<br>
<br>I was lucky and bought it for &#xA3;2.50 Steam sale, so I have no complaint, but think before you pay full price. (I imagine it has good replayabilty, as I imagine I most certainly will replay.)
<br>
<br>The expansion F.E.A.R.2 Reborn isn&apos;t so hot either, and it&apos;s extremely short. You play as a replica soldier, so it&apos;s an aside to the game, and not part of it. It&apos;s OK and fun to play at, as all the weapons and slo-mo are there. It is a strange and interesting little side story, but it&apos;s just way too short.

But 4 years is a long time and sometimes innovation is better than playing it safe. That&apos;s exactly why Project Origin falls short of its predecessor. The formula remained the same, but the audience has changed.
<br>
<br>The game picks up right the time when the first games is about to end. To be precise, it starts a couple of minutes before the end of F.E.A.R. You are a part of Delta Squad and you&apos;re sent to place the head of Armacham Technology Corporation into protective custody. It&apos;s when sh*t starts to get serious and a nuclear blast bakes most of the city as a result of the original F.E.A.R. team&apos;s endgame. In the rest of the game you move in and out of underground facilities trying to achieve your ultimate goal. Even though the campaign lasts only around 7 hours the story is detailed and interesting. On the other side, you have to pay attention to every detail that happens around you or told to you on the comm because if not you&apos;ll find yourself lost in the web organisations and projects thrown at you in every couple of hours. At least if you do get lost eventually right before the end of the game everything will be cleared up in 5 short minutes.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is very similar to the first game. Little has changed; slow-mo shooting is still great but the novelty has faded in the past four years. You will meet various enemies during your gameplay starting from soldiers, genetically modified monsters, mechs to ghosts even. The game will always try to throw something new at you which is nice, but eventually you&apos;ll immediately recognize the spacey room where a firefight is going to take place in 3...2...1.
<br>
<br>AI was a strong part of the first game and it returns in the second one too. However, it doesn&apos;t always work like it meant to be. Sometimes the enemies will be clever enough to kick over tables and take covers, but in other cases they will try to rush you through the same door where you&apos;ll stand and shoot them one by one. The Delta Squad, your mates aren&apos;t the most brightest either. Most of the times you&apos;ll see them splitting up and getting killed (because of the story) and the writers could&apos;ve written better lines for the voice actors too. Being a psychological game you&apos;ll never feel surprised of your team members being killed off. What is worse you&apos;ll never feel pity for them because they&apos;re unlikable, two-dimensional dolls.
<br>
<br>Visually F.E.A.R. 2 is a real mystery. On one hand it presents a great world with some stunning lighting effects and great destructibility, on the other hand it&apos;s ugly. Everything looks sharp when you move, but stop for a moment a take closer look at minor objects, like consoles or books on desks. They look downresd, blurry and pixelated. The devil is in the details as they say. In the year when hardware pushing games like Modern Warfare 2, Resident Evil 5 or Killzone 2 were put on the shelves of retailers this kind of laziness is disappointing. One can look aside when it comes to these problems, but then there is the audio. The sounds of guns are just atrocious; every one of them sounds like they were taken out from an 80s Atari 7800 game. Every shot you have to take with the shotgun or machine gun irritates your ears. It&apos;s like firing with toy guns from the crappiest Chinese manufacturer.
<br>
<br>F.E.A.R. is a sharp shooter with its flaws and assets. The formula that made the first game great has aged greatly and the horror factor is M.I.A. in most of the game. Great number of &quot;tricks&quot; has already been used up in the previous title or other games. When the horror is present the game feels like a real successor of the prequel, but those moments sadly end quickly. It definitely has its moments when it comes to shooting (the mech scenes are great), but drawbacks won&apos;t allow to have an experience like with the original F.E.A.R. game.

[Overall score 9.5] Played 2012.04.06 on Steam PC - 3 years after release<br><br>[DRM] Steam only<br><br>[Challenges] This game is not too complicated. Pick up gun - go down corridor and shoot. The atmospherics are mind numbingly intense and addictive; adrenaline overdose is inevitable. I really like the way the game flips back and forth between more standard FPS run and gun  - and the surreal Alma afflicted battles - the flavour is good - and then better - rinse and repeat. Choose your weapons and carry 4 - standard style armaments and the gameplay is tight Tight TIGHT.<br><br>AI behaviour is good - you will get snipped - and you see the patterns soon enough. I played on normal mode and had a good number of reloads; sometimes you are just outnumbered - so you go back to basics - pull back to choke points - grenades, cover and head shots. This game has that bullet time kind of stuff - I did not use it except in the last battle. Hmmmm maybe I should replay this game on a more difficult mode!<br><br>I enjoyed this game so much I will purchase FEAR3 even though the price is still forty smackers. Sometimes you just want to run and gun.<br><br>[My PC] i7-2600K 3.4GHz / ASUS Z68 ProGen3 / 8Gig RAM / Radeon 6870 / 1920x1200 / W7 PRO SP1 Frame rate - smooth as butter. I played this with a Logitech G15 and a Kensington expert mouse - the only way to play! The in-game menu allowed me to remap the keys which then show up in the on-screen instructions and tips.<br><br>[MyFavorites] [Win7x64] FEAR2 Crysis&amp;Warhead JustCause2 Rage [XPx32] DeuxExHumanRevolution&amp;TheMissingLink DeadSpace1&amp;2 Fallout3&amp;NewVegas HalfLife1&amp;2 Bordelands BatmanArkumAsylum AssassinsCreed1 Magicka RedFaction Portal1&amp;2 FromDust MrRobot Sam&amp;MaxSeasons1&amp;2 CulpaInnata TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland DreamfallTheLongestJourney Syberia1&amp;2 CrayonPhysicsDeluxe DefenseGridTheAwakening PlantsVsZombies Prototype Bioshock1&amp;2 UnrealTournament3 FEAR Quake4 [360] AfroSamurai BrutalLegends [XBOX] HALO KOTOR1&amp;2 Crackdown ArmedAndDangerous AggressiveInline BeyondGoodAndEvil DeadOrAlive1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;ExtremeBeachVolleyball Psychonauts [AppleG4] DeusExMachina ReturnToZork Suspended UnrealTournament TombRaiderSeries Suspended [Born] 1964</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315220">Expand</a></span>

For one thing, the PC version has higher res textures for one thing, being double the size of the console versions, also the better precision you get with a mouse makes playing the game more about skill and less about struggling with the analogue sticks. The fact you can&apos;t even use a 360 pad on this shows that it was not ported directly from the 360. As for the game itself, well, the lighting Some people mistakenly say that the lighting in the original is better without realizing that the reason you got so many dynamic lights in the original was due to the closed off badly detailed levels. The sequel has much more detail in it&apos;s environments and it&apos;s actual lighting quality that they had to cut some of the dynamic lights in the game to make it playable on modest systems, replacing it with static lighting, which overall is a massive improvement over the old system. Those wanting full dynamic lights back better be reay to go back to the closed, dull levels of the original for the next game. As for someone saying it relies more on shock, you&apos;ve got it the wrong way round, the original was the one that used the shock tactics, making you jump all the time. The sequel has a couple of these too, but it builds a more prevailing sense of unease throughout the game rather than Doom monster closet moments. The character models are fantastic for the game, with your team mates being nicely detailed and animated, which also goes for the enemies as well. The AI for me has been fine, but I know some people wanted a bigger challenge which is one of the improvements in the next patch which has been confirmed by the devs, along with DLC. The game has been bug-free for me the whole 3 times I have been through it, so I can&apos;t comment on any bugs in the game. The lack of lean is distracting, but anyone who lets something like that put them off this brilliant game is a fool. The story does enough to keep you held throughout, and unlike the first game, it is told well enough that you do not need to seek out external material to explain everything to you. For me it&apos;s alot more interesting than the first, more detailed and more variation, don&apos;t let the naysayers put you off, try the demo, if you like that you&apos;ll love the full game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=422170">Expand</a></span>

I wonder if some of the people complaining about the graphics are running it on lower quality settings as I found the graphics amazing, and probably the first game to slow down my 8800GT.

There&apos;s only one thing you really need to know about this and that&apos;s MOUSE ACCELERATION. The game isn&apos;t great but i reckon it would be a competent if mediocre shooter if not for this one thing rendering it completely unenjoyable. Even with the mouse sensitivity at its lowest setting a fast twitch of only a milimetre is enough to spin 180. It&apos;s no fun to control and just managing where to look gives me a sort of motion sickness and unease. It doesn&apos;t compare well to the original either. Even technically, the one thing you can almost guarantee will improve in a sequel, it comes up short. The enviroments are less destructible and the effects are poorer whch detracts from the combat. The weapon sounds are also less meaty. The slow mo effect is not as nice and it, along with the cartoony blood, makes the battles less visceral which is strange as the actual viscera has been upped. The loss of lean also negatively affects the combat. It&apos;s now more about charging in and spraying than creeping forward. To compemnsate the enmies are considerably less challenging and appear dumber. As a whole the game is brasher and more in your face. it&apos;s ringu isnpiration is obvious but it&apos;s approach to horror is noticeably more American. It focuses more on shocks ans frights rather than creepy and scary. More slasher flick than psychological horror. When you compare it to the underground levels of Stalker it comes up badly short. Also if you don&apos;t play in HD res (1920x1080 or 1280X720) you&apos;re going to have black bars cutting out a portion of your screen. Going by the Steam survey that&apos;s about 99% of people that play PCgames. Congrats Monolith you&apos;ve now joined the ranks of sell out devs may the fleeting cash before your consumed into a publishers development arm prove worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=421784">Expand</a></span>

What I did expect is a long single player play and to get some scares while blowing stuff up and to get deeper into the Alma story. The game delivered exactly what I expected. Never expect ground breaking genre shaking changes.. in a sequel &quot;a big LOL at all reviewers that nixed this sequel because of this. The gameplay is solid, the graphics look better than they did in the original FEAR, and the story is believable. The game also had some memorable occasions like when you have to climb down into the blast crater of a small nuclear explosion and getting knocked off your feet earlier in said blast. Also the elementary school level was very scary. The scenes with Alma are truly creepy and I jumped in the game more than once. It really makes me laugh when a reviewer states as a negative &quot;too many cheezy attempts to scare you&quot; when that is what FEAR and FEAR2 are all about. Next they will complain that shooters use too many bullets. I wanted a game with creepiness and guns and if you also are looking for this, FEAR2, like its predecessor, does not dissapoint. Highly recommended. Also in response to Angry Nuts review, this game is rated M for Mature not T for Teen, go play a game that is designed for your age group and let the Adults have their fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=740565">Expand</a></span>

Game play is pretty much the same if not more tactical than before. I can&apos;t say there&apos;s no reason to flip tables over while getting shot at but running holstered or dual wielding pistols have been taken out. The game is fun, there&apos;s more interactivity, there&apos;s more questions to be answered, and of course there&apos;s more fear. Every step of the way feels unique though the weapons were never meant to be &quot;truly original&quot; like the gravity gun. It felt good... really good, yes like &quot;John Woo&quot; good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=421801">Expand</a></span>

I Love the horryble atmosphere.The sound in the game is quiet amazing!!The levels were designed with so much details and (If you have all Video Settings set to Maxiumum) I think the Graphics (+Effects) are a mixture between R6Vegas 2 and Crysis... so it definitely can keep up with presently FPS! 10/10 points.</span>

Also new people to the game won&apos;t understand all the information given since it is based around a Special ops team not a F.E.A.R team. Would suggest renting this game if you are new to the series since the single player mode only makes you want to play it once.

                                        <span>Fear 2 is another awesome times good shooter from the forge of WB Games.
<br>Alma is back and now you can even attack.
<br>The graphics are a lot better than the predecessor and also the engine can be clearly seen.
<br>There are also lots of shock moments e.g. at the beginning of the game.
<br>
<br>From me full 10 points.</span>

Multiplayer is fun but missing one of everyones favourite game types from the first. However I&apos;m sure they will add this to FEAR 2 eventually. Scary and fun so yeah 8 out of 10, not quite perfect.</span>

If you liked the other F.E.A.R. games as I do I am sure you will love this one. The beginning may turn you off but the overall length of the game and graphic quality make up for it. It has a fantasic audio and music soundtrack much better then its three predecessors. I remember having to suffer through the first three games with 7.1 and random high pitched static that would happen in ceratin areas making the game unplayabe ending in a restart of the game. In all honesty it is probably the best soundtrack/audio I have experienced in a fps. I think it is that good. Besides the lack-luster feel that most Hollywood back games seem to have the artwork and style is good though I find the slow mo and death effects not as good as in the first game. I found the gameplay erratic and unusually easy on the &apos;normal&apos; level with easy mob fights and very hard sniper segments but this should hopefully be better at a higher level. The storyline is very strong in this and ties all the rest together contrary to the confusing ending that I very muched liked. It is a fun ride and worth playing. If you like first person shooters it is a must. It is definately a must if you like to be scared. Monolith&apos;s horror games are slowly becoming some of the best in the genre. Oh is it worth the price? Are any of the first-run games? I am sure there should be two or three expansions out of this. On a personal note, Ah Monolith, lose Warner Bros Games. Hollywood and gaming does not mix...sorry. Hollywood can ruin a classic series of games and has no business in the gaming industry. They ah have a tendacy to make the quality of things how should I put it...go down. And that is a poltie way of explaining what happens when they get involved and their money is more imporant that the actually art itself. Good game guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=421755">Expand</a></span>

I however have only experienced GROSS disappointment as I am unable to run the game at all, it would seem there are thousands of others in the same boat. Official forums are dead when it comes to developer feedback on fixes but there are some efforts from community members in attempting to fix the issues for people. I am technically savy, but when I am being asked to uninstall audio hardware, delete codecs and remove video files in order to be able to play the game with no video or sound I draw the line. The audio component of the original was one of the compelling features of the game. frankly this should not have been released and I will be returning the box to the store I bought it from at the earliest opportunity. Buyer beware, this will likely NOT run and will lead only to dismay and NO support from Monolith or the publisher..... Very poor performance!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=421820">Expand</a></span>

The problem is that Steam won&apos;t let you play until you download a huge patch and if you have a poor or slow connection it keeps aborting and starting over. Nor will it go into offline mode, nor obey the setting not to update the game. as a result 5 days after purchase the game is still unplayable, and likely to remain so. Buyer beware! PS. The first FEAR and it&apos;s expansion packs were a lot of fun. But I guess the publisher never heard of the saying &quot;if it isn&apos;t broken, don&apos;t fix it&quot;. They ruined an otherwise geat game. I won&apos;t even consider getting FEAR 3 due out later this year even if I do get @ working - just too much hassle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=747509">Expand</a></span>

Both times I&apos;ve played them I felt cheated for spending my time playing them. The reason for this was a lack of planning on the developers side. I liked the game play, the graphics, the atmosphere; but in both games I got to one point of the game where I ran out of ammo and could not progress nor could I go back to find ammo that had been dropped (This happened on normal). I spent hours trying to inch-forward only to be destroyed by any grunt who had a drop on me. It&apos;s hard for me to give any good credit when a core aspect of a game such as having bullets in which to shoot enemies some how falls by the way side. Plus the fact that I felt the multi-player to be bland and out dated for its time, and obvious add on. But seriously most games I play I try my hardest to beat, and to challenge myself with hard difficulty levels. So getting to a point where I was out of ammo made me feel out of options. I could not sneak around enemies nor find other option in which to subdue them. So fear goes back on the self with all the other games I&apos;ve rented</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381001">Expand</a></span>

Also, somethings changed and got both an upgrade and a dowgrade. For example, 3 medkits limit, but a stronger body armor; 4 slots in weapons, but some weapons are much weaker than usual (the shotgun is almost useless, since your rifles can kill with 3 shots to the head). We get more weapon variety at least, although few got removed (like the plasma rifle and the possibility of dual wield handguns). We don&apos;t need to upgrade our health anymore, but still can upgrade our reflexes, killing a bit of exploration from the first game. On the other hand, we aren&apos;t totally bind to use the focus and it is possible to kill also without it (but focus is still the best way). The levels now are much more interesting and a lot varied, moving from (well lighted!) skyscraper, to an abandoned city. We also get to use a mech in some parts of the game, and there&apos;s also a bit more of interaction with the levels (even if useless, the possibility to get cover by turning furniture is rather nice). If I have to mention some flaws, one of them is probably the longevity: the game is a lot shorter than the previous game (finished in about 8 hours or less; the first game is almost 10 hours and more). The &quot;scares&quot; in this game, even if well thought, some are just too weak and I hardly got impressed, but on the other hand the scenery is much more cured and, again, varied, even if the game is still pretty linear. And also, the story isn&apos;t totally linked to the first one: the main character is different, and initially it doesn&apos;t really connect, and even if it becomes better later on, it doesn&apos;t feel totally rewarding. All in all, I have no complains on this game: it&apos;s definitely a good upgrade, although it loses some of the scare factor, and the small flaws usually don&apos;t really ruin this game. Still not great game, but a good game and a very good sequel. Worth a try if you loved the first one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2890336">Expand</a></span>

Story: If you liked the first game because of the story, you probably will enjoy this one too. As far as I&apos;m concerned, everything related to the story was quite interesting, and kept me basically glued to the game until the end. The ending made me a bit disappointed but, that&apos;s just me, I don&apos;t care much for cliffhanger endings, though I should have expected as much considering the ending to the first. Basically, the story is solid, the scares and atmosphere in this one are improved, partially due to graphics. Graphics: This game has exceptional graphics, I knew I was in for something impressive when the download size of this game from steam (including the DLC) was nearly 15 gigabytes, a definite improvement over the original. This is one of those linear shooters where it does well to hide the linear aspect due to graphics. F.E.A.R. 1 did this fairly well with level designs, but it was still limited due to the technological capabilities of the time. F.E.A.R. 2 is just solid bad-assery in the graphics department. If you&apos;re computer can handle it on higher graphics settings, you will love it, even for a game released a few years ago, the graphics are top notch in my opinion. Another thing to note is the world detail, all the little things around the world that make it feel real, this game is so real it&apos;s almost disturbing, the interactions of the characters, the lighting, the props, it&apos;s all great. Gameplay: Well, you can&apos;t lean anymore, and I don&apos;t mind that it&apos;s gone, leaning was just another finger on my keyboard that I couldn&apos;t use, does it feel like a console port because they made the interface a little bit simpler? Not at all, the game is a solid PC pickup. It walks a fine line between dumbed down console port and decent PC shooter, the best of both worlds, simple, but not in any way boring. The AI is not worse than in the first, it&apos;s basically about the same difficulty, I assume I&apos;m playing on Hard difficulty post-patch, cause everyone is complaining about the difficulty being too easy, yet I had a rough time on a lot of the levels. Sometimes you really gotta keep your eyes moving, and on hard, you really need to abuse the slow-mo to make it out clean (or at all, I doubt I could have beaten it without it). Multiplayer: The multiplayer component is well done it seems, I find the use of gamespy annoying, but that&apos;s just me, the maps are cool, I really like the pinball machine map, and the customizable loadouts are a nice touch to keep things fairly fresh and balanced. In fact, the only thing that hinders the multiplayer experience for the PC is the lack of players, from what I saw in my short time after buying this game there were less than 5 player hosted (no dedicated servers it appears) games going on, and the first one I joined happened to be in Russia, I&apos;m in Canada, so my ping was awful, but I ended up joining a game where I had decent ping with the host, and it was fun! If there were more than 3 people in that match, it would have been even MORE fun. But I took what I could get, and had a great time, it almost reminded me of the good ol&apos; AVP2 days. Technical aspects: The technical parts of the game are ok, gamespy run ranked matches I don&apos;t care for, but nobody plays ranked from what I saw, the game feels reliable, though some of my tool tips telling me what keys do what in the menus appeared to turn into french? I&apos;m not sure, but &quot;escape&quot; key sure didn&apos;t say escape in the tool tip. Other than that, the only technical options this game could use is the option to quick-save (though I understand why you can&apos;t), and dedicated servers. But here&apos;s the summary, this game is enjoyable; solid graphics (often breathtaking), addictive multiplayer (but a lack of players), fantastic story, very well done, the whole direction of the game is great. The AI is challenging on hard, but certainly beatable. I got this for 10 bucks on steam, USD, and keep in mind the Canadian dollar is higher right now, and I gotta say, it&apos;s a better steal than the F.E.A.R. ultimate shooter edition for 10 bucks (FEAR plus the 2 expansions), because those didn&apos;t come with multiplayer, but THIS did. 10 or 20$ to romp around in a mech that can shred foot soldiers to pools of blood in seconds is beyond worth it alone, everything else aside. It&apos;s not perfect, but it is in no way mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681126">Expand</a></span>

The biggest disappointment is that there are no ranked multiplayer matches (2011), with only 1 or 2 unranked servers online at any given time. It&apos;s a shame since the multiplayer has potential to be fun and perhaps more polished than F.E.A.R. Combat&apos;s. The story is short with a lack of varied environments and gameplay. However, what you do get is of fairly decent quality and there&apos;s nothing like it out there. I played the demo on Xbox 360 and on PC before purchasing and it&apos;s quite clear that this game was made for the PC judging by the wealth of buttons in this game. Overall it&apos;s a decent game but not good value for money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=1963357">Expand</a></span>

There were a few things the developers neglected to add however, that are pretty standard in any modern PC game, particularly of the FPS variety. 1: No Anticheat or dedicated servers for multiplayer. 2: Not able to bind mouse 4 and mouse 5. 3: 16:9 resolution, but where the hell is 16:10?!? 4: No save feature, no auto save feature. Pretty much, only 1 save slot - period. 5: Glowing enemies? Seriously, slow motion wasn&apos;t enough? 6: Amateur shadow work. Dropped the ball there, badly. 7: Glass breaks in a LESS realistic way than Fear 1 (EXTREMELY noticeable in slow-mo) 8: No real time reflections (if there are, there were not on any of the puddles or anything I inspected) 9: Camera clips through your own player&apos;s shoulders very frequently, melee animations are not as good as Fear 1. 10: Despite being advertised as &quot;Games for Windows Live&quot; it does not have any 360 controller support, that is actually part of the live certification, and expected to be supported. Not that FEAR2 is a bad game, but it&apos;s definitely going in the wrong direction when you compare it to the first game. If you guys continue to make games like this, don&apos;t even bother with FEAR3. I don&apos;t even want to imagine what that will be like, and how much it will cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=421739">Expand</a></span>

The combat is great, and the slow-mo feature adds immensely to that. The graphics are absolutely amazing. The animations and scripted events are excellent. The characters, for the most part, are pretty well rounded and solid. The game can get very repetitive, but I think the variety of weapons combined with the slow-mo balance that out. The scary atmospheres are brilliant, and keep the game interesting. Is F.E.A.R. 2 one of the most original and groundbreaking games? I don&apos;t think so, but it&apos;s still very good nonetheless. It&apos;s not really one of those overwhelmingly good games that make history such as Half-Life or Mass Effect, but still a damn good work of art that deserves to be played. In fact, I think it deserves a bit of a higher score than 79.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3069245">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>FEAR2 manages to dumb the whole concept down and create a casual-shooter for drooling call-of-duty-kiddies.
<br>Enemies that GLOW (!) when you activate the slowmo!!! WHat the...?!
<br>Enemies have much less room to navigate and are poorly animated (especially when you compare the first one to this stupid dumbster!).
<br>
<br>Oh, and regenerating health! Don&apos;t forget this &quot;feature&quot; to appeal to all these &quot;gamers&quot; that are too stupid to play actually that good, that they don&apos;t die every second. Pleas! No challenges! &quot; - -
<br>
<br>(of course this &quot;new&quot; and &quot;flexible&quot; design-choice of &quot;REGENERATING HEALTH&quot; doesn&apos;t add any suspence whatever. All it does is giving lazy developers an excuse, to **** up good level-design!).
<br>
<br>And just a Side-Note: The Slowmo-graphics - especially the particle-effects look so extreme bad and unspectacular, that you&apos;ll keep looking for all the particles and destruction you know from the first one. But nothing to see here. HOW THE F*CK DID THEY MANAGED THIS?!
<br>(oh well, after playing the even worse &quot;Fear&quot;3, I know they can step even more steps towards an ugly mess!)
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy this! Seriously!
<br>I&apos;ll dig up the first FEAR again and will play the Sh*t out of it! again. and again. Yeah. It&apos;s that good!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962652">Expand</a></span>

The Point Man is nowhere to be seen, and the combat mechanics are stuck in a bizarre transitional reality between the first and third games. You have very little health, but the controls are so stiff that you will find yourself taking unecessary damage constantly. The &quot;cover&quot; mechanic is laughable, and most guns feel very weak especially the pump shotgun- a game killer for me. On the upside, the mech sections are absolutely cathartic, the music is very strong and echoes the first game&apos;s score beautifully, and there is much more character interaction and good dialogue given the shift in cast from a lone operative to a Delta Force strike team. Bottom line, as a F.E.A.R. fanboy I enjoyed the game, but those just here for the shooting might want to skip it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507905">Expand</a></span>

But F.E.A.R. 2 is the very definition of that and an epitome failure to make a decent sequel to good if not great Windows-PC game. Everything has been made more linear, less faster, more &quot;larger&quot;, less controllable. There&apos;s NO ABILITY TO SAVE THE GAME AS YOU WISH, no quick saves, no manual saves, ONLY AUTOSAVES AT PREDETERMINED PLACES!!! If you die, you&apos;ll lose 5-15 minutes of play time and you need to replay certain spots. F.E.A.R. 2 has terrible FOV, mouse acceleration, you can&apos;t bind all mouse buttons to a functions, plain ugly HDR, and oh god the motion blur is so bad. Everything uses very large font and everything has been adjusted TV in mind. There&apos;s also ALMOST TOTAL LACK OF COOL PARTICLE EFFECTS, and worse map design, bad jumpscares that aren&apos;t even effective, it&apos;s really short game, maybe 6-7 hours long, and worst of it all, it looks, feels, sounds, and acts like it&apos;s a Playstation 2 title. AI has been dumbed down by a large factor... And allow me to highlight how dumb the map design is by noting that the game has SEVERAL DIFFERENT &quot;SECRET&quot; UNDREGROUND FACILITIES with ALL THE POSSIBLE VIDEO GAME CLICH&#xC9;S IMAGINABLE. Maps are also more linear pipes than they were in first F.E.A.R. game. I didn&apos;t even sink into everything what&apos;s wrong with this title. Just stay away from it. It&apos;s one of the worst FPS games ever made. F.E.A.R. 2 lacks self-image and instead is more like bad imitation of Halo 3 from every aspect. F.E.A.R. 2 has no taste at all, and people who call this a good game have no taste at all either. Or are too inexperienced FPS gamers to understand what&apos;s wrong with this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3847175">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is very similar to the first game.  You have slow mo, you have very similar weapons but also some new ones, but you can&apos;t carry as many health packs this time which I think was a good decision.  Enemies are also very similar but there is the addition of ghoul type monsters that break up combat with typical soldier goons.  These segments also provide a new kind of tension that was absent from the first game.  Level design is very similar to the first game but the environments are more varied and there seems to be more polish to break up the monotony.  Like the first the game, FEAR 2 is very short and won&apos;t take you long.  Unlike the first game, however, I didn&apos;t feel as strong a desire to replay this one through higher difficulties.  Maybe it&apos;s just me, but the AI didn&apos;t seem as competent.  There were times when I could just stand near a doorway and blast everyone that walked through it like lemmings.  It&apos;s difficult to put my finger on, but the combat segments didn&apos;t feel like they had the same punch of the first game.  Sound effects, even in slow mo, just felt kinda stale and flat.  In short, there are some definite improvements over the first game but also one or two steps back.  Nevertheless, a worthy sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4497672">Expand</a></span>

<br>As for the game - a very good effort.  By no means it is the First F.E.A.R..  By the same token (and talking about going downhill) it surpasses F.E.A.R. 3 by a skyscraper and then some.

<br>Main things i liked:
<br>- Atmosphere - not as scary as the original, but solid.  Some places kept me on edge.  Well done.
<br>- Sound - although some tracks migrated from the original, music, sound effects, and voice acting deserves respect.
<br>- Story - story telling in this game is damn solid good, and it keeps you going through the game, just to find out what&apos;s next.  Nice.
<br>- Gameplay - some pluses and minuses here (see below) but overall i had a joyful playthrough.
<br>- Level Design - good level design.  Respect.  Detailing is also pretty superb, especially if you consider today&apos;s crap.
<br>
<br>Things i felt needed improvement:
<br>- Gameplay - the game which is designed for PC GAMERS is just superior to consoles.  End of discussion.  It feels different.  It FEELS.  The Original F.E.A.R. felt like you were shooting badasses; everything had gravity and dimension.  F.E.A.R. 2 is a few steps behind in that department - it just feels cartoony, not in terms of graphics, mind you, but in terms of game mechanics - when you shoot baddies, it just doesn&apos;t feel like you are shooting baddies.  More like shooting stuffed toys.  (Compare Hal Life and Original F.E.A.R.).  Yet, again - the crap companies put out today (which is designed for consoles first) makes F.E.A.R. 2 a masterpiece.
<br>- Hud - although the graphics are very good in this game, the HUD just needs to go, or at least be disabled through an option.
<br>- Scare Factor - this is pretty minor.  In some places, the horror factor felt heavy handed and scripted.  But i do not agree with the other who say the entire game was like that - not at all.  See Atmosphere above - you will not have to start the game with three spare pairs of underwear, but the game will keep you in the goosebumpy mood.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>Looking at today&apos;s trend to make games for consoles then port them (horribly!) to the PC, i cannot give F.E.A.R. 2 less than a solid 8/10.
<br>
<br>Dev&apos;s, please wake up!  Look at some old games and remember why you became Game Designers in the first place!  Start making games for PC GAMERS again.
<br>And Publishers, your rating is dropping rapidly.  Perhaps it is time to start earning Respect that you have lost from those who supported you and saw you grow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-2-project-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=6658878">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Mouse Accelerator: OMG why?
<br>-Holo-pad? the blue circle in the ground, you must pick up every single one, and read it. There is the only way to know WTF is happen, or you can skip it and miss 90% of the STORY
