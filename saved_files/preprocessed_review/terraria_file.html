I will start by saying I bought Terraria one week ago and when I first started I was like &quot;what the hell do I do here&quot; and before long I was devoured by zombies, I left it for about an hour until a friend noticed i had bought it and asked me how I liked it, after an in depth discussion and a link to the wiki I had another shot at it. With the help of the wiki and my friend I really got into the game, after four days playing we had beaten the eye of cthulhu, used the drops to make a better pick and the game spiralled upwards from there .<br>Now, my first point was that when people play this and are expecting minecraft they get let down because this game isn&apos;t minecraft. When people play expecting a fun multiplayer sandbox based explorer they get given what they expect, a fun entertaining game.<br><br>In summary:-<br><br>Graphics - (9) - The graphics in Terraria are good for what they are trying to be, They aren&apos;t fancy but they accomplish what they set out to do.<br><br>Gameplay - (8) - Terraria is a bit of a slow burning start, with no real tutorial and most users having to look on the wiki. However when taught to use it even new players get the hang of it quickly and learn from there. The actual gameplay itself is the same, it starts slow but picks up speed as you progress and once you get near the end the gameplay is so fast when you see new players you remember how frustrated you got before you made the big push forward.<br><br>Concept - (9) - no matter how much you wish this was Minecraft it is not, and for good reason. Terraria developed its own identity a while ago and it may well be a channel for Minecraft veterans and vice versa but Terraria will keep growing and will surpass Minecraft until you hear whispers of &quot;Hey, have you tried that game, what&apos;s it called.... oh yeah, Minecraft.&quot;<br>&quot;No, What is it.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s like Terraria!&quot;<br><br>General - (10) - With Terraria constantly expanding it will develop into a great game for all. It is consistently in the top ten games on steam and hits and stays at number one for a long time when a new update comes out. You are never short of a multiplayer game to join and its great fun with friends<br><br>Price - (10) - for &#xC2;&#xA3;6/$10 there are few other games you could buy that give you this much enjoyment and if you got 3 friends together and bought the four pack then it would save you &#xC2;&#xA3;1.50/$2.50 each. is that still too much, then trawl the steam forum and you can find people touting the remains of a four pack for considerably less, I grabbed a bargain and scored a copy for my brother for &#xC2;&#xA3;1.25/$2<br><br>Want to play, Add me on steam.

Are you gonna mine the crap out of the surrounding land finding ores, trinkets and riches? Are you going to scour the surface for the corruption that plagues the land with pure evil? Maybe you want to find the forbidden demon god dungeon of doom death hell at one of the corners of the map? Maybe you should just think of how to build yourself a second floor in your house for a buddy... go slow son.

At first I thought it was just going to be a cheap knockoff of Minecraft, and boy was I wrong.  Terraria really feels like a nice throwback to the retro era with its pixel art and retro music, and really feels like a cross of Castlevania with Minecraft.  Admittedly, construction is a bit lacking compared to Minecraft, but the significantly deeper exploration, combat, and items really make up for it.  Terraria really feels like less of a &quot;creativity toy&quot; like Minecraft and much more like an actual game.  Best of all, it&apos;s only $10!  Go and get it.

Minecraft is crafting/creating focused and Terraria is action/exploration focused.  Both have crafting, creating, exploration, and action, but Terraria definitely emphasizes on its exploration and action.  I own and enjoy Minecraft, but the &quot;fun factor&quot; seems much high for Terraria.  I love the design and crafting features as they are more streamlined than in Minecraft.  I think that it is one of the best games I&apos;ve ever played.  I&apos;ll end by saying this:
<br>If you played Minecraft and thought it was a good idea, but didn&apos;t get sucked in like many others, give Terraria a try.

I like minecraft, so why shouldnt i give this one a chance? Plus, i like Platformers, so how could i get wrong?<br><br>To be honest, my first impression was a really bad one. After creating a detailed character for your adventure and choosing the world&apos;s size, you&apos;re dropped in a landscape with nothing but a guy next to you called &quot;guide&quot;. The Guide gives you a few random tips, but only the first 4 or 5 are really usefull. Since the game does not provide any other form or tutorial, your first instinct is to read through all the tips. After around half of them you&apos;ll be totally confused and they&apos;ll stop making sense to someone who just played the game. The basic mechanisms of the game, such as crafting (which is REALLY essential) are not explained in detail. I had to watch tutorials on youtube in order to understand how to get started. Since there is a huge community for this game, it was not hard to find a good tutorial in no time. Still i dont think this is how it should be.<br><br>Like in Minecraft, you can harvest ressources such as wood, stone, iron ores and so on using the right tools. The resources can be placed in order to build structures, traps and so on, or they can be crafted, for example into better tools, pieces of armor or even weapons. Unlike minecraft, this game has a remarkable focus on defeating enemies, exploring dangerous caves and areas, dungeons and even finding magic pieces of equipment that increase your character&apos;s skills. Even spells, guns and many types of weapons can be found in chests, crafted or looted from killed enemies. You can improve your maximum health and acquire mana-energy which is used to cast spells (which can be rarely found). Several random events can take place in the world, most of them will confront you with threats in form of enemies. Even strong Bosses may occur which turn out to be a real challange without being too hard to beat, provided you have the right gear.<br><br>If you want to dig your way to the lowest levels of the game: have fun, it might take a while. The world is limited into all 4 directions (up, down, left, right) but there is more than enough space in all directions, and all of the directions (even up) has something interesting to explore. You can move around the world and find different Biomes which also have different undergrounds. Those vary in difficulty significantly, but since you always start in the &quot;easiest biome&quot; with the &quot;easiest underground&quot;, thats fine.<br><br>If you think you&apos;re done with one world, you can just create another one and play it with your old char. You, of course, keep your items and upgrades. The same works vice versa: If you cant get enough of your current world, you can create a new character and play the world again. Structures built and wholes dug of course remain in the game.<br><br>As the Game goes on, you can even have NPCs move into your house (provided certain criteria are met or certain tasks have been fulfilled). The NPCs are mainly shops that sell potions, basic equipments, weapons and vanity items.<br><br>Now to the &quot;But&quot;s. There are quite a few of them. At first, the game seems to have a lot of content and it is a hell lot of fun to explore it. But you quickly realise: as soon as you have mid-game-gear (acquireable in only a few hours if you know where to find it), you already run out of challanges. While your first boss fight might have taken you quite some time and nerves, you&apos;ll quickly find yourself spamming that boss only a few hours later. The underground levels become boring really fast since they offer even less of a challange. As soon as you have reached high end gear (which as well can be acquired in no time if you know how), nothing can stop you.<br><br>While at first trying to acquire every little ore you find, later you&apos;ll even leave valuable ores behind because harvesting them is still unrewarding as soon as you got your gear.<br><br>I&apos;ll draw a quick bottom line since i&apos;m running out of characters. This game IS fun, i&apos;ll give it that. But this is not the kind of game you can play every day. This is not minecraft. It has nothing to do with it except that you can dig and craft. It is more like an RPG. And as soon as you got your gear, you&apos;ll bore yourself to hell. Starting a new character wont help because as soon as you know how to get better gear or where to find it, you&apos;ll have maxed your second char in one or two evenings, facing the same problem again you had yesterday: you got nothing left to do.<br><br>This game needs more challanges on the long run. But for the first time playing, it will be fun, i promise it. And though this is not a long-term-burner, spending those 10 bucks on it aint the worst decision to make.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=1698056">Expand</a></span>

<br>I used to be that much of a Minecraft fanboy before, too. When I finally bought it...it paid off. Although it&apos;s 2D, it pulls it off with tremendous extravagance. The gameplay, after a few moments of slowness in the beginning, turns into a rapidly proceeding thrill. The inventive enemies, bosses, weapons and potions help keep the game competitive, while still allowing you to just build to your heart&apos;s content. The vast selection of items, materials, accessories and more present you with a nearly unlimited amount of fun to explore and expand with your own original creations and ideas. The physics of the game are quite advanced, and if used right, can be played to an advantage in the game.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, for an Indie game, it&apos;s an amazing production. It&apos;s a shame that it had to end so abruptly, but Redigit had his own family matters to deal with. Nevertheless, community content and the arbitrary generation is enough to keep me satisfied for a long time! 10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557048">Expand</a></span>

I recommend playing with friends and good luck.</span>

At most, similarities found in the games are their crafting systems and the possibility of some freeform building, which differ greatly when comparing both expieriences. But by offering an intense 2D sandbox expierience that offers a multitude of mobs, an old-school RPG expierience, tons of biomes with secrets located in the skies and underground, and an evergrowing slew of updates providing diverse new items, power-ups, weapons, and enemies, Terraria delivers with astounding gameplay that still leaves me addicted to this date.

I have noticed on several of the negative reviews for this game people say things like worst fifteen minuets ever or worst hour wasted.  Well if you aren&apos;t prepared to give this game probably around six to ten hours of exploration prepare for a letdown.  If however you want to explore, and learn then perhaps, this is your style of game.  I find humor in how few people give this game a five.  It is like the either don&apos;t give it a chance and ergo the bad score, or the do give it a chance and are like WOW his truly is amazing!  I do have to admit though that I&apos;m a fan of the eight bit style graphics and have been since they were around so that really is a positive in my book.  I continue to dump time into this game.  At 40 hours I have quite a place to live and have made it around half way into the armor building.  I have all gold armor and actually some advanced tools.  I wish this game was around when I was a kid I can&apos;t imagine what I would have done!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705881">Expand</a></span>

Hard to stop once you start.  An important part of this game is &quot;crafting&quot; or making complex items out of simple items.  Just finding some of those simple items turns into a full-on quest that might lead you from one end of the Terraria world to the other.  While battling bosses and advancing through the game is the ultimate goal, a lot of fun can be had just crafting and building stuff.   Some of the homes built by Terraria users are simply amazing.  There are some neat features to this game.  During the Christmas season, some bad guys will drop candy cane blocks which can be used to build red/white or green/white structures.  A Santa Claus also makes an appearance at one point.

The game plays similar to Minecraft which is pretty much a sand box game. In Terraria, players are able to create a character and choose between 3 different sized worlds which is different each time you create one, the player is able to explore through the world using numerous weapons, items and tools. Players are able to travel through land, sea, underground, hell, sky and in outer space. Players will also be able to customize their characters to look like some famous characters such as Mario and Link from the Nintendo universe! This game has A LOT of content, you will surely no doubt about it clock around 50-100 hours just through exploration, and even than you will be able to continue your adventures through the online community whom have created numerous PVP type servers or massive Boss battle arenas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2019270">Expand</a></span>

More items to make, more ores to mine, more enemies to kill, more tools to create, more, more, more more. However Terraria is despite this less engrossing and less fulfilling to play than minecraft. Terraria is however in many ways a very different game, focusing on a 2D pixel-fest the game is aesthetically pleasing and great to look at, by being 2D Terraria affords more detail to be applied  to everything in the world. The aim of Terraria is to build structures, dig for resources to build better tools, adventure across the land and fight monsters. All of which are easily done and the game has clear cut curves of difficulty, the deeper you dig the rarer the materials you find, but also the more dangerous the enemies. There are a lot of items to collect in Terraria through random events or crafting creating a RPG-style system of weapons armour and magic. However this was it&apos;s downfall, by adding more directed game play and content, the games ability  to keep you playing wears off after you have obtained the best armour, weapons and more gold than you could ever need. I never felt the same compulsion to keep playing the way that minecraft did. Terraria is a great game and well worth picking up, but once you have conquered it there is very little reason to go back and keep playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=1984714">Expand</a></span>

And in a very broad sense it is virtually exactly that, and if your the style of person who throws away a game after 10 minutes of nothing, this game just isn&apos;t for you. However spill some time into it, and you can get lost in a haven of randomly generated dungeons, start building an entire town for you and your friends in multi-player, and explore the devious world of The Corrupted lands in search of world eaters of the ever increasingly annoying Eye Of Cythulu if your friends continuously spawn it.<br>When you start up Terraria for the first time you are instructed to create your very first character to explore the vast expansive worlds of Terraria. Now, as well as a few similar and crazy hairstyles, there&apos;s not much at your disposal to customize your character. Besides hairstyles, there is nothing to change, merely altar the colour, and even that is a little bit frustrating, as you use those RGB sliders. Most people, unless you want to be really picky because for the majority of the time you will wear armour anyway, will just keep the character as the default look. There is nothing wrong with this though, in-fact if you move the sliders to attempt to change the character you normally end up completely ruining it anyway. On the other hand, customization of armour and weapons when you get into the game is much, and I mean much better. Think of a random weapon or armour style in your head, and it is probably craft-able in Terraria. Ranging from the simple crafted items early on such as copper swords and basic handguns found in some underground caves, to star cannons, massive lava flails and even lightsabers! Armour varies a lot too, and if you want survive after nightfall when the zombies and weird floating eyeballs are out to kill you, your going to need to know which armour as better for your style of play. Want to rummage through underground caves without the need for torches? Go for the molten armour. Or how about for moving round really quickly? How about shadow armour? The possibilities are endless! This brings me to my next point, Terraria doesn&apos;t seem to want to teach people how to play there game at all. There&apos;s no tutorial mode, only a guide there which gives you very vague hints and tips now and again on how to do things, sometimes this doesn&apos;t really help at all either. The only way your going to even learn much about Terraria is if you have numerous hours on your hands to read through an entire wiki site dedicated to Terraria.<br>The game-play mainly consists of crafting better and better items to survive in your randomly generated world and fend off enemies during the night. However if you build a house to stay in at night, you probably wont have much problems with enemies during the night. Also, Terraria does a good job of adding a different variety of random events to the game to vary it up a little at night. At times a bloodshot moon will occur and enemies will spawn at twice the rate and be twice as hard to defeat and be twice as powerful. Sometimes a massive goblin army will start to march towards your house and try to defeat you. And by defeating these this can normally get you some very respectable rewards. However these events don&apos;t happen on a regular enough basis, and so you can get bored of continuously fending off zombies as you try to build your house during the night. And your first shadow orb encounter can be a fun but surprising one. Unless you read the wiki, you&apos;ll try hitting it, it will disappear and an enemy boss, the eater of worlds will appear. Now if your unprepared, then be ready to die tonnes of times before you defeat him, because he will follow you whenever you spawn until you kill him, and he has tonnes of HP.<br>These random events and enemy boss fights can make multi-player and playing with friends a blast. And what&apos;s more, opening up multi-player gives you and your friends even more choices to make on were to go and what to do! As long as your friends aren&apos;t jerks, you should have no trouble with massive boss fights as long as your mate doesn&apos;t keep spawning them.<br>Recently Terraria released a new patch which contained a variety of new mobs such as jungles, bats and bigger deserts. The new mobs are great, but some rarely appear, and it&apos;s frustrating when you can&apos;t find the one your looking for. Overall, Terraria is a good enough game to have you playing for a long time, and there is enough new content in there to keep you playing for a long amount of time, but some things may not appeal to the more casual gamers such as the crafting system which can be over-complicated, and the mobs need to be balanced out a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=1985847">Expand</a></span>

You compare it to Minecraft, you say it&apos;s a blatant rip-off,  you can&apos;t build as cool things. Well then, let me just say this: Minecraft is a building game, with RPG elements (you can explore caves, kill monsters with boring combat, as well as...leveling up?), Terraria, on the other hand, isn&apos;t supposed to be a full building game like Minecraft: it&apos;s supposed to be more RPG, with building elements to enhance gameplay. It is in 2D, that can be a pro and a con for some. If you really, really just want to create things, by all means dis this game for Minecraft, but don&apos;t rate Terraria a 0 (which ALMOST NO GAME ever deserves) because it doesn&apos;t get building in Minecraft perfect. Now that we have that out of the way, let&apos;s talk more Terraria. Yes, you can&apos;t build as cool of things. If you want a game where you can build cool things, again, go play Minecraft. But for the survival aspect of Terraria, where the one thing you want to build is a base, and you want to survive against waves of enemies. I&apos;m happy to say, everything about Terraria survival is superior to Minecraft. To start, when you build your base, you will actually care about defending that base from enemy waves: in Minecraft, the only thing you really have to defend from are Zombies, Skeletons, Spiders and Creepers. None of these creatures can open doors, so if your inside a properly built fort, you don&apos;t have to do anything at all, and the only purpose of going out to slay these creatures is for useless crafting items...where grinding enemies for items is as tedious as watching grass grow. In Terraria,  there are actually events that happen that can actually harm your base: Blood Moons which give Zombies and Demon Eyes more power, as well as the ability to open doors, and Goblin invasions, which sends entire  ARMIES of mobs to raid your house. These can actually be defended from uniquely with traps, especially now with the 1.1 update which introduces Terraria to one of Minecraft&apos;s best features: Wiring, which can be made to create traps that, unlike Minecraft, ACTUALLY HAVE PURPOSE. Now, why do you want to defend your house? NPCs move into your base, and they can be slain by creatures of the night, these NPCs include a Merchant, an Arms Dealer,  a Nurse, and many more. These NPCs really make your base &apos;important&apos;, it gives you purpose to go back to your house when you see &quot;The Blood Moon has Rose&quot;. When you have a fortified base up, you will enter what is arguably Terraria&apos;s strongest point: Exploration. Exploring the world in Terraria is on another level compared to Minecraft, as there actually seems to be diverse biomes that ACTUALLY MATTER, and what seems to be a development, like a normal RPG. In Minecraft, you chop wood, build a basic house, then start mining untill you get diamond and obsidian, then go to the nether, then to the end, and that&apos;s it. In Terraria, there are so many things to go do and to explore. -The Surface -3 levles of underground -The Corruption (a dark, polluted bersion of the normal overworld, with different mobs and special rewards) -The Jungle/Underground Jungle (again, special items and mobs) -Floating Isles -The Dungeon -The Underworld and finally, after killing the Lord of the Underworld (not going to tell you what it is) -The Hallow (opposite of corruption, stands as the new &quot;end-game&quot; zone, along with the empowered corruption). You follow from one area to the next, developing new items and powering your character in ways that, again, ACTUALLY MATTER. Speaking of items, for those who think Terraria&apos;s items are &quot;a copy of minecraft&quot; my god you did not get far in the game, did you? Once you get past the normal Copper, Iron, Silver and Gold, there are so many items to develop, and it&apos;s after that point you can actually play as a dedicated &quot;Class&quot; (Melee Warrior, Archer, Gunner, Magician). Meteorite, Shadowscale, Necro, Jungle, Molten, Cobalt, Adamantite and Mythril armor sets, each with varied stats (Molten has highest base Defence, Jungle very mana conserving, mage-like, etc), as well as a boat-load of weapons (Swords, Axes, Lances, Hammers, Flails, Bows, Pistols, Machine Guns and Magic to name a few types), and accesories (Rocket Boots - Allow Temporary Flight, Obsidian Skull - Immunity to Fire Blocks (Meteorite, Hellstone), as well as being able to combine them). So in conclusion, Terraria, absolutly doesn&apos;t rip off Minecraft, and in fact actually improves on what Minecraft originally set to achieve upon it&apos;s release: Survival and Exploration. Graphics and be underwhelming for some, but maybe that&apos;s what they aimed for. I would do a full Part 2 of this review but that&apos;s...a little overboard. Note that at the time Terraria is in it&apos;s 1.1 update, and Minecraft has been released. If you bought Terraria on Steam for $2.50, you made a good choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994704">Expand</a></span>

I have played a multitudinous amount of games in my past, and none have been anywhere near as addicting and fun as Terraria. My personal opinion is that this game deserves a 10/10. The amount of content Pre-1.1 was enough to keep most entertained for hours on end, and now that we have 1.1, it&apos;s as if the possibilities have doubled. I don&apos;t know a single person who has any real complaints with the game, other than that they lack the insight or the patience to start out. Both the single-player and multiplayer aspects of Terraria are noteworthy as well. While the former gives the player a major challenge of fighting hordes of brutal enemies and facing a world of evil single-handed, the latter creates a fun and exciting world where teamwork and strategy shine. While i rave 100% for this game, i must give you a warning: this game is highly addictive and not to be played lightly. Expect to pour hours of your life into this game, while loving every creative, adventurous, and (oftentimes) brutal second of it. But don&apos;t just take my word for it. Start playing and find out for yourself!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2017796">Expand</a></span>

A must have for anyone who likes sandbox games</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2035359">Expand</a></span>

Anyways terraria is a 16-bit 2d platform game created by re-logic. My aspect of this game was &quot;oh its a minecraft ripoff&quot; i couldn&apos;t be much wrong. For a start  the gameplay is basically an adventure, monsters are abundant in this game, some are challenging while others are not. With the crafting system it reminds me of a mmorpg called wonderland online of course that game you fight monsters to build. Build new stuff and being able to acquire rare items from dungeons and fight bosses makes it worth while. There is hidden treasures and some help your character in a big way relics that can be obtained just by finding it and a bunch of gadgets to build. Since i said its 16-bit style of play it reminds me of the super nintendo days of playing. The game has dungeons to explore building one thing to get the best thing you are achieving for is  self rewarding. If you want to challenge yourself in this game there is softcore meaning if you die you loose coins which are helpful later on in the game, medium core loses items and coins, if you want to be the diablo 2 style of gameplay there is the hardcore gameplay which if you played diablo 2 you will know what i am talking about.<br><br>Water physics are impressive since you do not see the water just floating in space. Sure most of the building is simular to minecraft,but its rpgish adventure, looting and boss battles makes this a gem even if it  has the  SNES nostalgia graphic look.<br><br>I am sure that some people will just take a look at the screenshots of the game and just dismiss it as a bad game because the graphics are completely not high quality graphics. Just because the graphics are not realistic doesn&apos;t qualify as a bad game. Now lets look at the bad part about this game while i admire the SNES  nostalgia feeling and the rpgish crafting system and building structures i had to say one thing and that is the tutorial. The tutorial for this game was a bit out of place. When i first started the game i did not know what to do. Sure there is a guide person who tells you what you can build and tips, but above all the tips only refer to things that might be in the game. Since this is a 2d game the suspenseful moment is small when fighting monsters. Like shooting games your character can recharge their health by literally standing there, terraria is like that but a little slow regeneration. This game has a low-moderate modding community the results of this modding community  make the gameplay somewhat fun to a limit that maybe exceeds the price of terraria which is $10.00.<br><br>That is basically it on the game if you like building, and crafting while at the same time have that nostalgic feeling of the SNES era and RPG fashion, try this game out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2113184">Expand</a></span>

I particularly like the way that when you unlock the hard mode you unlock new objectives and  your weapons and tools work like you have just started a new and makes things so much harder.

Now you start the game with a COMPLETLY random world, nobody else has that world, then you start chopping down trees like Minecraft, build a decent house, then $#!% gets real. The fun part about this game is mining, you have SO much more to mine and do in Terraria. You have NPCs that you can buy stuff from, not only that, but you have 8 bosses in this game, including Skeletron, Eater of Worlds, Eye of Cthulhu but my favourite, is the Wall of Flesh. Like Minecraft, you will never get bored with the updates. No real glitches that I have come across, but it is a great game, even vanilla.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115612">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Terraria is a magical combination between 2D platformer/&quot;shooter&quot;-fighter + creative building + Item Farmer. I like the options you have in building stuff, it gets very close to minecraft. The fighting (pve/pvp) makes a lot of fun (far far far far far more then minecraft), especially the heroic bosses and pvp with some friends is just a ton of fun.</span>

There two different games, one more on the adventure and see you can get the better stuff than the other person. Minecraft is more on the builting, they both can built cool things. Another major different between the games is that minecraft is a fps, while Terraria is a completely different on using a tps and side scoller, which works well but it can be too dark sometimes. I think a issue is that the guide is useful but doesn&apos;t really help if he gets in your way to often. A strong point is that you will not get tired of the game fast, there are a lot of things you can do. Go adventure and be a awesome viking or a wizard or just built the coolest things you can imagine. I think that people should stop calling it a &quot;cheap rip off of Minecraft&quot; they different and besides they don&apos;t have any support. Also if was a rip off of minecraft it would have been a fps, not a side scroller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2304150">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s fun to play, addictive, and it&apos;s only $10! ~ Rating: 9.2/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2309696">Expand</a></span>

The worlds are as small or as massive as you want and your destiny in it is truely up to you. For the 1st hour or more the game will be a drag because you only have basic tools with no armor but once you start collecting better and better gear and weapons it becomes a blast. The music is alright but it can get on the annoying side after a while so that&apos;s why I just turned it down. There is a tad steep learning curve when you first start out and even more so when you get more and more stuff that&apos;s why the Terraria Wiki is your best friend for finding out what you need to know. My only real nit pick with this game is it is over really fast once you get going and the developer has already said on his website that he ceased development for it which is a pity because it is a fun game but I can also see his point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335963">Expand</a></span>

The problems are the hardmode bosses. If you dont play with like 4 friends... the bosses are almost impossible. The rest of the game is fine IT could have some enemies more and more variety of patterns but is not aggravating at all..

Another thing that&apos;s funny is the Minecraft fans who rip on this game because it&apos;s a &quot;copy.&quot; So pathetic. And yet ANOTHER thing that&apos;s funny is the people judging the graphics. You guys realize that&apos;s a stylistic approach, right? It has a classic, retro look and feel to it. It wasn&apos;t like they created this game but had limitations so they just made the graphics &quot;bad.&quot;  All in all, the really low ratings come from people who are mad they spent $5 - $10 on a game they found boring/they didn&apos;t know what to do, people who love Minecraft and think this game is a copy, and trolls.  If you like sandbox games, sidescrollers, fighting enemies with many different weapons, crafting, and building structures, then you&apos;ll like this game. Look at videos if you aren&apos;t sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868646">Expand</a></span>

You must collect wood and find a shelter to hide out for the night. However, just 10 minutes of game play showed me how different (and, in some aspects, better) this game is from MineCraft. There is a greater variety of enemies, NPCs come to live in your town, and, frankly, there is just more stuff to do. I can&apos;t go into details, because the surprises add to the fun, but just reading on the Terraria Wiki shows me that, even with all the time I have logged, there is still so much more for me to discover and do. The reason I rated an 8, not a 10, is because of two big inconveniences I have run into. First, the game can&apos;t be paused, unless auto-pause is on, which means you will be unable to navigate with the inventory/crafting menu open. Also, whenever you exit the game and relaunch, you start back at the spawn point, which might come in handy if you are battling a ton of monsters and about to die, you can just exit and relaunch, but if you are in the middle of a cave, and you have to exit out the game for whatever reason, it is hard to resume where you left off.
<br>Final thoughts: While most games focus on graphics, Terraria focuses on the actual game play. While it most likely did come from the idea of MineCraft, it adds to MineCraft in so many ways. Granted, I still love MineCraft and will continue to play it, Terraria is a great game as well. If I am in the mood to be creative and build and explore, MineCraft is what I will play. If I am in the mood for an adventure, Terraria. Two completely separate games, one unique concept. If you love MineCraft, play Terraria! If you love Terraria, play MineCraft! Terraria is probably the best 10 bucks I have ever spent.

The first thing I noticed were the pixelated visuals, and they work so perfectly with its vast environment. The game&apos;s mechanics are really solid, and its replay value is substantial. It&apos;s especially fun to pick up with friends. It appeals more to the explorer than the crafter, however. There&apos;s always something to go out and search for or obtain in the game, and I love that feeling. Although you can build awesome, detailed structures in Terraria, it&apos;s fairly limited as it&apos;s a sidescroller. In the end, your main objectives are to explore and combat against the various bosses in the generated world. More specifically, some things I really liked with the game were how I could port a character between different worlds (including single player worlds to multiplayer worlds and vice versa) with such ease and not having to sacrifice anything for it. I also love how it was a little more straight-forward about what to do in the game with their &quot;guide&quot; character. You don&apos;t have to spend large amounts of time looking up how to craft things on its wiki because it&apos;s there for you. You DO need to spend some time on the wiki in order to know how exactly to progress and know what is all available to you, but you&apos;re not completely dependent on it like you are with Minecraft. Overall, it&apos;s a great game, especially with friends. The only downside I had with the game was that I felt that sometimes there wasn&apos;t enough content available. Also, some people may disagree, but I think the implementation of an experience system would have been nice as well. I can&apos;t wait for Starbound to come out in the near future from these guys. They definitely know how to make an awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579793">Expand</a></span>

Compared to Minecraft, it has much better action/adventure and gameplay elements.  Combat is a fun mix of melee, ranged, and various magic spells.  The metroidvania gameplay keeps things challenging.  The amount of items to find is very addicting, but rarely devolves into farming.  Even when random worlds gets boring, you can hit the fan sites and download user made maps, which range from parkour obstacle courses to adventure maps with stories and puzzles.  My only complaint is the lack of originality: it does shamelessly copy minecraft, especially early in the game, what with chopping down trees and running from zombies at night.  But by the end of the game, when you are flying through the air raining crystal bullets down at a giant skeleton head made of metal while it tries to crush, zap blast, and saw you simultaniously, you will realize this is not Minecraft anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564992">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s actually progession and in Minecraft, well, there just isn&apos;t. It&apos;s as if a genius, took Minecraft, WoW, and Mario, and said, &quot;Hey, let&apos;s make a game!&quot; I have logged 170 hours in on this game, and I still am getting upgrades on my armour and weapons. So much to find, so much to do, although it&apos;s an empty goal, you still find yourself raiding that dungeon, trying to find another upgrade. 9 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2576289">Expand</a></span>

Compare this to Minecraft, they are both amazing, but Terraria is like a copy, a little bit, again more could be added, but since there is 2 more Terraria games on the way (Xbox 360 &amp; PS3) it would be hard to keep things going on PC.</span>

It is better to play with a group of friends than alone for sure, but the overall premise made this game amazing. And hardmode....is actually hard. My poor castle was destroyed within the first blood moon :&apos;(

<br>Oh...and the soundtrack makes this game!</span>

                                        <span>One of the best Indie games i&apos;ve ever played, ever. Picked it up 2 days ago and i already have 21 hours in it. Terraria doesn&apos;t fail to surprise with new monsters, items, and places to explore. It&apos;s similar to Minecraft is a few ways, but very different in many others. If you have a few friends to play this game with, there&apos;s no reason you shouldn&apos;t pick this game up!</span>

But in Terraria you can have special ability&apos;s, defeat bosses, holiday dlc, and much more. Fun game, but its mainly only fun if you have friends to play with.</span>

I probably would&apos;ve laughed. But Terraria pulled me in and didn&apos;t let me go until I took down the Moon Lord. Through many....MANY countless deaths due to strong enemies, bosses, falls, explosions, drowning, more bosses, traps, I was able to build and craft everything necessary to survive in a world that&apos;s against you from the start.
<br>
<br>Terraria drops you in the middle of a procedurely generated world filled with caves, tons of monsters, and nothing but a short sword, a pickaxe and an axe. Soon you&apos;ll learn how to build a house for your guide and for you to take refuge at night from the more dangerous monsters that roam around. You&apos;ll find ore, craft new weapons and armor to better protect yourself and finally start adventuring further and further, deeper and deeper in the world. Eventually you&apos;ll have everything you need to take down the Wall of Flesh and enter Hardmode where new enemies and bosses are introduced, new ore to mine and more weapons and armor to craft.
<br>
<br>On the surface you can see this game as a 2D version on Minecraft, but if you look deeper, it&apos;s much different. Terraria is more like Metroid with the exploration of a new world you know nothing about and Castlevania with the enemies you fight, and bosses you encounter and a few dungeons to explore with hidden goodies. The only similar thing to Minecraft is really the mining and the crafting, everything else is it&apos;s own game and that&apos;s where Terraria really shines.
<br>
<br>Of course no game is perfect and I do have maybe one gripe with Terraria. For example; Some deaths feel really cheap, enemies (especially in Hardmode) are more unfair than challenging, and you&apos;ll die countless times just trying to get your items back before even getting close to your grave stone to collect anything. It&apos;s important to keep extra weapons and armor nearly as strong as your equipped weapons. Trust me, if you die and need to go deep down, or far far out into the world, you&apos;re gonna need extra armor, weapons and equipables to reach your lost items, especially in Hardmode.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s really it for gripes, though I&apos;m sure people will be turned off by the slow start in the beginning of the game, only taking the game for surface value, calling it a Minecraft ripoff. But if you stick with it, do some research on what items you&apos;ll need, how to craft certain things, maybe getting a friend to help with the harder bosses, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find an amazing game inside a small little $10 package. The ammount of content you get in this game alone is worth the price of admission, you just have to do your research to truly understand the ins and outs of this game.
<br>
<br>With all that said, I can safely say this is one of those games that you can spend hundreds of hours doing nothing but building, crafting and still have a blast not really doing anything at all, or you can take down bosses, and look for the best weapons in the game and explore your world to find everything. With it&apos;s cheap price and the ammount of content and so much offered in one little package, I can safely say this game deserves a 9.5/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=5843348">Expand</a></span>

<br>-King Slime
<br>-Eye of Cthulhu (sorry bad grammar)
<br>-Eater of worlds
<br>-Brain of cthulhu
<br>-Queen Bee
<br>-Skeletron
<br>-Wall of flesh
<br>
<br>Now hardmode
<br>-Wyvern
<br>-Ice Golem
<br>-The Destroyer
<br>-The twins
<br>-Skeletron Prime
<br>-Plantera
<br>-Paladin
<br>-Golem
<br>-Lunar Eclipse (this is isn&apos;t a boss, but it&apos;s recommended to beat before the next boss/event)
<br>-Pumpking and Mourning Wood(Pumpkin moon)
<br>-Santa NK-1, Everscream and the Ice Queen (Frost moon)
<br>-Duke Fishron
<br>
<br>Those are mobile/console exclusive
<br>-Lepus
<br>-Arch Wyvern
<br>-Turkor the ungrateful
<br>-Ocram
<br>
<br>And now the mods, yes, they are a bit slim, but those make a HUGE HUGE REALLY HUGE modification, the minimum a mod of items they add are 200, bosses 3 and weapons 50, there are like 5 or so, 2 are for the lastest version (1.2.4.1), the first one is the oblivion mod, it have the ability to add to up to 600 of HP, it adds weapons 2x stronger than the terra blade and very strong armors, and over 5 bosses, wich 2 are almost the same but in the difficulty is really big, it hads another mode of game, the super hard-mode, it&apos;s after unlocking hard-mode and beating the nuclear slime or so, this unlocks most of the game content, the second one is N Terraria, it adds a RPG style, you can now choose a race, and have up to 3/4 teammates/pets, you can share inventory and it adds some biomes, + mini-bosses
<br>
<br>I have to mention the biomes? yes i do, it have 20 in total (almost), and they MAKE a difference, not like minecraft, they are just a reskin of everything and it&apos;s the same, this adds different enemys, loots, bosses etc. i mentioned that terraria have almost over 100 weapons?, this game is filled with a really big content,  and it&apos;s very cheap, less than 15 dollars, and it doesn&apos;t need more than 300 MB, i think it needs 128 or something like that
<br>
<br>10.5/10 Would Buy again</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=5058277">Expand</a></span>

It is somewhat like Minecraft, sure, but it is not a ripoff just because of that.  Unless every shooter other than the original is a ripoff, and every MMO other than the first is a ripoff, in which case about 99% of games should also get people rating them 0 because they are ripoffs.  This is a 2-dimensional game where you mine, explore, craft, and fight.  It is more focused on exploring and fighting than crafting and building, and there are hundreds of enemies in the game with many different types and lots of variety, as well as over ten bosses with more coming up in 1.3, which comes out on June 31 2015.  There are lots of biomes that feel completely different from each other, so exploring is always fun.  There are also hundreds of weapons with different effects from a rainbow gun to a jack-o-lantern launcher to a staff that summons a frost hydra.  The only problem is that there is a little bit of a grind at the beginning of the game, but other than that, this game is extremely fun, and is a must buy for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=5310060">Expand</a></span>

People call it a ripoff of minecraft but i believe that the two are similar but still worlds apart. Terraria offers boatloads more on adventure with a large array of bosses, mobs and events with minecraft having a minuscule amount of this sort of content in comparison. Mine craft has a much more in depth creative content however with the extra dimension allowing for more complicated structures to be made compared to terraria. When you play this amazing game on the verge of its next big update you realise just how different it is from minecraft and how much more engrossing a play through of the game is compared to minecraft. A $10 game i would say be worth much more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=5353340">Expand</a></span>

While this game is often called a Minecraft clone I believe this to be bull crap. This game has so much content, and choice, that it is completely unfair to be summed up to Minecraft. And don&apos;t get me wrong I have been playing Minecraft since the beta days. Anyway enough about Minecraft, Terraria starts off just like all the other clones. This may be why people disregard it as a M.C clone and never play it again. Big mistake! even the beginning offers tons of choice and control over your world. For example do you go and explore an underground cavern with treasures galore? And risk the chance of meeting a ghastly monster, and lose all of your hard earned coins? Or do you stay at the top of the world and gather what you can and hope to fend off the mob of undead on the horizon? I hope I have sold you on getting yourself a copy of Terraria after all it&apos;s only $9.99 on steam right now. Now for some downsides to Terraria. The Multiplayer in Terraria can be very dry sometimes as it does not have as many features as other games on steam. You can team up with a fellow adventurer and attempt to take out bosses together, or you could go exploring together, or perhaps build a gigantic fortress and help protect it from waves of undead marauders. As cool as I made that sound it&apos;s really just co-op mode. You can also try to join a server but it&apos;s more of the same thing depending on  which you join. I actually really enjoy the Multiplayer but I like the Singleplayer too. And I think the same thing goes for the other side. Somebody really doesn&apos;t like the singleplayer so they hop over to the multiplayer to see if their is any redeeming quality in it. Going back to M.C tons of people hate survival but love to play on servers, and I think something like that should be implemented into Terraria. I love this game and highly suggest that you and maybe a couple of friends pick this beauty up on steam and enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/terraria/user-reviews?user_review_id=5355607">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Terraria is a great game, i haven&apos;t played it much but it appeals to me much more than minecraft.
<br>people say that its a rip off from minecraft where actually its nothing like that, terraria is more adventuring and  going into dungeons and caves but minecraft is more building and crafting. In my opinion both are good games but terraria is better.</span>

                                        <span>The game is fun but there is a lot of grinding to get to the mechanical bosses but that&apos;s the only real grindy part. This Game with its retro looks and style similar to minecraft was very fun at the start but as stated the part between the wall of flesh and the last of the 3 mechanical bosses.</span>
