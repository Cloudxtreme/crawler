I hated it, and these two points I give for the idea, but...maybe Derek Smart really should read of reviews his games, &apos;cos all off his games have the same problems (sh*tty gameplay, tons of bugs etc.). Sorry Derek, two points. Please don&apos;t sue me.</span>

I think I&apos;m seeing the light though, the man can&apos;t make fun games. I don&apos;t care how much freedom and option you have in this game, none of it is fun or even functional. Stuff that should take a couple of clicks invilves a huge amount of menu-hunting and rarely works when you figure it out. The FPS portion is a flat out joke, the fighter to fighter combat is a breakneck speed jousting match, and if you decide to do everything from a command perspective instead it, well, isn&apos;t exactly user friendly. Do yourself a favour and buy X2 or wait until X3, you don&apos;t get the on-planet stuff but you get everything else plus some FUN which is sort of the point right?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/universal-combat/user-reviews?user_review_id=380175">Expand</a></span>

Now, I need help from Smart Derek, but he&apos;s always doing something else! (Making this world even bigger?) True, graphics don&apos;t make a game, but, really, graphics here is just plain outdated even on the latest from Smart. True, this game&apos;s got a huge dynamic universe, but, truly, it needs life not statistics. Frankly, there is no game out there alike this one because it&apos;s unique. No one else has or had the guts to make a game like Smart. This game &apos;s got potentials, lots of it. But, Smart would need talents real talents, to realize this potential into the next franchise. Let&apos;s face it, we&apos;ve all played the same games over and over. It&apos;s time for some change. 4 for the uniqueness and concept. 5 because it&apos;s Smart&apos;s. -1 because no tutorials. A game should be fun afterall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/universal-combat/user-reviews?user_review_id=402570">Expand</a></span>
