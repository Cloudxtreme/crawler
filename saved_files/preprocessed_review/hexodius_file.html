<br>
<br>The game is great fun and highly addictive, but from what I can see, not very popular on steam. I don&apos;t know why this is as its a fantastic game. You have a story mode, and a traditional arcade mode (with leaderboards everyone. Yes. You can own your friends). The story mode follows a very basic story and has several objectified missions to get to a dimensional portal at the end of the zone. There is plenty to do. And you get rewarded for exploring all the map with bonus unlocks and bonus health items.
<br>
<br>Your ship is also fully customisable with whatever powers you desire from the menu, different combinations will give you different pro&apos;s and cons of course, but work out whats good for you.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack to this game in my opinion is rather good, but gets slightly repetitive when you&apos;ve been in the same zone for a while.
<br>
<br>All in all, Hexodius is a great and addictive twin stick shooter, and there is a lot on offer if you try to give it the time of day. I give Hexodius a 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hexodius/user-reviews?user_review_id=6807335">Expand</a></span>
