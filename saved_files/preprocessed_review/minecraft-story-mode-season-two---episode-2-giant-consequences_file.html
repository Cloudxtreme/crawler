Most of the new characters we met in the previous episode make their own unique return as their true self, with one saving the main character from death, and the other being just as nasty as previously, and then we can&apos;t forget the llama. The ending showed the series first major plot twist since the Wither Strom saga from the first season, ending off with great anticipation for the next episode. This saga without a doubt, is shaping up to be even better than the Wither Storm saga, though I just wish it didn&apos;t start off as dull from the last episode. Though never the less, this episode in my opinion, may be Telltale&apos;s finest work in this entire franchise, lets just hope they can keep it up for the remainder of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode-season-two---episode-2-giant-consequences/user-reviews?user_review_id=7467989">Expand</a></span>

I praised the episode for its new characters as well as the re-introduction of some older characters, the new and less dull gameplay mechanics with less button mashing and &apos;micro-management&apos; unlike the first season, the updated graphics and the intensifying plot establishment though criticised it for its introduction to some of the new characters, the dull storyline walkthrough at the start as well as the slow and somewhat boring plot during the first half before the action really kicked in during the second half. The ending of the previous episode really left me in anticipation and speculation to what was to be offered next into this new saga with the new main antagonist though really wished for a bit more action in the storyline. While the introduction to this new story during the last episode could&apos;ve been a bit better and less shallow, this new episode continues right at the orientation of Jesse&apos;s new threat from the powerful foe; the admin. While a slight plothole was to be noted in contrast to the ending of the first episode, this opening was not to be disappointed by. Jesse and the entire town is in stake where he/she is put to the test in &apos;defeating&apos; this foe. With featuring both a lot of action and quick strategy, this already put myself if a great and all interested anticipation for what the rest of this episodes narrative has to offer based off its very promising aim for this new stories climax and the &apos;sizzling start&apos;. The first bit of action may have occurred very quickly with a somewhat abrupt ending, but it was awesome to know that the action packed part of the story was not really to end there though in fact be reinstated. The admin (the brand new main antagonist) only returns in a brand new physique and even though has the same desire, it feels as if he has a slightly different personality from the &apos;giant colossus&apos; admin puppet figure to which I both missed and felt contempt to all at the same time. This new yet the same antagonist sets Jesse and his friends out on a quest to which leads them to a bunch of deadly yet bizarre tests to prove their worthy of &apos;greatness&apos; and save the world from being frozen in time with a mass chaos of the night time consequences. During the episode, we got to regroup with some of the characters we previously met or saw during the previous episode including one of the main characters from the first season who made there reappearance at almost the perfect and most satisfying moment when Jesse and their town is in danger and once again becomes a great asset to your team. One of the newer main characters introduced in the previous episode; adventurer Jack also proves to be a good asset to your team at times including the beginning, while other times where he isn&apos;t very useful, but fortunately managed to stay in character. Lukas however was noticed to be acting a bit differently to how he did when we all loved him (preferably) from the first season. A lot of times he is seen acting very astute and far-sighted which isn&apos;t very impactful to the story itself though it somewhat limits the expectations from that particular characters personality in contrast to past episodes. As well as this, throughout the episode, we are reunited with the series semi-antagonist we met in the first episode, Jesse&apos;s &apos;rival&apos; to which I stated had lost her &apos;villain vibe&apos; when undoing one of her nasty actions. I was predicting that in this episode that her and Jesse would be forced to make some sort of alliance with each other. I was wrong. It was seen that she is very selfish and haughty to almost every single character including her pet (to which I expected to become the series&apos; companion). Even in some of the most dangerous situations, this semi-antagonist really proves herself in this episode as not only a fixated villain, but the first traitor we have ever seen in this entire franchise. During the end of the episode, just like the end of the previous episode where the interesting action starts to kick in, this ending ties in even more so with the superior and plot engaging twist. One of the newer characters (originally a friend of Jack) reveals themselves as the true form of the admin and sends away the remaining main characters away to which is to become the main setting for the next episode. This thrilling and compelling ending has left me even more eager than ever to see what is to come next. This episode has not only improved the series with its story driven engagement, but with some of its tie in decisions. Some of the decisions you will make in this episode may have the same or similar initial outcome to the story, but actually changes the meta of your story and the way your story will link to the primary outcome and the two different alternative endings. With these new improvements to the tailored story, the future episodes is looking pretty promising so far and I cannot wait for what is to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode-season-two---episode-2-giant-consequences/user-reviews?user_review_id=7467944">Expand</a></span>
