What I laugh about is apparently the only people who bought this game did so through steam; I did not.  I&apos;m one of the true originals who was excited about a sequel for one of my favorite strategies of all time.  Therefore: my rating has nothing to do with technicals.  My reviews never do.  It is about a much more crucial facet: the content of the game itself. _____  Allow me to just summarize and say that there is nothing here that really separates 2160 from any other strategy.  If you are looking at a new strategy to seek variety, then look elsewhere.  Unlike 2150, you cannot really customize your units to be your own, unique design.  Furthermore, the pacing is that of Starcraft II: that is to say clicking speed and reaction time is more important than strategy and tactics.  And advancing technologically seems irritatingly unrewarding.  You&apos;ll do it to keep the status quo, but don&apos;t expect to come out with some powerful tech that your enemy cannot counter with pure massive numbers.  Most will say &quot;so what,&quot; but the original did not play with this feature and the fact that they changed it to its current state of merely being a copy of other strategy games from the time.  Though SCII was not around when 2160 came out, the experiences are very similar so expect 2160 to be a worse looking, less-balanced game with a practically dead community (what community?).  As for the story -- which no one I&apos;ve seen has mentioned -- is just terrible.  Perhaps if you think the Sci-Fi channel movies have good storylines, then you&apos;ll like this... but really the story of this game is about like the sequel to Starship Troopers movie (not the book).  That is to say a mediocre story with interesting points that suddenly was **** on and left harden in the sun.  The story is more a soap now, with focus on personal relationships, than on politics and the cultures of the different factions.  Once again, average in itself but terrible in respect to its predecessor.  ______  Take this in stride.  The game at least functions.  There are at least groupings and defense, and so forth.  The AI will kick your ass until you figure out its quircks.  There is resource acquisition and technological advancement.  But advancement will not get you victory unless one side has completely neglected advancing...  But is any of this new?  It makes me sad that its predecessor from many years before was vastly superior.  It was unique and challenging; this one just seems to want to be a Blizzard game.  But I say not all games need to be Blizzard games: there needs to be variety, and this game simply is not it.  Some people care nothing about variety.  Then, please, play this game: you will enjoy the monotony, I&apos;m sure. _____ Perhaps this will sate those who have not played the game yet see fit to give a game a good rating due to not seeing a &quot;reason&quot; for a negative review. _____ Main negatives: -&gt; Gameplay focused on reflex rather than strategy.  -&gt; Repetitive, lack of variety and customization of the predecessor.  -&gt; Poor, melodramatic storyline.  -&gt; Drops cultural and political complexity of predecessor.  -&gt; Lack of community. _____ Positive: +&gt; It works.  +&gt; It&apos;s cheap (now).  +&gt; You can laugh at the bad writing.  +&gt; There is advancement and neat technologies (though they do not mean much, honestly, during gameplay).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=2061900">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Purchased Dec 2008. Basically thought I couldn&apos;t go wrong for a game &lt;$5. I was wrong. Its pretty rubbish. Dialog was probably written by an adolescent (i.e. pretty lame). There are a few bugs/annoying &quot;features&quot;. Honestly you are not scraping the barrel here, but its pretty bad. I can think of no good reason to buy this game now....i.e. in 2009.</span>

I thought it to be significantly sub standard. Its an interesting concept from those Mars books but the interface is poor and the gameplay difficult to control. Its cheap knoff off of command and conquer and would recommend anyone else not to waste their money! CONS: - interface poor - instrcutions limited - can crash - graphics okay but nothing special - basically mine and build to conquer concept - loose plot and missions - freezes when saving or in certain combat situations temporarily but only your mouse freezes noit yur enemies. I have great machine with top of the line graphics card, so its not the computer. Pro: - they had build in cheats so i could end the agony faster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=387172">Expand</a></span>

Now I have only played a little, but on the &quot;defend the space gun&quot; ED mission I finally realized what I was doing wrong. First off, NEVER use the default vehicles, you will want to specialize your vehicles for the situation you need them for. The LC, for example, use energy based weapons... so having energy repulsive armor is a good idea. Rockets are great anti building, but don&apos;t hit fast moving vehicles as well, let alone infantry. Air Craft can destroy an LC base in a matter of minutes, if all anti-air craft vehicles / sentry guns are destroyed. The LC has few, if any, anti-aircraft capabilities... however their ground capabilities are quite impressive. Second, unlike games like Warcraft, sending in everyone at once WILL get everyone killed. You actually need to analyze the targets and choose which ones to take down... Destroying power generators/distributors is a great way to severely cripple enemy defenses. And although you can &apos;destroy&apos; enemy structures, the ED can &apos;invade&apos; enemy structures and destroy them from within. The LC has a unit called the &apos;hacker&apos; which can take over enemy vehicles, what you have here is a new level of complexity. Actual battlefield tactics rather then assault... but the information you are given in game is inadequate and will NOT help you at all. You have to be able to recognize each structure the enemy has and be able to know what technology they are using. For instance, the ED and LC both have an anti rocket vehicle which WILL make your rocket attacks ineffective. The differences in combat is so much different then other RTS</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=392970">Expand</a></span>

This was made especially frustrating by the fact that the one time i had played it, it looked and played amazingly well. so I went and bought the retail for 9 bucks, and found an amazing game. the graphics are top notch- easily the best in any RTS game out at the moment. The customization features harken to &quot;Dawn of War&quot;, and make for an experience that makes multiplayer games over LAN, internet, or Skirmish reason enough to get the game in and of itself. the campaign, while a little iffy, gets the story through with good enough story telling to give you incentive to reach the next mission, along with main characters that are halfway decent. in short- go out, get the retail (not the bug-riddled steam) version of this game, and enjoy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=389077">Expand</a></span>

Super hard for those casual RTS&apos;ers. It can take a lot of trial and error to get a good army going. The graphics are truely awesome, and the game is one of the most stable I have ever seen. no freezing (Other than auto saves), no crashes. I had 1 glitch ONCE and it was fixed with a quick reload of the game. The game engine movies are sub par sadly, and the voice overs, though alright, the lip sync just doesn&apos;t exist. It&apos;s like your characters are pretending to be packman while they talk. But it is fine because it still gets the point across. I highly recommend this game to everyone. And if you played 2140 or 2150, you MUST get this game. And to any fools that say this game is to complicated, go back to school, learn to read, then try the game again. The game explanations make perfect sense. Some weapon descriptions are lacking, but just try them out. Also, someone below said you have unlimited resources... I don&apos;t think he even played the game. Resource limitation is probably the only thing that hurts this game. You have a very short window in the missions to learn which weapons do what before you just barely have enough resources for 1 or 2 attacks. GET THIS GAME!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=740912">Expand</a></span>

In some places superbly polished (being able to add new units directly to a group), but missing silly things, like changing your colour in the MP game. Overall a great game.</span>

Then I got into it a bit more and recognized the deep level of detail this game goes into. You can create your own untis by combining things like engines, shields, weapons, armor etc. to create thousands of combinations, each of which is useful in different situations. My only major gripe is with weapons. There are two main types - lasers and missles. Lasers are useless against buildings, missles are useless against units. There&apos;s no middle ground. So basically, you have to build an advanced army, one section to take out defenders, and one to deal with the base itself. That&apos;s arguably a good thing. I haven&apos;t played long enough to decide. Also, it&apos;s one of those &quot;infinite resource&quot; type games where you never need to move your resource gathering and you&apos;re only limited by how fast you can suck them up. So the majority of your time is spent waiting for units to train, not building the infrastructure or resource gathering to afford them. Starcraft is still FAR better, but this game is a lot more involved. It appeals to hardcore RTS fans, but this game with frustrate kids very quickly (ie. anyone under 14)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=384636">Expand</a></span>

E2160 has great graphics, gameplay that stands out among other RTSs, and a long campaign and good multiplayer. The complicated style of the game might be it&apos;s only bad point, but once you&apos;re used to it, this just adds more strategy and makes it even more fun. If you&apos;re new to E2160 don&apos;t just try it for 5 minutes and say &quot;This is too complex, I give up.&quot; Take some time to learn it and you will love it. In my opinion it&apos;s a newer more complex Starcraft. Get a retail version and not steam version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=392724">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Bugs wich were really disturbing in the beginning have been fixed after several patches.
<br>
<br>Annoying things about this game are the less of care with wich reality pump and zuxxez are handling there costumers now and the missing of &quot;Earth Net 2&quot;, wich has been promised a long time ago for this game.
<br>
<br>The only way to play balanced in the mp mode is to use the &quot;Reba Mod&quot; wich you can get at http://www.insideearth.de/ . But Reality Pump has promised to distribute a new Patch including this Reba Beta and the Earth Net 2.
<br>
<br>Another problem are the aliens wich aren&apos;t balanced in the mp mode.
<br>
<br>You should first try the demo (wich can be downloaded at http://www.earth2160.com/) and then think about downloading this game.
<br>
<br>All in all a great RTS game, especially for Single Player fans, the only really disturbing thing is the MP Part, wich will hopefully be fixed by Reality Pump in time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=58267">Expand</a></span>

And then 10 seconds later they sent in there ground troops. The voices are horrible, but you do get used to them. And at first there were some technical issues (my units still get killed when put in a structure) but with the patches and a few tweaking it works. There are also some mods out there. To be honest, it is a bit rusty, but it is the best rusty strategy game I have played ever. In fact, I wish I could play it now, but I am at work and will have to wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=397235">Expand</a></span>

Had not trouble with anything except the dialogue messing up a bit too often (hence not a 10). Still, it&apos;s a great time killer and the strategies of each side make it a bit more interesting. Very nice graphics.</span>

Earth 2160 has most of what it&apos;s renowned predecessors brought to RTS gaming.....deep, involved gameplay, excellent 3D camera control, long involved missions, unique factions and excellent multiplayer. It adds a sleek new look with graphics that will stand the test of time, some colorful characters and a new race. I&apos;ve played a lot of RTS games, and few have matched the depth of gameplay that Earth 2160 has to offer. It is one of the few games that allow you to orchestrate elaborate tactical maneuvers with your units using the record commands function. It works much like setting waypoints but gives you precise control over what your units will do and when. So you can give orders to groups of units and they will wait your command to execute their orders and then make adjustments on the fly. The four &quot;factions&quot; are all truly unique, sporting their own weapon systems to mount on their vehicles, which can be tailor made to perform various functions like main battle vehicle, artillery or anti-aircraft.  They are all similar in function, but the actual weapons are different. Their buildings and resource gathering methods are unique as well. Each faction also has it&apos;s own &quot;hero&quot;, and these characters figure prominently in the campaign, and not just in cut scenes, they are powerful tools at your disposal. Using these characters has a slight RPG feel to it, they don&apos;t level up or anything like that but the do have an inventory of weapons, armor and gadgets.  The only real downside to the game I can see is clunky lip syncing when the characters speak, and some of the voice acting can grate on you, one voice, that of Sebastian comes to mind. But you get a nice package, four robust single player campaigns, skirmish and multiplayer. I&apos;ve only played multiplayer on a LAN so I can&apos;t account for online play.  For what it&apos;s going for these days, usually less than 10 dollars, every Sci-Fi RTS fan should have this game. One thing this game is not is a cheap Command &amp; Conquer rip off. I Like the Command &amp; Conquer series as well, but for a deeper, more cerebral gaming experience the Earth 2150/60 series is light years ahead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=1447205">Expand</a></span>

The characterization of the moon women is a bit..... pink and comes off a bit misogynist. But seeing past that you have a fun RTS albeit with fairly bad graphics these days.</span>

The first few missions, which the game treats as a tutorial, are more of a constant struggle to figure out how to do what the game asks of you. Even the little things like deploying  time bombs from you hero&apos;s inventory is a lengthy struggle. That being said, putting the campaign down gives for a bit of fun. The skirmishes show the game&apos;s real strength, its diversity. The factions initially feel very different and for a few hours, you&apos;ll enjoy just figuring out how they work. Then you realize that the set-up is all that is different. The way the units fight, the strategies you use are all pretty much the same. The martian race does provide a fun and unique challenge but even that gets old fast. Overall, the confusing controls, insufferable campaign and shallow levels of diversity make for a fun couple hours but that is it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-2160/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873330">Expand</a></span>
