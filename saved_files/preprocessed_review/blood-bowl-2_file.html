The campaign provides a far better introduction to the rules to newcomers than any previous version as well, with new rules being introduced slowly game-by-game.  It is an entertaining campaign as well, although short and story focussed rather than the open campaign version seen in the original Blood Bowl game.
<br>
<br>The core of the game is with online play, although solo leagues against the AI are a useful way of trying out a team to get a feel for them before you throw them into the mix against human opponents. I would only really recommend this to those that are willing to play online versus other people, as that is where the real challenge (and therefore sense of achievement) can be found.
<br>
<br>Like all Warhammer games there is an element of luck, and minimsing risk is an important strategy. However there will be times when no matter how easy it should be to succeed, Nuffle (the in-game God of dice rolls) will say that you fail, which can be frustrating. That said, there will also be times when that last-ditch, highly unlikely attempt to score in the last turn somehow works and one of your team becomes a hero.  Just don&apos;t get too attached to them, as permanent injury (or death) is a part of the game and you will lose players along the way.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended for anyone that wants an online challenge that is turn based tactics rather than twitch shooting, and is willing to learn from losses and failures along the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blood-bowl-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6037733">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really like it, cant say if it&apos;s better then previous.
<br>Don&apos;t have any trouble with camera view as i see many say, kind of like the angle.
<br>Got it on a Steam sale though 45 Euro is to much and DLC teams for 8 Euro is to much.
<br>Got the game for 26 and DLC for 4 which is reasonable imo for this game.</span>

For the first few hours it&apos;s fun, as you develop a team and learn the game. But at some point it dawns on you that BB2 just isn&apos;t much of a game. It&apos;s flashy graphics, silly commentary and unbalanced RPG/turn based strategy. It should be good but refuses to be.
<br>
<br>There are three modes of play. The first is a campaign/tutorial that forces you to play human, which is an instant turnoff because humans are a bad team. The second is single player mode, a completely pointless endeavor, because half the teams are so squishy that they are useless for long term play for you, while the NPC apparently has no problems at all playing them, no matter how many of their players you kill or maim. And this is really the big problem with offline play in this game. Everything you do is pointless because you never gain a competitive advantage over the AI teams. If your team is more valuable, the AI simply gives itself ludicrous amounts of money before the game to even the scales. But your team is never cheaper than the AI team because the game balances all the opponents to your level. It&apos;s just awful, awful game design and kills the RPG aspect of the game completely.
<br>The third game mode is obviously online multiplayer. And this is also completely pointless except for the twelve people who do nothing but play the game online. Any casual BB player or just normal person will be stomped endlessly and have no fun at all.
<br>The game also runs poorly, has excessive loading times and many lazy design decisions. For example: all the fans are humans, regardless of which race you&apos;re playing. And so are the cheerleaders. And none of them match their colors to your uniforms in home games, or to the opposing team&apos;s in away games. Why not? This sounds like it should have taken about half an hour of programming to fix, so why hasn&apos;t it been?
<br>
<br>With Chaos League and Blood Bowl preceding it, Blood Bowl 2 marks the grave of the failed attempts at translating the Blood Bowl board game into a video game. Each one has been more pathetic than the last because the people making these games apparently have no clue how to actually make video games. What is the point of this awful game? It can&apos;t be for single player gaming because it isn&apos;t balanced for that, or apparently intended for it in any way. And it can&apos;t be multiplayer either because that is an unbalanced pile of trash, where a handful of lifeless people live all day in the hopes of finding a noob they can make request a refund by destroying their team.
<br>There is nothing here for anyone except a small group of diehard weirdos. And they only like it because they know how to game the multiplayer and win every match.
<br>There is almost no meaningful management of your team, no real tactical control because it is based on dice rolls and no persistent league structure. Just knockout cups you can repeat endlessly until you go mad. And you can&apos;t even see the brackets. It&apos;s just so, so lazy and bad all round. But of course a persistent league structure and long term play would be pointless anyway, because most of the teams are too squishy and expensive to sustain for more than a few games. Try playing elves, when you will usually lose three to five players to injury or death pr game, each costing 80 000+, when your income is about 40 000 pr game. Great design people! Just awesome. And to hammer home how lazy the developers are, there are no longer visible upgrades on players as they develop. This was in the first Blood Bowl game btw. But what the hell, let&apos;s save a few bucks! Anyone who buys this crap is dumb as rocks anyway, so they probably won&apos;t even notice. All hail the bottom line!
<br>I was going to give this turd a 5, because it is alright for the first few hours until you realize that you&apos;ve been fooled. But then I remembered Cyanide&apos;s obvious stripping of content with this release. Races are missing, features are missing etc. And you know they&apos;re gonna want to charge you for all of it later when their twelve customers have grown bored. Pay more money for another useless race for this trashy game? Suuuure....
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s a tip for you Cyanide: If you want to fleece your customers for content that should be in the game, make a good game first. Otherwise you&apos;re not going to have any customers to fleece. Business 101 there for you, and absolutely free, unlike what the halflings presumably will be. So to sum up: 1: Make good game, 2: Swindle stupid customers. It&apos;s very simple.
<br>
<br>Steer clear. Seriously.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blood-bowl-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6894673">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Instead of focussing on making stupid &quot;madden like football experience&quot;, with goal posts and TV cameras etc in the game, maybe the developers should of focussed on making things which SHOULD be in the game.
<br>
<br>I wont complain about all the races not being included, because I can understand how expensive it is to make one race. But they spent their resources on making **** that shouldn&apos;t be in the game.

<br>If they had JUST kept everything Blood Bowl 1 Chaos Edition was and expanded with the nicer graphics and the extra tidbits of customization (stadium, jerseys, etc.), this game would&apos;ve been pretty great.  Instead, they cut out ohhhh, about half of the teams that WERE previously available, they decimated the primary game mode (campaign; it&apos;s now HUMANS ONLY), and the &quot;updated&quot; UI is a joke.  Not saying BB1 had the best interface, but at least it never claimed that its interface would blow minds left and right the way these jerk developers did.
<br>
<br>This is the ultimate example of &quot;Hey, we own this IP, how can we squeeze the most money out of morons who aren&apos;t paying any attention? No no no, don&apos;t worry about quality, just put brighter colors, bigger text, and SAY that you made a better version, they&apos;ll never notice the difference&quot; (oh PS, they apparently think PC gamers are dumber than they are; hint: we&apos;re not).  Buy this game ONLY if you hate money or love supporting that guy at your office who does nothing, is capable of doing barely more than nothing, and claims credit for everything, because THAT is the group of people who developed this game.
<br>
<br>BUY BLOOD BOWL CHAOS EDITION.  You will be 100x happier, take my word for it (I&apos;ve played Blood Bowl on tabletop for 15+ years and have completed BB1 campaign mode with every race).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blood-bowl-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5512950">Expand</a></span>

No surprise considering they haven&apos;t changed since the board game came out. Updated graphics are nice. Presentation is pretty good, but like any sports game, the commentary is limited to generic comments and gets repetitive fairly quickly. The league play is a nice addition, making online tournaments and friendly leagues simple to organize. The biggest issues I have with the game are that it is missing many of the races from the previous game (which will be coming out as DLC at an unknown price point) and it is missing a lot of the little things that gave the previous iteration flavor. The stands are filled with mostly humans, and the monstrous races don&apos;t get their own cheerleaders. I was hoping to see flavor enhancements along with the graphics update, but it actually regressed slightly in that respect. As an updated version of digital Blood Bowl, it is a fine game that is still fun to play, but it is almost certainly overpriced for what little improvement it offers over Chaos Edition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blood-bowl-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5513401">Expand</a></span>

<br>During the Beta there were some issues with some of them addressed so the Developers deserve credit for their efforts.
<br>Orcs are a pain to play against if your just starting a new team. Black Orcs are OP- End of story.
<br>Dont get me wrong , this game has the whole &quot; one more match&quot; thing going for it but the terrible thing is that the wind can get knocked out of your sails just as quickly.
<br>The games i played had me against some very toxic players. If they lost, they were raging. To some degree it topped League of Legends toxic community. But then again to their defense it happened to me to where it took everything out of me not to shut down my computer, go outside , beat on a tree. If you like taking risks stay away from this game, because it will punish you.
<br>
<br>The Races however are fun to play and Developer support has been top notch. Its immensely rewarding to tackle someone else s team members. If you get tired of the slow mo tackle animations you can disable them in the settings menu.
<br>
<br>I gave it a 5 due to its immensely frustrating moments, the community that i have met and some doubts about the randomized system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blood-bowl-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5504188">Expand</a></span>

If your looking for an action game then this is not for you, this game is all about the tactics and trying to play to your advantages and playing to your opponents weaknesses. The only annoying thing is the insanely bad luck i get sometimes but then it goes the other way as well. Great game.</span>

PVP matches are based solely on team value rather than player skill, so having a basic team get pounded time after time by levelled teams means that getting any of the players levelled up without injury after injury or even death, becomes a pointless grind. Losing match after match simply isn&apos;t fun, and what on earth is the point of playing a game if not to have fun?
<br>
<br>Plus points? The character animations are excellent and Jim and Bob the commentators are hillarious! A great addition to this sort of game.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this? If you&apos;re familiar with Blood Bowl (either the board game or the first Blood Bowl PC game) then yes, having pre-existing knowledge of how each type of player works and how each type of team plays will be essential and will allow you crucial early victories, enabling your players to develop their skills.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve never played Blood Bowl before or are unfamiliar with this type of game then I can only suggest getting a hammer and breaking your own fingers with it, you&apos;ll have much more enjoyment than you would playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blood-bowl-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5554818">Expand</a></span>
