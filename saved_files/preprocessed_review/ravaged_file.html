The map environments are well detailed and are interesting to explore. However, this game just feels awful. The controls and gunplay are extremely awkward. Besides the fact that the game just feels wrong, there is also absolutely NO playerbase to mention. At any given time I can log in and fine anywhere from 1-15 people playing. Also, the START match button on the menu has been broken for months and the developers have done nothing except tell you to use the browse feature instead. This game also frequently crashes on me.
<br>Overall, this game really has no unique or interesting value to it. It is a very weak developed shooter with lots of broken features and no playerbase.
<br>If the developers of Ravaged could at least take the time to fix a major bug present at the main menu, maybe I wouldn&apos;t rate the game as low as I am. But as of right now, Ravaged is by far one of the worst games I have purchased, ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravaged/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190299">Expand</a></span>

In this game the Skill of the players really matters with all the stuff around, like weapons, vehicles, helicopters, pre-fire, reflex, etc etc. - also you will need to cooperate to win a Match. If you go Lonewolf or the team goes completely random, you lose the match in a couple of Minutes. Yeah there are some bugs in the game, but the game got HIGH potentials for the Competitive zone and the Developers support the Community, not like the other SH that doesn&apos;t care about the Community ( &quot; shut up and give us the money &quot; style ). People who complain about this game and give 0 Score it&apos;s because they probably sucked at this game and/or they are noob. Reading people that said &quot; omg this game sucks because you can&apos;t hit &quot; - &quot; omg this game sucks because i can&apos;t fly with the helicopter &quot; - just ignore them, since the Heli is the HARDEST vehicle to use in Ravaged and need lot of time on It and the part for the Hits, well, get aim and you will get Kills. The Sniper Rifle have the Bullet Drop and with 2 Hits in the body kills, 1 in the head (headshot) one-shot, from distances you need to calibrate the shot and pre-fire it (ie: if u shoot the bullet doesn&apos;t hit in that instant moment like actual noob cod games). Don&apos;t forget that the 2Dawn Team release TOTALLY FREE DLC, with new weapons, vehicles, maps and game modes - i repeat : FREE and with the lot of Feedbacks they receive, the game will be more balanced and the bugs will be no more, with the help of the community. To end : You are a Noob (and it&apos;s not an offense, once we were it too) ? You don&apos;t have Skills ? You can&apos;t drive vehicles since they also need skills ? You don&apos;t like vehicle based games ? You can&apos;t Hit ? Well, this game IS NOT for you, so better jump in a moar easy game ppl  =)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravaged/user-reviews?user_review_id=2914258">Expand</a></span>

<br>Not very good right now.  Bought it on Saturday, but with Chivalry taking up my time, I hadn&apos;t gotten around to it.
<br>
<br>Basically there&apos;s no one playing.  Those that ARE playing, are playing the demo version.  Which means when you buy the game you&apos;ll be playing matches with/against the people playing the demo.  So basically you bought the demo.  Only had about 40 people playing the game with 3/4 or more of them playing demo versions.  When I played it&apos;s well...decent sort of.  Didn&apos;t try out the helicopter.  The cars control weird.  Don&apos;t know why the 360 controller doesn&apos;t use the triggers for gas/brake...but perhaps that&apos;s able to be rebinded.
<br>
<br>Told the game to enable VSync yet it won&apos;t.  That doesn&apos;t help.  Overall the controls don&apos;t make much sense....nothing sprinted on the gamepad.  Many of the buttons didn&apos;t seem to do anything. The graphics are OK.  Nowhere near BF3.  Sort of all over the places.  Some aspects look good, others look dated.  Can&apos;t really place it.   Just reminds me of old school FPS from the 2000-2005...that&apos;s just kind of the impression I get, except obviously more advanced in many areas.  Wasn&apos;t impressed with the game, but perhaps that&apos;s because of few players.  Should have waited for more reviews, and wish others mentioned the dearth of players playing it.  Hopefully it gets better.  The setting is nice.  The maps are big.  But without players playing it, and needing better controls it just sort of seems to fall flat.  I&apos;ll give it a 5.  (which isn&apos;t on the American school grade system of 5 = F).  5 simply means very mediocre.   Lots better out there.  Many with much more players.  They should do a free weekend for Steam, and/or lower the price.  Looks like another online game bought that no one plays.  Oh well.  Knew it was a risk, so ultimately my fault.  Guess the good fun Chivalry provided lowered my guard.  Seems though this game might be one of those that only has a few months of playability before it dies out.  Vehicle combat?  Guess you need enough players to be around your vehicle to have those.  Sadly the one I played on only had about 8 total people, and I was driving..so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravaged/user-reviews?user_review_id=2706332">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is bug ridden to the point of invisible walls, &quot;flying people,&quot; and lag driven cars. The game itself would be a decent shooter, but the constant frame drops leave this game completely unplayable. Good idea, terrible execution.</span>

The on-foot gunplay is barely interesting at all, and this means that a small number of maps without vehicles are absolutely pointless.  One map, namely Oilrig which plays in a king-of-the-hill sort of way, has some pretty bad balance issues too.  After the beta there aren&apos;t any game-breaking flaws, but the game still has its share of bugs, like a Statue of Liberty that you can walk right through, sprinting while crouching playing the sprinting animation but not actually increasing your speed, and a few indoor environments with screwed up lighting.  The price is right and it has some really great maps and vehicles, but it needs some polishing, and a portion of it is something you won&apos;t enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravaged/user-reviews?user_review_id=2706303">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Its a really good game, this game is like a mix of borderlands and battlefield. So basically a war in the wastelands. Graphics is great, overall game experience is great. But they could add a little more weapons and remove the lens flare a little. Otherwise for &#xA3;15 its a great game for the price!</span>

<br>To start off with, this weekend was a free weekend for the game, so I fortunately didn&apos;t have to purchase the game. This game is just bad. It&apos;s one of those fun bads, but still bad. To start off with, the graphics aren&apos;t THAT great. I have my settings on High, and even then the textures look questionable. Graphics aren&apos;t everything, and they aren&apos;t straight out horrid, but not that good.
<br>
<br>For gameplay? Oh god no. First off one of the major things I thought this game was about was the vehicles. Turns out, they&apos;re terrible. They drive absolutely horrible and defy physics sometimes. The sounds produced by the vehicles are alright, but just end up producing an annoying buzz after so long. The weapons are just silly. Most of the time the recoil either is absent totally, or is so large isn&apos;t not even funny. It&apos;s also funny how when you ADS, there is next to no recoil, while in third person mode, it&apos;s very large. The weapons aren&apos;t balanced either, as the M4 kills super fast, the snipers are trash (literally, they don&apos;t even work), and the pistols are just as good as any pistol in any game. Maps are alright. They got lazy at some points, when you go to a stair you just magically teleport to the top of them, you can get stuck in many parts.. it&apos;s just horribly put together.
<br>
<br>Again, 28 minutes, not that long, but I just couldn&apos;t take it after using my M4 to blast my way to their spawn and camp them while my team just gathers gas cans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravaged/user-reviews?user_review_id=2885410">Expand</a></span>
