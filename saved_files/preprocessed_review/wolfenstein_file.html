It seems too many people reviewing games have a checklist like the one below:: Graphics: Good Sound: Good Story: Good Cinematics: Good Gameplay: Rubbish Overall: Good Excuse my example above but a game is more than a sum of its parts. This game is a look back at how action packed first person shooters used to be, atmospheric, intense, hardcore, fun and not taking themselves too seriously. It seems if Half-life 1 was released today people would give it really bad reviews because they wouldn&apos;t find it &apos;groundbreaking&apos; enough. This game has a beautiful engine that is not overcrowded, cumbersome and detrimental to gameplay. The game has a beautiful array of weapons, powers and Nazi&apos;s with a death wish. The enemies are fun to fight and the game itself is very immersive. Too many FPS games around these days cater for the console market and are dumbed down, this however is an example of a classic shooter that I will remember fondly, sadly I can&apos;t say the same for alot of the rubbish thats around today. In conclusion support the few people who still make games with the hardcore dedicated fans in mind and buy this game now!!! p.s. if you dont like first person shooters don&apos;t buy them and don&apos;t review them giving good games a bad score please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=84903">Expand</a></span>

If you like FPS games, then you should pick up this one.  The story is far-fetched, but remember this is Wolfenstein.  It&apos;s really fun to play and I played through the game 3 times after first purchasing it from Steam.  This game doesn&apos;t try to be anything other than what it is, so stop trying to compare it to other games .. many of which have their own drawbacks.  The variety of the bosses will make you think (especially during the first playthrough) and there are many different stages to break the monotony of other FPS&apos; (fight in hospitals, farms, streets, and of course castles).  I also like how the maps sort of meld together making it feel like you&apos;re in one big overall map.

                                        <span> I enjoyed this game a lot for my PC. The guns were all great and rewarded the player with satisfying kills. The sounds are done perfectly and create an intense environment in a heated battle. If you enjoy FPS games then you must give this game a play through, it&apos;s not revolutionary but it&apos;s still a very solid and entertaining shooter.</span>

The guns and violence are unbelievably stunning. It&apos;s amazing how many games call themselves shooters but forgot to make shooting the best part of it. Finding hidden items is ACTUALLY fun in this game because they are required for upgrades and they&apos;re cleverly hidden. The dynamic between the medallion powers, the guns themselves, and the epic brutality of the game will knock you out of your chair. I&apos;ll tell you this, once you have the particle cannon, the tesla gun, and the leichenfaust, you will crap yourself in amazement while you tear through challenging but ultimately helpless groups of enemies. Oh ya, and there are boss battles. Dope. OH YA, make sure you play on &quot;I am death incarnate&quot; difficulty.

The game runs smoothly, contains lots of action, lots of cool weapons and a lot of interesting missions. i agree that this game is underrated as it is, cause it deserves at least 8 if not 9. the story could be improved though, but the missions are always different, and never gets repetetive, which is a big plus for a shooter! you just have to consider this game a new IP, and stop thinking of it as a wolfenstein game. if you can do that, then you should buy this game instantly, cause it&apos;s worth the money. i would personally tell you not to buy the console versions though, all servers are private hosted, and therefore all the servers lag and hit detection gets awfull. many different game modes in the multiplayer game and upgrades for your guns and veil abilities. have fun and enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=85698">Expand</a></span>

First is Gameplay, it is bad for a few reasons. The game trains you early on to look for weak spots on enemies and objects, it highlights these weak spots in red, however, later on in the game, these red weak spots are used only some of the time, leaving you wondering how to complete a mission or reach an objective, or kill a boss. You will die many needless deaths because of this. The AI in this game is just awful, enemies will throw gernades and then run into them, you can shoot people&apos;s heads off, but if they fall off a ledge they will scream with no head. You can shoot enemies that are no aware of you yet with a sniper rifle and they will continue to walk like nothing happened. In terms of strategy simply wait in a corner and any grunts you alerted will eventually walk in front of you making for an easy kill, if they don&apos;t blow themselves up first. Graphics do the job, they look the part, the veil world is a nice touch but the entire open world setting could have been dropped in favor of cut scenes like the original. The open world ends up becoming a pain later on in the game once you&apos;re weapons are upgraded, you will simply switch to the veil world just to run fast through the maps. Sound will react dynamically to the action on the screen, however, it&apos;s buggy, many times it will continue to play the suspenseful music while nothing is happening simply because 1 gaurd is lost on the map trying to find you. The weapon upgrade ability is a cool feature, however if you miss a gold bag/bar while playing a mission, you can&apos;t go back to that mission to replay it, so if you miss any secrets or gold it&apos;s gone until you play again. The game is decent, but not what you would expect from a AAA title especially considering that its wolfenstein, it&apos;s worth playing, but only as a rental or a year from now when it&apos;s $20 used at the game store.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=85342">Expand</a></span>

At first sight, mp seemed horrible.

                                        <span> I dont normally like WW II shooters but believe me when i say that this game is a blast. As Jae Q said the SP is phenomnal. On the low side, the graphics are bit outdated but still nice. I found MP a bit lacking... But if you want a good SP experience dun miss this one.</span>

                                        <span> Wolfenstein is not a genre revolution but something I&apos;ve been looking for since I finished Prey: a very good and atmospheric shooter, put together by a bunch of people how know how to do it. It runs even on low end systems but is looking good on high end systems. The multiplayer mode could have been a lot better but still Wolfenstein will give you a run for it&apos;s money.</span>

One review states &quot;Wolfenstein doesn&apos;t Revolutionize the genre...&quot; (many reviews state similar things) Really? Is that what we really want? For each game ever released to sequentially revolutionize its genre? Is it not enough to just be a great game? a fun game (isn&apos;t that the reason we play, for fun)? Now every game is scrutinized unless it, in some way, reinvents the genre. Doesn&apos;t anyone else see this as an unrealistic expectation? Maybe its just me be I like the way FPS shooters are now. Why so much emphasis &quot;revolutionizing&quot;? Take a look at Fallout3. Sure it put a new twist on FPS combat... but it was awkward and sucked. It became trivial, involved zero skill, and was boring. Anyway, Wolfenstein did a great job of incorporating many different elements that make a good FPS work. AI and several other things may not be perfect, but in all it is a great game worth playing for the single player alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=84637">Expand</a></span>

When i got that kill on the train station i was instantly hooked. The graphics were great and the game runs smoothly on my new GTX285, i also liked the sound in the game. The other Wolfenstein games focused on gameplay and graphics but lacked some sound quality, Eg, the sound of each weapon being fired or an explosion, But Raven and ID must have have concentrated on all aspects, and they did a good job. This is a great game and i think it is currently one of the best FPS games of the year. THIS GAME IS UNDERRATED!

Then suddenly, holy crap. The game goes nuts. You get particle cannons. Tesla cannons. Flame throwers that shoot like 30m. Rocket launchers. And the dogs bollocks, the leichenfaust 44, which shoots a high energy wave of death at your foes with disintegrates them on contact.<br><br>Then the enemies! You get Plasma warriors, (carry Particle Cannons). Flame Warriors, (carry Flammenwerfers - Flame Throwers). You get women with their **** showing who do like martial arts. You get women with green energy whips. you get demented possessed skeletons. and the Boss a hunk with two mini guns, (one in each hand).<br><br>The graphics are alright but not as good as other games like dead space 2. It is a fairly old game now though, ( for PS3).<br><br>If you don&apos;t buy it your insane.<br><br>Warning: very boring after first playthrough, but if you leave it for about 4-6 months then play it again you kinda forget what happens so its more interesting</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=1719599">Expand</a></span>

I would say Wolfenstein is every bit as much as fun as it predecessor (Return to Castle Wolfenstein). It improved in some areas: graphics might not be amazing, but they&apos;re good enough to be atmospheric (especially the visuals of the &quot;veil&quot;, the ominous dimension the Nazis discovered), and the gameplay has actually improved due to the &quot;magic&quot; powers (slowing time, activating a short term shield) with the occult amulet. It play like a mixture between a traditional FPS and Deus Ex. What got worse, perhaps, is the level design: RTCW had amazing (single player) maps, and Wolfenstein only has &quot;meh&quot; maps so far. But taken together, I have as much fun in single player as I had with RTCW. I&apos;m torn between rating it 8 or 9, but since the game is underrated IMO, I&apos;ll go with 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=2092214">Expand</a></span>

I cant believe how the heck this game got so many bad reviews. This is my first review ever and my English is bad. So plz forgive me if there are any mistakes! There are some aspects on which we enjoy or review the game.( They are not treditional parameters but are those which a games notices while playing a game) Graphics:- 10 on 10 I dont think the graphics were bad! Seriously. Who cares what engines is being used. The graphics were stunning. YES. Believe me. I have played Crysis, Crysis warhead, Prototype, COD 4, COD 5, Bionic commando, gears of wars, Mirror&apos;s edge etc. I think there were very good minute details provided in the game, as various powers effect, barrel changing their shapes after using Veil energy(3 times), flying creatures after using vail effects, extremely beautiful environment effects, models sure are beautiful. One thing that surprises me that meny people say this game is GREEN, coz i think those people have not played GEARS OF WAR. That game didn&apos;t had any color other than grey. And still people found that graphics FANTASTIC. Prototype had cartoonish graphics which didnt looked real at any point of time. Animation:- WOW Remember the first guy you kill in the first level at railway station. Dont you think the that FELT fantastic.Those were really fluent. Its really satisfying to see that guy dying in the proper manner. The other game you will feel the same is COD 4. On top of that this game has very good destructible environment. A.I. : 8 on 10 Yes the a.i. is not that good. Our allies keep comin in our way. Enemy coming streight into the line of fire. BUT they are not horrible and still serve the purpose of providing good gameplay ( i played on HARD difficulty so others views may be differnt about A.I.) Mission Varity :- 10 on 10 We do have some difficult tasks to do in various beautiful levels. On one mession we are in Airfield and for another we had to go to farm. Cmon, i don&apos;t think anyone will say tat the mission were repeatative as GEARS OF WAR or PROTOTYPE. BOSSES:- 9 on 10. Bosses were really good and different. One strategy cannot be used with another boss. They were not only differet but also great fun as Serious Sam. SOUND : 10 on 10. I am yet to read any bad thing in this department, so i have nothing to say. ( i havnt played multiplayer so i cant comment on it!.) DONT BELIEVE CRITICS. So those gamers who have not yet played the game, plz go ahead and buy it. Its probably one of the top 5 fps realeased in this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=84279">Expand</a></span>

Games don&apos;t need to be revolutionary to be good and this game is proof positive that by pushing tried and tested gameplay mechanics you can still get a good game. I regret missing this game when it was first released and have only just got around to playing it all the way through. The crazy comic book genre mash up concept of Wolfenstein is well realised with some very stylish and cool design throughout. The graphics are excellent overall and Raven have achieved a great atmosphere from good use of soft HDR lighting to embellish the period, special effects and superb sound. Special mention must go out to Bill Browns music which really contributes to Wolfensteins barn storming WW2 set pieces. There are some great action and suspense orchestral beats. As you would expect from ID and Raven the weapons are amazing. I never get tired of spinning up the particle gun and hosing down an entire platoon of Nazis. Animations are nice and the way enemies react to getting shot makes the combat very satisfying with the addition of special powers adding good variety and tactics. It has a more exploration driven game structure after the strictly linear Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Overall, this is an FSP I can highly recommend to anyone who loves the genre. I can&apos;t understand the mediocre reviews at all. Great stuff!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=2542275">Expand</a></span>

In fact, I think I like Wolfenstein 2009 even a bit better. Here&apos;s why.
<br>
<br>****************************************************************************************************
<br>
<br>First, play the game on &apos;hard&apos; difficulty, please. Some people here complain the game is too easy, but on &apos;hard&apos;, you&apos;ll have a challenge. The enemies act suprisingly smart: the human ones run for cover,  the supernatural ones charge you, then retreat again. It all feels very natural. The best levels are, in my opinion, the late stages of the town Isenstad you discover. There&apos;s an area, where resistance fighters and Nazis battle for supremacy, around some castle entrance. Now, this is not a sandbox game, so the the dynamics are more or less predetermined, and the resistance never wins. But just walking into this scene looks marvelous, like a war movie, only with uber-engineered Nazi Super soldiers that looks like Battlemechs, and undead Nazi officers that radiate pure evil. This particular scene, I would often replay: walk into the area, join the fight, and once it&apos;s over, leave the area and re-enter, just to play it again (it changes a bit every time).
<br>
<br>****************************************************************************************************
<br>
<br>There are two things I loved the most about this game. Number 1: it is relatively &quot;non-linear&quot;, at least for an FPS. Not all areas are like the battle ground described above, some are more restrictive (only one way leads to the end), but in general, enemies emerge relatively naturally, so it doesn&apos;t feel too scripted, and how you defeat them is up to you: rushing into them, using all your powers to quickly overwhelm them, or cautiously kill them one by one. The game allows both playing styles, and I like that. ****************************************************************************************************
<br>
<br>Number 2: the biggest strength of this game for me is the design, both of the world and of the enemies. The enemies look, sound  and behave fantastic. The standard soldiers are nothing new, sure, but the power armor super soldier, or the undead Nazi officers look stunning. Are you old enough to remember the original Doom? Do you remember how your heart skipped a beat when you entered a room and suddenly heard the familiar &quot;clank, clank&quot; sound, the sound that gave away cyber demon? That feeling is back, for several foes. Here&apos;s the most scary one: you run into an open area. Suddenly seeing some faint green or red glow in the distance. Now you only have a breathless second to think, oh **** before the undead reincarnation of an SS officer stands in front of you, streams of menacing energy emanating from his body, and he splits you in half. The visual design of the world is equally amazing, maybe the best level: a giant Nazi Zeppelin. It all has the visually powerful, expensive feel of an Indiana Jones or Hellboy movie. This combiation of Diesel Punk and Nazi Occultism is not new, other games and movies have done it before, but it is pulled off brilliant in this game, and, in my opinion, is even more satisfying than in RTCW. ****************************************************************************************************
<br>
<br>That said, the game is not perfect: it is a bit too short. Also, it is missing some really big levels, with a wide area of engagement, like RTCW had. Finally, if you play it on &apos;hard&apos;, it&apos;s challenging, but not consistently so: you yourself die very easily on &apos;hard&apos; difficulty (any attack of a stronger enemy kills you, which is good). But with the right &quot;crystal powers&quot; (slowing time, overcharging your attack, shield), even the strongest (non boss) enemy dies very quickly as well. I would have preferred if some extra strong enemies would have had more health, and it would take you a long time before you can destroy them. The way it is now, if you react fast, activate the right powers, you kill any enemy in a few seconds. If you make a mistake, you die. But there are no (non-boss) enemies that &quot;put up a fight&quot;, i.e. that you have to work on for a minute before they go down. That makes the game play a bit too shallow sometimes.
<br>
<br>****************************************************************************************************
<br>
<br>Summary: A great game, every bit as good as Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The &quot;crystal powers&quot; (like slowing time) work very well, the game is challening if played on &apos;hard&apos;, but the best part is the visual design of the world and the enemies: it feels just viscerally satisfying to fight those beautifully designed power-armor Nazis or the glowing undead officers that I can forgive the minor game play problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=2534715">Expand</a></span>

Youll be lucky to find 20 people playing, globally, even at peak times. This game is so full of bugs and problems, quite honestly, I dont think it can even be fixed with multiple patches. Even the single player has many issues, where the game crashes out, locks up, causes your computer to reboot. If a class action lawsuit were feasible, I would be all for it. Do not waste your money on this game, I implore you. You will regret it. If you HAVE to try or play this game, wait a couple more months and pick it up in the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=85838">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a boring WW2 game with a boring twist. If you want to play WW2 games with weird crap like this, go play CoD5: WaW and play the zombie mode. This game really has nothing new to offer anybody. Also, it&apos;s really, really green. I rate it a 4 out of 10 simply for the cinematics.

<br>Gameplay has nothing to do with Wolfenstein, gameplay is directly copy paste of Call of Duty. You gotta hide behind cover, sprint and aimdownsights and stuff. Weaponlimit is also present.

However the game does open up and delivers more than just a FPS, but an interesting alt reality from newspaper clippings too just a world controlled by an oppressive regime.  There is a certain tone that follows the player throughout the game of being a symbol of justice and writing the wrongs for the many that suffered.
<br>
<br>Graphics may feel like a throw back to games such as Half Life 2, and other 2009 games, textures seem larger than today&apos;s standards but hardly worth noting.
<br>
<br>Enemy AI feels about perfect, enemies will try to flank you or get behind you they do seem to have times when AI pathing is interupted.  I&apos;ve only seen this a few times where the enemy will do kind of a strange dance or sit still until you kill a solder or get close to them, mostly on stairs or around corners.
<br>
<br>Weapons/Combat  are kind of disappointing the selection available for a FPS doesn&apos;t seem adequate enough to really be a today&apos;s shooter, some feel completely copied and pasted from games like dead space and Half Life 2.  A game title such as wolfenstien that pioneered FPS&apos;s it doesn&apos;t do anything to advance the genre and I would say Rage was far more innovative.
<br>
<br>System Stability had no issues running on a I5 2400 3.4ghz with a GTX 660 Nvidia card with settings set to high.
<br>
<br>Final thought on this game, only the player can decided if 60 dollars is worth it for them to buy, I was able to complete the game in less than 14 hours and I feel that I&apos;m a pretty thoroughly player when it comes to checking every nook and cranny of the map.  Game developers imo opened the door on the protagonists life in this alt universe but didn&apos;t do enough to make the player have an attachment and a lasting memory on the characters involved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=4203992">Expand</a></span>

I would say YES but dont expect to get more than a few months out of this game. 7/10 P.S Killing Nazis is always a pleasure, enjoy the game people!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=83948">Expand</a></span>

Here we have yet another WW2 shooter - with a twist: occult powers!! Could they BE any less imaginative? The fact that they thought of it first with the original Wolfenstein doesn&apos;t change things: It&apos;s been done to death. It&apos;s not new, it&apos;s not interesting,and it changes the whole feel of the game into something cartoony and ludicrous. When you see nazis floating in the air ... how are you supposed to take this seriously? Also, the whole health thing is just no good. Got shot? Bleeding to death? Headshot AND gutshot at the same time? no problem ... hide behind a pillar for about 10 seconds and you&apos;re perfectly healthy again.. So.. why be afraid of being shot? Or dying? Why hide or sneak? Why be careful? Why not just run around like a headless chicken and shoot the sh*t out of everything? Id, you&apos;ve got to change this. All tension and care is gone. It&apos;s hard to take anything seriously - and very soon after that it&apos;s hard to care about the game. Get rid of the instant health recovery. Stop clowning about with floating nazis and silly occult powers. The graphics, while dated, ARE really nice for the engine and run well even on older machines. You guys CAN code - you just can&apos;t make a decent game without clowning around. Why don&apos;t you grow up?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=84046">Expand</a></span>

Maybe it&apos;s my past as a Doom and Quake junkie speaking, but I had more FUN playing this &quot;old school&quot; game I ever did in CodWaW (although it had moments) or BioShock -- games with which Wolfenstein shares similarities in graphics and gameplay. I do wish the developers allowed the characters to have more personality, but I can&apos;t overcomplain. I haven&apos;t yet tried the MP, although it sounds like no one&apos;s playing anyway. Quick comments: excellent graphics (contrary to some sniping about using idTech 4), entertaining level design, great mix of camp and suspense, fun weapons, good sound (really, what are the complaints here?), inconsistent AI (sometimes fantastic, sometimes abysmal, generally passable), challenging-but-not-impossible bosses, smooth and attractive play on mid-range equipment, better than its more macabre and downbeat predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=741480">Expand</a></span>

They should have removed this feature. The main character is one of the coolest game characters I have seen. The cutscenes and the story in them is very well done. The boss battles are awesome, and the gameplay is fun.

Consoles have taken over the standard setting due to the lack of money coming from the PC gaming market. This means that the best you can see on console if the best you will ever see on PC. If you don&apos;t believe me go take a look at Cry Engine 3.

Smart move by Raven Software, who decided to go back to Wolf&apos;s routes, and focus on good strong gameplay rather than countless new elements that would otherwise drown a solid fps. OBVIOUSLY the game is going to seem similar to COD: WAW, because not only do both games take place during the same time period, but theyre both published by Activision. OBVIOUSLY Activision is going to be smart and use elements that work in one game to develop another. Isnt that what Bethesda did with Fallout 3? Anyways, back to the game itself...Graphics are slightly dated, but still look great on new hardware; game play is fierce especially in the latter stages of the game; upgrade and veil elements are a welcome plus (maybe the game wouldnt be so green if you knew how to properly play an fps...). Unfortunately, common complaints are as usual. Bad ai, terrible save point system, minimal setting variety, but none of which paralyze the game too drastically, though. The only thing i wish they would have added were more upgrades/weapons and side missions to flesh out more of the story line/setting. All in all, Wolfenstien is a game im happy to say ill play a few times through before i get bored of the SP. And if the MP is anything like its predecessors, its safe to say Wolfenstien will be on my HDD for a very long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=84058">Expand</a></span>

It is no longer ok to use a heavily modified venerable engine that runs well and loads quickly on almost any reasonable machine, if it&apos;s not Crysis, then folks condemn the graphics as &apos;bad&apos;. Let me say from the outset that the graphics of Wolfenstein are not even close to &apos;bad&apos;. They are not &apos;like a PS2&apos; as some of our more delusional commentators might suggest, they are slick, they look good and they are well animated. On a system which had such timeless classics as Civilisation and Deus Ex, the fixation on graphics is illogical and should be swept away post haste. Now that&apos;s out of the way, Wolfenstein is a thoroughly enjoyable single-player romp with a distinctly old school feel. It&apos;s about shooting Nazis, ghouls and occult creatures, just like every other Wolfenstein game and it does it well. Ravensoft, as always puts out a fantastic single-player experience with memorable and varied locals, a great selection of (upgradeable) weapons and a big variety of enemies with solid AI. 2009 has been somewhat devoid of solid single-player FPS and Wolfenstein is the best we&apos;ve seen since Project Origin. Visceral and well-thought out, with a unique spin thanks to the Veil powers, I challenge anyone with any background in PC FPSs not to enjoy this game. Ravensoft have never made a bad FPS and they certainly haven&apos;t started now. While the multiplayer might be lackluster, that was developed by a different company and I put stock in Ravensoft&apos;s ability to create a great single-player experience and they do not disappoint. One final thing, The Farm is perhaps one of the greatest FPS levels ever designed. An absolute blast to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=84176">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s still worth a run through and should keep you busy for quite some time. I could see this as much much more though, I didn&apos;t all like the supernatural side of things but it was different to most other fps titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=1792600">Expand</a></span>

When I started it up I remembered why I didn&apos;t get very far the first time round. The movement is clunky, the FOV too low, the speed too slow, the hints are annoying as are the objective markers. Fortunately, since a long time has passed since its debut a few mods have been released in the meantime, one of which is called NeuroWolf and addresses all the issues I had with the core gameplay mechanics.
<br>With NeuroWolf installed the game becomes FUN. Although, having said that, it still takes a while to get moving and it only really hits its stride about halfway through.
<br>The best parts of the game are the assaults on the Nazi bases, rather than the parts set in Isenstadt, and once you have all the Thule crystals you can really play around with your attacks. The additional weapons are ok, but I stuck to the MP40 for most of the game, barely touching the rocket launcher or Tesla gun, and saved most of the other weapons for the bosses.
<br>Overall, a fun game, mired by poor console mechanics on the PC. If this game had originally been developed for the PC, like the original Wolfenstein games, instead of being an obvious console-port, it would have been far superior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=3423894">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story: 6
<br>Just above average, many holes or &quot;just roll with it&quot; moments. Not the worst plot ever, though overdone.
<br>
<br>Graphics/Audio: 6-8
<br>Im honestly not sure how to rate this, as I cant vividly remember what other games of the time looked like, however even compared to today I don&apos;t find the graphics to be bad. Audio reached its pinnacle already, at least to people like me who aren&apos;t audiophiles, and this game has decent audio selection while being on par in recording quality.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 8
<br>Other than the roller coaster of a difficulty curve, enemies with impenetrable shields in narrow hallways in the second mission when shield penetration is the last power you get, I actually somewhat enjoyed this aspect of the game.
<br>On the hardest difficulty, it takes about as many bullets to kill you as it takes to kill an enemy, so you don&apos;t feel like some god of a human, until you get powers that is, but that&apos;s good because it feels powerful then, not just like an added bonus to your gallery of over powered stuff.
<br>Nice reaction animations of enemies, neck shots actually have appropriate animations as opposed to head shots, however the ai for grunts as a whole is stupid, and only super powered enemies possess the self preservation needed to so much as evade a grenade at their feet they are fully aware of.
<br>
<br>Overall: 7
<br>If you ever find it on sale somewhere(I believe steam has pulled it down now due to some sort of multiplayer failure) it isn&apos;t a bad game to burn through in a weekend. Is it memorable or &quot;required playing&quot;? Not really, but its fun enough, and that&apos;s really all I ask of a FPS these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=3872847">Expand</a></span>

Thus when I finally gave up waiting for a Mac version of Wolfenstein to be released, I bought the PC version and loaded it on BootCamp.  First of all... the game plays great via BootCamp.  As the game opened, I thought to myself that it was well on the way to being as much of a classic as RTCW.  But alas the game never quite makes it.  It looks good, and the play was smooth, but that is best I can say.  Unlike RTCW, the storyline of Wolfenstein never &quot;creeped me out&quot;.  The side missions seemed a waste of BJ&apos;s time and effort.  The NCPs were wooden and only served to point out how fake BJ&apos;s over all mission seemed to be. In my mind this game went a long way in convincing me that the old fashion &quot;linear game&quot; model has merit.   Don&apos;t get me wrong... the game is challenging and I was happy to play all the way through (even though the last chapter is very silly), it was nothing more than a run of the mill FPS.  The game never captured my imagination.  I vacillated on what score to give the game.  End the end, I had to give it a 7 (the edge of positive) simply for the sake of an old mutual friend... RTCW.  12 years after RTCW, it still holds up as a great came... I doubt I will be able to say the same about Wolfenstein in 12 years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=2013870">Expand</a></span>

The cutscenes have pleasing visuals, and the in-game graphics are pleasing also. The story is fairly flimsy, but that doesn&apos;t really matter for this game, because we all know Wolfenstein is all about gunning down supernatural Nazis. Combat is fairl easy on Normal, as you never run out of ammo (ammo is plentiful) and the enemy AI isn&apos;t too smart, as they just sit behind cover and wait for you to kill them. Sound effects are also quite good, like if you melee hit a Nazi with your gun you will a squishy bone crunching effect (disturbingly realistic). The game is also realistic in that enemies respond quite differently if you shoot them in different parts of the body, e.g. Shoot a soldier in the throat, and they will fall down gurgling and sputtering. Wolfenstein is a satisfying FPS that will please Wolf 3D fans as well as fans of WWII shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=2309673">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story was fine, albeit a bit weird (but it worked).  The mechanics were solid: I liked the addition of the veil powers; they added flavor and complexity, separating the game from other mindless entries in the fps genre.  I also really liked the addition of the black market/ upgrade system.  Hidden treasure has always been a big part of the series and in this game we actually had something to do with the loot we spend so much time trying to find, really cool.
<br>
<br>So yea, if you like Wolfenstein you should check this game out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=4201558">Expand</a></span>

<br>The result was awesome looking graphics, flat story, characters I didn&apos;t really cared for and entertainment of killing Germans. Some of the weapons I used only once because I can be alright just with my Tull medallion and the MP40. The best thing from the game was killing Nazis. I loved shooting them in the heads with the rifle.

<br>Overall Wolfenstein was for me just a fun game and nothing more. Great for killing not only Nazis, but also time. I am giving it with the Bulgarian school marks system where 2 is the weakest mark and 6 is the best mark GOOD 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=4912621">Expand</a></span>

<br>But it totally deserves more than 7. Story was good, gameplay could be better. No issue with graphics, game is running smoothly. Re-release it on Steam with working multiplayer, and I&apos;ll give 10. Cause it&apos;s Wolfenstein, why dafuq not. :)</span>

On the other hand, I played other id Software and Raven Software games, like Doom 1, Doom 2, Doom 3, the Quake games etc. so I was really excited about this game and I just had to try it out.
<br>
<br>I noticed the graphics first and I found them to be pretty good, even though the game uses an old id Tech 4 Engine. Wolfenstein actually looks better than many shooters from that era, including Medal of Honor: Airborne and F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. The other thing I was impressed with is the non-linear level progression. The game gives you options, which missions you&apos;d like to do first and which later. There are also many optional side mission. Of course, most of the time you&apos;ll be killing Nazis, but there are also many other creatures around, like robots etc. You can also use special powers like night vision and &quot;super shield&quot;, which can be fun to play with, but more about these things in the second paragraph. There are many different weapons in this game, for which you can buy upgrades and ammo. Some of these weapons are really cool, like the Tesla gun, but some are ridiculous. The story isn&apos;t anything special, but at least there is a story, which is a big step up from, let&apos;s say, Far Cry 2.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, the game becomes repetitive because, even though there are tons of different weapons (you will be using only one or two of them most of the time though, probably the MP40 and MP43) and different locations and sometimes different enemies, you can&apos;t escape the feeling that it is all just so &quot;nothing special&quot;. The game does not feature anything you haven&apos;t seen or experienced before. I mean, the story is unbelievably uninspired, super weapons are stolen from F.E.A.R., Doom and Quake. Locations are solid and the town of Isenstadt is well made, but the maps are too small and there is too much loading time between areas. Like I mentioned before, there are also special powers on disposal, but again, the system isn&apos;t well made and you can basically use night vision (in the game it&apos;s called the veil) all the time which kills the immersion. There are also boss fights and some of them are really hard, which is strange, because the game is in general very easy to play.
<br>
<br>Because of all the things mentioned in the second paragraph, I was a bit disappointed with Wolfenstein. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s a bad game, it&apos;s pretty fun to play and most of all, I like the non-linear mission progress, but it could have been much more. After so highly praised Return to Castle Wolfenstein, this must have come as a disappointment to many but nevertheless, I enjoyed it as much as I could.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wolfenstein/user-reviews?user_review_id=6777965">Expand</a></span>
