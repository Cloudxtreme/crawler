That is a sentence i never thought i would write! It is without a doubt the first FPS puzzler that comes near the perfection of Portal and in some, albeit subjective ways, it surpasses it.  The &quot;ways&quot; i am talking about are the technical aspects(graphics and sound) which were always a forte of Croteam and the atmosphere. This game just grabs you from the first second with its amazing puzzle design and great writing. You just have to see what comes next. Overall a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale year filled with over hyped triple A boredom. I wholeheartedly recommend buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4812148">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Direct comparison is inevitable as, like its venerable ancestor, TTP is a first-person puzzler set in a cryptic and unsettling science-fictional background, where the player has to find a way out of an environment controlled by a seemingly friendly omnipotent figure but where - of course - nothing is quite as it seems.
<br>
<br>The narrative structure varies, as TTP conveys most of its story through written text and pre-recorded messages. It also places more emphasis on the (well-designed) puzzles themselves as there is quite a lot of them, with a nicely adjusted difficulty, they can be accessed in a non-linear fashion, and completionists will have a blast finding all the secrets.
<br>
<br>The writing is smart and the voice acting is occasionally superb (Alexandra&apos;s couple of last time capsules are especially poignant, kuddos to the voice actress), but alas falls short of its predecessor cinematographic brilliance. Half-way through the game, most people will have understood everything there is to understand and will be waiting, as I have been, for a last twist or two that never come. The end of the game, while relatively satisfactory gameplay-wise, becomes more of a road to confirmation rather than a road to enlightenment as the build-up would have you believe, and you&apos;re left with the feeling that the philosophical food for thought thrown at you throughout the game, while certainly entertaining and curiosity-arousing, was maybe just a bit too much for the writers to tie-up properly.
<br>
<br>That being said, TTP remains a great experience, with very neat production values, and a satisfyingly smarter-than-average backstory and game mechanics. If you liked Portal for its blend of sci-fi puzzling, you&apos;ll feel right at home and will most likely have a blast with TTP as well! Wether or not that&apos;s worth 40&#x20AC; is ultimately up to you, as there&apos;s quite a bit more of content out-of-the-box than Portal, but a lot of it is absolutely optional.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4911332">Expand</a></span>

<br>I didn&#xB4;t bore any second while i played this game.
<br>Nice textures and good story and multiple endings.
<br>And also lift stuck troll, which croteam trolled yourselves, because it is easy to evade from it, by developer cheats haha.
<br>Great game, only - is no multiplayer why ?
<br>It could be much more fun like portal 2 :/</span>

<br>What I found great about the game was that it didn&apos;t force you to be a part of the story, if you just wanted to solve puzzles, then it left you to it, but if you wanted to delve more into the story line then it rewarded your curiousity. Considering there wasn&apos;t alot of narrative in the game in terms of videos and other cutscenes I still found myself engaging in the the philosophical questions posed by the terminals. Despite not getting many answers it only drove me to play the game even more just to see what was on the next terminal. I can honestly say that I can&apos;t wait for a sequel to this game I&apos;d love to see where the development team might take this IP. In short if you just want  to solve puzzles then play this game. If you want an engaging story then play this game. If you want both... Yup you guessed it! Play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5181321">Expand</a></span>

<br>No need to worry yourselves about input lag or your ping here; just prepare to use your mind for this adventure!  This kind of game makes me happy to be a PC gamer; loved the main story and will definitely keep installed to play some Steam workshop mods and wait for an expansion or any DLC that may be down the road hopefully.  A job well-done to the developers at Croteam for this gem!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5276865">Expand</a></span>

The story pulls you in, until the very last excruciating second, and makes you feel content in your journey. The game itself is gorgeous (albeit a bit redundant.)

<br>An amazing experience that will make you ask yourself all those questions you&apos;ve ever had about life and humanity. The game itself goes over very deep topics, this means that the player must be a person who like to stay calm, read and explore all he can get or reach.
<br>
<br>The story is based in the mystery of not knowing what the hell is happening. Every time you get information about who are you, or where you are, a new theory comes across your head. It&apos;s magic.
<br>
<br>The Talos Principle remains between reality and fiction in the genre of puzzles. While the gameplay is simple to understand but hard to reproduce, with few mechanics that work together (making the game frustrating some times), the graphics, effects and scenarios are excellent crafted and really beautiful. But clearly what highlights is the wonderful narrative and story.
<br>
<br>It is the first game in which I do not want to play the actual core game, instead find more information, stories and people thoughts in each area.
<br>
<br>The game suggest in a sublime way the future of artificial intelligence and the infinite possibilities of a virtual universe, while questioning our own universe with elaborate theories, really creepy actually Questions about life, death, consciousness and how humans act in front of a machine depending on the level of consciousness it has, instead if that machine is alive or not. Raises impossible questions that will encourage more and more to end as quickly as possible to know how the story end. Keep in mind that The Talos Principle has different endings based in your final choices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5527102">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good: It reminded me of Portal 2 in a good way.
<br>
<br>The Bad: It was not Portal 2.
<br>
<br>The Ugly: It kind of wanted to be Portal 2.
<br>
<br>Its similarities to &#x2013; and differences from &#x2013; Portal 2 are instructive. Some of these were solid choices which helped to differentiate it, but some of its differences were failures on its part which diminished it as an experience.
<br>
<br>However, perhaps the most salient difference is this: Portal 2 is about 8 hours long. The Talos Principle took me 26 hours to complete.
<br>
<br>Now, you might think that this means that The Talos Principle had massively more content than Portal 2. In a strict sense, this is true; The Talos Principle has about twice as many levels as Portal 2 did, with Portal 2 clocking in at 64 in the single-player campaign and The Talos Principle clocking in at 138, more counting the Easter eggs &#x2013; little (and sometimes big) things hidden in the various levels.
<br>
<br>However, even with twice the content, that would leave The Talos Principle at only about 18 hours in length. Whence the extra 8 hours?
<br>
<br>The answer to that is, sadly, &#x201C;running around looking at walls&#x201D;. And it is actually probably more than that, as the first half of the game is primarily spent on that activity, with far more time spent trying to find hidden puzzles than is spent on solving the actual puzzles themselves.
<br>
<br>And worse still, despite taking nearly three times as long to beat, The Talos Principle doesn&#x2019;t feel like it has more content than Portal 2 &#x2013; indeed, in many ways, it feels like it has less, as you don&#x2019;t interact with the characters as often, nor do the environments feel as varied as they did in Portal 2.
<br>
<br>Through the course of the game, the player travels through a number of different environments themed around ancient civilizations &#x2013; Greek ruins, Egyptian ruins, ruins of European churches, and even ruins of castles and forts high in snowy mountains. This contrasts sharply with the obviously technological nature of the player and of the various puzzles in the game, revealing a dichotomy between the pseudo-religious nature of Elohim, and the reality of the technological reality you inhabit. All of this contrasts sharply with the overworld hub &#x2013; a place full of what look like beautiful ancient places from the inside, but which it quickly becomes clear are naught but replicas built in concrete bunkers in a snowy place from the outside. The tower dominates your view in the overworld hub, an enormously tall spire of concrete and steel that towers over all else, containing an elevator with the higher floors locked out &#x2013; to begin with. Unlike everything else in the game, there is a sort of grubby reality to the tower, which hints at its true nature and purpose.
<br>
<br>The story aspect of the game is quite good, and the whole game does a great job of invoking a feeling of profundity but also underlying desperation. You find messages left behind by various previous people, with version numbers after their names, and, if you pay close attention, you might notice a name or two from your Steam friends list. This is no coincidence &#x2013; it is possible for you yourself to find paint buckets to leave behind messages to future folks who go through. Interestingly, this also hints at the nature of the world &#x2013; as well as where you&#x2019;re going in the end &#x2013; and as you progress through the game, you unlock more and more messages you can leave behind for your buddies.
<br>
<br>The game also has some meta aspects to it. I have seen some reviews which claim that the whole game is meta-commentary about video games, but it really isn&#x2019;t. That said, it certainly contains meta-commentary about video games, and there are a lot of in-world meta explanations for the nature of the world and even why names from your Steam friends list are appearing in the world &#x2013; this is not an artificial contrivance, but an actual part of the world you inhabit, and there&#x2019;s a reason for it. There are also in-game Easter eggs, some of which are quite brilliant, and as you progress through the game the reason that those Easter eggs exist is again explained in-game as being an organic (if silly) part of the world.
<br>
<br>What the game is really about is the central question of what it means to be human. The titular Talos Principle is a concept from Greek mythology &#x2013; Talos being a massive automaton made of bronze, animated by ichor put in his body by Zeus (or Hephestus, depending on the myth) himself to animate him and give him life. In the end, when the ichor is drained from his body, he dies as a human would if they exsanguinated, thus proving him to be &#x201C;human&#x201D; in a sense. Much of the game&#x2019;s philosophical conversations with Milton &#x2013; and many of the documents in the computer &#x2013; talk about the question of what it means to be human, and the question of whether or not the AIs they are creating &#x2013; which you are one of &#x2013; are &#x201C;human&#x201D; in a sense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5982918">Expand</a></span>

<br>- nice music and graphics
<br>- the story with much intrigue which kept me interested till the end, they way they chose to tell it (notes, emails, voice recordings) was great
<br>- many references to philosophy, citations from their works, pretty educational
<br>
<br>Cons (really minor stuff):
<br>- some of the conversations contained replies none of which I wanted to pick, but still had to pick something to continue
<br>- the 2nd ending lacked explanations - I really wanted to know what happened to the world but i guess they didn&apos;t bother to think that stuff thru
<br>- a few very annoying puzzles where precise timing was needed (e.g. &quot;Nerve Wrecker&quot;). It&apos;s annoying when you already know how to solve a puzzle but fail to do it over and over because you fail to press a key at the precise needed moment. Thankfully, there were just a few such puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5407215">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The soundtrack is very well done if slightly repetitive, and the visuals are quite decent as well. UI is perfectly functional and compact. There are also a huge plethora of in-game options to tweak to your heart&apos;s content. This is a very well optimized game.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, the game would be improved if:
<br>- there was greater puzzle variation.
<br>- the game was a little shorter. I felt it overstayed its welcome just a little bit.
<br>- there was an in-game explanation of how to use different tools and their possible applications. Perhaps if there was a brief and optional tutorial separate from the main game.
<br>- quicksaving was implemented.
<br>- the game used additional avenues of storytelling besides audio logs and text documents.

It&apos;s not easy to get all the stars, I spent hours to find certain stars and the experience and the sense of accomplishment that you get are unique. But what kept me the most hooked in this game was the story, very well done. A truly unique game.</span>

Instead of getting a flat &quot;go through X puzzles to get X thing to do X things&quot;, you are given the ability to choose, to think, to form an opinion. A great game with an interesting puzzle set and a thought provoking philosophical story.</span>

The mechanics are simple, but the whole atmosphere the game presents is similar to an acid trip. Love the philosophy and discussions on the terminals, however limited the answers are. I really felt deep respect for Alexandra Drennan and her in-game work. I just wish there were more content for the afterwards of the events of the game, I do wish an expansion for the events of the real world. Normally, I wouldn&apos;t even finish this game, but with this lovely story telling, I even got every achievement on Steam :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5410582">Expand</a></span>

<br>Besides the 120 or so puzzles, there is a story that reveals itself as the game progresses. I wasn&apos;t thinking about it much at the beginning but I soon realized that I was getting emotionally caught up in the story as I was solving the puzzles. And the puzzles are logical....repeat....The Puzzles Are Logical. None of that off the wall nonsense that you can find in many poorly designed adventure games.
<br>Also, there are Star Puzzles that are scattered throughout the game that you can also solve (only if you want to) that are much harder.
<br>The thing that absolutely amazed me was when I finished the last puzzle and the game ended, I felt a kind of loss. Seemed ridiculous but the feeling hung with me for days!
<br>Thank Goodness there is an expansion that you can download: The Talos Principle: Road To Gehenna which will let you continue on your journey for awhile.
<br>Also something that I noticed was how fluid this game played on my computer. The motion, reaction time, etc. felt smooth as silk. I found out that it uses the Serious Engine 4 designed by the Croteam who also designed the game.
<br>I have to tell Ya, I&apos;ve been playing intellectual video games since I was a kid and The Talos Principle is one that stands high among the best that I have ever played. And I&apos;m in my 60&apos;s!
<br>The only negative thing that I can think of about the main game or the add on is that they finally came to an end.
<br>It&apos;s going to be hard for anyone to top this masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5496130">Expand</a></span>

A serious puzzle game with an intriguing story, some great philosophical elements, lots of mystery and things to be discovered. It is a very immersive experience and quite relaxing. The soundtrack, art style, environments and graphical fidelity make for a somehwat euphoric experience. It&apos;s a beautiful game in its design. There are no tutorials in this game - it&apos;s all about exploration and experimentation. What I love baout this game is that the puzzles are really intuitive; at least once you know the main mechanics, you&apos;ll rarely find yourself being frustrated by a puzzle and resorting to &quot;cheating&quot; (by looking up the solution). There&apos;s quite a good diversity in terms of the worlds, so you&apos;ll always be immersed and want to continue to progress the story (through interacting with &quot;Command Prompt&quot;-style terminals, listening to audio logs, reading some things etc.) The ambiguity in this game motivates you to progress further - everything feels like it has meaning and purpose. I would compare The Talos Principle to Portal as being a top-notch puzzle game but unlike Portal, The Talos Principle is far deeper and more &quot;serious&quot;, with Elohim being a much more intimidating, powerful and &quot;Godly&quot; character than the tongue-in-cheek GLaDOS. Also the game does not rely on a single mechanic or device (although many puzzles will use just one device). Every puzzle feels like a &quot;puzzle within a puzzle within a puzzle&quot;, and indeed due to the way it&apos;s structured, some of them link so to get some of the stars you have to think literally &quot;outside the box&quot; (or rather, &quot;puzzle arena&quot;). It&apos;s beautiful, unpredictable, atmospheric and truly original. I would not have expected a game like this from the developers of the (not so serious) Serious Sam series! This is a game that is definitely worth checking out if you want something perplexing - an adventure game without any guns or violence or a linear, cliche plot. The only negative I would give this game is that I wish there was a bit more traditional story-telling to tie things together and less of those obnoxious &apos;Sigil&apos; shape puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5406674">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The puzzle game which The Talos Principle sets up is nice, and the design of a lot of the puzzle areas is well done and makes you think and observe your environment in order to advance. The way in which the game gives you a new mechanic to work with and then softly introduces you to that mechanic by way of self learning is clever and rewarding. The only thing that you will notice however is that there are some puzzles that tend to be too similar to others
<br>
<br>The story is what shines in this game, as the philosophical themes are strewn about, which make you think hard between dialogue, and under those themes is a story which you must piece together with audio logs, and the final ending is a bittersweet conclusion.
<br>
<br>The visuals are nice in this game, nothing groundbreaking but pleasant to look at, and the change of scenery between each world from Egypt, to Greece, and the middle ages is a nice switch. The Talos Principle is a smart, thoughtful, and challenging puzzler that poses intriguing thoughts, and a sad story underneath a well designed puzzler.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6065182">Expand</a></span>

<br>Let&apos;s start with what I think were mistakes on this game:
<br>- they failed on the Law of Conservation of Energy during the narration (or at least the Italian translation did, badly) and since the whole game is about AI this is really bad IMHO
<br>- puzzles are repetitive, to a point that for more than half of the puzzles everything is reduced to the hassle of running around with the pieces (and/or falling/else because you&apos;re bored and you don&apos;t pay attention anymore) of a puzzle you solved as you entered the room because you&apos;ve already solved that same puzzle before, with minor differences
<br>- narration is slow... actually it&apos;s a direct consequence of the exaggerated amount of puzzles needed to beat the game
<br>
<br>So why isn&apos;t my review negative? Because, again, the game is good.
<br>The plot, even though it&apos;s smeared on almost 20 hours of game-play, is nice and catching with all the reasoning, philosophy and physics. Graphics are top notch (mostly) and anyway always visually rewarding. Same could be said for the soundtrack that was never able to bore me even if I was listening to it for 20 hours straight. Probably something more could have been done on sound effects, sometimes they felt repetitive or missing.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to talk a bit more about those puzzles, because the concept is great, and the realization is great too, when I was given a puzzle I had to think to solve it was fun and rewarding, but then I was given the same puzzle, with minor differences that took me a minute or less to understand and I lost tenth of minutes just running around with puzzle pieces, bored, so bored I&apos;d actually fail falling or being killed because I was rushing to end the thing ASAP, furthermore increasing the boredom adding some frustration.
<br>And again, certain puzzles were great and on others I even gave up (more or less 1/3 of the &quot;stars&quot;) so challenging they were, I just cannot stand this &quot;same puzzle over and over&quot; thing, sorry. Not to mention that to beat the game you HAVE to complete all the puzzles (except for the &quot;stars&quot;).
<br>
<br>To conclude, in my opinion this game could have been on the same level of Portal if it had 1/3 of the puzzles it has (or even less), so that the narration would have been a bit more fast paced and catching and every puzzle would have felt a new challenge.
<br>
<br>NOTE: Italian dub is not that good and Italian translation isn&apos;t either, since reading a lot of text on a foreign language is quite demanding I still opted for the Italian translation, but I couldn&apos;t really stand the dub too, so I played the game with the original English voice acting and Italian subs/text; if you feel very confident with the English language I&apos;d suggest you to play the whole game (speech, subs and text) in English language.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6004494">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles to that point weren&apos;t much challenge and the only areas I could advance the story gave me lame responses to the AI that I was conversing with.  But after the midpoint in the game the puzzles got a whole lot better.  I spent ten hours on the first half of the game and 42 on the second!  I&apos;m a completionist and that includes every yellow star (secret) and gray sigil (area only playable after recovering 30 stars) and no looking up the solution on the internet.  I still think the philosophically heavy story was a bit tedious and haughty for a puzzle game but I had a great time nonetheless.

Unlike many modern titles, that are either frustrating, derivative, or unfinished, Talos Principle is a pleasant, focused game, that resembles a quiet, lazy autumn afternoon when you go for a walk alone just to sort through your thoughts, passing people, observing, thinking, enjoying that precious little moment when there is no task at hand, no time pressure nor a danger that would force an immediate action.
<br>
<br>Everything in the game is &quot;just right&quot; - graphics, although very static, are pleasant to look at, the soundtrack is serene and enjoyable, the puzzles are not too difficult but not trivial either. Many of them feature clever twists, their structure indicating certain direction towards the solution that in facts leads nowhere while thinking out of the box is required. Solving such puzzles provides great satisfaction.
<br>
<br>I have not finished the game yet, but I would gladly play something similar again. Perhaps the best of the recent &quot;puzzle games&quot; I have tried, including Witness, Fish Fillets, etc.

<br>it is really rare to find a game that debates philosophy without it feeling forced. (thought many texts are too unrelated.
<br>the gameplay is quite fun but too many puzzles feel like tutorial. the dlc RtG has some mindbending puzzles.
<br>the voice over is amazing.
<br>soundtrack is good. but fitting.</span>

If you liked Portal, you&apos;ll enjoy this game as well. Suffers from heady social justice and leftist political leanings, including (spoiler) a snarky AI conversationalist who goes full gamma/passive-aggressive (like a true SJW) on you at the end if you don&apos;t agree with him philosophically. Still the great reward of inheriting the planet in spite of SJWs is a reward unto itself. Highly recommended, even for red-pillers, but look for 75% off Steam sales to reduce the cash flow to the SJW devs. These kinds of games are great mind exercise and as such make it a required brain-muscle workout to maintain peak mental fitness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5965835">Expand</a></span>

<br>You begin by not knowing who you are, what you are</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Talos Principle is a first-person, Portal-inspired puzzle game with a philosophical narrative as a backdrop that makes for a truly intriguing and remarkable experience. The game delivers a wealth of challenging puzzles compiled with a thought-provoking story. It&apos;s a fantastic combination that makes this title a prime GOTY contender.
<br>
<br>You begin by not knowing who you are, what you are or why you exist before you are propelled into a mysterious world in where you seek answers for your existence. Your progression in the land is unfolded by completing puzzles and collecting Silgils. Only you and a strange voice seemingly from the sky reside in this strange place but can whoever or whatever is there be trusted? You&apos;ll have to progress to find out..
<br>
<br>The game houses a vast selection of smart and beautifully crafted puzzles which were designed to an amazing standard by the developers; Croteam - the development house behind the Serious Sam games. Some are fairly routine in the early stages as expected but the more Sigils you collect; the harder the puzzles become especially in the latter stages of the game. You will find yourself deeply confused, frustrated and dumbfounded at times but it&apos;s all worthwhile for the satisfaction on completion of a tricky task and is a testament to the developers for their creativity. The supportive writing and story complimenting the game is also of a very impressive standard and you really have to admire the effort that has gone into producing a game that&apos;s more than just a puzzle title.
<br>
<br>Overall; I hadn&apos;t heard of The Talos Priniple this time last week and now I am the proud owner of a truly fantastic title that is worth every penny. The narrative is deep and compelling and the puzzles on offer are of the highest standard. The developers have done a truly fantastic job in their design and execution and should be commended in the highest order for what has been a dreadful year in gaming. The Steam Workshop potential is also another selling point to what is a beautifully produced title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871921">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyway my favourite things... it runs at HIGH SPEED on my average machine.  The levels load in like an instant. the voice acting is good, the support &apos;info&apos; is intriguing.  there&apos;s no rubbish cutscene movies to sit through.  No tedious messing about as you reset a level after you mess up.  Puzzles so far are a bit repetitive, but overall... great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4851360">Expand</a></span>

The mechanics is not similar to Portal games. All the puzzles are so clever that you can get great satisfaction when you find out the solutions. There are mainly two goals for the game. One is to collect sigils which can be used for you to reach the eternity. Another one is to collect stars which can be used to open up more puzzles. Collecting sigils is easier than collecting stars (I found all the sigils without much struggles. But so far I found 23 stars. I am still trying to find others). There is also an opportunity to climb up the Babel&apos;s tower, which I am going to try after I finish the star job. The background of the game is about fundamental philosophical ideas such as consciousness, ontology, moral, and divinity. If you have some ideas about philosophy, this game will give you good opportunities to think about philosophical problems while you are solving puzzles. After all, what human beings do is to solve puzzles which are presented to us in real worlds just like we solve puzzles in this virtual reality that the game presents to us.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4868247">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yes - you could play this game as a pure puzzle game and not take any note of the many texts, voice logs and metaplot happening all around you, but that would in my mind be a huge mistake. Rarely have I been this moved by a video game, if you want to talk about video games as art then talk about the The Talos Principle. This is a game which every human, or other intelligent lifeform for that matter, should play and think about.
<br>
<br>Quite simply - this is a masterpiece of a game and I&apos;m in awe of the development team for having created it. If you like philosophy and video games then The Talos Principle is a game you simply cannot overlook.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6065493">Expand</a></span>

A few of the puzzles left me scratching my head for months, until I came back to them with a fresh approach.

Among those being Portal, Myst, and Antichamber. That&apos;s not to say TTP does not bring its own stock of new ideas to the table. Discovery in TTP plays a major role so the less details you know in advance, the better. Enter the world of impeccable visuals, music, and voice acting; the world full of ingenious 2D and 3D puzzles; the world with a mysterious story only revealed to you in glimpses if you care to follow them; the world of thought-provoking philosophical undertones so rare in video games; the world with tons of secrets, extra content, and Easter eggs; and finally, the world when you don&apos;t need guns and weapons to make progress. Even if you are not a completionist, TTP will provide you with around 20 hours of gameplay. The game is extremely polished, well-tested, and rewarding and satisfying to play. I would not expect such a gem coming from creators of Serious Frikkin&apos; Sam :-) This is a complete paradigm shift and I&apos;m very glad Croteam took this turn to expand their horizons - and everyone else&apos;s. I rate 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872494">Expand</a></span>

You can play Public Test to decide if you want this game. The first thing that will take your breath away is graphics - its top notch. The optimization is also splendid. Music is charming and in its place. The game is 10 out of 10 without a discussion.
<br>PS. I&apos;ve come across the game&apos;s ads occasionally in Steam while surfing through newly-released titles. A picture of robot gently holding a kitten in its hands attracted me at once, and here I&apos;m here - with the downloaded and finished Public Test and 100% ready to buy the full game. I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t ever regret! Awesome demo! Top notch and winner on all points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4836423">Expand</a></span>

<br>Admittedly, my low rating comes from my high expectations. I was thinking more along the lines of a larger overarching adventure game with a plot (e.g. Myst and Riven of yesterdays) than a purely level-based puzzle game. It is good for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5232944">Expand</a></span>

I waited for a good sale and eventually bought it, but was so unsure of the concept that I decided not to grab the DLC (a decision I now regret).  Here&#x2019;s the thing: it&#x2019;s not Portal meets the Stanley Parable -- it&#x2019;s a reimagining of Portal.  It trades the gun for several tools (each more confusing than the last) which you unlock as you systematically complete more and more puzzle rooms.  It trades the trademark humor of the franchise for heavy-handed philosophy about perception, artificial intelligence and, of course, what it really means to be human.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is great.  I do not suspect anyone who is a fan of Portal will not be a fan of the gameplay.  The graphics are pretty solid too.  Not as great as some of the higher budget AAA games out there, but surprisingly good.  The environments are a bit sparse, but that&#x2019;s by design.  There are some places in the game that I stopped to admire because I thought they were particularly beautiful.  Even the voice acting, which only employs the talent of two actors, is quite good.
<br>
<br>The place the game falters is that heavy-handed philosophical conversations do not appeal to everyone.  If you are not trying to pay full attention to, at the very least, the interactions with the computer (most of the documents are unnecessary but some of them are quite funny or interesting), you will not really enjoy the game enough to really stick with it.  I loved that aspect of the game, though.  If you think that would appeal to you, give this game a shot.
<br>
<br>The Talos Principle is enabled in the Steam Workshop, so you can get lots of fun stuff and add-ons through there, which is a welcome addition to any game, although I have not yet been able to find many add-ons that added too much content.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - My personal score is 9.5/10.  If you don&#x2019;t like anything philosophical, this game is probably not for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6135186">Expand</a></span>

After all, I&apos;d just come for a few puzzles per session, when I&apos;m in the mood, and I consider a well done context as nothing more than a pleasant bonus.
<br>
<br>Maybe more useful to you is the following warning: Some 3D games give me motion sickness, others don&apos;t; The Talos Principle makes my stomach uneasy quite quickly, therefore I couldn&apos;t do more than a few puzzles in a session even if I wanted to.
<br>
<br>Anyway, here&apos;s what seriously lowers my opinion of this game: The puzzles are not intellectually challenging whatsoever, but do require a modicum of dexterity, with failure resulting in death and a puzzle&apos;s reset. Unfortunately, there are no free saves, only checkpoints. I&apos;ll never tire of repeating it: Bad annoying design ! I&apos;m not interested in carrying a cube for 2 kilometres of desert only to have to do it again if I ever drop it at the wrong place or time when the actual play begins. No to backtracking. No to repeating. No to artificial lengthening.
<br>
<br>If you make your puzzles depend on fingers rather than brains, at least make it amusing.
<br>
<br>Still good enough for a very casual session once in a while. For its relaxing environment, not for its actual puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6465842">Expand</a></span>

<br>But firstly: The Talos Principle sure is an inventive and engaging puzzler. Rightly so, comparisons have been made to Portal, but in truth, for some time to come, all puzzlers will suffer the same fate.
<br>Graphics are nice , sound track excellent, and a special mention for some of the witty and fun Easter Eggs. Main puzzles are well balanced, nothing too impossible but still challenging enough. In my opinion the mechanics get a little stale towards the end, and the &quot;side&quot; star puzzle challenges are a little more complex and you might find you need to reference online walkthroughs. The Talos Principle does not really bring anything new to the genre but I still strongly recommend it.
<br>Now for the rant: Gaming is a visual, interactive medium, and this is how I want my story development to unfold. I do NOT want to have to read bucket loads of text, disjointed and spread out, ESPECIALLY if that text is (post modernly) displayed on a virtual reality computer screen on my computer screen. I am not going to give a fiddlers&apos; flea very early on, and skim through the seemingly pointless drivel. This is where Talos Principle falls down. The story line is on the surface fascinating; deeply philosophical ,questioning faith morality, the mind, and what it is to be human, but with the exception of the touching voice recordings, how this is conveyed is dry, disparate and  DULL DULL DULL. If I had wanted to read a frickin&apos; book I would have gone to University rather than waste my formative years playing video games.
<br>Anyhoo. I feel better now I have that off my chest.
<br>Enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4860676">Expand</a></span>

I wholeheartedly recommend buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857117">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoyed playing Talos Principle but there were a few things that detracted from the experience.  One annoying thing was having to walk back and forth to the different levels.  I think they should have taken out the hub world or at least added some interesting things to it.  Another thing was the long paragraphs of text.  They could have condensed it to make it more readable.  Finally, some of the star secrets were too vague to figure out and also some of the missions were way too hard.  I wish they streamlined the game a bit more.  Overall though, it was one of the best puzzle games I&apos;ve played in awhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871264">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The puzzles are generally interesting, but there are so many of them (~120) and they took more and more time to complete, with too little innovation in between. If only the story could motivate, but it&apos;s bits and pieces are hidden in longish texts on the terminal you pass by. Nice voice acting though. Nice, but lifeless scenery.
<br>
<br>They tried hard with this, the grave story and philosophical aspects I found quite impressing, but as a game it&apos;s not really that much fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5864637">Expand</a></span>

What is most surprising is that some puzzles are almost duplicates of others, which is unnecessary. That said, the puzzling aspect of this game is quite good and has nothing to envy from Portal. The atmosphere is intriguing and puts the player into an introspective stance. The visuals are serviceable and the music is quite enjoyable yet quite repetitive.  You will be at times invited to debate an AI  through a DOS like interface, but in my personal experience, the choices allowed felt disloyal and rarely approximated my actual thinking. It is easy to recommend the game to puzzle solvers, however, I advise you to turn around if you are not particularly found of puzzle games in the first place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6241101">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a Portal clone... ehhh, also maybe. It feels like a Portal clone, looks like a nicer outdoor version of Portal, and the game seems generally trying to copy the Portal FPS-puzzle-physics-placement formula in order to print money.
<br>
<br>As a benchmark... doubtful. The engine looks nice but doesn&apos;t seem to push my rig like other benchmarks already widely available.
<br>
<br>As a good game? Not a chance. Maybe I didn&apos;t play it long enough to see something worthwhile, but every single second that I played absolutely sucked. It felt like I was playing a Myst-Portal hybrid made by an untalented, copycat developer. It also crashed my entire rig when I tried to switch resolutions to Surround.
<br>
<br>I regarded Serious Sam as cynically designed, generic, and generally tedious company, and I dislike this for similar reasons. It was on my wishlist based on hype, genre, and screenshots, but it sure isn&apos;t now.

Its FPP puzzle game (aka Portal clone) and its decent, but i have a feeling thats its just too long and besides good parts- full of not interesting content. First Portal was a blast, because it had original, interesting mechanics, some easy puzzles at the beginning to grasp portals mechanics, and few difficult puzzles near the end of game, and was quite short so you wanted even more. This game is not so original, it has a lot of rehashed ideas from other games (like &quot;recording&quot; and then &quot;playing&quot; your actions- Ratchet and clank anyone?) and a lot of boring/repetitive puzzles. It has also interesting puzzles (some yellow and red ones) but almost all green puzzles are far too easy, theres too many of them and its just a waste of time. The first half of game just drags. Not to mention some mechanics (for example that you can throw box on a flying mine and ride on it) arent even explained, and with that many easy puzzles they should be.
<br>Also story- its quite interesting and i like philosophical vibe to it, but still i have few concerns about that:
<br>- its puzzle game, so no real threat/rush or decisions to make for the player,
<br>- a lot of story and information about player/world is just reading walls of text on computer terminals- no thanks.
<br>This really could be interesting concept for rpg or adventure game (Myst?), but not for puzzle game. It feels like missed opportunity or wasted potential.
<br>Setting is nice, graphics can be truly breathtaking at times (waterfalls, sunset etc.), but sometimes are just dull (brown walls of ruins everywhere, you get the idea).
<br>Overall- it could be much better, but its still quite good puzzle game with some flaws, my score is 7/10. Not for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-talos-principle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5097796">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t say its better than portal, because portal was the perfect game with every last bit of fat squeezed out. But, this is absolutely as good as Portal 2 (I prefer this to Portal 2 by far).</span>
