Although they say it takes skill and to some degree it does, most of the time it doesn&apos;t. All it boils down to is a bunch of people fighting in a concealed area. That leads to most of the time you die it is because you got gangbanged 3 on 1. About 1 in every 4 fights is an even match and comes down to skill. There is no way to sprint or way to get away so you always lose if ganged up on. The swinging mechanic is original but poorly performed. You have to move your mouse in the way you want to swing, but most of the time I would move it forward and it would swing left. You barely every swing where you want to. Also if you fight a higher level guy you automatically die if he is heavily armored. That is because he can only be hurt in the face and you can be hit anywhere and be hurt. With the attack system and the fact that the only way to hurt him is a jab to the face you can do nothing but die. The single player is just a few random battles to get you practicing but it literally explains nothing about fighting, game controls, or any tips to play. Also you are usually left to try and take points by yourself as your team AI doesn&apos;t know how to follow you. Most of the points you have to attack have multiple enemies and some respawn, which means you have to keep killing them as they all gang up and then respawn. I quit it after 15 minutes.  A good idea but most of the execution and gameplay falls very short of the lofty aspirations. Apparently you have to play mount and blade games prior to playing this to appreciate it. I was super excited and then completely let down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2666166">Expand</a></span>

In other words, it&apos;s a game which you grow tired of really quickly. And the graphics aren&apos;t that great.  worth 29 euros? no :(    Might be worth to buy if it&apos;s on a discount on steam.</span>

The funny thing about this is that even my &quot;casual&quot; friends can see through the terrible gimmicks and truly retarded choices that the developers have made in accordance to the game.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s break the negative and positives points of this game down; NEGATIVE: 1. **** progression system designed to hide the bland gameplay and increase the eventual short lifespan of the game. (summer flick) 2. Slow and cumbersome combat system. Two veterans will literally duel each other for upwards of 10 minutes simply because there&apos;s a very low &quot;skill height level&quot; compared to that of other games in the genre such as Mount &amp; Blade.
<br>3. Developer is rejecting the fundamental aspects that make up PC gaming - they&apos;re refusing to post in topics asking them to release dedicated server files (even unranked files) and the devs have no plan to include mod support
<br>4. To rub the soreness of the lack of dedicated server files in further, the developers have decided to team up with Multiplay (Whom host **** servers, the only reason they&apos;re &quot;big&quot; is because they spend tonnes on marketing) to provide EXCLUSIVE server hosting. So the only way you can run a server is if you rent it. 5. Squad spawning system is so bad that I simply don&apos;t know how to sum it up in words. They might work in games such as Call Of Duty and Battlefield but THEY DON&apos;T WORK IN THIS GENRE! 6. Game is riddled with bugs and connectivity issues, despite players warning FatShark that this was going to happen in alpha/beta.
<br>7. I could keep on talking about the negative aspects but why rehash content which you can find all over the &apos;net. The only positive aspects about this game is the graphics and excellent archer mechanics. Bascially, this game is simply an arcade game which should be priced around the $10 mark as it&apos;s really only good for wasting an hour or two on when you&apos;re completely bored. I might be being overly harsh with my review score, but FatShark have broken so many promises with this game that it&apos;s astounding that people are still defending them. I don&apos;t have any hopes for much after-release support considering FatShark&apos;s has a reputation (or lack thefore) for not creating updates for their products after launch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2667268">Expand</a></span>

If you are more used to slower-paced games, this game will throw you off. If you are used to games that require little in terms of practice and skill, this game will throw you off. This is not your average multiplayer game, this is something unique and different.
<br>
<br>Some claim that the controls are clunky and awkward and, you know what, they are. The point is that it&apos;s not something that takes away from the game; rather, it is just another element that you have to learn, adapt to and then master. We are all noobs to begin with and this game makes that painfully clear.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a terribad, you&apos;re going to hate this game, because no matter what you do, others will seem to instantly kill you from miles away with a crossbow, mow you down with a horse and lance, crush your face with a hammer coming down on your helmet like the wrath of a severely irked deity... but if you decide to lift yourself above the masses and actually learn the mechanics, learn when to use the dagger, when to use the poleaxe, how the arrows drop off... then you will eventually be rewarded ten-fold, when you snipe that pesky mounted knight right off his horse at 200 yards.
<br>
<br>This game rewards skill and, unfortunately for some, skill is not an unlock.
<br>
<br>The graphics quality is top-of-the-line and with all settings cranked to the max, it looks as good as any triple-A title on the market. It has some work to do in the optimization/performance department, but those are just details, minor cracks in an otherwise superb presentation. If you don&apos;t own a beastly machine, turn shadows off, and your framerate will skyrocket.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is definitely worth the </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2665016">Expand</a></span>

4. Poor game development</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Rated 0 for a game that isn&apos;t worth your money and time at all for the following reasons:
<br>
<br>1. Pay to win.
<br>2. Horrible balance in weapons &amp; armour, only very few weapons and customisations are viable
<br>3. Poor community (for a multiplayer game), inactive forums, foul mouthed players ingame. Even Dota 2&apos;s community is better and its a F2P without Pay To Win.
<br>4. Poor game development direction and track record (read their forums)
<br>
<br>You need about 20USD to buy the gears (after grinding up the levels to unlock them) to gain a level playing field. With the 4 stock classes available, with the exception of the Foot Knight, you will be mercilessly massacred non-stop by players with OP weapons, which means you can&apos;t help your team win, meaning you level very slowly and painfully and have no equipment.
<br>
<br>The current state of the game 1.8 is highly unbalanced and the development direction isn&apos;t good. Multi player consists of:
<br>
<br>1. Ninjas in cloth armour and overpowered weapons running around, dodging hits and 1-hitting people
<br>2. Players using overpowered weapons (Pollaxe, Long Axe, Warhammer) in Medium/Heavy armour killing everything in 1  2 hits.
<br>3. Snipers with Crossbows sniping with high precision across the battlefield.
<br>
<br>Simply try the F2P version if you want to see how bad it is.
<br>
<br>Forget about trying anything &quot;historical&quot;. They don&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>List of useless game features (or why the game is terrible):
<br>
<br>1. Heavy Armour  Blunt weapons ignore armour. The 2 OP weapons commonly used are Pollaxe (Foot Knight stock class has it) and Warhammer. No knight in shining armour for you.
<br>
<br>2. Any Medium/Heavy Helmet other than Bascinet  Pollaxe 1-hit kills if it hits your head regardless of Helmet type. The neck attachments to the helmets DO NOT WORK (Bevors, Mail Coif) but they still slow your character down. Bascinet is the only viable competitive helmet because of its protection to weight ratio as well as the vision restriction. The lack of neck protection also means that people can simply use a faster weapon and spam an attack to your head repeatedly hoping for a lucky hit to your neck (which happens rather frequently).
<br>
<br>3a. Any sword that isn&apos;t Imperial Style, Hollow Grind, Balanced  These settings increases the damage of your weapon, penetration against heavy armour and swing speed. The majority of your opponents online wear Medium to Heavy Armour. Without Hollow Grind (which gives armour penetration buff), your sword is useless.
<br>
<br>b. That being said, majority of the swords are useless because they either don&apos;t attack fast enough, or don&apos;t deal enough damage.
<br>
<br>c. You will notice an option to pick Common Style, Imperial Style or Milanese Style of fighting with any weapon. Anything except from Imperial style, is non-competitive. You&apos;re welcome to try and frustrate yourself.
<br>
<br>4. Bows  They take time to charge up, can only hold maximum charge for a few seconds and are difficult to shoot with. Compare this with Crossbows which can be reloaded within 4 seconds with pin point sniper accuracy and potential 1-hit headshot kills. Again, this requires you to buy all the correct unlocks.
<br>
<br>5. Perks  Majority of the perks are uncompetitive and useless. You will only use some perks for the entire time because they are the ONLY VIABLE perks. This reduces the &quot;options&quot; by about 75%
<br>
<br>6. Majority of other weapons  No matter what weapon combination you pick, if you go up against players using Medium/Heavy Armour  Warhammer you will not win. Even if you&apos;re mastered the game by training in duelling scenarios non-stop, your team mates will not be as good as you and the players using OP weapons know this. They will kill them and they will drop like flies. Then you will be mobbed by a party, beaten to death and your corpse teabagged.
<br>
<br>Some players may say, use a Shield! Guess what? All axes in this game deals extra damage to shield (breaks them faster). Add an Offensive Perk called Shield Breaker, add Imperial Style (Extra Damage) and Convex blade (Extra Damage) your shield goes down in 2 fully charged hits. If he is a competent cloth ninja with long axe, good luck trying to hit him with anything shorter than the long axe.

<br>The Good Bits
<br>===  ===
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve read all that, you&apos;re undeterred you still want to play the game... Here&apos;s what&apos;s good about the game. (Aside from all the technical problems as well)
<br>
<br>1. Combat system is fundamentally sound  If no OP customisations are used, a fight goes down to skill and very little luck. There is also a significant difference between winning duels (1v1) and winning battles (Group Fighting &amp; Objective Game Modes).
<br>
<br>2. Armour Customisations  They are quite nice, if you&apos;re willing to accept massive penalties to performing well in game.
<br>
<br>3. Graphics  It&apos;s pretty good looking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3520654">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m sorry, but when there are people shooting arrows at you, then it&apos;s on. All in all, this game isn&apos;t even worth the 5 bucks I paid on Steam for it.

The biggest flaw with this game is weapon balance. There is a huge variety of weapons yet you&apos;re limited to 3 main weapons and 2-3 sidearms. Even the community is getting angry at devs not being willing to reduce strength of certain weapons that dominate the game. Those weapons either are both fast and strong or just have broken hitbox that you can&apos;t really avoid, since you will get hit by part of the weapon that&apos;s invisible.
<br>Melee combat is never trying to properly punish people who spam their attacks since the weapon&apos;s speed will always put you back in advantage over enemy, even if you get hit, so perhaps if you block once or twice that&apos;s enough. Feinting doesn&apos;t help either since your enemy will ignore it and just spam attacks mindlessly.
<br>One of the specially annoying things are shield bashes that stun you for a brief moment so the enemy always gets a hit on you, but that wouldn&apos;t be that bad if it wasn&apos;t for the fact you can do that all the time without any sort of cool down. The only way you can counter it is if you&apos;re out of enemy&apos;s reach, but then if he notices that, he can do 180 degree turn and slide away from you.
<br>
<br>Arrows are broken in this game as well. 1 arrow type becomes part of metagame due to its versatility. In the past that was swallow tail, which would penetrate every type of armor without any problem. That makes me wonder what armor piercing arrows are meant for. If you take certain type of arrows they should excel in the combat aspect they are meant for and lack in other aspects. That was meant to be fixed in latest patch, but it just made the early mentioned type of arrows replaced by a new one that does almost exact same thing.
<br>
<br>Game is lacking in game modes. Mostly it&apos;s team deathmatch or conquest (along with those there are assault and pitched battle that are almost never played). Team deathmatch is mindless killing without any tactics. Conquest is slightly better, but the fact the teams have to advance one flag at the time is really stupid. You end up fighting for the flag in the middle so there&apos;s barely any flanking or anything since enemy knows where to expect you. Lets also not forget about the fact that devs don&apos;t want to include duel mode, while duels are actually quite enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Reviving and execution mechanic is pretty irritating and while you could say you can avoid it and not suffer irritation, you will always need money as a beginner and that&apos;s the biggest income of gold for you. When you get good at the game you can avoid that and get just as much gold as the newbies who stop to revive or execute. I don&apos;t really see any other reason to revive teammate or execute enemy since you risk your life by doing so and it&apos;s not even properly rewarded.
<br>
<br>Oh, yes. I almost forgot to mention that the game has almost no protection against cheaters, so you will run into many people who will be speedhacking and some of them will be very subtle about it. The only way to deal with it is to make sure that the person is a cheater and vote kick him. However just getting his ID to kick him and write it all down is a painful process, so most of the time you will be like, &quot;Ahh,  it!&quot; and will leave the match.
<br>
<br>Only positive thing I can think of is that devs release new content in their patches instead of making it a DLC. However game has a system where you buy coins with real money. Luckily most of the things are fairly cheap so you can obtain your imbalanced weapons just by playing 2-3 matches.
<br>
<br>Game could be fairly fun if it gets properly balanced, but since it&apos;s been so long without any proper balance update I&apos;m afraid it will stay like this.
<br>
<br>Buy only if discounted and if you&apos;re okay with spending some money for a couple of hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3557672">Expand</a></span>

But over time you gain experience so you can level up and buy better weapons, armor, perks, etc. The graphics are good, not spectacular, but good. It is a step above the one-button combat, which I like. But fighting with another player can be awkward. After you kill someone, they fall down and you can preform an execution move which is pretty cool, but after you see the same move over and over, it gets pretty boring. Progression can take a while so most of the time you will be stuck on the bottom of the scoreboard because everyone else is better equipped that you. There aren&apos;t a whole lot of multiplayer modes which is unfortunate. Character customization is also pretty weak with only 4 heads to choose from, including only one female head. It isn&apos;t a great game, but it gets such a good score because it is only 20 dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2978185">Expand</a></span>

At first glance War of the Roses looks attractive. When I first started up the game I had the expectation that I would be experiencing some fun game play, sword fighting with other players from across the world and upgrading my character etc. Now I have a pretty good PC, i can run the new Tomb Raider on High settings but War of the Roses barely runs properly on medium! In fact in only runs smoothly on low! And even then there is pop-up and some damn bad textures. There is so little to do in this game, there is no single player and the maps are frankly rubbish! Everything about the game play is boring and sluggish, you move at a snails pace, your character is awkward to look at and control and the sword fighting... it seems like a great idea, allowing you to swing your sword in different directions and give yourself more control but it is executed SO badly! It takes a depressing amount of time and effort to land a single blow on an enemy. Also you will find that it is hard to tell who is your enemy and who isn&apos;t since there is no indication as to who your enemy is, you just have to look for whoever is trying to kill you. I could go on for ages about how bad this game is. Usually when I see users rating a game a low score I assume the user is just being too harsh but this is NOT the case with this game, don&apos;t be tempted by any positive reviews, this game is BAD! I&apos;m just glad I got it in the humble origin deal for a low price otherwise I would be fuming by now.

War of roses is definately slower paced. The hit boxes in this game are pretty solid, minus some of the broken weapons. Guys complaining about the 2h swords don&apos;t know the basic mechanics otherwise they would be saying the pitchfork is massively OP as the hit boxes on it are so broken (it just hits everything including the handle). Heavy armor can be ONE shot with a warhammer. So armor choices basically let you know what weapons will give you trouble.
<br>
<br>The real trouble lies in no auto-balance, respawn timers that are shorter for lancaster than for york (clear advantage when lancaster can spawn 3 times for yorks 1), hackers (easy to spot, except for archers), and the fact that most capture the point maps are also setup to make it easier for the lancaster side, and a solid grind with a lack of content. With all this negative I still enjoy taking heads off or winning a 5v1(easy to do if u know how to dance and face hug enemies to make them hit you with the weapon handle instead of the sharp part).
<br>
<br>All in all this game is a lot of fun once you find a custom load out you rape face with. Plus the graphics are F**king amazing. Flaming arrows and guns anyone?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894963">Expand</a></span>

Every knockdown feels so good, because it was hard earned and won with cunning, not button-mashing.
<br>
<br>A lot has changed since this game debuted, early on there were no tutorials, which made the learning curve even steeper if you didn&apos;t have a friend who could help you out with it. There were a lot of balancing issues  some weapons were overly powerful, bleed was a lot more annoying (although it still sucks, it doesn&apos;t happen quite as easily now). Both bleed and squad spawning are pretty annoying mechanics, but without squad spawning it would be annoying to have to traverse the map all the time.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re new to the game, the best piece of advice I can give is to put $5 into your steam wallet and spend it on coins. Coins can be earned through xp, but it&apos;s very slow and while the game isn&apos;t really pay-to-win it will become a lot more enjoyable once you have some custom loadout slots and your own weapon and armor choices.
<br>
<br>As long as the servers stay full, I have no problem with this game receiving tepid or even bad reviews. I understand where you&apos;re coming from, but I think most probably played it in beta and did not really give it a chance to shine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3708871">Expand</a></span>

Fast forward to now, I decided to try War of the Roses  what a mistake. This game is full of people who have spent far too much time unlocking skins and weapon upgrades so you basically have no chance. Most of the players in the game kill you no matter what you do. I&apos;ve tried all the tactics, faking attacks, parrying enemy attacks, it&apos;s just so badly done. The hitboxes are small and random, so you can&apos;t reliably hit someone just because your mace or sword just hit them. The third person perspective sucks for immersion and makes it hard to aim given the game has such small hitboxes. I unlocked plate armor and thought I&apos;d try it assuming I&apos;d be much harder to kill  NOPE. Plate armor is useless, the latest patch must have rebalanced because people fussed about plate armor being OP. Now I get murdered by guys with swords and axes with my visor down. Somehow slashing a guy in plate armor just murders him.
<br>
<br>The realism in this game is just totally missing. No stamina, so that means everyone just spams attacks. There&apos;s no real different feel between the armor types they just look different. Honestly this game makes me think of Call of Duty far more than Chivalry did. This has ranks, crests which are like the banner thing in CoD (I have no idea what it&apos;s called anymore), ridiculous things that look stupid (Big antlers on a guy&apos;s head, really authentic there), and ridiculous skins for some of the armors and unlockable weapons. Chivalry had unlockable weapons, but at least required a player to be really good with them to get the better ones and didn&apos;t have terrible ones for starter weapons. It&apos;s hard to believe the same people who made Mount &amp; Blade made this abomination, as M&amp;B is a good and fun game. This is nothing like it. Avoid at all costs. Any small redeeming factors in this game get totally overshadowed by terrible balance, ridiculous learning curve, and it just feels too arcade to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3495482">Expand</a></span>

The truth is a whole other story. When you get into the game you will however start to realize this is not the perfect medieval game you wanted. The game lets you level up, and give you gold so you can unlock newa armor and better weapons and such. This means that you will in the first couple of levels (where you are forced to used their default classes, since you cannot create your own) you will get slaughtered by higher leveled people. Sure skill is somewhat part of the game. Until some huge knight with a two handed sword comes running with full plate armor. I have trying almost everything, and I am not exaggerating, to bring a person in full plate down. I even had a friend of mine just stand still while I began to chop at him, and there was only one place he could get harmed. We then duelled and my friend just kept blocking that spot so I couldn&apos;t even hurt him.
<br>The good: good graphics, polished. The bad: Higher leveled people have access to better weapons, armor, etc. Most of the time people will just form a huge mass in middle of map, lack of game modes.
<br>
<br>Buy mount and blade instead it&apos;s cheaper and way more fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2876387">Expand</a></span>

Most of the time you get someone attacking you over and over with the same basic attack and can randomly kill you even if you have a shield. So very little skill is involved in this game. Other players say you need skill but don&apos;t listen to them. Very little skill is really needed since there is no stamina or negative draw back from spam attacking someone. Since the game is meant to be a melee combat game, having it so broken seems like a total failure on behalf of the developer. However, the graphics are good. Gore is alright. If you need gore to sell you a game you should probably get your head examined anyway. Archery is pretty fun and always great feeling getting a headshot. Maps are decent but only a few are actually fun. Overall, pass on this title. Don&apos;t bother wasting your money. Although there is fun aspects to the game, most of the time you&apos;ll be pulling your hair out when your spam attacked or when you hit an opponent but it fails to register. However, if the developer fixes the basic mistakes they made then this title might be worth checking out. But in it&apos;s current state, don&apos;t bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2878993">Expand</a></span>

The process of unlocking both is also quite interesting.  Unfortunately, this is the best that I can say for this game.  While I found archery to be satisfying in this medieval game, melee feels incredibly floaty and I oftentimes do not know why I insta-kill somebody even after hours of playing; things just do not connect sometimes and I have found that that attack spammers with heavy armor often win the melee field.  For a medieval game focused on melee combat, you are going to be frustrated when fully charged attacks to an opponents head do no damage when it appears perfectly aimed and timed.  Once you learn the power of heavy armor, not wearing it is more of a challenge than a trade-off.  Then there is the fact that not that many people play this now.  On top of this, the number of play modes are limited.  Conquest and Team DM are basically what you are looking at, plus a DM with no respawns even fewer people play.  In short: it is a limited experience and everything that it does, I feel other games have done better: Chivalry, in melee, and Mount &amp; Blade, in horse and game modes.  It&apos;s a 5, in my opinion, because it is average and Mount &amp; Blade -- an older game -- outperforms it, even though WOR looks nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811737">Expand</a></span>

What we now have is a game that is nothing but a blatant high res copy of the brilliant Mount &amp; Blade Warband but without the awesome Siege mode. All you do is either just play deathmatch or capture the flag. The fighting system needs more work seeing its way to slow and most of the time you end up against 5 enemies hacking you to pieces. 1 on 1 fights are really rare. The game was allot better in the beta, i don&apos;t know what they did to it to make it so different.
<br>
<br>The game also offers a bleed out system, even though this realistic, it ruins the gameplay, mainly because i always get a bleed out when i finally am fighting a good fight for once versus 1 guy and not 5 and just drop dead after 10 seconds. Also squad members spawning on each other is something just something straight out of Battlefield, something that is not needed in this game. Just when you are about to kill a guy, his buddies magically spawn around you and you are dead. But the game has a future if the developer listens to its community and fixes bugs and other annoyances, i am hope for a Siege mode!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2721644">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed when I finally got to play it. It seems that the majority of players play as heavily armored archers or heavily armored two-handed swordsmen. Since I was getting cut up by these swordsmen, I decided that as soon as I reached the required level I would buy the plate armor and use a sword myself. It seemed to work, but the swordsmen were still cutting through my armor as if it were made of glass. I tried carrying a shield, this time they poked through my armor until I started bleeding. Tried using riposte to parry the blows so I could get a shot in, still no dice. No matter what I tried as an infantryman, I could not swing a sword as fast as these other players. My next bet was to try playing as an archer, pretty much the same thing happened except I seemed to be more of a target this time around. I feel that I gave the game a fair chance, already playing over 24 hours worth, maybe I&apos;m just not good at it but there definitely needs to be a drawback on swinging a two-handed sword around wildly, otherwise you run through a gauntlet to find out who&apos;s got the sharpest blade then wait for the new players to swoop in and poke your eyes out with a dagger. Item wise, this game does not offer much. Everyone gets the same armors, the only customization available is color change. There&apos;s three bow choices, one two-handed sword choice, two dagger choices, and a couple of other one handed weapons and pole-arms. I know it&apos;s a multiplayer game, but some item variety would be nice, I don&apos;t expect over 100 different choices but I&apos;d like to maintain some level of individuality.
<br>
<br>Crashes seem to happen to me a lot, mostly CTD. I&apos;ve had instances where I would gain entry to a server, only to be met with just a background and no menu choices. In those cases, you&apos;ll be using ALT+Tab to get to the desktop and force close the game. I still feel like there&apos;s a lot of potential for War of the Roses, I think once some rebalancing and bug-fixing is done it will be more playable for me, but as of right now, I&apos;m hanging up my sword.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696034">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;d think with so many &quot;almost their&quot; examples SOMEONE would be able to get this right, but it hasn&apos;t happened yet  that I&apos;ve seen. It&apos;s a shame because the &quot;melee shooter&quot; for lack of a better term has so much potential, but no one can seem to nail the formula. Either they make it so realistic it&apos;s unappealing to the majority or so arcade that all skill is lost and it just feels like a shooter with longer range knives... (See Chivalry Medieval Warfare for an example of this)  War of the Roses was close... SO close to striking a middle ground of complexity and fun that really could have made it the first out and out &quot;good&quot; example I&apos;ve seen, but it just couldn&apos;t get there. It ends up being mediocre, but frustratingly so because sometimes when playing you can catch glimmers of what could have been a really fun diversion from the flood of shooters on the market. The core problem with the game pretty much boils down to its combat system. To sum it up: -The aiming system is clunky the mouse option throws off aim and the keyboard option forces unwanted movement. They should have just assigned the attacks (overhand, thrust, slash) to bindable keys. -Compounding the poor aiming system the hit boxes and windows on the weapons are far too small for their own good and you</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874599">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d say they need to go back and analyze the fighting from mount and blade warband and give it a slight twist and go for a re-do as sadly this game in my opionion will be one of those fall by the wayside $9.99 titles that we see way to often already.

The game tries to appeal to the masses with its &quot;customization&quot; but all that leads to is the perks getting in the way of actual game play. The spammers are also unstoppable, the swords are overpowered and everything else either wont penetrate armor or has the worst hit detection. And for the execution system, its dull and annoying to watch in a first person view someone do a stale execution on you, its aggravating and gets in the way of gameplay. The game is full of lag, has a poor development team which just fix&apos;s one or two things every month, and occasionally gives a few of the same weapons out. The graphics are the only redeeming thing about this game, besides that, the game has 0 love or actual effort put into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2801002">Expand</a></span>

Because you don`t have a chance to do anything in the game except of keep falling to death. It really sucks if your are new to the game. If you want to play it and don`t want to spend a bit of time in it, you can forget it. But the Graphics are fine</span>

Yes, it does have problems: the first day servers kept crashing (but this was fixed by the morning); there are only two modes (but more have been promised for free), and it is not very well optimised (but I turned off shadows and now my frame rate is good). But the great things far outweigh these negatives. Firstly, it&apos;s great to have something new multiplayer-wise, rather than FPS games. Secondly, this is is just pure, unadulterated fun. Nothing more. It is, in fact, hilarious. What other recent games do you get to charge at people with a sword or be on the receiving end and shoot them with a crossbow just as they reach you? Or where a guy on a horse with a lance is charging at you and you shoot the horse so he flies off it as it collapses? Battles can be messy (like I imagine they were in medieval times) and they can also be sparse. You can play how you want - close quarters, long-range, horseback, quickly in for a kill then run away, or a mixture. I like the crossbow then going in for some sword-fighting. It is hard. There is a steep learning curve. You have to give it time and learn how to play. People say it&apos;s unbalanced, but it&apos;s not. if you want to kill a guy with heavy armour you really have to use a hammer. If you only have a sword, then hopefully you have little armour so you can move more quickly and escape or run circles around him. This game actually requires thought and skill. It also requires teamwork to win. The only thing I fear is people won&apos;t try it because other people say it&apos;s unbalanced, but, in actuality, they haven&apos;t taken the time to learn how it plays. This is definitely worth picking up, especially as free DLC content has been promises in the form of maps and game modes. Hopefully they will make a siege mode, as the genre calls for it. And hopefully they will allow servers other than Multiplay. All-in-all, great game if you give it time to learn it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2667888">Expand</a></span>

There are a lot of pluses in this game, and developers did a great job overall, the hit detection in small area between two plat armor is amazing, the type of damages and the armor piercing, this mechanism is the highlight of the game to be honest, it is a advanced and surprised me, when I encounter any enemy I have to look into his weapon, armor and his style, to plan how to knock him down, and the nice things there are many weapons, armors and even some additional accessories like neck protection, all those can make your style played differently against each of opponent. I wont talk about graphics and sounds as they are perfect, I gave the game 8 cause the feeling, I usually give my score based on how the overall factor of fun, M&amp;B got 9 for me, even that most of things in WOTR is superior, but M&amp;B has this feeling of enjoyment that I am not getting in WOTR for some reason, and I guess it lacks of game-mode such a siege battle. Finally, I would recommend this game for M&amp;B fans, but I have to mention that there is a better medieval slasher game on the way which is Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, so if you have only one choice go with the later, and it is a totally another story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2671824">Expand</a></span>

I was wheezing with laughter the first two days, mainly due to my own incompetence and the tragic results for my teammates! Huge scope for skill in the combats, which are perfectly resolved in my view, the animation, sound and results of my swings and jabs have been 100% pixel perfect and rock solid again since the start. The only problem for me has been server disconnects which now seem 95% fixed (two days after launch) . Can&apos;t wait to get back into the fight. Fending off multiple attacks by parrying with your shield and backing away is my favourite! Brilliant game, am sure the likers will stay satisfied with the good news about the franchise. Well done Paradox!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2671366">Expand</a></span>

There is a certain slash..slash...slash to the game that can seem repetitive and unskilled to the initiate, but actually, on the contrary - the immediate simpleness belies the deeper subtleties within. To strike effectively each attack must be angled and aimed and each weapon (many choices) has it&apos;s own benefits or drawbacks. For example, some can pierce / break armour or weapons effectively, but are slow or ungainly to wield. Downed players can be put to death for MONDO xp, but at the risk of a nail bitingly slow cut-scene when, in my experience, your protagonist seems to randomly sprout arrows and gushes of blood from the neck / head.  The resulting battlefield can feel sometimes chaotic but mostly deeply fulfilling and incredibly compelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2665184">Expand</a></span>

So summing it up the game is not worth even a dime. If the problems would be fixed, for the game itself I would give strong 8. But how can You review something which stopped to work after the patches were released? In my opinion Paradox just rips people off on this, gathering money to make some other game. This is a frustrating product - some may ask why don&apos;t You play single player? Because there is none.

This game sold thousands, if not millions of copies since it&apos;s recent release. And it is a very PC consuming game. The lag is just the amount of people trying to get on their servers. So if you gave the game a bad review based on that, and I rarely say this, you are flat out WRONG! As an avid mount and blade player, I am used to the mechanics and I can understand that they can be difficult to adjust to. I mean it is a huge step upwards from you standard spam the left mouse button (i.e. Minecraft, Terraria, and Elder Scrolls game except Morrowind, etc.) so its gonna take a little adjusting, but wouldn&apos;t you rather have a sophisticated combat system then have everybody going around spamming left mouse button and dying left and right. Also, the mechanic where if you&apos;re too close to someone and you swing at them, you just hit them with a wooden pole, is genius. There have been so many games where I&apos;ve been standing right up against something and slamming on top of it with a spear and it did significant damage. I&apos;m whacking them with a padded handle and its cutting like a blade! Why does that make since. War of the Roses is a great step away from today&apos;s competitive games whether it be FPSs, Mobas, or Dota styles, cause lets face it, those are the only real online competitive games these days, and brings in a whole new genre (or rather builds on it) I like to call, Medieval Competitive Combat. I&apos;d also consider Mount and Blade and Chivalry in this category.  If anyone asks, I coined that term. Solid 9 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2679789">Expand</a></span>

Fatshark are trying to appeal to the casual gamers on this one. DO NOT BUY THIS! One thing that is funny is that when using a horse you can either A) move extremely fast and uncontrollable, or B) move extremely slow and trot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781267">Expand</a></span>

Combat is clumsy and not working good and smooth like on Mount and blade series, graphics are nice but it doesn&apos;t matter when the gameplay is horribly bad  It always feel like it would run on 20 fps or lagging like on 150 ping.</span>

The balance is completely  up since the early beta-days, because the Devs decided to listen to every single complaint about a weapon being over-powered. It has less than 300 players a day (according to steam), so I really have to hate myself because I bought this steaming pile of donkey  instead of the much, much better Age of Chivalry (which has ofc its own problems, but WotR dwarfs them in comparison). Avoid this stinking pile of garbage at any cost. Again: Less than 300 players a day cant be wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3197988">Expand</a></span>

The default classes are not bad and I quickly earned gold with which to purchase custom classes and equipment. Sure, I can&apos;t afford good armor yet but I am doing fine without it. The battle mechanics are great and dueling is really fun. All the weapons are realistic. If you are using an axe or spear you must hit with the top of the weapon or it will not count. Its a great feeling when you successfully decapitate someone, get a headshot with a longbow, or knock someone off their mount.
<br>
<br>I tried Chivalry recently and found it to be basic, boring, unrealistic, and very unpolished. I went straight back to WOTR. It feels much more refined and satisfying. Its not too easy and its not too hard, and with some skill you can earn enough gold to buy new stuff very quickly. Its really a great game and I plan to log many more hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3359176">Expand</a></span>

For starters, the swinging system feels backwards. Swinging the mouse to the right makes you swing left, and vise versa. The archery, while seemingly sophisticated, is too complicated for serious use. The game requires you to reach level 20 to make your own classes. Until then, you are stuck with classes that are objectively inferior to these created classes, causing you to get your butt handed to you over and over again and destroying any sense of enjoyment until level 20. The spawn and revival systems feel incredibly wonky and confusing, as well. But the worst part of the game, by far, is the campaign missions. You run into glitch after glitch after glitch, in which either your kills aren&apos;t registered, the AI has snipers for archers, or you just die on the spot for no reason. In these cases, you don&apos;t even get a death animation, you are just sent back to your spawn point. The AI is constantly stealing your kills, yet never has your back when you need them the most. The campaign is definitely the worst aspect. Even disregarding the campaign, this game feels broken and only half finished. I honestly cannot name a single positive thing about this game. If you are looking for a medieval combat game, I would instead recommend Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498083">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the game was incredibly buggy on release and while some steps have been made in fixing it, it might be too little, too late.</span>

Squad spawn also is annoying and is almost useless. However, I still recommend this game highly as I already have 30+ hours logged in, and plan to have many more.</span>

When I read that one of the faults of WotR was that the controls were worse, I steered away.  I decided to give the game a go however, due to a great sale on Steam.  While the game is still clunky, I think it is great fun, and the 3rd person view does a bit to give you some situational awareness.  Online play is fun, and leveling up for new classes comes easy enough with just a few wins.  I do disagree with the crossbow mechanic, but the longbow works great, and the sword swinging and parry system are great fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=3241892">Expand</a></span>

No ETA, No bans of existing hackers resulting in the game now being unplayable without hacks as all those people that purchased hacks want to make the most of it.  Glad I paid for a game that is unplayable.   This company made a game that should have sold itself and then somehow still screwed it up.   It is a disaster.   A great game made uttertly unplayable by hacking and the inactivity of the developer.  Why they bothered with a beta I dont know as the exploits from beta are all still there.  These days most hackers dont even bother with subtetly.
<br>
<br>What to expect.  A beautiful game with great locations and a nice feel to the weapons on offer.  A great array of weapons.
<br>
<br>Spamming the same weapon all day long.  2H sword point dragging works well (Also meant to have been fixed patches ago but still there) Being forced to go archer because you have at least a chance of hitting a hacker with it occasionally even with speed increases.  Going bald because your spending your time scratching your head wondering just why the hell someone would release a game like this and allow the hackers to ruin it while doing nothing about it. One assumes this game cost money to make but it feels abandoned .
<br>
<br>People in heavy armour with heavy weapons speed hacking so they are faster than an olympic sprinter in his underwear.
<br>
<br>Blocks which do not block because of an exploit that allows you to avoid blocks.
<br>
<br>Archers using the horse dismount exploit to enter the map scenery usually inaccessible and firing out with impunity.
<br>
<br>and too many other hacks and exploits to list most of which have been there since launch.
<br>
<br>I have persevered with this game since launch but this game is too broken to be fixed by this developer.  They were lazy in testing, created another game which also doesnt work instead and is actually a terrible game even without the hacking and now they are just discussing putting in an anti cheat system which might work but no timeline.
<br>
<br>Avoid anything from this company like the plague.  One of the very few (only) companies which make EA look customer focused.
<br>
<br>Waiting for a long long time before you can actually play the game.   Until the anti cheat patch there is no point logging in as everyone that purchased hacks is trying to get value for money before the mythical anti cheat release.
<br>
<br>On a server without hacking and exploiting (you find one perhaps once every couple of weeks) the game is a joy to play. It isnt perfect at all but it is satisfying addictive and fun with very detailed combat mechanics which mean that combat is more than just clicking furiously.  Combat involves many choices and options when all things are equal.  Do not expect realism but a great game with combat that feels like your level of skill and timing matters.  This may or may not be possible again for the foreseeable future while they dither and blunder around wondering what to do about hacking and at present things will get worse before they get better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2697407">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s fun to whack people with sword, but as everyone said, for 20 minutes. Then it gets extremely dull. Opening Tech tree needs more grinding than completing whole game of WoW and differences in options are costly and too subtle to matter: Even with deadliest weapon and armor, you quickly get creamed by few enemy archers, but have advantage of only 1-2 hits less needed to kill an enemy, so there&apos;s no point in investing hours and hours in getting those.

<br>Disappointment, that&apos;s what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2676886">Expand</a></span>

But even the most well equipped soldiers in this game has its weaknesses i learnt when getting stabbed down by a peasant.</span>

<br>
<br>First, I&apos;ve played every single Mount and Blade that has ever been. The multiplayer has always been off balance and this game is no exception. In fact, the balance is worse. It is so bad that unless you are a high enough level to use heavy armor and two-handed sword then you might as well be an Archer. Fighting an enemy with heavy armor? You&apos;d have to jab through the hole in his visor while he is strafing and spam bashing you with a massive sword that does 40x the damage yours does. LUCKILY that is the worst part. We all know the bugs of the previous M&amp;B games that made them unplayable unless you exploited the bugs for TEH LULZ, well I&apos;m glad this game does not have those glitches that I have seen yet. There are people that will run into your spawn and kill everyone constantly. They will one shot you to the head with a mace, then do it over again and over again and over again. I was really hoping that MAYBE they would have come to a balance in this game after releasing SO MANY bugged games over the last several years. I thought for a very long time before deciding to purchase this game and in the end I regret it. If your ideal game is getting raped constantly the second you spawn and watching a level 35 chop your head off with a shield once every 15 seconds, then go for it. Also in the &quot;single player aka &quot;how to get aimbotted by NPC archers until you ragequit&quot; sounds like fun, then go for it. If you aren&apos;t an archer or a lvl 15+ then prepare for the rage.  If they lowered the health and made some kind of knockback for attacking 50x a second by spammers, then maybe this game could involve skill, but as it is it&apos;s a bashfest. You won&apos;t be able to block 3 attacks per second and even if you do there is no reason why it matters. A parry doesn&apos;t knock them off balance like it would it any other game. The only &quot;skill&quot; involved is to stay in-game long enough without breaking your computer so that you can finally get heavy armor and a two-handed weapon to pwn nubs like everyone else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2679418">Expand</a></span>

The action is fantastic and there are a lot of fun classes and perks. There are 4 maps, all different and challenging, and demand specific tactics for each one. The developers are also really generous with content, releasing a free weapon update within  the past month. The biggest rub with this game, which I feel would make it a 9.5 is the connectivity/latency issues. They can be quite severe and also maddeningly consistent, so there are times where you just have to wait it out until things get corrected again. Of course, this is an issue the developers are working on getting fixed, and it&apos;s not so pervasive where it is a deal breaker if you&apos;re deciding on getting it. I would recommend buying this game, there is a steep learning curve but it is worth it-very enjoyable once you get the tactics down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818251">Expand</a></span>

<br>battle system is far from being comfortable - it&apos;s hard to see when u hit someone or u was striked by someone
<br>animations - awful, all players move like they have smthng in their ass, and battle with more then 4 guys turn in total chaotic mess
<br>
<br>So for me personally - WotR is a big dissapointment, and i will continue to play Warband.
<br>After a month or so I will try WotR again to see how it goes after patches, but i dont expect much now...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2668578">Expand</a></span>

Which is what alot of the naysayers have failed to do! alot of the negative feedback from this come from within a days play....I have been playing this for weeks and have now only just fully understood the game and am now in full stride having ALOT fun and doing well in most games! To begin with the game can be very stressfull and definately had me swearing all sorts. But in the end, its the skill required and the challenge that kept me playing and reward you get from killing someone, It&apos;s an achievement whereas to compare it to chivalry the feeling of achievement and skill...for me is extremely low. In a few words WOTR is very skill based. Chivalry is your Call of duty, very casual. Both fun in their own merit. Pick your poison..... I&apos;d choose War of the Roses.

Everyone checking out War of the Roses should feel pretty shocked at seeing these scores. This is an extremely underrated game and I have absolutely no idea why. I was about 2 weeks late in buying this game, but as I see most of these negative reviews are from it&apos;s original release date. There are NO bugs, I&apos;ve been playing this game all day. There are a few minor issues with frame rates sometimes, but that doesn&apos;t take away from the game. Despite all these negative reviews, the player base is massive. The combat mechanics are easy to pick up, unlike Mount and Blade, which I love just as much. This game is just easier to play, than Mount and Blade. It looks better, too. It&apos;s historically accurate, so I feel like I&apos;m learning on top of everything. There&apos;s so many perks, armors, weapons, and customization options, that there are hundreds of ways your characters stands out from every other. The sounds are sharp and music is very epic. There is no reason any fan of Mount and Blade should have a hard time picking this game up and fall in love with this new addition. Those who have never played Mount and Blade are about to experience one hell of a blast from a new style of game. It&apos;s well worth my $30, so it should be well worth yours as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2691869">Expand</a></span>

This is, mostly, I feel because of the skill level required to truly play this game well. On the surface it looks simple but it is, actually quite complex.
<br>Many different weapons all which have a different feel along with armor types. That, along with different customization, allows one to create custom classes that fit ones style. That along with a very interesting attack and parry system, make for a really great combination.
<br>All in all, I really am enjoying this game.
<br>However, there are two issues I have a problem with. One is the fact that the game servers were sold out to only one company, Multiplay, with no way of setting up one&apos;s own server. This has made renting servers very expensive and some areas where no servers are located. The other is a squad spawning system that doesn&apos;t suite this game. However, this latter problem, like other issues this game has had, will probably be handled by the developers (they&apos;ve already begun to change it).
<br>I&apos;d highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and complex medieval FPS. However, it won&apos;t appeal to the masses due to the high learning curve required to actually get good at this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2748042">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A fun combat game for the casual gamer. The combat system forces you to be more tactical in how you approach each engagement, not just a hack and slash free-for-all. Some may like this for a quick 20 minute battle, others will enjoy the long term customisation as you progress with your character. Overall a good attempt at on-line medieval combat, but still a long way to go to be great.</span>

<br>The maps are beautiful and so big that battles are very different depending on which area of the map the players go for.  The two available modes (TDM and conquest) are a lot of fun but the real prize is the pitched battle mode which is currently in open beta.

The game play is fun and fast-paced, and the class customization is very in-depth, going so far as to letting you choose your fighting style and how your blade is sharpened. There are a few downsides however. When you start, you&apos;ll probably get frustrated because of the players with full plate armor and two-hit swords, but when you unlock some good armor and a good weapon, it&apos;s really not a problem. Then there&apos;s the matter of nothing cheaper than 1,000 coins. What the developers did was put high prices on things that you unlock at level 5 so you&apos;ll buy in game coins for real money, on top of buying the game. I can understand doing that if it was a free-to-play game, but seeing as how it&apos;s regularly $30, I think it&apos;s ridiculous. On the upside, the coins aren&apos;t that much, so if you&apos;re having trouble with fully armored foes, there&apos;s a way past it. Honestly, the option of being able to buy coins made me want to unlock everything manually, and that feeling you get when you save up enough hard-earned coins to buy an armored horse or a perfectly balanced sword is exhilarating and it makes all the time you spent, winning or losing, well worth it. This game also rewards you for playing as a team and helping out your buddies. You get 200 points for an execution on a fallen teammate, but you get 250 points for bandaging your friends wounds, and 300 points for helping up a downed teammate. It encourages people to work together and travel in groups, and punishes those that walk around by themselves with a group of enemies around the corner or an arrow in the face. Overall, I think is a good buy for anyone that enjoyed Mount  Blade or Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, and in the end, buying coins can be easily avoided if you&apos;re willing to put the time into the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-roses/user-reviews?user_review_id=2978010">Expand</a></span>
