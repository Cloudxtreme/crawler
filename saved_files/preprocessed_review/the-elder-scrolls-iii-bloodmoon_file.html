I enjoy the frozen icy environment that Morrowind was missing, and the idea of building a new city instead of &apos;Ooh, look, a city that came from nowhere!&apos; is cool. Even if you couldn&apos;t be a werewolf, encountering them is cool, they like, growl, and everything! Finally someone worth my Redguard fighter. Unlike in Tribunal, which was worst mod EVUH, this adds a new island which might look small, but it&apos;s not, believe me. And if you go to the barrows (Or whatever they are called) you might never leave. I myself, for example, moved over to Solstheim because of stronger monsters, and cool quests. If you&apos;re lower level, you shouldn&apos;t complain with some wolves or bears, and for higher levels there are those nasty Spriggans (Keep respawning after getting killed! Grah.) For extremely high levels, you might want to seek out some werewolves, and possibly become one yourself, and then kill without being suspected! Best od EVUH! Better than Tribunal all the way! PS: If you wanna real challenge, try Karstaag at the end of the game, he&apos;s tough, but Hicine&apos;s guile aspect is plain crazy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-bloodmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=395872">Expand</a></span>

The whole thing seems a bit like Skyrim demo to me, Bethesda was trying out winter environments, mountains, snow, ice, werewolves, Nord lore and while Bloodmoon is still quite enjoyable, it just felt like a Skyrim betatest to me. Unfortunately for Bloodmoon, I played Skyrim before Bloodmoon, so that might have hurt my impressions, as in Skyrim all those elements were even better. Still good, but nevertheless, Bloodmoon was the least favourite part of my entire Morrowind experience, which is otherwise still one of the best RPG&apos;s ever created to this day. 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-bloodmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4395913">Expand</a></span>

I love Morrowind, and played it through twice by itself before trying the expansions, but the quality of each seems to be exponentially poorer than the last. Tribunal was ok (and that&apos;s all it was), but Bloodmoon is outright rotten. Almost everything about it is a disappointment...the new monsters (especially the riders) are boring and incredibly amateurish, the storyline is short and weak, the environment is completely depressing from the minute you set foot in the new area, and the performance is a joke (especially with weather, as already stated). As if that wasn&apos;t enough, Bloodmoon also takes the most unbearably annoying Morrowind quests - escorting, and completely floods the game with them (and no, the AI has not been improved). Throw in the very contrived &quot;werewolf&quot; experience, weak scripting, and on and on, and honestly, you have something that is barely at the level of quality of a free fan-made add-on. It&apos;s shocking and disappointing, coming from Bethesda. Save your money and time, and ignore this horrible money-grab. It&apos;ll ruin your Morrowind experience, make you lose your respect for Bethesda&apos;s quality and integrity, and take an unreasonable bite out of your wallet to boot. If you feel you MUST have every Morrowind expansion, at least do yourself a favor and wait until it&apos;s in the bargain bin (though frankly it isn&apos;t worth even that). Unbelievably disappointing. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-bloodmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=366973">Expand</a></span>

I have played it a few times now (never finished it though) as different characters and have been deeply engrossed in it for several months...and now that Tribunal and Bloodmoon have come out, the entertainment for this great game just continues. As for Bloodmoon as a whole, I only gave it a 7 for several reasons. The game itself is a worthy addition to the Morrowind saga as it is easy to access from Knull and the quests and NPC are well thought up. However, the game has become much more unstable than it&apos;s predecessor. I can&apos;t make it through an hour without having the game crash to my desktop (yes, I have the latest drivers and all that) and when the snowy weather starts, I can&apos;t play the game (yes, I have a not-so-good GeForce 2 MX, but that still affects my review). I have to rest until the storm subsides. Also, the creatures in this expansion are very easy to kill. The only time my character has died was because the game got so bogged down (video card again) that I couldn&apos;t move...gotta love 0.5 FPS. Overall, it is a nice add-on to an amazing game, but I would put it below Tribunal for the toughness factor and above it for the experience...and below everything due to the constant crashes.

Obviously, this is geared at Morrowind fans, so if you are just a casual gamer, beat the original game before venturing out into Solstheim. As such, it shouldn&apos;t be reviewed as anything but an add-on for hardcore gamers. In this, it delivers. It&apos;s better than Tribunal in that it actually has outdoor cells, and varied weather at that. Long live the greatest RPG ever!</span>

<br>
<br>The NPCs are shallow and the whole island feels stale and barren, just like the main title, but is even worse here. Dungeons are boring and feel empty. Yes, you can become a werewolf, but that alone does not save the expansion.
<br>
<br>If you finished the Neverarine quest in the main title, and also the quest in Tribunal, going to Solstheim may not be a challenge at start. Spriggans, bears, wolves, rieklings,tusked bristlebacks are all rather easy to kill; and so are the bandits (smugglers, berserkers, hags). The only good thing is that there are no cliff racers.
<br>
<br>The story is boring and the land is boring as well. Add to it the same clunky combat mechanics, the same clumsy directions from robotic NPCs as in Morrowind, and you have an expansion that leaves a lot to be desired. If you want an rpg experience, forget about Morrowind expansions, and try Gothic or Gothic 2.
<br>
<br>If you still want to experience Solstheim, then try the Dragonborn expansion for Skyrim (I know, mentioning Skyrim is kind of sacrilege for Morrowind fans, sorry about that) with much more organic npcs, better combat and a much more interesting story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-iii-bloodmoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871680">Expand</a></span>
