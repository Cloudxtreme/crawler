The graphics themselves look astounding , in my own opinion the only con is theres no push to talk option the mic is always open so pvp can be irritating if theres a jerk in the round with his mic turned on constantly</span>

The story and the varied gameplay make it fairly interesting from beginning to end, but it can get tedious at certain points. The campaign is way too easy, which can make for a boring playthrough, but the weird, choppy game mechanics would have made a hard difficulty very frustrating. The cutscene graphics look horrendous, like something from a ps2-era game, but the in-game graphics are average for a 2009 title.
<br>
<br>I just wonder why this spent so much time in development from the 2006 release of the Damnation mod for UT2004, to this 2009 release, based on the UT3 engine. It was worth the $1.50 I paid for it though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/damnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=3443116">Expand</a></span>

The fact that the levels are big and with a lot of perspective makes up a lot.

<br>Why does the developer uses save points? I REALLY hate save points. If I stop reading a book, I do not restart the complete chapter either you bunch of idiots. I do not like playing a game for 15 min and have to restart 15 min because I died or more.

THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME! Minus being fun and effective. Sure they changed the skin of the gun, but its the same guns! They even use the same friggin crosshairs! Also you&apos;ll notice an almost exact copy of the ingame menu from GoW2. Also your made to collect these little glowing discs throughout the game *COUGH COUGH* Cog Tags! And you&apos;d think if they were going to out right copy another games ideas they surely couldn&apos;t F*#$ it up with Gears of War but somehow they still manage to make it unenjoyable.

The only bright spot is a massive 3 axis environment. Problem solving elements are not interesting. Having to restart repeated dialogs, door openings, and elevator rides after being killed really adds pain. Best possible player reward would be able to immediately shoot down brainwashing speakers. Some can be shot out others not. Had to turn off the sound often.

The FPS portion was odd and the clamoring around climbing was frustrating to say the least. Save the money and prepay your funeral expenses. It will be a better investment, trust me. Of course if you like leaping, twisting and jumping about, you may enjoy this tripe.</span>

This is one of the dumbest games I&apos;ve played in a long time. I&apos;d be laughing if I hadn&apos;t paid for it. Be assured this game is far worse than it appears to be in the trailers. For all the claims of &quot;evolving the shooter genre&quot; and &quot;taking it vertical&quot; this is the same gameplay style that was conceived nearly a decade and a half ago in the first Tomb Raider. But whereas the Tomb Raider games are (mostly) well-executed and... what&apos;s that word... oh yeah, FUN, this is silly-feeling and plum dumb. Toss in a storyline that is incomprehensible right from the start, some of the most cringe-inducing dialogue this side of an Uwe Boll movie, and ridiculous characters with names like Yakiken (that&apos;s yah-KEE-kin--fun to say!), and you&apos;ve got a hot mess on your hands.

The controls are sloppy, the graphics are pretty outdated in terms of being a PS3 game. Player movements are choppy and the NPCs pretty much defy gravity. The story is stupid and rather boring. I was hoping this game would be another GUN but I suppose my hopes were just too high.</span>

The voice acting was as annoying as Alvin and The Chipmunks music (Don&apos;t quote that point). There was NO story to it really, it was as if they had forgotten the storyline and needed something to fill in. I nearly got sick from all of the climbing because I had to restart so many times. It took up 10 GIGS (I would underline that rather than use caps but...) which is purely ridiculous for the lack of polish, or styling, or thought, or... I think the only remotely enjoyable thing about this was the motorcycle/mini-trains, and that is worth maybe a quarter of a point. All and all, there goes forty bucks I won&apos;t be getting back.

Jumping is pretty easy to do, sometimes you can get lost where you are exactly, but the route is fairly linear so you are still moving forward, and played to jump are typically laid out well to see like being a yellow color. Enemy AI seems fine, they don&apos;t just stand there, they move about and are decent shots. Definately glad I played it with a friend, think it wouldnt have been nearly as good solo. Several times you ride a bike and the track routes seem pretty well laid out, lots of fun jumps. All in all not the best game, but certainly good, and worth a try, especially if you need a co-op game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/damnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=85495">Expand</a></span>

Thats what I discovered has mostly been the case with Damnation. Scathing reviews from pretty much everybody, yet practically no one had anything constructive to say about the game. Now personally I enjoyed the game. Would I say I loved it? Probably not, though it had its moments where I was stunned at how the story was progressing. Story: 8/10 Despite both user and critic reviews, the story is hardly &quot;incoherent.&quot; In fact its quite easy to follow and has a pretty good twist thrown in. If the story suffered anywhere, it would be that it could have been longer and they could have developed the characters a bit more. Adding a little more fluff would have helped somewhat too as well as making the ending a little more substantial. I would like to have known what happened afterward. Sound &amp; Voice Acting: 7/10 Voice acting was solid. Could it have been better? I would say probably. Everything else, solid. And I admit, some of the dialogue could have used some work but people need to understand that not everybody is a Oxford english major, not everybody is William Shakespeare. For crying out loud, the game takes place in the old west. Honestly I find the character&apos;s ineloquence make them more believable than if they spoke like Winston Churchill. Graphics &amp; Animation: 9/10 Now as far as the graphics go, they are very well done. In fact I only noticed a few textures here and there that could have been a little higher res, but over all they did great. I don&apos;t know how people come off saying that the graphics are bad, perhaps they forgot to set the graphics quality to high and up the resolution. As for places that could use improvement, some of the cutscenes lagged a bit here and there. And I noticed in one level outside the PSI fortress where there was a floating drainage pipe not connected to anything and part of the tower is floating off the ground. But other than that no real problems that I noticed. Animations were solid. The only animation that I would see as needing to be fixed would be the animation of getting shot. There were also some weird animations with the motorcycle one or or two occasions where part of the bike would get funky but those problems were east to correct. In the end, people seem to forget that it&apos;s not about how pretty the game looks...its about how it plays... Gameplay: 9/10 I watched a video earlier about how inaccurate the weapons were. I had no such problems and the few times that I missed a head shot with the sniper rifle was due to me (though there might have been a few times where it glitched). Some of the levels were a little sparse for me in terms of enemies (PSI headquarters, Motorcycle levels) but hey... Game play overall though is solid. AI. 7/10 AI was generally good. There were a few times that I noticed the AI get a bit funky though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/damnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=424795">Expand</a></span>

There are a few glitches here and there that i&apos;ve found and the names and plot are fairly corny...But the game was still fun. The only problem i&apos;ve had with weapons is when i had network trouble in a co op game and my bullets couldn&apos;t hit the enemy at all. WOW! one problem that&apos;s actually caused some form of frustration. Yes things like having to repeat the opening of doors and stuff is a pain...but who cares. i think the gameplay was quite good, and whatever the above comment was about the overcomplicated controls was ridiculous. it&apos;s like a 4 button control interface. If they&apos;re too complicated for you, go back to your 2x tables. It&apos;s not perfect, it&apos;s not GREAT, but it&apos;s pretty decent and i think people have cut it down WAY more than is necessary as the game can be quite fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/damnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=425152">Expand</a></span>

The things that should not be in the final game are: - animation when hit feels and looks not as a finished product.  Things that could be improved: - A bit too easy to play. It plays like a shooter in third person view.
<br>- The controls are ok, some people complain about it, but I find it ok.
<br>- The A.I is basic, the enemies do hide away after getting hit.
<br>
<br>Good things about the game:
<br>- The greying out, without a health-bar is cleverly incorporated. Let&apos;s the player focus on the action.
<br>- The game is diverse. Platform, shooter, Bike to race to the next place. The bike riding takes a bit of   practise. After that you can speed throught. Gives a nice feeling of speed.
<br>- The world is nicely drawn.
<br>- Can take 3 types of guns/rifles with you. Can switch between them.
<br>- As a man I do like the playable female chars. =)
<br>- The western setting with 20th century robots and weapons is refreshing.
<br>
<br>I played most great games and this game does not shine like those top games, but does not deserve a place among the worst games. It&apos;s still enjoyable. They could have made this game much better. The potential is there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/damnation/user-reviews?user_review_id=2077585">Expand</a></span>
