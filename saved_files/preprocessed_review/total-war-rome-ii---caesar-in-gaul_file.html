<br>
<br>Caesar in Gaul essentially scales up a setting that is already in the main campaign. It does it well, however. It also adds one single historical battle to the existing four. A low number for any Total War game, only matched by Empire.
<br>
<br>As it happens expansions nowadays come with the most absurd price tags. Compared with Rise of the Samurai for Shogun 2, which offered an entirely new setting, entirely new factions and units plus a number of other minor things, the price of Caesar in Gaul is borderline absurd. Almost twice the cost for a much less innovative expansion offering less features, released to an unfinished game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-rome-ii---caesar-in-gaul/user-reviews?user_review_id=3927905">Expand</a></span>

What ever happened to all nations feeling unique? Those historic pop ups that would educate you or give you a choice that could really change the outcome of your campaign? Those cool videos that agents had when they failed or were successful in a mission? Coop or Head 2 head games that players could both move at the same time? This DLC sucks...for a game which is still broken. Rome 2 is still the worst of the TW Franchise and this DLC just rubs salt on the wounds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-rome-ii---caesar-in-gaul/user-reviews?user_review_id=3934058">Expand</a></span>

In this focused mini-campaign, the map stretches over all of Gaul, and includes some areas just adjacent to it. While significantly smaller in scope, the game does increase the overall feeling needing to expand, and quickly. Unfortunately, that is all the game does successfully.
<br>The new tech trees are rotten, combining the worst aspects of Empire: Total War and the base product Rome II. The new factions add no real content into the main Campaign (purchasing Caesar in Gaul unlocks four new factions for the main game).
<br>The real sticking point for many fans is that multiple turns per year, and changing seasons, are only added in the mini campaign. Couple this with the still poor optimization and AI, and this game fails nearly on every aspect.
<br>All in all, this was rushed out too early, and more time should have gone into a massive overhaul of the AI and optimization with the launch of this 15USD product. At the end of the day, it simply isn&apos;t worth your time or money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-rome-ii---caesar-in-gaul/user-reviews?user_review_id=3927285">Expand</a></span>

Now CA can probably appreciate how flawed their entire approach to Rome II has been. If the engine design and the basic engine had been built properly an idea like this would have translated into a great mini campaign. As it is definitely WAIT till you can get this POS for about $1. Because that&apos;s all it&apos;s worth. I fell like a real moron for paying full price for this.

                                        <span>hey guys, So i gave this a 10 since its exactly similar to what the kingdoms expansions were to medieval 2. If you like the barbarian factions or rome crushing barbarians, its alot of fun, it fixes loads of issues you may have with the main game.
<br>
<br>If you own the main game you should really check it out, its only a few bucks and well worth the purchase.</span>

Once I got so far then other factions would just declare war on me as soon as I destroyed a previous faction so I never got to personally choose what to do. Since your imperium rises very quickly, all the faction will hate you very early making any diplomatic opportunities few and far between.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-rome-ii---caesar-in-gaul/user-reviews?user_review_id=4918450">Expand</a></span>

I think the game overall was sad, CA is making the game to similar just with more bugs. I think they need to start new series instead of sequels to old games such as tome total war (shogun 2 is different story mind blowing game). I think they should make a modern total war, or WWI or WWII or something perhaps even the crusades, or the war or roses or even GoT just not more sequels. They need to start adding to the campaign more, let us build things from scratch, and dig trenches and traps. Thats another thing units need more moves. and formations I think they should really think about adding the ability of troops laying down. Also, as said before add more things like traps like a line of oil and setting it on fire or trenches that fall under pressure stuff of that sort. CA had the ability to make this happen they made what I think are 11/10 games in the past.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-rome-ii---caesar-in-gaul/user-reviews?user_review_id=4262699">Expand</a></span>
