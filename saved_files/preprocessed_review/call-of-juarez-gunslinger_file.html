It&apos;s got a silly and fun story with Baston-style narration. I like the focus on getting high scores and combos. Texture quality and weapon variety were lacking, but for a straight shooter at this price, it&apos;s unexpectedly polished and thoroughly enjoyable. The best wild west shooter I&apos;ve ever played, and out of all the Techland games I&apos;ve experienced, I feel it&apos;s their best effort by far.
<br>
<br>Also, you know what? I&apos;m GLAD they didn&apos;t shoehorn in a multiplayer mode which would&apos;ve taken away development time that instead went into improving the core of the game. Besides, I felt that the arcade and dueling modes suited this game much better. It&apos;s a 4 to 6-hour long, $15 singleplayer-focused experience.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not the greatest port, but I didn&apos;t get any issues whatsoever, and it ran at about 35 to 40 fps on my Core 2 Duo  Radeon HD 6570 combo (not even an entry-level gaming machine). Didn&apos;t run into a single bug either. I was happy they added in the option to change the FOV via config files, but it should&apos;ve been there since day one. At least the default was 82 horizontal which I thought was reasonable, though 90 would&apos;ve been ideal. Also, while this does support resolutions for all aspect ratios, the game will always display in a 16:9 letterbox with horizontal black bars if you&apos;re running at a non-16:9 resolution. It&apos;s likely intentional for a more cinematic effect, but it wasn&apos;t my cup of tea. Just a head&apos;s up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3178910">Expand</a></span>

I think that its more than worth the 15 dollars that it costs! There is nothing to complain here other than some little hickups with stuttering wich im sure get patched very soon... I wish there would be more bucket titles like that in the future!

<br>
<br>Where it really shined for me was the story telling. The voice acting is very good, accompanying art is outstanding, and the way old Silas backtracks through his story, and happens to remember a path/opening/ladder that escaped his previous attention is quite amusing. There&apos;s not much to the actual story, a cowboy seeking revenge, but I found myself wanting to hear the story unfold.
<br>
<br>I got about 5 hours out of one play through of the main story line. Was happy considering it cost less than $20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293183">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is very well balanced, and never gets stale with the constant change of pace, humour, and duel segments. Although technically a bit dated, the graphics still look great. Its a pity the devs had a small budget, and the single-player story is quite short. But there is some replay value, and the arcade mode (a kind of time trial) allows you to compare high scores with your friends. Note - If FOV is too low, it can easily be fixed in the config text files.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=4627085">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The games main campaign is quite solid. The area variety is quite nice and there are some quite cool ares in the game. The enemy variety is basically what you would expect from a cowboy game but they have thrown in some bosses which is a nice touch. The weapon variety could be a bit better but it never becomes a issue since the campaign isnt the longest one out there. The weapons in the game are however quite tough and fun to use.
<br>
<br>The different missions in the game is chained together by a narrator who sits in a bar and tells a story. The story in itself is actually quite good but what really surprised me what how well the handled the whole narrator format. The voice acting is great and the narrator and his listeners will discuss the events in the bar which is a really nice touch. But what is really cool is that the world changes depending on the narration which really benefits the story and atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Another thing that the developers really succeed with is the shooting. The shooting in the game is really fun with some tough mechanics like bullet-dodging. The gameplay do overall feel really solid even though it never really moves away from the standard fps format. Horse riding combat etc would be nice.
<br>One thing i should mention is the duels. The duels are certainly not terrible  but the do feel like the weakest part of the gameplay.
<br>
<br>Summary: Call of Juarez Gunslinger was a fresh breath of air for me. The game delivers a really solid campaign with excellent shooting mechanics and well put together gameplay. The campaign could be a bit longer (around six hours) but i believe that it delivers more than enough considering the games cheap price. There are also some other game-modes like arcade and duel which you can spend some time on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3228324">Expand</a></span>

It reminds me of playing the first red dead game. It was made by developers that seemed like they were wanting to make a game they wanted to play themselves.</span>

Although it shares absolutely no story from the first two CoJ games, that&apos;s okay; the cheesy plot is given life by being told through the memories of a grizzled, old gunslinger who is full of tall tales, and is unafraid to use them. I had fun with Gunslinger, more than I&apos;ve had with most games in its price range, and even though the arcade-style shooting gets repetitive, if you take breaks and play other games in between Gunslinger sessions it maintains its charm throughout its short campaign.

<br>I can&apos;t believe, by the way, how good it looks! The dev team milked the Chrome engine for all it&apos;s worth, and the results are colorful and full of wonderful detail. CoJ:G is a pretty and pretty fun game that won&apos;t set you back more than it&apos;s worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3240490">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s an impressive amount of intrinsic rewards and, although technically repetitive, I never felt like I got the slightest bored. The game kept me active and engaged throughout the entire game  including the cut-scenes.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is fantastic and entertaining throughout the entire campaign. The characters feel believable and fit right into the world of the wild west. The world constantly changes and adapts to the story and makes for highly engaging storytelling. You feel like you&apos;re both living and being told the story at the same time. It&apos;s something I&apos;ve never experienced in a game before.
<br>
<br>Controls is something the developers have absolutely aced. They are responsive, sleek and they never get in your way. They are so good that not only aren&apos;t they in the way, they also make you significantly more engaged in what you&apos;re doing.
<br>
<br>The AI is basic yet sufficient for the task at hand. The game isn&apos;t trying to be a hardcore experience but still manages to deliver an AI good enough to, occasionally, present you with notable challenges.
<br>
<br>Textures, style and general visuals are something that the developers seem to have had a problem with. Although it looks good and performs fantastically it still feel it&apos;s lacking in personal style. However, the gameplay compensates for this by great measure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599137">Expand</a></span>

It has an interesting storyline that pulls you through the main game mode, which roughly lasts 7 hours. The environments are well-varied and the sense of action is incredible. Shooting enemies never felt this satisfactory in a game before. Pulling off those headshots and seeing my enemies fall to the ground in a heap of blood felt so good. There&apos;s also three skill trees present in which you can upgrade your abilities. That was a nice touch. However having said that, there are a few problems. The duelling sections were overused and there was a lack of gun variety. Sure, I felt really attached to some of the guns I used but I wish there were more guns available. Furthermore I believe that the game needed a multiplayer mode. All in all, Gunslinger is a damn fun game but overall lacks in gameplay variety (no multiplayer, overused duels).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=5364132">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is great fun, shooting feels very good and trying to rack up higher scores is awesome, the graphics look great, weapons sound as you would expect and the storytelling is done in a very original and sometimes quite amusing fashion. The story itself certainly isn&apos;t as revolutionary as Bioshock Infinity&apos;s to name a great example, but it did keep me wondering til the end. The Nuggets of Truth (essentially this game&apos;s secrets hidden throughout the levels) are a great feature as they give the player background information on famous wild west figures and events  this game has definitely told me a few &quot;nice to know&quot; things, even though I&apos;m sure not everybody cares about stuff like that. Also, there seems to still be plenty of stuff to do after finishing the main story  another difficulty mode that let&apos;s you keep all the unlocked skills, a game mode to just go after high scores, and for those who loved the story mode duels, you can also replay those for high scores. Can only recommend this game, especially considering the low price!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174012">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is probaly one of the best wild west games, besides Red Dead Redemption.
<br>This game is worth the 15 euro on Steam, who doesn&apos;t love a game with Billy the kid, Pat Garrett and Jesse James?
<br>Go buy this game now and stop reading the reviews, this is clearly one of the best games of 2013.</span>

With this game Techland made it up for their horrible CoJ: The Cartel. Overall this is an awesome western shooter with an awesome price tag: 14,99 </span>

Walking in the boots of a famous bounty hunter as he recalls the story through his eyes as he narrates brings really neat gameplay elements such as someone calling him on his bluff, and an element of gameplay changes mid battle. Its humorous and witty writing really delivers this short but entertaining adventure through the West. What Gunslinger really nails is the shooting mechanics, pulling off headshots and barrages is extremely satisfying as a result of the good use of blood and pacing which sees the story take you from a standoff to a train robbery. While being a small but well packaged downloadable, Call of Juarez Gunslinger really nails the fun of shooting it up like a spaghetti western, something previous COJ games failed to capture.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366500">Expand</a></span>

<br>The third game wasn&apos;t what everyone expected it to be so this is a great step back in the right direction.
<br>
<br>The setting is amazing, smoked trough cowboy Silas is telling a story while you play it. With big shootouts, names you&apos;ll know from the history books and great looking environments.
<br>
<br>Sure it&apos;s not top of the line with CoD or Battlefield, but remember this is not a full priced game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Shootouts
<br>- Story
<br>- Environments
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The standoffs aren&apos;t that spectacular
<br>- The health indication feels a bit strange.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Some minor issues but for the price of 15 bucks, This game is surely BANG for your bucks </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176239">Expand</a></span>

The story telling and voice acting is, in my opinion of course, the best of the series, creating its most lovable and memorable character yet, Silas Greaves. The way the story is told beautifully connects to the flawless FPS controls. The game looks gorgeous, from its Borderlands-styled graphics in the environment to the blood gushing from the enemie&apos;s face after pulling of a satisfying headshot in Concentration Mode, making you feel like a real Western bad ass. The only very minor flaws are the frame rate and the low FOV, but since the FOV almost never gets in the way of shooting some in the knee cap, it&apos;s very forgivable, combined with all the amusing content &quot;Gunslinger&quot; has to offer.
<br>
<br>As a fifteen dollar arcade game, &quot;Call of Juarez: Gunslinger&quot; offers more fun than most of today&apos;s fifty dollar games even manage to get close to.
<br>
<br>Gorgeous, classic, amusing: everything a great and enjoyable game has to be. 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3173008">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Amazing, Call of juarez it&#xB4;s back and it will win a lot of new fans. Perfect sound, more than decent graphics, plenty action, nice narrative, no multiplayer(becose this way the game it&#xB4;s longer), and it is more than amazing, one of the best games i had ever played in a long time. Don&#xB4;t wait more and make your self with a copy.

<br>Great action western game, is all nice, song, graphics, sound, gameplay, and mainly the main character. The narrative of game is the point here, the narrative depends of your decisions, Silas Greaves (protagonist) tells what you do in game on real time. Very fun.

Playing this you can truly feel yourself like a cowboy, who stylishly punishes bad guys. Very similar in gameplay sence with &quot;Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood&quot;  I think they finally took right course. If you are westerns fan  &quot;Call of Juarez: Gunslinger&quot; is really good choise for today.</span>

The narrative is phenomenally done for just an Arcade shooter, and the gameplay is fluid and entertaining.   Other than the less than stellar graphics, I had no complaints about this good 15 dollar game.</span>

<br>Duel mode seems to be frustrating and not fun at all, graphics and FOV options are limited. These are the only gripes I have with the game.

I was constantly checking my CPU temp wondering why this game ran so smoothly when it looks so gorgeous. I cant stress enough how well done the environment was designed, and how shocked I am at how little resources it needs to run it.
<br>Actual gameplay is linear and frankly, basic. But this game brings a lot of individualism to the table. The storytelling and artistic elements are what make this game a quality title. There are also a lot of genuine wild west references, so western fans will get a huge kick out of this game.
<br>Overall, this game offers nothing new or intuitive in terms of gameplay, but has some amazing storytelling, beautiful and high quality graphics, and a lot of good humor.
<br>At a base price of 15 bucks, this game is a worthy buy for any fps fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293464">Expand</a></span>

Price is cheap because the developers did not worry about unwanted multi player and other nonsense. Runs very smoothly on NVIDIA hardware.</span>

I think trying to describe this game in detail ends up being a disservice to it, because there&apos;s a very simple thing that makes this game tons of fun: the fact that you enter a world where history and historical fiction blend together, allowing you to step into the Old West as the one pivotal character that gets to interact with all of the great legends of the Wild West.

<br>The rest of the experience, IMHO, becomes secondary to the joy of being able to have a shootout with any famous name from all the books and movies you already know.  That said, the hits and misses still come out on the positive end.  Of the Juarez games, this ended up being my favorite without a doubt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3294483">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That was the case for me with Gunslinger, it was released in may 2013 but i only recently learnt of its existence, luckily the devs knew they have a great product so they were not afraid to release a demo on steam, i checked the game, was immediately in love with it, bought it next day.
<br>
<br>Whatever opinion i might have of the previous instalments of the CoJ series, this one is the best for me.
<br>Great graphics, similar to other great games like Borderlands for example, make the game stand out.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is also unique, every shoot out looks like you are duel, like and arcade game at your local mall, the word shooting gallery comes to mind...but that&apos;s great, weapons handle and feel great, good skill trees add a bit of variety and are actually useful, there is a decent variety of enemies and the game doesn&apos;t get boring that easy.
<br>
<br>While you play there is a great deal of narration going on, the plot is done in an amazing way, the main hero is sitting in a bar and he is telling the story of his life, often forgetting or changing some thing which in turn make the player reverse back in time or give him a chance to do something other way.
<br>
<br>Voice acting is done well, very well, same for sounds and music in game.
<br>
<br>The game is fairly priced and given that you can access a demo you are being treated like a respected customer.
<br>
<br>The only drawback i would say is that game is not that long but it has a decent replay value thanks to skill trees and game modes including New Game+.
<br>
<br>I can recommend this game to fans of wild west and anyone else alike as this is a good shooter that will make you enjoy yourself and forget about all those hate wars about which game is better etc., this is pure fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3716200">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay features are pretty cool. You feel like a cowboy, but not like a real. You can&apos;t ride on horses or something like that. If there were more western features, it would be one of the best and coolest  yeah!) first person shooters, I played!</span>

Firstly, art style in this game is beautiful, it looks great on the PC, I haven&apos;t seen the console version so I can&apos;t say if the PC version looks better or not(i bet it does). Let&apos;s talk about gameplay, even though this game is on rails you can experience some awesome moments thanks to cool gameplay mechanics like bullet time and others. One of the best things in this game is the way in which the story is being told, throughout the game every moment will be narrated by one of the best narrators out there but unfortunately I can&apos;t spoil anything so... But there are some funny moments in this game. This is a wild West game so we have to talk about Duels. They are so much fun, there are two ways in which you can kill your opponents in a duel, you can kill in a honourable way or you can be an  and kill your opponent drawing your gun very early. There is only one problem I have with this game, its length, I want this game to be longer, it took me 5h to beat this game but keep in mind this game have lots of replay value, after you beat the game you can play it again on NewGame+ mod which unlocks every weapon in the game so you can use it from the start, this may sound like an easy mode but no, enemies are hard to kill I mean very hard to kill. Lastly, call of Juarez gunslinger is one of the best titles released this year and for only 15dollars I recommend it to everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3289816">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>just excellent shooter, great graphics and story, very funny at times  you learn a lot about these outlaws because game gives you a lot of info from that era. I&apos;ve played all FPS on the marker, recently Sniper Ghost Warrior which is also very good but this game is lot of fun, some levels have such a great setting I would just walk around there without even shooting!</span>

<br>Game is only 15 dollars and you will get a lot of value for that. Besides the campaign there are other 2 modes Arcade and Duels where you can compete with your Steam friends for the highest scores.
<br>Now the downside, there is no multiplayer/Co-op whatsoever and it would&#x2019;ve been nice if they had added some kind of horse experience, after all what&#x2019;s a western without that? But even so Call of Juarez Gunslinger is absolutely fantastic, one of my favorite games and you should dare to visit the wild west with this one, do not miss it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3909051">Expand</a></span>

The graphics with the chrome engine really work with the gameplay, and the various mechanics that were implemented, such as dodging bullets, standoffs, and the upgrade system, were all really balanced added to the game. The levels were all varied, and it keeps introducing new things throughout the game that keep it from getting stale at any point. What really drives this game is the story, which is award-worthy. It&apos;s the kind of FPS game storytelling that call of duty or other major franchises wish they could do. The only negative things I could say about this game are that I wish there were some kind of multiplayer, either coop or some kind of deathmatch, because implementing these mechanics in multiplayer seems like it would be really fun. It&apos;s amazing how much went into this game for a budget title, well worth the price. This may not have a lot of features, like a lot of hidden unlockables or multiplayer, but what it does, it does very well. Considering that this game is better on many aspects than some full-price games released around the same time, and it  it is well deserving of a 10/10 rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3774016">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Bound in Blood had the best dueling system it just gets harder and harder with each duel and no hud.
<br>
<br>The screen is cluttered with hud everytime you shoot something.
<br>
<br>For some reason the developers removed the corner shooting system entirely inside of Call of Juarez The Cartel, then in this version they ruined corner shooting all together, in the first 2 games if you are faced next to an object both of your guns get tilted up, it feels like you are actually in a gun fight. But in this one, only 1 gun will be held up, while the other one is entirely stationary like your aren&apos;t even behind cover.
<br>
<br>With cartoon graphics heavy charcoal outlines it looks like diarhea, who in their right minds would make a western shooter like Call of Juarez with cartoon graphics.
<br>
<br>People who give this game a 10 obviously haven&apos;t played the other Call of Juarez games.
<br>
<br>Call of Duty is ruining this game industry, with these perks and  Jeeeeezus.
<br>
<br>Needs massive patches before it actually becomes good, maybe a mode with no perks, or a way to remove the heavy black outline, or a way to get legacy duels.
<br>
<br>I know you trolls don&apos;t know what a real Real Call of Juarez game is, but the first 2 were damn good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188997">Expand</a></span>

<br>The sound of the guns, the music and the narrator. All above, simply awesome. What can I say? I played the entire campaign in 1 sitting. it took somewhere around 5 hours. A thorough play-through would probably add an hour or so. There are secrets in every level, &quot;little nuggets of truth&quot;
<br>
<br>And the truth of the mather is, this game is worth every cent, nickel and dime.
<br>Buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174097">Expand</a></span>

The price caught my eye and for a price that low it told me one of two things, it is either very very short or it is not an official installment. Well, I was right on both.
<br>
<br>The first thing you are going to notice after the cutscene ends when you start is this God awful horrendous black ugly border that surrounds your screen. Once you&apos;ve recovered from the shock you&apos;re going to notice the graphics look very familiar to Boringlands. Oops I mean Borderlands. Yes, that ugly black cartoon style outline on every character, object and detail. Even the character introduction screens are done the same comic book way. By now you&apos;re thinking &quot;Well it must be all down hill from here.&quot; Oh no, not true at all. You are rewarded with very bloody headshots and very satisfying showdowns, NOW it&apos;s all down hill from here.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is arcade rail-type. Shoot and move if you will, while you can pick up rifles for those long range kills you realize that areas are so small you can run through the whole game with a single pistol on its hardest setting. Health is another noticeable issue, how do you die? Can you die? It&apos;s annoying when you are killed easy and enemies can take five shotgun shells to the face and live, but when it&apos;s the complete opposite it&apos;s even more annoying. Yes there are upgrades but what&apos;s the point? You&apos;re already overpowered as it is. There are &quot;secrets&quot; but they are just pages of background on characters and such. Time wise, you&apos;re done and over in roughly four to six hours, three or less on average.
<br>
<br>There is no link at all to the first two installments and defiantly not the third. The name &quot;Call of Juarez&quot; has just been slapped on it to sell more then it should. Only Call of Juarez and Bound in Blood are the real story and it has become clear to me that it had officially ended in Bound in Blood. New to the story you should only pick up the first two titles and avoid everything else like the plague and not to feed Techland. This is my third and last game I will purchase from them. They have failed on every level in all three games I have played developed by them to even impress me in the slightest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3191070">Expand</a></span>

I felt that this game lacks any real depth. It was so disappointing that I just created an account just to express my dislike for this game. The gameplay is nothing but shoot this bad guy, then shoot that bad guy, and 50 other bad guys, then have a quick draw duel with a boss.  Having played Bound in Blood, this game does not bring much new for the series.  It was mildly entertaining for the first couple hours (levels), but after I discovered it&apos;s just the same thing each level with nothing else to do but shoot people and progress through the story, I was pretty turned off. The level design is pretty linear as well, and it and the gameplay sort of forces you to move in one direction toward the next objective, and really deters you from any sort of exploration or just taking a breather to look around.
<br>
<br>I was hoping it would have &quot;some&quot; high action fighting, then every once in awhile you take a breather, and get to do other things, like play poker, and do side missions, ect.  Call of Juarez: Gunslinger just seems like a copy of Bound in Blood with a handful of new features such as choosing skills and the new scoring system. I just feels like your playing a bunch of gun fight (shoot out) stories that have nothing to them except killing everyone and completing the level.
<br>
<br>If you just like high action linear story mode games that are completed in a few hours, then this game is for you. However, If you like more open world games that have great action, innovative gameplay mechanics, and high replay value, (like &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot;) then this game is not for you.
<br>
<br>Because It felt like an ok shooter with decent graphics and story telling and gave me some entertainment up until I realized it&apos;s just the same thing over and over with no real depth. I&apos;ll give it a generous 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3173065">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you don&apos;t mind this, go ahead, but if you are looking for something more or even for the qualities of the great first Call of Juarez, you will again be disappointed.
<br>
<br>There is nothing to challenge your mind and there is nothing to explore (except some bland collectibles). You are basically moving on rails through this western setting and there is nothing but shooting. You don&apos;t care for your cardboard opponents, you don&apos;t care for anything, you just shoot stuff and get points for it. The narrative in the background even tells you what&apos;s happening next in this bland plot, so you won&apos;t even experience much surprises on your own.
<br>
<br>The graphics feels a bit like a half hearted borderlands copy and it misses a general sense of clearness, especially with the use of colours, so things can get confusing to where your opponents are and where to go.
<br>
<br>Besides all that, the gun play itself is pretty neat, it feels good and the sound is crunchy, and getting points for shooting stuff is almost always fun for some time, but that&apos;s about it.
<br>
<br>The game could have worked better as a light gun shooter on real rails, because then it wouldn&apos;t even give you the impression that there is something else and it could have concentrated more on a better, more action packed and surprising pacing.
<br>
<br>The way it is, it&apos;s a game to be forgotten fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3182872">Expand</a></span>

<br>the story is good. it moves the action pretty good and it gets better along the way. the cutscenes have a cool style.
<br>now to the bad stuff. the thing that most annoyed me is the dueling system. ITS ABSOLUTELY CRAP!!!!! the dueling system is annoying. its a good idea, but its executed really bad.  another annoying thing is that some times death feels cheap. the game has a few bugs and glitches, theyre not so bad though. the game also could have benefited of more guns. my final complaint is that the game is a bit repetetive. its not too bad, but considering how the locations are  varied its a bit disapointing that the gameplay is always the same  dont get me wrong, the gameplay is really fun and great but they should have put more different gameplay to spice things up)
<br>overall i really enjoyed call of juarez gunslinger!!! this is a great shooter, and for 15$ its totally worth it. if you want a wild west game, than this is what your looking for, its just awesome!!!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3188782">Expand</a></span>

The Call of Juarez series has never been anything special (it has actually been downright horrible, at times). Gunslinger, on the other hand, is something that&apos;s truly worth your time. Combine the excellent cell shaded graphics with phenomenal gunplay and you have a real winner. The excellently voiced comic book style story never takes itself too seriously and it benefits greatly from that. As for the gameplay, they did a fantastic job of letting you absolutely tear through people as a reward for accuracy without ever letting you get lazy. Every enemy is a threat and they WILL kill you if you aren&apos;t fast enough (I do recommend playing on Hard though. I didn&apos;t touch normal.). My only complaint is the duel mechanic that quickly grows to be tiresome though you only have to do it at the end of levels. The campaign should keep you busy for 4-5 hours by which time you will unlock a New Game+ mode that lets you keep leveling up and play on the &quot;True West&quot; difficulty. If that&apos;s not enough, there&apos;s the relentlessly fun arcade mode that is essentially a score attack mode where accuracy, speed, and combos are key.

<br>9/10 - a surprisingly complete package for $15 or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=4118993">Expand</a></span>

I had a craving for something different in a shooter and this totally delivered. Not since Red Dead Redemption has a game captured the feeling of the &quot;wild&quot; west as well as this game. Beautifully rendered graphics and although linear in design, gave you just enough incentive with the &quot;history nugget&quot; unlocks, that exploring through every nook and cranny of the levels is worth it. The guns and gunplay was done brilliantly  not since the iD Doom/Rage shotgun have I had so much fun shooting! (everything from badguys to rusty coffee cans to chickens)
<br>The gameplay mechanics on bullet time, bullet dodging and duels was executed perfectly. The story ideas were well thought out and engaging, with an original story telling idea that you play both what the legend tells, and what the actual history was. (with the legend and the reality usually being wildly different)
<br>A short game, but lots of replayabilty with different game play modes and leaderboards, etc.
<br>If Ubi set out to atone for the horrible mess that was &quot;C.o.J  The Cartel&quot; then they have redeemed themselves totally, and have made what is quite possibly one of the best western games ever made.
<br>Totally worth the new release price of 15$ and a must have if it ever goes on sale!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3214626">Expand</a></span>

At  first it&apos;s quite fun because it&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve played a western shooting game. Aftter the 2nd episode I felt like it&apos;s purely shooting game, your mission is to shoot and shoot and shoot.
<br>I like the blood splatter, the concentration, the 1 on 1 showdown. But overall it&apos;s like an arcade game with movement.
<br>
<br>The narrative is very good but the problem is they overdo it. The game was very short. I was expecting Horse riding or any special Mission.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game was smooth, the graphics  good, AI  cardboard AI.
<br>
<br>The collection of nuggets was great to see the story of every outlaw.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an average game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207778">Expand</a></span>

There are tough parts but thats all part of the game and having fun as much as possible and thats what it sure does. Western would have to be second in my book of most favorite game styles. Its worth the money i must say. also the cut scenes are skip-able if i remember correctly. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3197890">Expand</a></span>

<br>I must say that lately some budget games have been putting AAA titles to shame and Gunslinger is no exception. The gameplay mechanics feel more arcade than the previous Call Of Juarez games but it fits perfectly with the &apos;tall tale&apos; style narrative of the game.
<br>Worthy of note is the bullet dodging system which literally allows you to.. well... dodge the bullet and live another day. The stand off mechanics is deep and tense making duels far more enjoyable than previous games in the series. Also, this is no a particularly short game, in fact it lasted longer than some full priced titles. And even better, you&apos;ll have a hoot running and gunning and dull moments are not to be found.
<br>A worthy game that punches well above it&apos;s price point. Heck, they could have gotten away with a $50-$60 price tag, instead they only ask for $18.

<br>
<br>In this relatively short review, i&apos;ll cover the Good, Bad and the Ugly of this game.
<br>
<br>:
<br>
<br>+ Excellent story-telling
<br>+ Superb &amp; convincing cutscenes as well as characters
<br>+ Very well optimised game mechanic, didn&apos;t have had any trouble playing it from the start.
<br>+ [spoiler]    Nugget of Truth tells stories and short bios about real life characters, places, etc    [/spoiler]    The Bad &amp; The Ugly:
<br>
<br>- Extremely short singleplayer story mode. (4 hours for &lt; or equal to US$15)
<br>- Graphics doesn&apos;t seem to impress. Probably because of the engine used.
<br>- A.I. isn&apos;t great. Felt little to no challenge at all.
<br>- No tutorial centred mission(s). Players are thrown into the game with HUD overlaying short tips &amp; other advices.
<br>
<br>In all, i really recommend this game for it&apos;s cheap price. Worth playing, especially if you love the old 19th century Western Texas/Mexico cowboy era!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=4090933">Expand</a></span>

It has a skill/level up system, decent replayablity (i went through the game twice, you keep your skills and level on each playthrough. I went all rifles/pistols on the first playthrough and all shotguns on the second), graphics that deeply reminded me of Borderlands (in other words, awesome graphics), super fun gameplay (you can slow time after getting some kills by pressing Q, kinda like Red Dead Redemption), great humor, a low asking price (I got it for all of 3$ during a sale on steam, and it was soooooo worth it) and real life lore you can find to learn about actual cowboys from the past (Doc Holiday, Billy the Kid, ect.). If you&apos;re playing through the game on Steam, there is an extremely handy guide on how the duels work, which I highly reccomend you take a look at.
<br>
<br>TL;DR
<br>Skill/Level System
<br>Replay Value (Check!)
<br>Really fun Gameplay
<br>Borderlands-esque Graphics
<br>In-Game lore on Real Life Cowboys
<br>Great sense of Humor
<br>Low Asking Price (10$ not on sale)

Let&apos;s hope this marks a new direction for the franchise and not yet another let down in its ever more schizophrenic history.
<br>The story is presented as a mere flashback, with Silas Greaves, the bounty hunter, recounting his achievements across the American west as he holds court at a local saloon. At any moment though, the story might change as Greaves recalls something he forgot to mention or a listener gives him hard time for one supposed &#x201C;fact&#x201D; or another.
<br>When it comes to game-play, you might be finding yourself fending off an Apache ambush in the middle of a hunt for fleeing bandits, only for someone to ask why there are suddenly Native Americans in the mix. Greaves then recounts and explains, &#x201C;No, they ambushed me like they were Apaches,&#x201D; at which point the scene changes as your attackers suddenly transform into outlaws.
<br>This happens repeatedly throughout Gunslinger. The environment transforms itself right in front of the player, and an confined space could suddenly have an exit that Greaves forgot to mention. At one point, your path leads to a deadly encounter with the end of a speeding mine cart, complete with a Game Over screen that quickly disappears as the game rewinds while Greaves explains how stupid it would have been to take that particular path.
<br>The unusual story progression does put a nice twist on what would otherwise be a linear FPS. Gunslinger embraces a much more ambitious look than past Call of Juarez games. Vibrant colored textures that heavily emphasize shadows to the unique look of Gearbox Software&#x2019;s Borderlands games, but the overall feel falls closer to that of a graphic novel.
<br>&#x2003;
<br>players also have the option of playing around with either Duel or Arcade modes. Duel is a boss rush mode that pits you against key enemies from the story in a quickdraw arena. The quickdraw mini-game however is a weak element in Gunslinger, with players needing to juggle a pair of meters by twiddling the left and right thumb sticks. It&#x2019;s a solution to an aspect of Wild West lore that doesn&#x2019;t entirely translate into good nor entertaining game-play.
<br>Arcade mode though offers much more in the way of replay value, with breaking the story&#x2019;s intense combat moments up into a chain of discrete encounters. You can simply max out a single skill tree in the course of one play-through, but you can&#x2019;t go much further than that. Arcade acknowledges this with a &#x201C;loadout&#x201D; selection at the start of each challenge.
<br>
<br>Conclusion?
<br>
<br>This is without any doubt a fresh and original take on what most would call an ailing franchise, and it&#x2019;s a game that is worth investing a handful of hours in if you&#x2019;re a FPS fan. It may not reinvent the FPS, but Silas Greaves&#x2019; payable tall tale tweaks formulas just enough to provide a memorable experience. However Techland unfortunately is in the position of having to redeem itself after the horrific misstep that was 2011&#x2032;s Call of Juarez: The Cartel and 2013&apos;s Dead Island: Riptide. Gunslinger puts the tobacco spitting series back on track with an almost arcade experience and a visual twist you could only ever get if Borderlands screwed Red Dead Redemption, got pregnant and then gave birth to one genocidal child.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3194842">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A rather strange decision was to tack on a leveling system and skills. While it sounds like fun it lead to a limited number of enemies to prevent you from getting unlimited XP and in turn an at times rather dull story mode. Which is also pretty short and has some strange quirks like giving you default weapons at the start of each level instead of your favorites.
<br>
<br>In essence, if you haven&apos;t played &apos;Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood  start there. If you liked it and absolutely need new stuff try Gunslinger but don&apos;t expect it to be better.
<br>
<br>Still it&apos;s not a bad game. I&apos;ll give it a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185261">Expand</a></span>

I also enjoyed reading all the &quot;Nuggets of Truth&quot; to learn the true stories about how everything really went down back then.
<br>
<br>The game-play is super fun, too, with the constant feeling of progress as you see the XP add up when you shoot the enemies.  The gun-play is tight and responsive, and the sounds of all the guns is perfect.
<br>
<br>The cel-shaded art style is beautiful, especially on a PC with everything turned up to high.  There is no anti-aliasing option, but I usually don&apos;t turn that on anyway.
<br>
<br>I finished the game in 6 hours and collected most of the Nuggets of Truth during the process.  After you finish the game the &quot;New Game  mode opens up which allows you to start again with your character fully decked out from the beginning.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed this game thoroughly and recommend it to any fan of first person shooters, and especially fans of the &quot;Old West&quot; genre of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3189101">Expand</a></span>

Gunslinger tells us the story of how the protagonist is killing and interacting with famous western Characters, like Billy the Kid or the Dalton Brothers. Every character has its own Story that is told which is in general combined to an overall story of the protagonist.
<br>The gameplay is very basic and as far as I can say, the shooting itself is relatively unprecice. Very often I was wondering myself why I didnt hit an enemy even though I was definitivly sure I hit.
<br>Along with that the game comes with a score based rating, which counts your headshots and combo kills and rates it.
<br>Funny parts of the game are definitivly when the story is changed while telling and so does the level at the same time. This is something that makes Gunslinger pretty unique.
<br>
<br>In general comapred to other Shooters, this game is more then average  but only costs 15 Euros so its worth its price and thats why I give it a 7 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=3196858">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics, voices, sounds of gunfire and ambient are beautiful.
<br>It&apos;s possible to specialize in a branch like in borderlands (Talent Tree).
<br>I&apos;ve played many FPS but never a FPS with a Western environment but now I&apos;m really in love!</span>

The whole single palyer campaign is about 7 hours which is pretty good for a downable title. However you can spend another 10 hours in arcade mode.

<br>
<br>The art style is very strange and unusual. It tries to cover the cell shaded design but interferes with the actual graphics, it doesn&apos;t perform like a toony western shooter and feels like it was just slapped on for the sake of trying to be &apos;unique&apos; while utterly failing. And what&apos;s the deal with those annoying black borders that take up the screen?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not happy with the asking price of $15 for such little content. But I will give 1 score for the effort, it feels like they really tried to make a good game but decided to give up half way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=4125107">Expand</a></span>

<br>Then there are the cut scenes.  Kind of neat at first but then you see the guy is like the Forest Gump of the Western world.  He/you just happen to know all the famous outlaws and cross paths with them all.
<br>
<br>Goes from a sort of tolerating humor to   being overrun and sanctimonious.  I don&apos;t want a game telling me so and so outlaw was really a nice person and is just understood and so on.
<br>The designer(s) of this game took them self a little to seriously.
<br>At least if I could only skip these dialogs, but many you can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>I would rather had more action and less silliness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=5579763">Expand</a></span>

From the moment you start the game, you&apos;re met with amazing narration, great story telling, and awesome gameplay. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I would have liked to see some form of open-world exploration (I think it&apos;d be perfect for a game like this). Definitely buy this game, you won&apos;t regret it.</span>

We have a revenge story to listen, old memories of Greaves... He&apos;s a old bounty hunter who lost his brothers. But he cheated death and decided to go after their killers. Since there&apos;s a story-telling i must say voice acting is splendid also country songs are really great. CoJG offers fantastic action, funny moments, perfect shooting.Features like skill selection, concentrate mode and sense of death make it even more fantastic. It takes 7-8 hours to complete main storyline. But don&apos;t worry. Arcade mode and duels mode is offering more hours to play. You can try to do your best and compare your scores with others. I always loved to hear good stories about wild west. I like country music, i like western movies and when i&apos;m not dreaming about become a medieval knight, i dream about become a cowboy. If you&apos;re like me this game is 11/10 for you. If you&apos;re not, it&apos;s still a pretty good shooter and it deserves 9 in my humble opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=4512704">Expand</a></span>

Arcade mode is fun, and CoJ doesn&apos;t rely on gimmicks to drive the gameplay. For 15 dollars, this game is a complete steal. Its only flaw is the lack of replay value. The only form of &quot;replay&quot; aspect is a new-game+ like what Batman: Arkham Origins did. You keep your skills from the last run, but enemies get stronger? I never really noticed. Towards the end of the game, you get to be ridiculously overpowered, having the game autoaim for you and rack up headshots like aimbot in Modern Warfare 2. But, the game takes 10-15 hours to complete, arcade mode will add up to about 5 hours, and this makes Call of Juarez: Gunslinger the underrated gem that it is. While the game does lack setpieces and prefers a lead-throwing romp playstyle, it is executed so well that it&apos;s easily forgivable.
<br>Pick this game up for its normal value, DEFINITELY pick it up if it&apos;s on sale. This could knock out a weekend.
<br>It&apos;s no game that&apos;ll last you forever like Payday 2 or Terraria, but it can definitely be revisited if you feel like dumping a day into some damn good gunslinging. Oh, and the voice acting is badass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-gunslinger/user-reviews?user_review_id=4753365">Expand</a></span>

Yes, there are plenty of FPS games out there that allow greater freedom of exploration, but there are many that don&apos;t come close to nailing down an enjoyable mecvhanic, whereas CoJ:GS has many. There are FPS games with greater visual quality but whose lack of artistry falls short of the prettiness that Gunslinger provides. There are FPS games with gritty stories, but none of Gunslinger&apos;s wit and smarts. This was one of 2013&apos;s best surprises, especially after the missteps of the CoJ series of late.
