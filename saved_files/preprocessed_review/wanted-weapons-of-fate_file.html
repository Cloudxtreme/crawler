Pretty much the best shooting game I&apos;ve ever played, and I&apos;ve played plenty. Why? Because it let&apos;s you be cool, badass, and hardcore, just like you were in an action movie. You can pull off incredibly cool kills and feel like it is you doing them. You can chain moves together to outflank unsuspecting enemies and hit them in the head. You can curve bullets to hit them behind cover. You can uses pistols the whole time!! I love pistols! Pistols are cool in a way machine guns aren&apos;t. I&apos;ve always liked pistols more than machine guns in games, the kills are so much more satisfying because each bullet is a mouse press so you feel more like it is you doing the killing rather than auto-fire doing the killing. That connects you with the game more. And, perhaps most importantly, your character LOOKS COOL while shooting and killing. You character takes up COOL POSES while shooting. I love that!!! I love it when the game character shoots in a cool way. I love the way one character holds the guns sideways. It is hardcore! It makes you feel totally and utterly badass! That is what I want out of a game! Another game which did this a little bit is Dark Sector, if your character is standing with his back to cover he can blindfire the pistol in his left hand under his right armpit! I got a headshot like that once and it was just the sweetest moment ever in shooting games, because the character looked so cool while doing it. Also the graphics in Wanted are very, very sweet on a good PC. Basically this game does action like I want it - it lets you pull off cool moves, and lets you use a pistol a lot, so it scores very very highly in my book. And I am not some dumb gamer with no taste and low standards who likes any game that lets you blast away mindlessly. I hate blasting away mindlessly, but in Wanted every bullet counts, it is the opposite of mindless blasting! That is why it is good! It is a cool, good game with ace mechanics and extremely satisfying and enjoyable gunplay. Admittedly I haven&apos;t completed it yet but I do love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wanted-weapons-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=424433">Expand</a></span>

I dont mean shoot shoot get hit and hide then do it, no, u can literally stand there and just shoot the whole game with minimal cover. The exceptions are the sniper missions, which are marginally more interesting. I ended up just trying to get the gamerscore long before I finished the story mode. Definitely a decent rent if you are the kind of person that likes to play a game for an hour then not play for the rest of the day. This game is like going for a run, you think awesome, Im really doing it at first while you flip around n shoot stuff, but after a while your like why the **** am I doing this?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wanted-weapons-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=743471">Expand</a></span>

Even if the controls were in order its still a terrible game and not worth paying for or</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I played the PC Version of this game, runs fine however terrible control sensitivity makes the game unplayable.Before even playing the game I wanted to test different resolutions on my PC to see what would look good but the mouse controls in the options screen are just as erratic as the game controls. Even if the controls were in order its still a terrible game and not worth paying for or wasting time playing.I actually chose this over world in conflict,this cost fifteen euro and world in conflict cost twenty including expansion but foolishly I made the wrong decision.In case you&apos;re wondering I&apos;m not biased about the game as I really enjoyed the movie which was what prompted me to choose this title in the first place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wanted-weapons-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=3853904">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are very few good things about it.
<br>With cheesy stealth mechanics to uncomfortable shooting mechanic.
<br>I hate the atmosphere and overall presentation of the game.</span>

<br>
<br>Story was nothing special and dialogue mostly was pretty bad and at times cringe worthy, tho theres some funny cutscenes. Also guy who tried to impersonate McAvoy&apos;s voice felt pretty unconvincing.
<br>
<br>PC port has bare bones cuztomazation options for controls and no graphical ones whats so ever, but at least game ran really well on my GTX 650 with 60 fps all the way thru, with few game areas where fps tanks but its engine&apos;s fault, so unless your running stone age PC you should be fine. Also it was tricky to change the resolution in the game, you might want to use the config file for that. Annoyingly in few levels i experienced some crazy artifacting when youre in intense shootouts, i thought my GPU was finaly dying but it was the game, not my hardware, so be wary of that.
<br>
<br>All and all decent action game, but mostly for those who liked the movie or the comics, on its own its not a very good entry point into the franchise, otherwise you might feel like you wasted money buying or renting this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wanted-weapons-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6954883">Expand</a></span>
