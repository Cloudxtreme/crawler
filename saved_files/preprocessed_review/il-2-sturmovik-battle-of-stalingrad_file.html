I wholeheartedly jumped in based upon my previous experience with 777 Studios&apos; Rise of Flight game. It was a product I greatly enjoyed and despite some short falls they weren&apos;t anything that affected my enjoyment of the game. Eventually a decent campaign system was released and I was a relatively happy camper. So when 777 Studios was tasked with creating the next iteration of the venerable IL2 I was confident I&apos;d get a quality product that would provide years of entertainment.
<br>
<br>Where do I begin with this game? Well the obvious is the graphics. It&apos;s the first thing you notice and for the most part they look satisfactory to very good. I&apos;m not fond of the cockpits but find that the atmosphere effects and ground details are pretty nice.
<br>
<br>Flight models? They are very functional and remove my disbelief enough so that I CAN imagine I&apos;m flying a LaGG 3 on the western front. Most of the sounds are excellent, but as has been noted on several posts, the hit sounds of bullets striking your craft are inconsistent. Plane engines all sound realistic. Subtle things like the sounds of brake pistons and canopy hatches add to the realism.
<br>
<br>AI is a mixed bag. I don&apos;t consider my talent to be expert flyer/marksmen so I do get a challenge from the fighters, but not so much the bombers. Take it for what you will. AI is subjective and one man&apos;s hard may be another&apos;s easy.
<br>
<br>Where I fault the game (and it is a big fault because I&apos;m a single player) is the campaign. I feel the game is Head and Shoulders above others because the it feels like the campaign has me applying, lathering, rinsing, and repeating over and over again. The campaign generator is just that, but instead of in-depth, living, breathing missions I get quick missions with three access points and minimal enemy interaction. The runways are thread bare and lifeless. I lead a flight of four and intercept two 111s and maybe one or two 109. Go home, land, and do it all over again.
<br>
<br>I can live with the unlocks, though I hope they don&apos;t continue this trend on further releases.
<br>
<br>There have been numerous ideas on the IL2:BoS forum where improvements can be made and I hope 1C/777 look into them.
<br>
<br>There is no mission editor yet and I hope that when it&apos;s released the community will get the plethora of user made campaigns we enjoyed in the original IL2. We&apos;ll see. Originally 777 wasn&apos;t going to release it at all but after community uproar they changed their mind. We&apos;ll see.
<br>
<br>My personal and final grade would be a 6. The campaign really does affect my desire to play and as it is I only fire up IL2:BoS a few times a week. I longingly look at my Track IR and CH Products HOTAS and just say, &quot;Naw. I&apos;m not interested.&quot; So much is good to very good, and my SIX is a subjective grade, so I rate it based on my likes and how they affect my desire to play.
<br>
<br>My NUMBERED Metacritic grade is 7. I&apos;d like to see if 777 takes the opinions and desires of the community and improves on the good solid base of this game to the status of the original IL2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4631589">Expand</a></span>

The externals are very very well done, the landscape and general scenary are what you`d expect of a snow covered Stalingrad area. The little extras like the cylinder firing flashes etc etc are all very well done.
<br>
<br>The cockpits imo are not that great, definitley not as good as CloD or DCS and that`s a shame, they are dull bland and lifeless almost as if someone has thrown a veil over them, possibly the SSAO but without full access to all the graphics options you are left with how they think you should see the game whereas a lot of us want to be able to tweak as we like, bad decision number 1 that one.
<br>
<br>I can`t comment of the FM or DM as I don`t spend hours analysing such stuff on the internet, the planes feel as though you`re flying them which is good enough for me. Again though the community threw a lot of info into the ring and were met with a less than welcoming response. They sent a project manager with poor English and a sarcastic bias to answer questions and then post responses usually comically negative to claims that were made. When you refuse to listen to someone who has flown all the recently built Yak 3 and 9`s you have serious self importance issues.
<br>
<br>The decision to force everyone to play the Sigle Player Campaign which is nothing more than some QMB style missions arranged into a campaign with childish Experience Points and Weapons unlocks is baffling to even the most ardent fan.
<br>
<br>For 80 weeks we were predominantly onboard with the direction BoS was taking, then the unlocks and XP bomb was dropped and hell broke loose on the forums, threats, forum tantrums between major devs and punters, threads locked , posts deleted, all left a bad taste in the mouth. The general feeling for myself is that they want control over everything and the paying customers opinion matters not if it doesn`t fall into line with their philosophy. 80 good PR weeks tainted by 3 spectacularly bad ones.
<br>
<br>Despite 90+ % expressing a less than favourable response to the unlocks poll, they still implemented it!!!! approx 1000 total voters over all btw. That says a lot to me, a real **** you attitude regards players wishes cannot be good for relations, the poll was a sham btw, never had a hope of anything being done.
<br>
<br>Anyway I personally won`t let three bad weeks ruin my enjoyment, it`s a good quality product that will only get better if the Devs wake up and realise a lot of us have been playing these games for years , we know what we want, we know what we like and some even know what they`re talking about.  Get rid of the unlock farce, give us FMB and DS and the majority will be back fully behind you.
<br>
<br>Anyone voting less than 4 probably has issues beyond the game imo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618184">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Very nice graphics, all optimized to create a huge feeling of immersion of winter in Stalingrad 1942
<br>+ Stable release, most bugs worked out
<br>+ very nice aircraft models, just a bit too reflective skins
<br>
<br>+/- solid, but not exceptional FM, gives the feeling of flying a much lighter plane then what a WW2 warbird (loaded 3-7 tons, depending on the ftype of fighter plane) actually was, has some quirks still to be worked out (landing bounce, low speed stall characteristics, roll rates of several aircraft, max speed in all aircraft etc.) Feels more like flying an ultralight, but is still a lot better then War Thunder.
<br>
<br>- no campaign deserving that name
<br>- unlock system/level system, giving the impression of an arcade game
<br>- simplified damage model/Hollywood feel -&gt; quick successes
<br>- simplified CEM (same level as old IL2)
<br>- no mission builder (yet)
<br>- no user made skins (yet)
<br>
<br>So far, a 6 with a tendency to 7, though with lots of potential for better ratings. Will check the game again in a year and see what changed. As that, I can recommend this sim for beginners, or people coming over from War Thunder seeking more of a challenge and immersive expirience. It&apos;s solid in it&apos;s core, needs some optimisation. But in it&apos;s complexity a step back from IL2 CloD and a huge step away from DCS. I&apos;d personally call it a transition sim on the way to more challenges.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4620153">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>BoS is a bit muddled and feels as though it has suffered from a development tug of war between making a simple blaster to appeal to the masses, or a flight simulator for the smaller core audience. As it stands it on release, BoS does neither element well and unfortunately falls foul to mediocrity. It doesn&#x2019;t help that it is based on an old direct x9 game engine that is already showing its age (RoF engine).
<br>
<br>The IL-2 brand name, the developers previous RoF tittle and PR suggest a good solid ww2 flight simulator but simple engine start-ups and management, unlocks and experience points for munitions and skins, the &#x2018;Michael Bay Hollywood&#x2019; damage model and air-quake style servers limited to 32 players smacks more of a simple but flashy arcade game. Single player content is poor and revolves around getting the aforementioned experience points needed in both single and multiplayer and what&#x2019;s worse is there is no public mission editor for players to make new content. Worse still, the developers have attempted to hold players to ransom, no mission editor in the future for groups that critique and even a now deleted threat that the game would be cancelled if negative critical scores prevailed hence the many 9 and 10 scores here.
<br>
<br>There are some positives, the graphics aren&#x2019;t at all bad and the general feeling of flight is rendered ok (despite some colourful bugs), however there just isn&#x2019;t enough to this title to make it stand-out against the competition never mind justify the price tag for an ageing game engine. Simply put War Thunder does the arcade thing better and Cliffs of Dover and DCS are more detailed simulators - BoS feels lost in the wilderness.
<br>
<br>I bought in as a &#x201C;Founder&#x201D; to support BoS and I wanted to like this game. BoS is not terrible but it doesn&#x2019;t do anything particularly well either and taking into account the contempt the developers have shown for much of their fanbase I give this a 3/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4633584">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros

<br>Nice sound
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>1. OKish FM as long as you fly nice and gentle but the problem is this is a combat sim and the FM during combat maneuvers is pure FACEPALM.
<br>2. DM is a bit hit or miss (pardon the pun) and seems to be based on how many times you are hit rather than where you are hit.  Almost every hit causes fluid leaks.
<br>3. SP campaign is utterly atrocious and has no redeeming features.
<br>4. Barren empty world if you stray outside the narrow mission area.
<br>No feeling of belonging to a squadron or even a side.  You can actually change sides from German to Russian between mission.
<br>5. You need to grind to unlock weapons that were standard issue.
<br>6. You need to grind to unlock standard paint schemes.
<br>7. MP only player need to grind through the horrible campaign.
<br>
<br>No more than a 3 out of 10 from me.  This game has just been officially released and I cannot bring myself to play it.  There is not one single compelling thing this game offers to make me play.
<br>
<br>Avoid if you are a hardcore simmer, avoid if you are a WT fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4629251">Expand</a></span>

They will tell you it was a different set of people but it&apos;s the same company, the same drama, and the same results.  Official forums are Nazi style moderation and anyone who has anything negative to say is moderated and removed.
<br>
<br>While the graphics are decent, the flight model and damage model are not up to par.   Additionally the single player campaign is tedious and boring.   Whoever decided to charge 80 dollars for a game then make you unlock everything is out of their minds.   Buy Cliff of Dover with the Team Fusion Mod, it&apos;s a better game at a much cheaper price.
<br>
<br>Due to the single player experience this game fails at what it tried to set out to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4640785">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game, and I do mean game as it is not a simulator of the same level as CoD, was released with awful options that force boring game play with a crap campaign that is not historical in any way, more a series of unrelated single missions.
<br>Further you must play through this abortion in order to unlock equipment and even skins for the aircraft. None of which are available for single or multiplayer use until you have ground them all out in the previously mentioned terrible campaign that is included in the release.
<br>And whats more it is impossible to tailor this game to your system. Your options are low, balanced, high and ultra. That is it. Apparently Loft has it in his head that we as a community are too stupid to use this software properly.
<br>In summation, here is an excerpt from one of my posts at BoS forums:
<br>
<br>&quot;I can&apos;t select the best graphics settings for my rig.
<br>I cannot play a coherent unit based historical campaign.
<br>I cannot create a coherent unit based historical campaign.
<br>I cannot play the coherent unit based campaigns created by others.
<br>I am forced to play a garbage campaign in order to unlock common front line mission essential equipment and skins.
<br>When a work around is found to the above by running at x16 speed the devs punish us by limiting it to x2.
<br>I cannot create skins (to my knowledge anyhow, might be wrong).
<br>I dislike online play.
<br>
<br>So what, exactly, is there left for me to do with this 100 usd boondoggle?&quot;
<br>
<br>I should have used the $100 somewhere else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4798243">Expand</a></span>

My first review, along with ever other review of BOS 90% complete was deleted at 1C/777 insistence. It seems the devs didn&apos;t like the backlash of negative reviews after some of the final rounds of updates. So, here we go again.
<br>1. Game Engine = 7 Bos works right out of the box. The updating system works well and is easy. The true strength  has not been thoroughly tested in the consumer market because the D Server has just been released, so this remains to be seen. How many player and AI planes and objects that can be used in a functional mission is not known yet.  Once  FME is released, which may be up to 6 months from now per 1C/777, the strength of  the DNE good or bad will be  displayed.
<br>2. Graphics and Sound = 6 The games looks nice and gives pretty good frame rates(40 FPS for me on Ultra). There is nothing new here graphically(dx9c) except that BOS uses a full snow map  with vary little on it in the way of objects, which is probably correct for Stalingrad during WWII.Graphics are set through 1C/777 designated presets, no custom graphics settings. Low, Balanced, High,  and Ultra are the presets. Antialaising and Gama-correction are available. The sound in BOS is good with the usual setting of low, medium and high bit rate.
<br>3. Plane models = 7 They are nice but they do not compare to either DCS or CLOD plane models. The damage modeling again is nice, but does not compare with either of the above mentioned Sims. As of now only 1C/777 can add skins to BOS. There are 10 skins per plane that have to be unlocked through SP missions.(more on this later). No Nose art.
<br>4. Flight Model = 6 BOS gives a good feeling of flying but it still feels something like flying the ROF FMs. a very lite feeling. It is not a convincing metal plane heavyweight feel. It is very bouncy unless you set deep curves in the control settings. Landings are quite bad. BOS is way to bouncy on each plane, this really needs attention IMHO.
<br>5..Map = 5 Here again it looks nice. It has very little in the way of trees(trees do have collision model, a +)or other objects. Stalingrad itself is modeled and looks average at best. The sky and depiction of the 24 hour lighting(Sun) cycle are absolutely excellent, one of the best in any Sim yet. The weather effects are standard.
<br>6.Gui = 4 The Gui looks very &quot;Arcade&quot; and plain. There is no theme once you are in the SP, MP , QMB or Campaign selection screens. The Campaign has a tiny theme in the Campaign selection screens, and video intros for each stage of the Campaign. These videos are CG graphics and while good graphic quality is there, they are quite unrealistic and plastic feeling. In game videos would have been much better.
<br>7. SP, QMB and Campaign. = 2  There are 14 SP missions, they are fair at best. QMB is straight forward and a good place to practice, but no meat as far as building immersive missions. The Campaign is awful, that is the only true way to describe it. Non Historical Squads at non Historical Airfields, cannot custom name your pilot, there is no storyline and the missions are non connected and generated by the QMB. The way points are Home Field, Action point and Exit points(completely arcade). All planes come with basic weapons for SP and MP. During the Campaign you accumulate Xpoints by flying missions, Intercept, Escort, Ground attack, Ground Support and Bombing. These missions either consist of takeoff start or air start and fly to action point and fight enemy there. You may encounter some miscellaneous flights to fight, but that is rare. It is estimated to take about 60-80 hours of flying in Campaign mode to unlock all plane upgrades(see BOS Forums). THIS IS REQUIRED IF YOU WANT TO USE PLANE UPGRADES IN MP. This Single player and Campaign mode is very &quot;Arcade&quot; and does not even measure up to the original IL2 Single player and Campaign immersion or challenge. IMHO, this is the worst Campaign in a Flight Sim I have ever played.
<br>8. Replay Ability = 2 Other than MP, BOS has no replay ability as of now. Of course if and when user content can be added to BOS this could change. The Campaign mode is just plain boring and is best flown in very small doses.
<br>Conclusion: Score = 4(at best)  THIS IS NOT THE IL2 SUCCESSOR THAT THE DEVS PROMISED, NOT EVEN CLOSE. The cover art for BOSs DVD box says,&quot; IL2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad, The Legend Returns.&quot;  IMHO, The Legend is not back. A quote from one of Lofts&apos; initial interviews during the beginning of pre-purchase but before production of BOS had begun,&quot;And to the experienced avia-sim players I want to say: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t worry! We know how to make our sim the way you&#x2019;ll like it.&quot; I have owned and flown every IL2 iteration from the first IL2 to  BOS, and I can comfortably say 1C/777 have not lived up to there word. I supported BOS from a before production start EA purchase and 1C/777 had a pretty good game going until 3 weeks ago when they locked everything down. This is an Arcade game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4627932">Expand</a></span>

Avoid it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4788484">Expand</a></span>

I owned the original IL2, along with all it&apos;s expansions up to Il2 1946, along with many other WWII combat sims. The IL2 series remained my favorite.
<br>
<br>I purchased the Early Access Premium version of BOS when it became available, and participated all throughout the Early Access period. While I had some smaller concerns,  I really liked what I saw, and had very high hopes for this sim. I was and am a fan of ROF, and with BOS being developed by the same guys, I was very excited.  Until they released the Single Player system upon us, shortly before the official release. Last time I played it , was the day after the SP was released to us.
<br>
<br>The XP grinding, unlocking items, unlocking airfields, no continuity of a player&apos;s career, only what appear to be some QMG missions thrown together, just does not do anything for me - in fact, turns me off to the sim completely. Throw in the graphics presets only in the options - 4 presets one has to choose, with no ability to customize any individual items like bloom, hdr, shadows, terrain, etc. Plus no ability to customize globally difficulty settings for the SP campaign.  Want to fly with unlimited ammo while you are cutting your teeth on the sim? Not going to happen.
<br>
<br>If one likes power ups, unlocking items ( that you have already paid for), etc - then you will likely like this sim. If you are more used to what you got with previous WWII combat flight sims in terms of campaigns, careers, then you may well be disappointed like myself. Especially if you are coming from the IL-2 Series itself. I myself just can not see this sim as they have billed it &quot; The continuation of the legendary IL-2 Series&quot;.
<br>
<br>I am giving BOS a score of 3 here. I feel that is generous on my part, it does have nice graphics and for the most part the flight physics seem really good, but what pulls that score down from me is - I no longer play it, and have no desire to play it in it&apos;s current state. I will keep an eye on it going forward and see if maybe something changes that might lure me back to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796489">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Instead it is a step backwards.  Instead of focusing of making a complete study sim, they focused on game elements, unlocks tied to a quick mission style campaign.  You are part of no squadron, and can pick and choose randomly what you fly.  It really is a quick mission generator with a skin trying to give you the impression of a campaign.  Calling it that almost feels generous.
<br>
<br>The camera effects are great, head movement from G forces and maneuvering are great.   Combat is over the top Hollywood.  Everything burns instantly.  There is no such thing as a self sealing fuel tank in BOS.  Planes go down very fast, AI seems about as good as ROF.  Feeling of flight is not on par with Cliffs of dover or DCS.  In fact the feeling of flight is the #1 issue with the game for me.  It feels wrong, but the camera masks it well. Sound is good, graphics are alright, good lighting, and textures which seem 4 years old.
<br>
<br>It could be a good game for a fast 10 min quick mission, but the feeling of flight, unlocks, and mediocre cockpits keep me away.  Whats left with the price of extra aircraft doesn&apos;t the ability to stand on it&apos;s own.  Modders have made Cliffs of dover superior in every way....and they don&apos;t get paid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4631478">Expand</a></span>

I understand change is hard for some people and the ones frustrated with this title might seem that way, but it really is just a case of bad implementation of non sim ideas into a &quot;sim&quot; game.
<br>
<br>Instead of trying to draw in the WT crowd or think they know how to draw in the younger gamers, could you imagine if they put that time into building an out of this world immersive SP campaign?
<br>
<br>I play lots of games, from the late Darkfall Online to the FPS Insurgency to titles on the WII U to RO. The bottom line is GAMEPLAY will always win. If you don&apos;t have solid gameplay and depth to your game it will fail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4751218">Expand</a></span>

At every step in the evolution of the IL-2 franchise there has been a sense of ambition, of a desire to make the &quot;next big thing&quot; in flight simulation, the original (even on release) blew the competition out of the water in terms of fidelity and capability, Birds/Wings of Prey were good simcade games, Il-2: CLoD aimed to be more realistic, more in depth and more beautiful than everything that had come before.  CLoD was let down by shoddy project management and a restless publisher and it took a while for Team Fusions to rescue it, but at least there was the ambition to be the final word in WW2 flight sims.
<br>
<br>BoS, whilst pretty, seems to have lost that ambition.  The fidelity level is somewhere between CLoD and War Thunder, the single player is lacklustre and arcade inspired (even the original Il-2 linear story driven campaign would be preferable), the community is in an unhealthy state and the developers seem to be aiming for the mid-core War Thunder Air Quake crowd.
<br>
<br>This is not what I (and many people) hoped for in an Il-2 successor, and that makes me sad. :-(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4629628">Expand</a></span>

As I play the game, more and more it feels like a shinier version of Wings of Prey or Birds of Steel for the xbox 360.
<br>
<br>Yes, this game has one of the best physics engines in flight simulator history.  All the aircraft have their own unique &quot;feeling&quot; that make learning each one&apos;s nuances very satisfying and fun.  The Engine-related systems are all modeled as you would expect in a simulator like this, although the lack of clickable cockpits is very disappointing.
<br>
<br>The graphics are very good in this game, with reflections on the planes/glass, realistic smoke and fire, excellent lighting effects, and clouds that look almost real.  The sound engine is a work of beauty as well, when it works properly.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, there are some big problems with this game.  First, and most obvious is the lack of any type of campaign or career mode.  The built in &quot;campaign&quot; is only there to serve as a mission generator for the main focus of this game: Unlocking equipment for your planes by earning experience points in the campaign.  The missions in the campaign are what can only be referred to as boring.  Autopilot is disabled and time compression is limited, so there will be significant stretches of time where you sit idly and do nothing.  Doing nothing is not fun.
<br>
<br>The unlock system and the random mission generator would be interesting components if they were not so tied together with the profile system.  Instead of medals, there are achievements, of which there are many to earn and some that are pretty challenging.  Unfortunately your pilot profile also is tied to the unlocks system, so even for multiplayer and quick missions, you will have to play the campaign to unlock equipment.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer component runs well and has a very simple server browser that anyone can use.  When there are people playing, multiplayer is very fun in this game, however the plane set for this game has shown to be chosen very poorly.
<br>
<br>First, the German fighters are the best planes by a wide margin.  Superior to Russian planes in most performance measure with the exception of turn radius vs the Yak, these planes have next to ruined the online atmosphere.  Russian pilots are outnumbered 2 to 1 by better aircraft nearly every single game.  That is not an exaggeration.  While this situation is easily overcome by an experienced pilot, for new players this is extremely off-putting and for early access players like me has become a very frustrating  feature of this game.
<br>
<br>Also in the multiplayer you will notice that more often than not, you will not hear when your plane gets shot.  This is a bug in the sound engine that causes your plane to outrun the sounds of it being damaged, essentially.
<br>
<br>Avoid this game if you do not like to grind for exp, and also avoid it if you are looking for a deep, involved single-player campaign: there is not one here.  As there is no way to get out of grinding for unlockable airplane components, the game&apos;s experience will be severely hampered even if you are a MP exclusive pilot.
<br>
<br>On the other side, if you can stand to play the same missions over and over again so you can unlock the rear turrent on your IL-2, then buy this game.  If you want to fly one of the most graphically and technically impressive flight sims of all time, and can stand to play or ignore the horrible unlock system, then get this game.
<br>
<br>Pros: Excellent graphics, Excellent Sound (mostly), Excellent physics, Excellent Server Browser for MP
<br>Cons: Terrible forced grind, shallow and boring campaign, no career mode, no advanced graphics options
<br>
<br>One more thing: There is a screenshot and movie recording functions built into this game that are very easy to use and work very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617099">Expand</a></span>

<br>That&apos;s fine, as long you at least get what was already available in the engine. But looks instead of developing the Rise of flight engine  and add more features to it, they decided to chop off stuff as time went on. At this point Battle of Stalingrad is an extremely limited game, where players are forced to play a certain absurd way.
<br>Gone are the custom skins, gone is the mission, builder, gone is the ability to customize your graphics settings and they even removed the f11 free camera for some obscure reason.
<br>The career is boring to tears and the players have to focus on the unlocks instead of getting immersed in the action.
<br>The multiplayer also got a hard hit recently. The maximum number of players allowed in a server being reduced to 32.
<br>But the worst part about this game is the patronizing and borderline dictatorial attitude of the developers. From deleting thousands of posts on the forums, to locking game content paid at premium price in an absurd offline only unlock system, to threatening to shut down everything if users don&apos;t post stellar reviews.
<br>I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4642402">Expand</a></span>

But the problem as probably noted in plenty of other reviews is some poor decisions regarding SP and unlocks. Unlocks can only be done in the SP campaign. So if you want those field modifications you are going to have to spend a considerable amount of time in the campaign.
<br>
<br>As for the campaign, you have choices based on what aircraft you choose, between things like ground attack, intercept and escort etc. The missions are then randomly generated and difficulty of said missions will vary and increase based on your &quot;pilot level&quot;.
<br>
<br>The missions aren&apos;t exactly the worst thing in the world, but I wouldn&apos;t exactly call them enjoyable either. It&apos;s a decision to have them work this way that has angered a lot of MP focused folks, essentially being forced to play SP. For the SP oriented folks it seems to miss the mark as there is nothing exactly imersive about it. No real coherent story to it, just a collection of randomly generated missions.
<br>
<br>There really is a lot of good stuff in the game, but the decision of unlocks tied to a SP randomly generated mission campaign really drags it down, this game should be an 8 or 9, but instead gets drug down by the stinker or an idea that in their unlocks system. I gave it a 7 because while that unlock business is indeed silly, it still does a lot of things really well, that and I can&apos;t give it a 7.5 :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618303">Expand</a></span>

And never mind &quot;soviet-biased&quot; FMs, the FM allows planes like the He111 to do infinite loops. In expert-mode! And then the unlocks. This is where you cannot use the content you PAID for until you&apos;ve grinded your way through the dreadful SP &apos;campaign&apos;. It&apos;s not a campaign, the campaign is nothing more than a QMB-generator, in which you&apos;re lucky to see more than a handful of planes and tanks to shoot at. That&apos;s because the Digital Nature engine cannot handle AI objects very well.
<br>Then we have the absence of the ability to set-up graphics settings. That&apos;s because BoS is basically a console-game dressed up for the PC. The lack of a mission-editor, even a basic one.
<br>This game brings nothing to the PC. It belongs on the consoles. Shallow arcade dreck and the worst betrayal of the IL2 name since 1C dumped Cliffs of Dover.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4641551">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Everything they do, and everything they are, is a direct contradiction of what they promised to deliver.  When called on it, they hold a gun to the sim that you paid money for&apos;s head, and tell you to write good reviews because they need &quot;comrades, not customers&quot;.
<br>
<br>We haven&apos;t even broached the technical aspects of the game yet.  Massive biases to the Russian aircraft (in every aspect- flight stability, performance, firepower), coupled with bombers that can do infinite loops right from the runway, huge holes in the damage and flight modelling, ballistics, all contributing to a 180 degree turn from what the original was billed as.
<br>
<br>This is not a flight sim, and you can barely call it a game. If, however, you still subscribe to the antiquated notion that games are supposed to be &quot;fun&quot;, then you can&apos;t really call it that, either.  It is by far the greatest insult ever levied against the flight sim market, and only made worse by its creators&apos; treatment of the  community.  These people make Oleg Maddox look kind and flexible, and Putin benevolent.
<br>
<br>I wish I had rolled up my money and smoked it rather than give even a stinky ruble to these....&quot;gentlemen&quot;.

<br>
<br>Where this GAME goes off the rails is its design decisions.  A War Thunder-esque XP unlock system that, left in Single player would make sense (though its wrapped up in a sub-par campaign system).  1CGS has elected to force the sims content (weapons, mods, and paint jobs) to be unlocked before it can be used in Multi-player.  Which seems completely backwards.  It has dragged the MP community kicking and screaming into an environment they would rather not be in, and indeed many have just forgone the purchase of the sim/game to avoid the grind style of play of an MMO in a game that has admittedly rebuked  (by the devs) that they are not an MMO.  This design decision leaves a very schizophrenic taste in many a consumers mouths.  Worst yet, is that up to this point they had all the ingriedients of a blockbuster return of the &quot;legendary series&quot;, but muffed the ball on the 2 yard line.  Leaving me no choice but to give it a disappointed 7 of 10, of what otherwise would have been a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619022">Expand</a></span>

And a russians planes originally was much harder to keep on the air than this game.
<br>
<br>Noting more just a fair Arcade game in this stage, but far from a sim. It has named sim just because you have a cockpit. Push the throttle then soot em&apos; all thats of the content, the fan made mission better than the built-in. Available combat tactics so limited, litte mainstream and childish. Maybe the bombers has proper engine management (so-so).
<br>
<br>First look the game eye-candy, but you have to have a high end comp to run it well when you facing the crowds. The devs have promised 100/server, now 75/server barely can maintain. And about the campaign. Random generated stuff without conception. Few chapter, but dont try to find logic in it.
<br>
<br>I think they want to compete with War Thunder, but originally was IL-2 the game of sophisticated pilots not the casual ones.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>1. Casual player wont buy it because the controlling devices.
<br>2. For a Hardcore players it a weak game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619576">Expand</a></span>

<br>there we are the second time on Metacritics maybe time for a little history session before I explain my review and my score. Now, everything started in the Early Access when they released the Singleplayer campaign. It was told us to get a really great immersive campaign, with a pilot which joins different squadrons and we get told the Battle of Stalingrad. There will be unlocks and everything will be great... now then they released the campaign. In short, its not even a campaign. And so the uproar began, people were saying that this is not right and bad. And the first round on metacritics began with a bad scoring of the game from desatisfied customers. The reaction of the devs? They released a post, that if the &quot;true fanboys&quot; of this genre won&apos;t start a crusade against the negative votes they have to shut down that game in dezember. So essential, the Developers of the Game threatened the PLAYERS that they will shut down the game if they don&apos;t make positive votes - hence so many positives votes here. :)
<br>Anyway they fastly closed this here, and now after release the second Battle of Metacritics will beginn... And again the Holy Crusade of the Fanboys is marching....
<br>
<br>Anyway, lets talk about the Game or Simulation or yeah what is it now?
<br>
<br>First off, this is not a real simulation anymore. It feels like a War Thunder Simulation Battle but with a little bit more simulation. So for me its more or less a great flying game, but nothing more. But this was pretty much stated many times of the devs, that the Simulation-Crowd is not their core customer base they want to have. Funnily, this Simulation-Crowd is the one who mainly brought into the game, and gave them their Early Access Money.
<br>
<br>What does the game good?
<br>- Well the graphics are okay, they are not top of the notch for 2014 and a PC game but they are not that bad either. Some textures are pretty low ress, the colour of everything is washed out and a little bit to much grey in my opinion. If you use SweetFX than you can make a pretty good looking game out of it, but the main problems with low res textures is still there. I mean come on, its 2014 we should expect a little bit more!
<br>
<br>- The game is stable, so hence I don&apos;t give it a 0-2 because its stable. Thats great isn&apos;t it? It runs!
<br>
<br>Anything more? Well, yeah it works but thats all nothing really outstanding, what overcomes any expectations If you buy a Flight game/simulation in 2014! THATS IT!
<br>
<br>Now the negative Side:
<br>This will be a little bit more, and I only can state my point of view and what is not right with the game.
<br>
<br>Flight Models:
<br>Well, here is a lot of work still to do. It doesn&apos;t feel like I&apos;m flying fighter planes. Every plane is pretty tail heavy which is completly **** You can&apos;t even trim the 109 G2 to a straight flight because its so **** tail heavy.
<br>
<br>The German Planes are making strange snap rolls when flying hard dives: It is explained by one Dev that this is because the german fighter could achieve a higher g-force but funnly a Yak-1 can follow you with the same maneuver without any problem...
<br>
<br>Which leads me to my biggest dissatisfaction: Cherry Picking, well the devs aren&apos;t posting any sources they used, and I can understand that because well some sorces weren&apos;t cheap or are freely in the internet. But then making such cherry picking infavour for the VVS-Planes is not right! For example: The Notleistung of the 109 F-4 was only restricted in the manuals for a short time. In game we got appx. one Minute of it. In the VVS Manuals for the LaGG3 it is said that they shouldn&apos;t dive faster than 650 km/h. But because there is ONE report of a pilot which is not confirmed that he really was that fast they can easily dive above 700 km/h without any damage at all. And this goes through every plane in favour of the VVS. Hey the La-5 or LaGG3 had fuel tanks in the wings and suffered heavy controls but they roll faster than a FW190...
<br>
<br>This leads me to the next point, some VVS Flightmodels are real UFO&apos;s. Especially the YAK-1. It loses zero energy, can make maneuvers like a UFO and much more. Or look at the FW190, it can do a **** Cobra-Maneuver right after the take-off. The Flight physic is broken.
<br>
<br>I have to come short, but there is a lot of things which aren&apos;t right or doesn&apos;t work right. The campaign is just generic generated missions without any immersion. You could even change the sides after every mission. We don&apos;t have a dedicated Sever yet, no Full Mission Builder. We don&apos;t know if we can have skins or how. You are FORCED to play the singleplayer to get unlocks for the multiplayer. We have arcadish unreasonable unlocks which are comepletly meh but could be great campaign rewards. The GUI is just a bad design and not even good.
<br>
<br>All in all its a 4 of a 10. And I don&apos;t compare that game with any other games. There Is a lot of potential, but I doubt the devs will use it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619819">Expand</a></span>

I bought into the early access pretty early and was very impressed with the way it looked and handled. I posted how impressed I was on the forums. Being so early in development I was expecting some improvement over time and some evolution. Friday&apos;s came with some updates, New planes etc. But they also came with
<br>1. The removal of graphics options, in their place 3 presets because the developers think their players are too stupid to tinker with their own computers.
<br>2. Arcade like HUD, presumably the devs think the player base is too stupid to look at the actual cockpit instruments they have modeled. Reading the forums, some folk are looking for tablet app&apos;s to show their instruments when there is a cockpit on screen, so I guess the devs have the target audience they were looking for.
<br>3. Unlocks, power ups, call them what you like. They are a gamey feature. Some folk are saying they are the first step in the introduction of in-game purchases/microtransactions/pay to win features. Time will tell on that, but the signs are there for sure. The devs and forum moderators think the paying customers are too dumb to just jump in the aircraft and fly and must go through flight school to get unlocks. I **** you not, read the forums.
<br>4. No improvement of flight models.
<br>5. An empty campaign that the paying customer is forced to go through to access the field modifications locked into the power up/unlock system.
<br>
<br>The textures are low resolution, the game engine is dx9 and with 2 years of development there has been no improvement. DX11 cards have been on the market for a long time. The folk who play flight simulators are always looking for the best fps  and invest a lot of money in their hobby. I&apos;m pretty sure 90% of the player base have dx11 systems.
<br>
<br>Flight simulations are a cult. They bring out the fanatics. The devs threatened to scrap the project if the reviews on this site weren&apos;t favourable. The scores of 9-10 you see here are from the kool-aid drinkers.
<br>This is not a flight simulator and it is NOT a worthy successor to the original il2 by Oleg Maddox. It&apos;s an arcade shooter aimed at the warthunder crowd and that is a shame.
<br>I asked for my money back, stating that the game is not the simulator it was advertised to be. That the introduction of power ups have no place in a simulation. Eventually they agreed and refunded my premium early access $90. They will not look into unlocks, they are there to stay. My refund is testament to that.
<br>I give it a 1 and only because they gave me my money back</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4624074">Expand</a></span>

The sovjet planes are so overmodelled, Stalin had won the war within days with just a few of them :-) Seriously, the German planes, which were famous for their topnotch engineering and quality fly like crap, whereas the sovjet planes fly like on rails. And all evidence brought to the developers during early access phase didn&apos;t better the situation at all. Quite the contrary was the case. They demanded documents for each single bit the community claimed (although it is common knowledge), but never proved themselves with supporting documents for their phantasy flight models.
<br>
<br>So if you want to have a gamey game, get it. But if you are looking for a proper flight simulation which reflects the true history, then you better wait for another try of  a development studio. DCS has a big potential in terms of honest flight models, and has probably a better chance to be sincere and honest, because the development isn&#x2019;t Russian&#x2026;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4628937">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics are very nice, from the exterior 3D models to the cockpits. Lighting and atmospheric effects are amazing. It also runs very well on my 5+ years old machine. I only experience a problem with clouds, as some other people do. Quite annoying ATM but I&apos;m confident we&apos;ll see a fix for this.
<br>
<br>FM give a very good sense of flying and are quite demanding, I don&apos;t see how anyone could label them as arcade. Even if not every single switch and instrument can be activated in the cockpit, all systems are simulated and the most important ones are to be controlled by the pilot in flight and kept within the correct envelope.
<br>
<br>Netcode is good, MP is still limited to a few servers, as the both the dserver software and the full mission builder haven&apos;t been officially released yet, but they will be released soon. Given the previous experience with ROF and the bigger WWII community I&apos;m pretty confident that MP will be allow for a great experience, whether you a re into pure dogfight or more into complex historical scenarios.
<br>
<br>SP is a bit lacking at the moment, the campaign is more like a glorified quick mission generator with not much historical immersion. Still missions are mostly pretty fun and filled with action. There&apos;s word that this mode will evolve in the future, I have no reasons so far to think it will not change.
<br>
<br>As for unlocks I&apos;m not a fan of them, but they&apos;re not a game breaker for me. It seems that the unlocking process is quite quick. Still I would prefer that at leat MP was free of unlocks.
<br>
<br>All in all this a very convincing simulator with a clear aim at realism. There&apos;s room for criticism and for improvements, some things really need to be fixed, but it clearly doesn&apos;t deserve some of the amazingly bad reviews I see here. It might not be the absolute best in every aspect, but it does everything very good and in a convincing manner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619742">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I am  very sad to buy this game. Bad flight model, bad damage model.
<br>I thuoght this game is successor of IL2:STURMOVIK 1946.BUT IT ISIN&apos;T!
<br>Overall I cant recommend this game at all. If you have any love for the genera then your money would be best spent elsewhere supporting people who make flight simulations instead of junk like this.</span>

<br>It looks good, it plays good. And mainly I really want it to take over the coming 10+ years as the New IL2 in the ..ehh.. IL2 series.
<br>I&apos;ve been an owner of the game for quite some time, and I already got my 100$ worth out of it, several times over.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not really bitter anymore about the forced SP campaign, to unlock stuff for MP and QM&apos;s.
<br>I tried some positive thinking, and pretend I have to attend flight-school against my will.
<br>This title will only grow stronger in time, but I recommend you to voice your opinions about the unlocks were the devs can see it, not immediately feel it in their pockets.
<br>
<br>This is my greatest fear about the project.. the unlocks. If I would today stand between buying a 100$ sim.. and then having to unlock weapons I would just laugh, and browse on, I&apos;m 42 years old.. I don&apos;t &apos;Gotta catch them all&apos;
<br>But I&apos;m glad I bought it when I did, since now I have it, instead it being showed to me today, I would take the word &apos;unlock&apos; on the same page as simulator as an insult.
<br>But see it as being forced to learn your surroundings, identify planes etc etc. that you will benefit from a lot in MP While being &apos;rewarded&apos; for doing it
<br>
<br>The dedicated server and full mission builder will be out sooner then later
<br>
<br>I will make a re-review after I finish my first campaign, so this score is not set in stone
<br>
<br>Since I can&apos;t even force myself to play the &apos;unlock game&apos; and not even playing it at all right now, I changed my rating</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617525">Expand</a></span>

It is not. Far from it. Yes, it has very well developed flight models and the graphics are superb. This is all to the good. But, very significantly for those looking for a true successor to the IL series, bad design decisions late in its development introduced gamey and arcade characteristics to the game. You have to grind through pointless missions, for example, to unlock certain points and weapons, planes etc. Like a War Thunder experience. As a single player, you will be left sorely dissapointment. If you like arcade WT-ish type games, with better flight physics, then this is probably the game for you. If you want a deep, well designed simulation, then stay away from BoS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618725">Expand</a></span>

Custom graphic options not being present and with no plans to change this policy is ludicrous. Badly implemented SSAO ruining the game&apos;s looks at high / ultra settings. Autopilot stuck to 2x time compression so the cheaper Russian buyers can&apos;t blaze through the dull campaign unlocks.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a good core game here but Loft has made some very bad calls about some major aspects of the game design. It would be easy for the devs to remedy these decisions with virtually no work on their side but Loft appears to be digging his heels in as he knows better than everybody voicing their complaints apparently. Hopefully somebody can make him come to his senses and things can turn around but I&apos;m not overly hopeful at this point. If they keep these same policies I won&apos;t be buying any future releases and with DCS WW2 and CloD TF 5.0 on the way there&apos;s plenty of other quality choices in the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4620053">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only people who can run a server are the fanboys who dont criticise, one guy that did was stopped from running one, just search their forums and you can see that. No mission editor either so you just play air quake and not real battles.
<br>
<br>There are some really weird flight model issues that if you search on youtube will show examples of planes doing things they cant in real life. A weird bias against luftwaffe planes that when questioned gets you banned on their forums e even after you post performance stats. One of the developers scared the community a few weeks ago into giving them good scores here by threatening that the project could close in december if scores continued to be low.
<br>
<br>Its sad to see the IL-2 name sink to new lows.

A poor development decision, and not the only one. &quot;power ups&quot;? The developers have been in the flight sim game long enough to know that Multi-player is a huge part of the appeal of ww2 combat flight simulation for the punters. How can the dedicated servers,when the arrive, run COOP missions when the player base &quot;power up&quot; level is all over the place? It&apos;s mind boggling that the devs chose to implement such a bad idea.
<br>Flight models are not the worst but they are certainly not the best. This is NOT a combat flight simulator. It&apos;s somewhere between warthunder and il2 1946. It&apos;s an arcade flight shooter. Warthunder players there is no mouse aim and it&apos;s not free but if you have a joystick and you don&apos;t mind spending money to grind your way to &quot;power ups&quot; You may find it a small step up from warthunder.
<br>I really wanted to like this game, I really want to see potential in it but the developers seem to have taken no notice of the paying early access customers and made some pretty poor decisions.  I don&apos;t hold out much hope for further development, aircraft, maps. The developer threatened to shut down the project when some bad reviews appeared. Who can tell if there will be further development when, one of the guys running the show, shows such a lack of faith in his own project?
<br>Meh and only meh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619222">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the foundation: The feeling of flight is well captured with the Digital Nature engine, but some of the nuances in flight modeling are questionable at best and are hotly (and normally, unprofessionally) contested by the developer. Second to that, there is no transparency in the documentation used to draw the conclusion on why the VVS historically overperform and don&apos;t suffer from production quality issues like it should be modeled, but any changes in flight modeling initiated by the community requires complete disclosure of sources and a whole lot of tooth pulling. The damage model is absolutely horrendous and is built primarily around HP counters and badly modeled break-points, black 2D holes on the wings, no spars in the wing, hitboxes, etc. The simulator is built around a terrible and embarrassing XP system designed to make you toil away to unlock standard loadouts. The &quot;campaign&quot; is a slightly-more-advanced Quick Mission Builder, is not dynamic and completely lacks any form of historical/squadron-based immersion - the only difference QMB and the &quot;campaign&quot; is that AI are placed on the map for you and you are dealt a very generic, repetitive series of missions/briefings that have no effect on the outcome of the battle. Not to mention, repetitive flight paths/objectives. Achieving victory in the campaign is repetitive as the criteria for completion is always the same - meet target at action point, shoot, fly to exit point. AI is deplorably broken and will not function (even when commanded to do so) in the campaign. Hit sounds and feedback do not perform properly and were dismissed with poor excuses about game-engine limitation. Overall, the things that BUILD a flight simulator are ultimately underwhelming and not so convincing.
<br>
<br>For the MP guys: Digital Nature has difficulty providing the large-scale multiplayer experiences that we have come to expect in the IL-2 series and equally proves to be the largest limiting factor for the entire experience. If you are expecting SoW, SEoW or any other large-scale/dynamic multiplayer experiences, look elsewhere. I am not convinced the engine will ever support them.
<br>
<br>777 as a company is deplorable and incredibly difficult to work with or give the benefit of the doubt to, due to all of the times they managed to shoot themselves in the foot. Their communication is poorly translated (from Russian) and the cultural differences between Russian society and the Western consumer will leave you feeling undermined and dismissed if you are ever granted an audience to make a claim. Jason, their American business partner (and the only major redeemer to their communication), has had to clean up their publicity/business mistakes more than once.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - Stay away for years. It will take that long to mature, if it ever does.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617691">Expand</a></span>

The flight models have huge holes, the damage model is a joke and the ballistics is lacking. It has huge huge historical inaccuracies and is heavily russian biased. The terrain is fairly small and because the theater is Battle of Stalingrad the ground is covered in snow which means there is absolutely no variety in visuals. Even if the game&apos;s graphics were top notch, which they are not, the game would look bland and boring. On top of that the game does not even give you a full set of graphic&apos;s options because the developers do not thing the community is smart enough to configure their computer&apos;s properly. (do a search and you can find the exact quote on the topic.)
<br>
<br>Overall I cant recommend this game at all. If you have any love for the genera then your money would be best spent elsewhere supporting people who make flight simulations instead of junk like this.

<br>The Legend Returns! ? Please, if anything this is the final nail in the IL-2 coffin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4620505">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sadly 777/1c has used the IL2 name in an attempt to sway people who loved the original to buy this. The only thing in common with the old IL2 is the name and its a WWII flight game.
<br>
<br>This is not a good sandbox type sim. This is not an immersive WWII air combat sim. Its very linear, and very strict. You can forget it being old IL246 with updated graphics. You can forget doing a COOP campaign, or a good SP dynamic campaign. You can expect a HUD that is out of star wars, and a campaign about as fun and interesting as watching grass grow.
<br>
<br>The devs are trying to get the War Thunder crowd, and having the sim crowd pay for development.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>
<br>1. Graphics are nice. NOT CLoD graphics, but better than old IL2.
<br>2. FM are ok. Not great but passable.
<br>3. Land graphics are nice. It IS all snow, but its done well.
<br>4. 8 regular plane is nice.
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>
<br>1. SP campaign is horrible. Its a bunch of quick missions. No historic squads, no pilot info, no squadmate info, and no dynamaic campaign. Blow up and airfield in one mission, its back the next.
<br>2. Always on connection. You have to be connected to the 777servers to play the SP campaign, and access your profile.
<br>3. No full mission builder. Forget making your own missions. They *might* release one later down the road....maybe.
<br>4. No Dserver for MP.  Again they might release one later....maybe. For now enjoy the slim list in different timezones, and mostly just quick dogfights.
<br>5. Unlock and XP. Yes, in order to unlock different loadouts you HAVE to the play the SP campaign. This even goes for online players. You are forced to play the boring SP campaign to get weapons and skins.
<br>6. Graphic presets. No custom graphics settings. Why? According to the devs people are too dumb to set up their graphics options.
<br>7. Hollywood smoke and damage effects. No planes go down without huge plumes of smoke and fire. To the point of over the top.
<br>8. Simplified damage model. Hitboxes without internal componet damage.
<br>9. Old digital nature engine running the game. Using DX9 tech. Severely limits how many objects can be in a battle. Dont expect to see large bomber formations, or large scale ground/air battles.
<br>10. Limited modding. User made mods have to be approved before it goes into the game, including skins. This is another reason for the always on master server.
<br>11. The development team. 80% of &quot;founders&quot; who bought the early access game did not want XP and unlocks. Everyone gave them feedback, but they basically said too bad. You play the game the way we want you to. Same with the graphics presets, and no custom setting in campaign. They think they know better on how you play the game than you do.
<br>12. No triple screen support. There is not one &quot;sim&quot; from racing to flying that has been out for the last few years that does not support triple screens. Well, here you are.
<br>13. Price. For what you get, simple dogfight MP, random generated quick mission campaign, a quick mission builder, no dserver, no full mission builder, and no way to pick your graphic settings, its just a shallow game.
<br>
<br>The only saving grace is hoping that next year modders can make this game more of what made old IL2 fun. Considering the restrictions by the devs, that might not ever happen. We can hope.
<br>
<br>In the meantime CLoD with Team Fusions patches, and IL21946 with HSFX mods, are much better (and way cheaper) alternatives to get a good WWII sim fix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617625">Expand</a></span>

The learning curve is not overpowering, and the plans for the games continued support both by the company and third party enthusiasts has already began.  This is the best flight sim to come out in years and I urge you to give it a try.
<br>
<br>In all fairness, the game uses a system of unlocks which can be viewed as equipment upgrades, so it is necessary to complete the campaign section of the game, one phase at a time.  Some of the multiplayer guys are a little upset about the unlocking system, so you might see some lower ratings based on that situation alone.  Had it not been for that  situation and the lack of a better historical unit based career mode....I would have given this game a &quot;10&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618141">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In terms of gameplay, the multiplayer is top notch. Even at this early stage, we have 60+ player servers with a buddy of mine looking at doing a 120 player server. Combined with a powerful mission builder (in closed beta as of this review, but with some of those custom missions being made available to all), the multiplayer maps are incredible. There is the possibility of player made fully dynamic online campaigns and complex missions in general. This is the MP CFS to play for the next few years at least.
<br>
<br>Sadly the game does have one major short coming and that is the single player aspect. The career/campaign is basically non-existant. In its place, we have what basically amounts to an advanced quick mission builder (QMB) in addition to the regular QMB. It has some historical background in cutscenes and an historical frontline at various stages, but the player doesn&apos;t have an assigned unit, plane type or even nationality. The player is everyone and no one at the same time. Terrible design decision imho. That said, functionally it works just fine. I simply hate the design of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617643">Expand</a></span>

You name it and I&apos;ve probably played it....as long as it was categorized as a &quot;simulation&quot;.
<br>
<br>When I first heard BoS being marketed as the true simulation replacement to IL2:1946s I got excited.  1946s was dying out as the game was so old and was no longer attracting any new blood...this was exactly what we needed, a new game!  I was one of the early adopters and jumped right into the &quot;alpha premium&quot; just to be able to fly this &quot;future of flight sims&quot; game.  While I was happy with what I saw at first I was quickly brought back in reality once the development continued.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not going to get into any of the forum drama or anything of that sort, but my main problem was that the Devs didn&apos;t seem to listen to what their early adopters/playerbase were wanting and expecting out of the game.  They had their own ideas and were sticking to them.  Hardcore sim fan? Sorry, you&apos;re not our target audience.
<br>
<br>Everything seems dumbed down and really does remind me of IL2:Birds of Prey (which I could not stand).  While pretty it just didn&apos;t seem real at all and seemed to throw out all that made IL2:1946 so good and fun.  I am in no way talking about the lack of maps/planes but more of a focus shift from individual plane components to what now seems like an overall &quot;plane&quot;.  I&apos;ll compare it to some car racing games that use green bars that have static performance levels for easy interpretation rather than relying on the skill of the driver.  Don&apos;t even get me started on the FW190...
<br>
<br>The game is gorgeous but unfortunately is still plagued by the DX9 &quot;plateau&quot; that some developers can&apos;t seem to get past.  The flight models seem a little wonky and I can&apos;t understand why the pitch input in the axis planes seems to &quot;wander&quot; after input (regardless of speed) where as the russian planes do not have this issue.  This makes gunnery/overall flight aggravating since I don&apos;t remember seeing this input in any other game series (DCS and Cliffs of Dover don&apos;t suffer from this)
<br>
<br>All in all I was utterly disappointed by the game.  I may check back in a year or two to see if things have improved, but for right now...there are MUCH better games out there if you are looking for a true flight sim experience.  If you&apos;re looking for a step up/above from War Thunder then BoS may be for you.
<br>
<br>I give this game a solid 4.0.  It&apos;s pretty, the sounds are awesome, and it has potential....but the devs come off as hostile/apathetic and I just don&apos;t have any patience for that.  I wish them good luck!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617844">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was very, very disappointed when, very late in the development cycle the single player &quot;campaign&quot; was finally released.  I put the term campaign in quotes because there really is no campaign to speak of.   The &quot;campaign&quot; is basically a random mission generator that is very repetitive in nature, bug-ridden, and ultimately unfulfilling as there is absolutely no sense of continuity between missions.  You choose your starting base, the type of plane you wish to fly, and then a basic mission type (intercept, escort, ground attack, etc) from one of 5 options and the game then generates a semi-random mission.  The victory conditions for each mission type are always exactly the same and there&apos;s very little variety between them.  Flight plans are nearly always the same 4 point diamond pattern (start, 1st waypoint, action point, 3rd waypoint, home).  The briefings are generic, repetitive, and lacking important details.  They&apos;re also full of errors.  It often informs you that your target will be at 500 meters when they turn out to be at 5,000m or vice versa.
<br>
<br>The AI in the missions is broken.  Friendly ground attack AI wingmen will not attack targets, no matter how many times you order them to.  They&apos;ll just circle over the target until they&apos;re shot down by AAA, furn out of fuel, or you RTB.  Enemy AI fighters almost never engage bombers or ground attack aircraft if escorts are around.  Air-to-air AI is a bit better in that the AI will engage the player but the challenge level is low.  They&apos;re all too easy to shoot down and never seem to present much of a challenge at all.  There don&apos;t seem to be different skill levels between pilots.  They all fly in a uniform and predictable fashion.
<br>
<br>Even if they do manage to shoot you down, it doesn&apos;t really matter as there&apos;s no penalty for failing the mission.  The reason for this is that you don&apos;t actually create a single, online pilot.  It&apos;s a truly baffling omission.
<br>
<br>Even the most rudimentary of campaigns in other flight sim titles allow the player to create a virtual pilot and then track their progress throughout the campaign.  Even Rise of Flight allowed this.  Battle of Stalingrad does not.  You don&apos;t create a pilot.  You don&apos;t join a squadron.  There are no historic markings, bases, aces, or dynamic battlefields.  It doesn&apos;t matter if you shoot down 2 enemies of 20, nothing will change on the battlefield.  Nor does it matter if every single one of your AI wingmen is shot down.  The game doesn&apos;t keep track of them.  They have no names and there&apos;s no penalty for losing them.  As the AI kind of sucks anyway, there&apos;s absolutely no point in caring about what happens to them.  They tend to be more of a threat to you than an aid anyway as they will sometimes ram you if you&apos;re both chasing the same bad guy.  Rather than creating an immersive, historically accurate representation of the battle with player and squadron stats being tracked and updated, the developers came up with a truly idiotic system wherein the player is expected to grind for XP  in order to earn unlocks.  The system lifted straight out of an MMO or Battlefield-esque FPS and has no place in a flight sim.
<br>
<br>Your only goal in the game is to earn enough XP to unlock plane modifications such as rockets, bombs, or new plane skins.  Earn enough XP and you can unlock the next of 5 chapters in the campaign.  These chapters are largely pointless as the battlefield in each chapter is completely static and you&apos;re always fighting over the same map with the same weather regardless.  The only difference is the position of air bases and front lines.  It&apos;s all just crushingly dull.   What makes it even worse is the fact that the developers have removed choice from the player.
<br>
<br>For the longest time during the pre-access stages, the players had the ability to select custom difficulty options to tailor the game experience in such a way as to get the most enjoyment out of the sim.  For some unknown reason, the developers took the difficulty customization away from the campaign portion of the game and instead force the player to select either &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;expert&quot; difficulty.  I prefer to play in full-realism mode with external views turned on but I can no longer do so in the campaign.  I have no idea why they refuse to let me.
<br>
<br>The unlock system carries over into multi-player as well.  If you want the planes and unlocks for use in the online portion of the game, you&apos;ll have to grind through the single-player portion in order to earn them.  The MP community has suffered as a result as players can&apos;t join missions if they don&apos;t have the unlocks required.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a huge disappointment because the flight dynamics are great.  Shame the game itself is so bad.

The multiplayer experience has been my favorite aspect so far, especially when teamed up with some other pilots over teamspeak. The feeling of flight is very satisfying as well, even more so with the weather and wind effects. The game has the ability to attract newcomers to flight sim games from the very popular Free-to-play titles, by offering easier setting for more novice pilots without sacrificing realism until they can get comfortable with complex engine management.. Some people seem to be turned off by this and turn their nose up at these types of players and the dev team for trying to appeal to a broader market. Bringing in players who&apos;s interest has been sparked by the arcades style games and want something more is essential to the survival of the genre as a whole.
<br>The single player campaign is fun and immersive as you may stumble upon patrolling enemy fighters on your way to the target, or witness a dogfight taking place off in the distance. You can also see tank and other battles going on in the distance as well, which is very immersive. I will say that it does lack the career mode like ROF which would have been a nice touch. The lack of this feature can make the campaign feel a bit like a single mission generator at times.
<br>
<br>I think the biggest negative aspect of this game was the decision by the developers implement an xp/unlock system. In order to used field mods for your aircraft in MP, you have to unlock them while playing singleplayer. This has upset a lot of MP only players who don&apos;t want to have to grind out xp in the SP campaign in order to have their desired load out in MP. I agree that the SP and campaign should be separate and all unlocks should be available in MP unless restricted by server settings.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s easy to compare BoS to other games that have been out for years and have been heavily modded and say that it lacks certain content. However you have to remember that those games were much the same when they were released. All in all I would have to say that I am very pleased with the game so far and that my money has been well spent. I look forward to the future of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618042">Expand</a></span>

Yes, go look up the official BoS forum and look at the campaign started by the fans. Its a disgrace. Its far from a TRUE score.
<br>
<br>Sadly, this game cannot stand on its own merits, therefore gets inflated by the forum users.
<br>
<br>Bottom line is this is not worthy of using the IL2 name. From the arcade unlocks and xp points to the generic campaign. This is nothing like the good old IL2 1946.
<br>
<br>The main fault? The campaign. Supposedly 80% of BoS was centered around this part. Its arcade, boring, and just plain bad. Its random quick missions over and over again with no pilot stats, and no real squadrons from that time period. In fact, there are no squadron marking in the game. The campaign is not dynamic like Dgen or DCG for Il21946. It gets dull fast, but if you want unlocks you have to play it for xp points. Yes, xp points in a WWII &quot;sim&quot;. This also carries over to multiplayer. You want to use unlocks and skins online? Go grind your xp in single player. It wouldnt be so bad if it was actually fun.
<br>
<br>Custom campaign options are also out. Custom gfx setting are also out. But having to be connected to play the single player campaign is in.
<br>
<br>There is also no dedicated server. You will not be moving your squad from another game. Nope you have a select few servers, that are at peak pretty barren. There is no mission editor either. You will not be creating missions. Again 2 things that old IL21946 did, and did well.
<br>
<br>Its sad when a company takes a name like IL2 and makes it War Thunder 2.0, then tries to sell it to the sim market. Its an insult.
<br>
<br>People looking for a great sim experience might want to look at IL21946 (5-10 bucks) and get it modded. Want something more pretty? Cliffs of Dover with the Team Fusion patches (5-10 bucks). For $20 you can have tons more than BoS can offer right now, in single player and mulitplayer without spending $60 + bucks for BoS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618729">Expand</a></span>

<br>The planes themselves feel very faithfully modelled, both visually (particularly the damage modelling) and in terms of flight characteristics. The narrower selection of planes means that each has been finished to a very high standard, although the developers have already made some suggestions about planes being added following release.
<br>
<br>The visual effects are obviously excellent and the sound is generally very good, although a few effects appear to be missing (eg some hit sounds on your own airraft), but that can probably be put down to the game still being in early access.
<br>
<br>The AI is also very impressive and provides a very challenging opponent without resorting to any cheating: the AI follows the same rules as the player, has his vision constrained by the cockpit and controls his plane via control inputs as well. I&apos;ve occasionally forgotten that I was fighting the computer rather than players online.
<br>
<br>AI gunners also man the gunnery positions in the Heinkel, Pe-2, the Ju-87 and IL-2, however they can also be manned by other human players. Gunnery stations in each of the planes that have them are fully modelled from a first-person pov.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is also very fun, even at this early stage where it appears to be a basic team deathmatch placeholder. Servers offer two difficulty settings; Normal (icons, automatic engine management, navigation assists) and Expert (no icons, manual engine management and navigation).
<br>
<br>EDIT: From reading the community page, a lot of people seem concerned that the La-5 and FW-190 premium aircraft are some sort of pay-to-win issue. They&apos;re intended for enthusiasts as neither played a significant part in the Battle of Stalingrad itself, and neither are the highest performing aircraft on either side: multiplayer is still largely a contest between the Yak-1 and the 109s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617676">Expand</a></span>

<br>Multiplayer have potential also, and there is some variety of servers already, some of them being pure air-quake and some others offering more historical approach with full realism settings. The question how many players servers can accommodate is still to be answered, atm largest have limit of 100 or something like that.
<br>At it&apos;s current form, it&apos;s by now means perfect, but the core is solid, so there is a lot of potential to build on. Hopefully in time we will see more (user made) content and all the small things (like problem with 3 monitor set-ups) fixed.

<br>
<br>It is a crying shame that the IL-2 brand has come to this, but Battle of Stalingrad is a wanna be pretender made by a company that has no clue how to manage the IL-2 brand which they purchased for the release of this product. Make no mistake, this is not an Oleg Maddox IL-2 premier game design that you might be familiar with over the last 10 years.
<br>
<br>The campaign has no role playing aspect and no dynamic aspect. It is not even a linear campaign. It is a bunch of randomly generated missions strung together that tell no story at all. Instead of earning higher ranks and medals from your success, you&apos;ll earn things like the &quot;Young Pilot&apos;s Badge&quot; and bigger bombs for your airplane. And you&apos;ll get messages of congratulations for just taking off in your plane &quot;Good job. You took off!&quot; You will get no sense of history at all from this game while it insults your intelligence at the same time.
<br>
<br>Who would I recommend this game for...I can&apos;t think of any audience. MP players are forced to grind through the SP Campaign to earn skins and technology for MP play and SP players face a campaign made for kids.  And the game&apos;s too mature and difficult for kids.  Get ready for a huge disappointment if you purchase IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad no matter who you are.&#x2026;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617687">Expand</a></span>

<br>As I bought the game very early I fell into the trap to assume that it would be a improved IL2-1946 and at least as good as the abandoned IL2-Cliffs of Dover.
<br>I was wrong!
<br>While this game sports very nice graphics and sounds, it lacks in the sim department.
<br>The flight model gives imo no real feeling of weight of the planes, especially when landing they float and float, very unlike as in real life where I occasionally dumped a Cessna the last 20 - 30 cm because of the stall.
<br>Not so here, too fast and you bounce and you have to become really slow to reach the stall.
<br>The FM has too many discrepancies, FW 190 roll rate, FW 190 Cobra manoeuvre, in general the twisty reactions of the axis fighters and rock steady (felt) reactions of the VVS fighters.
<br>The DM needs to be reworked also, attacked planes are loosing wings or other major parts waay to easy. Almost every hit gives at least a major leak, a fire, or with cannons a major structural damage.
<br>That disregards that at least 70% of the fuselage is empty and has no critically load bearing structures.
<br>The DM is clearly made for gamers, not for the sim crowd, as success is easy and spectacular.
<br>If you want a flight game -&gt; you&apos;ve found it, and a really good one.
<br>If you want a sim -&gt; stay with IL2-Cliffs of Dover or wait for DCS WWII or even stay with IL2-1946.
<br>Same if you want to fly as a group, BoS doesn&apos;t deliver that, at least for now.
<br>Mission building will be available in the future, we&apos;ll see. Collapse</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618457">Expand</a></span>

<br>During the early access programme the devs very clear what they could acive in the very limited time they had to develope it.
<br>
<br>The SP campange is NOT a dynamic Carrier as many may had hoped, rather randomly generated missions that fit in the time of the Battle you choose.
<br>If you want roleplay you have to add that yourself.
<br>
<br>The unlocks are not great, but the most important ones are very easy to get, 2 or 3 missions/plane will get you there for most parts.
<br>
<br>MP is quiet good at the moment already, the SYN Server runs now games with 75 players and more to come soon.
<br>
<br>The devs have stated that they are currently working on the Dserver, skin making tools and the FMB, and in December we will get a roadmap for futher development .

<br>
<br>This title tries to tell you this is the continuation of the original IL2 series yet doesn&apos;t have 10% of the features that made IL2 what it is.
<br>
<br>Combine that with developers that threaten their customers, and forum moderators that are amongst the worst in the business, you are left with very few people playing and even fewer with any interest to play.
<br>
<br>This is the 1st flight sim I&apos;ve ever bought that I have absolutely 0, zip, nada, interest in playing.  It&apos;s no simulator, and it&apos;s definitely not much of a game either.
<br>
<br>In 2014 you don&apos;t even have an option for something as simple as setting the trim on an axis of your HOTAS.  You can&apos;t even create skins for the planes.  You can&apos;t even choose markings or numbering for your planes.
<br>
<br>This is the biggest let down as a flight simmer I&apos;ve seen yet.  Not only does this game fail to deliver something better than products released years ago, it doesn&apos;t even deliver the very most basic features of those other titles released decades ago.   To top it all off, this game is expensive.
<br>
<br>Save your money if you are expecting a real IL2.  The closest product I can compare this to is Wings of Prey and that&apos;s probably pushing it.  With very questionable flight models, a basic damage model, DX9 graphics, along with hollywood effects, the realism and accuracy of this game is completely thrown out the window.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for an IL2, look at the real IL2 titles made by Oleg.  If you want a War Thunder grind fest in an arcade setting, this is the sim for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4621347">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game mechanics, maps, flight model and damage model are sound, and the game has been getting updates and attention weekly during early access, and they are continuing to make improvements.  The development team (777) is very active and responsive to the community; Check out their forum.

First the planes flight models (FMs) including the ground handling are much more realistic or atleast they feel that way for me. WT and IL2 BoS FMs are worlds apart, that said I can not compare them to DSC or older IL2 titles, cause I haven&apos;t played them.
<br>
<br>Graphics are good, definitely better than the ones I have seen in WT, especially the cockpit models (all gauges, levers and switches are working and animated). The landscape is mostly snowy planes with roads, some cities and forests on it. Close up they look good, but winter is not really my favorite landscape theme, but that is just a personnel task.
<br>
<br>Difficulty is okay, taking off is a bit more difficult than in WT (SB) but with some practice it feels nearly as easy. Spotting (if you play on expert with no markers) is easier than in WT. Aiming and flying can be compared to WT, guns do actually do damage and I experienced no issues with hit registration so far. Planes with damaged wings can still fly, even if a 1/3 of one wing is missing, which is realistic. Don&apos;t expect to be able to go back into combat with such damage, but flying back to the airfield is possible.
<br>
<br>The game offers a Single Player campaign, which was just released as I wrote this review. It is still in development, so don&apos;t expect to much from it in this state. Multiplayer is great, servers allow joining and leaving at anytime (no queues like in WT). Despite being still in development and not released, the number of players is already big. There are two modes in Multiplayer, &apos;normal&apos; with markers and automatic engine management and &apos;expert&apos; without markers and with complex engine management.
<br>
<br>It may has fewer planes than WT, but the few it has have great FMs, alot of skins and highly detailed cockpits which are fully animated (gauges and levers). The Heinkel 111 has all gunner positions fully modeled. Also each planes offers alot of diffrent configurations and weapon loadouts. The Ju 87 D-3 for example can be equipped with bombs up to 1800kg bombs, 3.7 cm cannons or underwing machine gun pods with 6 guns in each pod.
<br>
<br>The developers recently introduced an unlock system for skins and weapon modifications. I for myself coming from WT am used to this. IL2 BoS unlock system doesn&apos;t take that much time compared to WT, but it is only available in Single player, so you have to play the SP campaign to be able to use certain skins and weapon load outs in multiplayer.
<br>
<br>All in all this sim feels great, one of the best WW2 flight sims out there. Switching to this game from WT was the right step, as I prefer historical matchups and realistic FMs over quantity of planes. I am giving this title a 8 cause the unlock system is in my opinion spoiling the fun for the MP players that don&apos;t want to play SP to get them, even if it is way faster than the unlock system of WT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617742">Expand</a></span>

Immersion is stunning as for the flight feeling and physic engine, the best land ever seen with a superb bump mapping. This provide really a great immersion when you fly at low altitudes with clouds and snow. Graphic is really very good even if the game is till in DX9. In DX11 it would have been much better however.

<br>Multiplayer is still WIP (YOU STILL CAN NOT HOST your own missions) but it&apos;s really good now with the last update (75 players on-line without any problems if not some lag sometimes), but the on-line experience is great and really immersive: fly the He-111 with friends, and you&apos;ll dream!
<br>We are still waiting for a FMB as for the Dserver but they are both WIP. We&apos;ll se, this game can only improve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617784">Expand</a></span>

Each of the planes has its very unique behaviour. It&apos;s not exactly easy to be successful in combat with those planes but when mastered it&apos;s rewarding. This sim is probably not for everyone. A good joystick + rudder pedals + Track-IR are a necessity. A fast PC and a good gaming monitor are necessary too. Graphics is simply stunning - great visibility of aircraft, great implementation of weather, clouds, fog, sunset and so on.
<br>
<br>The offline Campaign is not so great. Is serves its purpose but is lacking more depth. Night missions are great though. There are plenty of ground targets around. AAA gets interesting because of its visual effects. Light-beams may blind you. Trucks have lights on. The overall feeling is much better than during day missions when everything is black and white.
<br>
<br>This game is a great choice for seasoned flight simmers and WW2 enthusiasts. It&apos;s not too friendly to gamers new to this genre. But this will probably change over time when there is more community created content available including detailed tutorials with all the tricks.

<br>
<br>+ fantastic 3D plane models from the outside (never seen better in any sim out there).
<br>+ good FM for what it is (certainly much better than the old il2 or 1946)
<br>+ runs stable and smooth and hasn&apos;t any major bugs or technical flaws
<br>
<br>- the cockpits aren&apos;t nearly as sophisticated as they could be graphic wiese in 2014 (they are worse than Cliffs of Dovers which is 3 years on the marked...)
<br>- the map and the cities are lifeless and have not many details (i.e. rubble, telegraph poles, etc., again worse than Cliffs of Dovers)
<br>- no infantry, which is a shame for a game about one of the biggest infantry battles in history
<br>
<br>(-) if you dispice unlocks, well, the game has them (however no microtransactions or that sort of s***, thankfuly)
<br>(-) no clickable cockpits, for hardcore simer (like me) thats a real bummer
<br>(-) outdated graphics engine; I fear we will stick with the same graphical quality for quite a long time, which is a pitty considering this is an engine (digital nature engine) is already outdated today.
<br>
<br>And for the FM debate: you won&apos;t find a game in which everybody agrees about the flight model. There isn&apos;t just one. So imho you can ignore the FM debate, because for me as a long time simer I think it is well enough to immerse you into the world and enjoy the strengths (and weaknesses) of your plane.
<br>An F4 is the truly superiour plane than a LaGG. I don&apos;t know if it is correct to the last 5% but who knows? It certainly is sophisticated and far away from being arcade.
<br>
<br>I would give the game a 7.5 but will give it an 8 because is the game exactely what I wanted? No. But is it a good product for everyone to enjoy and did the devs sincerely try to release a good flight sim? Definitely yes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619652">Expand</a></span>

Much of the deficiencies in this sim since my first review have been corrected as I felt very confident that they would be. As of this date the biggest flaw in this sim is it&apos;s single player campaign and the still as of this writing lack of graphics options, however in that respect the graphics presets work very well on most user PCs.  The potential is there greater than it has ever been for the future of this sim. User content is being created in the form of missions and skins and there is new content in the works for BoS in the form of summer maps and an entirely new theater is also in the works, The Battle of Moscow, coming with 6 totally new aircraft and new variants of three other aircraft already in the sim.
<br>
<br>My current score of a 9 is a reflection of the positive changes to this sim that have been achieved and als a reflection of my confidence that the deficiencies that remain will be corrected to the satisfation of a majority of the simmers  who own this product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618613">Expand</a></span>

If you like random quick missions campaign, non-historic squads, air-quake MP, and xp points in your game....this might be for you.
<br>
<br>Could have been good, but BoS made too many bad decisions. Starting with the fact you have no custom graphics setting. Nope, you get presets. You have to be connected to the 777 master server for your profile and to play the SP campaign. In the campaign you cannot set a custom setting. You get two options.
<br>
<br>So the SP campaign BoS gives you is as follows:
<br>
<br>You pick your plane (no historic squad to choose). You pick an airfield (again not historic to plane type). No pilot name, no squad info. You pick between short (air start) or long (ground start). Now at plane setup, all your skins and &quot;upgrades&quot; (ie removed headrest, wing cannons for the 190) are &quot;locked&quot;. So you take off/or air start and you have a silly non-historic way point system. Your starting point. Your first way point. Your &quot;Action Point&quot;. And your &quot;Exit Point&quot;. Yes, your action point is where the enemy will spawn, where you have to shoot 2 planes (yes...you have to shoot 2 planes its in the briefing ). Your exit point is what you have to reach to have a successful mission. Now you can land or just hit ESC to end the mission. You will know this by the bright flashing text on your screen telling you. Then you get your XP points, and a little measure bar showing how much XP you got for the mission. You get enough you can unlock a skin or a new modification. No AAR report. No info on the front. Nothing else. Its that generic.
<br>
<br>Nothing dynamic. Nothing interesting. A snore fest.
<br>
<br>Now you will have to do this SP campaign to unlock anything for your planes. This includes people wanting to play online with unlocks. You are forced to play this shallow campaign in order to unlock things for online use. So not only do the SP players get screwed, but so the MP ones.
<br>
<br>Now, lets see what we can do in building our own missions and campaigns, since the devs gave us nothing on their end. Oh, never mind you cant. There is no full missions builder. It might come later, but no idea when. Nice.
<br>
<br>There is also the Digital Nature engine. A modified one used in RoF. Considering large amounts of air/ground cannot be made with it, this concerns me. Without having access to the Full Mission Builder, its not known what can be done with it. It seems so far that massive battles are not possible. Small scale is what you will have to deal with. Thats not for me.
<br>
<br>Spent money on Early Access of BoS in hopes that it would continue the IL2 series. It didnt. It went far to make sure it didnt. MAYBE in 6month to a year it would be worth it. As it is right now it does not offer anything that I enjoy in my sims from IL2 orginal modded to CLoD TF modded.
<br>
<br>If you are like me, wait. Then wait some more until modders make this game enjoyable. Then see if it has made any progress.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617731">Expand</a></span>

<br>BoS is the game that killed the I2 series. Jason Williams literally came to 1c and convinced them to cancel development on Il2; Battle of Moscow. The true successor to the Il2 series made by Il2 developers. Jason Williams is someone with no background in flight sims, someone who worked for a hardware manufacturer and saw an opportunity in buying NeoGB &#x2013; a company that made a WW1 flight sim.
<br>
<br>Under Jasons brilliant guidance, the renamed NeoGB started making DLC the likes of which that would make bethesda with their horse armor envious. He managed to milk the ww1 flight sim fans, at east the fanatic ones, for all they were worth. And in the process drove off all the hard core simmers, thanks to his complete disregard for historically accurate performance.
<br>
<br>Now this Jason Williams is tainting the Il2 name, one of the most esteemed in all of combat flight simming, by making a game that follows the lead of Rise of Flight. One filled with micro-transactions, with little care given to historical flight performance and no care given to the machines used at stalingrad. This is a game where the 190 is given free reign over stalingrad, even though it never served there. While the iconic Ju-52, which played a vital role at stalingrad is simply absent&#x2026; I think some of this has to do with what planes will sell to the &#x201C;light sim&#x201D; audience 777 is targeting.
<br>
<br>For everyone who is reading about this game and might be thinking &#x201C;this is a sequel to Il2&#x2033; &#x2013; it is not. This is a cash grab by a developer who has shown a clear disdain for its community time and time again. A developer who cares more about making 1.99 off of colored scarves rather then updating the flight models of aircraft that are clearly inaccurate (they said it was too hard to do and their engine made changing fms impossible, but they added altimeters for money!
<br>
<br>I think this article is a case of PC world not having enough experience to properly rate something as specialized as a flight sim. They hear the BS of the developers and take it a face value, whereas the flight sims fans already know the story.
<br>
<br>As a long time CFS (combat flight sim) and most of all, an Il2 fan, please don&#x2019;t buy this game. It is a disgrace to the Il2 name, a fast and cheap money grab that takes advantage of people from lighter sims, like War thunder and World of Warplanes, to make money. This is IL2 dragged through the mud, with bad physics thrown in, and microtrnasactions tossed in.
<br>
<br>This is a game made by a man wanting money, with no love or care for aviation, let alone ww2. Dont give opportunists like this your money</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619097">Expand</a></span>

The DCS model is well regarded by the flight sim community and I would say il2 BOS is at least on a par with DCS on that issue.  The developers have concentrated on the flying aspect of the game rather than every button and switch like DCS.  This will appeal to many, particularly those new to the genre.  BTW I like WW2 DCS models as well, when I am in the mood for detail.  At the moment BOS is better than DCS with the range of aircraft, ground attack targets (moving vehicles) and graphics.
<br>
<br>Ignore the haters (what is all that about!!??) and try this title if you are a WW2 flight sim enthusiast.  More upside than down side.  Is it perfect, no, what game is?  Is it very good?  Yes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619603">Expand</a></span>

The unlocks are nearly all minor items that were rare at the time so they shouldn&apos;t affect your enjoyment of the game even if you don&apos;t want to play through the campaign. Currently waiting for the release of the dedicated server and mission builder, both of which have been promised by the developers.

<br>
<br>Starting with eye candy it is really top notch, really good atmosphere and feeling of cold Stalingrad and planes are really beautiful. Same goes with sounds, they are working.
<br>
<br>Flight model feels like flying, not going on rails. Every plane has a very unique feeling and are fun to fly. Damage model is on good level, planes taking hits and damage on different parts of plane depending on hits taken.
<br>
<br>AI is using same flight models than player which is good. AI is decent at the moment and gets job done most of the times. Although it could use some work still and it will be improved further in future updates.
<br>
<br>There are quick mission builder, separate missions and campaign available to the single player. QMB is working tool for testing and quick fights with AI up to the 16 planes. Separate missions include 14 different kind of missions at the moment.
<br>
<br>Campaign is not a traditional career type. There are 5 chapters in campaign and you progress through them by flying succesful missions and  gathering experience points in the process. Experience points unlock wide variety of new features for planes. They range from new cannons and bombs to additional armour. You can choose every time different plane and different type of mission on any stage of the campaign. It is working quite well for what it is. I would prefer career type campaign but still I have played current one with great pleasure. Missions generated have been very fun to play, I have played it through already and still keep flying. Hopefully at some stage game gets proper career campaign but this is a good start.
<br>
<br>Overall its been a good experience past year from early access to first release. Development is going to continue, foundation is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618114">Expand</a></span>

The most realistic feeling of flight without actually getting into a WW2 aircraft and bodes well for when Oculus Rift&apos;s CV1 is released to realise new levels of immersion that can only be dreamed off.

<br>Quite simply the best.</span>

<br>It&apos;s not an arcade game although it can have some simplified controls if you wish. So don&apos;t expect a Warthunder experience. Expect more!
<br>I can only recommend using a joystick for this game, and if you can afford it, a HOTAS + TrackIR.
<br>Awesome game with a great community. I&apos;m sure developers will expand the plane selection and maps in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619152">Expand</a></span>

The crash landings are done really well. The sounds are also really well done. The Flight Models are pretty good. Flying the campaign in full real can be pretty intense. The bad: MP only via their test servers, no mission builder, SP campaign could be better. Overall synopsis, this still runs way smoother and has less bugs than CLOD. The flight models and difficulties almost get to the CLOD level and this can be played in full real. If they add a dynamic campaign that I can play online with friends, add a mission builder, forget the points and unlocks, then this could easily be a 9. Until then I think a 6 is fair.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4627931">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good ..........
<br>We have good graphics especially at night dawn and dusk .
<br>decent sound but needs work on impact sounds on aircraft .
<br>Good quick mission builder. Easy to use .
<br>Good flight models tweak your joystick settings .
<br>eight aircraft to choose from with tail gunners for multiplayer .
<br>Large map .
<br>Easy setup GUI.
<br>Good for the new comer to flight sims .
<br>
<br>The Bad ........
<br>poor campaign and the unlocks ,
<br>no ground war going on ,historical
<br>no squadron historical
<br>no pilot ranks historical
<br>no real history to connect too .
<br>Basic hit boxes on FM .
<br>visuals in combat ..seem  Arcaded
<br>
<br>The Ugly........
<br>Unlocks .
<br>
<br>For me it&apos;s all about history , this is nothing like Rise of flight , were you had good campaigns and real mission history involved . Squadrons , pilot skins ect , ect .... The more I play this game the more frustrated I become , of what should of been , could of been . Shouldn&apos;t of been .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4846083">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I do see potential, but frankly I am just not playing the game and the reaction to the playerbase by the developers is troubling. Overall it is probably the best game I will not play and I think at least has had a positive effect of moving people to Cliffs of Dover. Keep in mind I have flown in excess of 1500 organized Multiplayer missions in the original il-2 as pilot Lipfert.
<br>
<br>If they are going to force a single player unlock system on you, then they really should had made it a very interesting experience. The word on the street is it is frustratingly boring in it&apos;s present form and I have basically been in a holding pattern.
<br>
<br>I am giving this a 5, because of the reaction from the development team during the release to the playbase in question. Will give an updated review in one month and see if anything interesting develops.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4761960">Expand</a></span>

<br>Very good with the exception of forced SSAO and other postprocessing. There are NO custom settings. Just 3 console like presets. Workarounds to switch off SSAO&apos;s and other PP have been actively stopped and patched by Devs.
<br>
<br>--SINGLE PLAYER-- 2/10
<br>
<br>Game features unlockable field modifications for your aircraft. These apply in SP &amp; MP. You need to grind your way through them if you want to use them in MP which is not much fun at all.
<br>
<br>There is NO traditional campaign with a backstory, continual career progress or medals. Only a quick mission builder and &quot;campaign&quot;.
<br>
<br>The &quot;campaign&quot; is a simplified quick mission builder. A series of disjointed, generated missions. You choose your side, airplane, airfield, mission type &amp; duration for each mission. The only purpose of this is so you can grind through to earn XP to unlock aforementioned unlockable field mods. Without exception, every mission has 4 waypoints.
<br>
<br>1. Start at Airfield (or in air)
<br>2. Enter &quot;Mission&quot;
<br>3. Target Area
<br>4 . Exit &quot;Mission&quot;
<br>
<br>The waypoint system enforces the XP grinding system - you need to fly through waypoints to earn XP. You earn XP only on easy or realistic difficulty. The custom setting doesn&apos;t give you any XP points.
<br>
<br>Many people didn&apos;t like this fun killing feature that was introduced at release (not being there during early access). So they set their plane at autopilot and 16x time compression and let the pc do the grind for them.
<br>
<br>At the same time the devs decided to reduce time compression to 2x maximum(!). These 2 events are apparently unrelated. However this made auto-grinding unfeasible and also makes the flight through waypoints on longer missions (more XP) boring.
<br>
<br>A &quot;Autopilot off when enemy is near&quot; feature would have made more sense.
<br>
<br>All of the above makes singleplayer in it&apos;s current form an utterly boring experience.
<br>
<br>--THE COMING MISSION EDITOR-- ?
<br>
<br>There is light at the end of the tunnel however as a proper Mission Editor is in the works. It will allow players to script, place objectives, waypoints, etc. When this tool is released, new and complex missions are expected to be released by members of the community, with one already in existence.
<br>
<br>It is a sad new paradigm where the players have to do the devs job to bring about a creative campaign. And don&apos;t have the tools to do it at release none the less.
<br>
<br>--MULTI PLAYER-- 7/10
<br>
<br>Multiplayer can be good solid fun, especially on a good server and with friends. There is no dedicated server tool for all players yet(will be in future) to host their own server so current choice is limited.
<br>
<br>BoS can host a limited number of players on a server. Originaly 64, then reduced to 32 and now again lifted to a slightly larger number of 48. Don&apos;t expect 100 player servers any time soon.
<br>
<br>--FLIGHT MODEL-- 6.5/10
<br>
<br>The flight model received a lot of praise and part of it is justified. The game recreates a feeling of flight like no other. Visual and audio clues give you a feeling like you&apos;re in the air. Alas - you&apos;re in the wrong aircraft. The feeling of flight is based on the dev&apos;s previous work on Rise of Flight and it does show. The airplanes feel like they are 500KG and not 2500KG. Your airplane rarely stays still. It&apos;s constantly jittering as if it had partially and asymmetrically deployed flaps (or indeed was a light airplane) The planes from WW2 were more then capable to fly in a straight line without jittering, the thrust to weight of these planes,and their design and construction allowed for it. Watch a POV flight video that had a properly mounted camera (no vibration) and you&apos;ll see what I mean.
<br>
<br>In short you always feel like you&apos;re in turbulence, which is appealing to some people but doesn&apos;t reflect reality of what it was like to fly a metal plane at 400kmh. The actual turbulence and wind is however nicely modeled, it&apos;s just that it never completely goes away for one second.
<br>
<br>There are squabbles over roll rates, turn circles and climbing performance of various planes, but that&apos;s the way it is with every sim.
<br>
<br>--DAMAGE MODEL-- 6/10
<br>
<br>Eye candy. Lots of smoke, lots of explosions, fire, etc. But it is effects for the sake of physical/historical accuracy. Machine gun fire lights up fuesalages. Single cannon round hits cause critical damage where they wouldn&apos;t and every other hit results in some sort of smoke coming of the enemy a/c. It&apos;s nice to look at, but not very accurate.
<br>
--SUMMARY--

I&apos;ve played the original IL2 Sturmovik. I was hoping for this to be a continuation of the IL2 spirit. It&apos;s not. I&apos;m disillusioned.  A lot of good features have been forcibly taken out and fun killing features introduced for no reason.

If you&apos;ve been expecting a new il2 sturmovik then this is not the game for you.

If you&apos;re new to the genre and want a good place to start or coming from WT then yes this is a good game to get started.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785085">Expand</a></span>

<br>About the AI, they are not that challenging. But difficulty is not what I want to criticize.
<br>There&apos;s no communication between you and the AI.
<br>Of course you can order them to attack or cover, but to do that, first you need to memorize all the shortcuts.
<br>Also it seems like AI don&apos;t know how to attack ground targets. They use guns rather than drop bombs.
<br>This game force you to play campaign to unlock things(which is ridiculous), but the campaign is boring.

<br>I would say the only WW2 game worth your time. Excellent  flight model and graphics. Good enough damage model. Im realy enjoing this game now !</span>

<br>
<br>OK, I&apos;ll tell you more: BoS in 100 words or less
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s set in WW2, 1942, in Russia, with planes from Germany flying against planes from Russia. You can buy a version with 8 planes for 50 bucks/Euros, or with ten planes for 90 bucks/Euros. You can play in either &#x2018;normal&#x2019; or expert mode. Normal mode is like War Thunder Arcade mode, and Expert mode is like Realistic mode, just even more realistic.
<br>
<br>The Stalingrad map is flat, white, and snowy, with flat, white snowy bits, and icy rivers. And snow. Great for framerates on older PCs, a bit boring after you have flown over it a few times.
<br>
<br>You love War Thunder/World of Warplanes, so why would you buy this?
<br>
<br>If you have a gaming PC, mouse and a joystick (needs programmable joystick), you have 50+ bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and are looking for a more &#x2018;realistic&#x2019; flight game than WT/WOW, this could be worth a look.
<br>
<br>But buy it on sale. For what you get, it is overpriced: 8-10 aircraft and you are forced to play the crappy offline campaign in order to be able to get all the aircraft options in multiplayer. Seriously dumb idea, ruins an otherwise good flight game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4922966">Expand</a></span>

It is an excellent sim, the graphics are outstanding, the planes and atmosphere are almost photo-realistic. What I like most about it is the sense of height and speed they were able to create. If you don&#x2019;t have the hud on or you&apos;re not looking at your altimeter you can pretty much tell how high you are by the level of detail provided on the ground. The map is huge, and there is a lot to do. For instance if you are doing a ground support mission (my favorite) on the way to the mission point you might come across a flight of bombers and their escorts and you can engage and then continue with your mission, once you are done with the mission on the way back there might be a train or an airfield you come across. It really seems as if there is a larger battle going on and you are just a part of it. People say the campaign is repetitive, but i don&#x2019;t think so at all. There is 5 planes to choose from on both sides and 6 different types of missions. Now you can do the same mission in the same plane twice and the objectives will be different. Not to mention if you were a real pilot you would probably be doing the same thing most days. The planes are incredibly detailed, and each one is unique in response. I think they handle great, it actually feels like being in a prop plane. The biggest complaint i hear is the dlc and the unlocks,. Personally I kind of like the unlocks, it gives you a sense of accomplishment not found in a lot of flight sims. But I can see both sides of the argument. Flight sim fans don&#x2019;t buy games to be video gamey if that makes sense, and unlockables are definitely video gamey. As far as the dlc, i like to judge games on what i bought, not what is available so i cant really comment. Although In dcs you have to buy every plane and this comes with 10 planes. Any fan of flight sims or ww2 should check this out in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244346">Expand</a></span>

As there&apos;s a lot of Russian flight games and simulators out there, i wouldn&apos;t be impressed if, for example, Gajin, the most unprofessional company someone can imagine, making accounts just to bash this awesome title to make kids think his arcade and bs of game is better than the best simulator one can fly.
<br>
<br>And as i can see here, there are a lot of kids, that looks that were expecting an easy game, like warthunder, and awesomly expecting better graphics. Maybe they just have potato pc&apos;s because i can&apos;t understand how someone can talk bad about the looking of this sim. And this sim looked perfect even when i had a potato pc, so i don&apos;t understand what they are saying...
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s focus on the important. A comercial pilot student, friend of mine, recommended me the IL-2 Cliffs of Dover as the best sim he has ever flown. Then we saw Battle of Stalingrad and bought it instantly as he told me wonderful things about it.
<br>And he can&apos;t be more right. This title has the best physics i have ever tested in a flight simulator. Amazingly accurate stalls, airflow flight models, and landing gear physics. It has he best damage model i have ever seen. Awesome graphics, from terrain, to models, to even smoke, chemtrails, and fire effects and explosions.
<br>
<br>I have flown flight simulators since a lot of years now. With decent peripherals as the Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog and saitek rudder pedals with Track IR can be. Flown from the FSX on the old days, to DCS World and a lot of the IL-2 titles.
<br>
<br>And all i can say is, 1C Game Studios have done the best flight simulators i have ever flown.
<br>
<br>FSX is outdated af. Complex integration of the comercial planes internal systems, with interactive cockpits, but too simple physics, and graphics that are harmfull to the eyes.
<br>
<br>DCS World has decent flight models, simple but decent. Miles away from IL-2. The good point are the interactive cockpits, the third party companies doing modules, and therefore more varety of planes.  But then you have the problem of having some planes, without their rivals of the era. An important fact here is that this is focused as a modern jet flight sim, and not as a WW2 flight sim as IL-2 is.
<br>The graphics? Well, even with the 1.5 update, they still have the explosions and fire effects from Lock-On, a sim from 2003. And the damage model is bs. P-51&apos;s laughing at half of a 30mm Bf 109 K-4 mag. This simulator is focused on dominating the systems of modern jets, not for doing dogfights. Also each module costs around 60&#x20AC;, that is what Battle of Stalingrad cost on release.
<br>
<br>IL-2? Well, i said already the most important things. Best physics i have ever flown. Looking on pair with DCS World 1.5, with fire and explosions miles from dcs. The best damage model i have ever seen, come on search videos on youtube about the damage model of this game, you will go crazy. Wings bending, parts flying, planes breaking in 1000 pieces...
<br>IMHO this sim could just be improved by adding interactive cockpits, but as kids today just want easy games, this would limit the market. And also, maybe more planes, although the most used ones are implemented, and to add more planes they should add more factions like the Brits or the US, and wouldn&apos;t make sense on the Battle of Stalingrad, as thos nations weren&apos;t involved in this battle. They are close to the release of Battle of Moscow, where they are adding appart from more planes to the german and ussr factions, an american p-40 for the allies, and a italian MC-202 for the germans.
<br>
<br>I would love to fly the Spitfires again on a more updated 1C Game Studios engine, and also americans like a P-15 or thunderbolts, along with germans on for example the Battle of the Ruhr. I would be the happiest man of the world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/il-2-sturmovik-battle-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=5663106">Expand</a></span>
