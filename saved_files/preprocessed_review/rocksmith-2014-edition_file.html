Most obvious is the improved song list, with more mainstream rock hits over the general indie flavor of the original (although I still ended up liking much of the original&apos;s song list). The reworked gameplay looked kind of suspect at first but is vastly superior, adding support for palm muted chords, oblique bends, and even pinch harmonics (which I still can&apos;t figure out how to play). And the menu. The original&apos;s menu was absolutely horrible. Now it looks like an actual menu! If I had to knock the game any, I&apos;d say that the missions become obviously random very quickly, like asking me to play a new song when I&apos;ve already played every song I have. The note detection, while improved, still is slightly flawed, most noticeably so in drop D power chords, and while &quot;true tuning&quot; is great, it&apos;s kind of a pain to have to retune my guitar so often. Overall though, Rocksmith 2014 is about as good as possible, and while not perfect, it&apos;s still pretty darn great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3741756">Expand</a></span>

If you are new to Rocksmith make sure you flip the strings so that red is on the bottom, so that it will be easier to read tab and music notation in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773922">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Having spent close to 200 hours with the original Rocksmith I wasn&apos;t hesitant in pre-ordering the 2014 edition for almost the songs alone. While the original had some flaws, 2014 addresses all the major ones, improves the game in every way &amp; adds some great new modes. I&apos;ve seen some complaints on having to pay around $10 to import the songs from the original Rocksmith (the dlc from the first transfers for free), but I think it&apos;s understandable due to the licencing fees. Also it came as a welcome surprise that all the original songs have been redone, benefiting from the improved techniques such as improved bends, and have become more accurate to the original arrangement.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve ever wanted to learn guitar or bass or need the motivation to improve I&apos;d suggest Rocksmith 2014 as an additional aid as well as being great fun once you&apos;ve become comfortable with them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3665103">Expand</a></span>

On my PC the audio latency has been reduced to near-zero (hooray!) and the revised tab makes bends and finger positions much clearer. The riff repeater functionality has gotten a major overhaul as well and is implemented in a vastly superior manner (allowing you to jump right into the repeater at any given moment). But perhaps the most important function that the game has is a genuine ability to motivate and make the often tedious initial work in learning guitar much more engaging and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3666671">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>It&apos;s true, this is the fastest way to learn guitar. I had the original Rocksmith and the new 2014 version improves in ALL the areas the original had flaws in. Before playing this game, I did not know how to play electric guitar. After playing this game, I can now feel confident with tabs I find online and jam with my friends in real life.</span>

I also send my daughter to private lessons and can tell you that she may know more about the theory and reading music but Rocksmith keeps her interested as a side practice after she finished her formal lesson homework... it helps her greatly with coordination and being able to quickly change chord positions. And while I plan to continue lessons for a while more for her. I have spend nearly $2000 in private lessons and when you compare that expense to a $59 Rocksmith how do you give this any less then 9 stars? Learning guitar takes years and THOUSANDS of hours of practice... people that don&apos;t think this delivers are just not willing to invest the time and work hard for it. And here&apos;s the deal, they took the first version and made improvements based on player feedback, what more can you ask for, and for only $10 they let you transfer your music with upgraded features in each song. you get 50+ songs per game and they have somewhere around 200 songs in total you can get and they now committed to weekly content updates.
<br>
<br>Also the requirements on the PC are pretty light, if you have having issues or performance problems, you must have a really old crappy virus infected PC... I have a 5 year old Lenovo laptop that runs this game perfectly with zero lag.
<br>
<br>Finally, you can&apos;t call this a game.. it&apos;s an educational/training software program... they could have just as easily charged $499 and sold it in Guitar Center and it would have flow off the shelf.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3713594">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes if you want to learn guitar you have to learn from other sources too,however having this will improve your playing greatly.
<br>
<br>Get some lessons either from a teacher or online and buy Rocksmith 2014,you will thank me for it.</span>

<br>
<br>But the poor sound captation qualitiy and the too permissive system made the experience respectively frustrating and superficial.
<br>
<br>Frustrating when you try hard to play a riff as perfect as possible and you got it half wrong cause the game don&apos;t capture your palm muted chord, and finally forced you to play clear chords to be sure not to fail.
<br>
<br>Superficial when you realize it&apos;s not able to distinguish any nuance, and when playing notes out of time is not sanctioned (as opposed to GH or Rockband). As a result, if you want 100% accuracy on a song, it&apos;s quite easy: just play all notes clear (no muting nor ghost notes) using tremolo picking method from beginning to end.
<br>
<br>So, a good game to practice with fun, and learn some songs quickly. But a wrong choice to really learn to play the guitar and practice seriously and rigorously.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326293">Expand</a></span>

I knew no chords, techniques or anything else when I began using this software. I tried self teaching when I was a teenager with no success and gave up inside a few months of goofing of on the acoustic I had. Now, 20 years later, I can see that I will be able to play once I simply put in the practice. Calling this a game is an insult to the creators. It is tutorial software at it&apos;s best and most entertaining. The mini-games (guitarcade) teach you basic skills without you even realizing and the songs ramp up at reasonable pace. The inclusion of lessons with actual human tutorials helps with the basics although sometimes they move a little quick with the practice riffs (string bending lesson has you try a riff where  of the notes are bends right after you learn how to do your first one) or explanations (harmonics explanation was a bit confusing and I ended up going online to figure it out).
<br>
<br>I have not been able to put this away since I started. I&apos;m only about 2 weeks in and I am so excited with my progress. Keep in mind it takes work and dedication; this isn&apos;t Guitar Hero! I play every night for an hour and a half after work and the rate that you see improvement is truly incredible. Supplement this with some online tutorials and you will be on a fast track to playing guitar in a span of time that no one ever thought possible. I can see myself playing a full song or two by the end of the month. Think about that, one month and you could be playing a handful of your favorite rock songs on guitar! I think their &quot;60 day challenge&quot; is set up for those out there that are less motivated than myself. If you use this an hour a day for 60 days and can&apos;t play at least one song, you are doing something wrong.
<br>
<br>I do have a couple quibbles. I wish there was a tutorial on reading the songs in actual musical notation and/or tab. As it is, you are learning to play in a new form of musical notation, &quot;Rocksmith&quot; notation. I realize it will not take much to translate once I am better, but I wish the game helped with that transition, since pretty much everything else is covered. I can&apos;t really take any points for not including more in a game with so much. I refuse to take away points because more could have been done; more can always be done!
<br>Another small issue I have is the way which the auto-detect difficulty works at times. You start playing well, so it throws more notes at you, which in turn makes you stumble and miss pretty much everything as you stare at your fretting hand and strumming hand, trying to grasp where your fingers need to be (especially when a new chord comes at you). Meanwhile, all the notes are rolling past and you are missing them. Then, just as you are about to get the hang of that new chord placement, it drops the difficulty back down (because you missed so many notes while staring at your hands) and those new chords disappear. Just a little annoying and you can actually shut the ramping difficulty off and take things at your own pace, but I like the computer being in charge of that because it has a tenancy to push me when I did not even realize I was ready for that push. Again, I can&apos;t take away any points for this because you can control whether you want the feature on or off; the choice in yours and I&apos;m thankful they included that choice.
<br>
<br>So, in conclusion, this is probably the best way to learn to play if you can&apos;t get a private tutor, which most of us can&apos;t. It moves at a good pace and once you dig into the options menu (be sure to check thoroughly on the riff repeater menu) you will find that you have a lot more control of your play than just picking up and running with it. Not that that is not a bad idea! The stock settings are great, but when you start to use the riff repeater to go at your own pace and really hit those hard sections, you will move even faster. Supplement this software with some online tutorials to get a little more information and you will see yourself progress that much faster. Also notice that the only people who gave this a low mark had problems getting the software or hardware (cable) to run correctly. My guess would be most of these are actually user errors or problems within their own computers, not with the software itself. Go get this game if you have ever thought about playing guitar!!! You will not be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3859406">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lag was a serious issue for me, after I owned the game about 3 months. It seemed random and eventually got to the point where I couldn&apos;t even finish a song. I tried the recommended set ups, but nothing really seemed to fix the issue. Until, I saw an old post that told me how to install the game to my 360&apos;s hard drive. Believe it or not, that seems to have solved all of the latency issues. Zero crashes since I installed it to my hard drive.
<br>
<br>As a game it is a 10. As it is the cheapest method to learn how to play guitar and it really works (even for a lefty). I gave it a 5 because of the frustration in finding out that the best way to solve the latency, and thus crashing issues was to install the disc to my 360&apos;s hard drive. I have owned the game about 11 months now. And once installed to your hard drive, it is fantastic. Sadly I took me 10 1/2 months to find out it needs to be installed to the hard drive. So I recommend, just skipping having to use a game disc and buying it from the Xbox Store, as a digital copy.  I hope my 3rd revision and review on this game will help my fellow gamer&apos;s and guitar enthusiasts to not go through the latency frustration and wasted learning time I went though.
<br>
<br>The game is great, buy it if you want to learn to play guitar. Just install it to your hard drive.  And since the Xbox One forces you to install games to the hard drive, you shouldn&apos;t have any lag issues on it. Although using a different sound system than your game console is highly recommended. I.E. surround sound, or a stereo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3981009">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Length of Ownership:  6 weeks.
<br>
<br>I purchased this game/learning tool (G/LT) to spice up my practice and (hopefully) learn something new.  Having played guitar for over 40 years and possessing more than 20 years online gaming experience, I felt confident that I could find a way to make this software work on PC with reasonable results despite its game console (PS, X-Box, etc.) heritage.  Boy was I Wrong.
<br>
<br>Platform:  Win 7 Pro, intel Core i7, dedicated Radeon Graphics, 6GB RAM.
<br>
<br>Guitar:  1977 Les Paul Custom
<br>
<br>Cans:  Shure SRH-440
<br>
<br>Installation:  Ordinarily installation of any complex and interactive software requires more than a single attempt.  I have installed and re-installed the software At Least FOUR times.  The requirements to install the software, create an account with UbiSoft and register the software are cumbersome at best.  Moreover, despite its relatively recent release date, registering unique user account names is equally unwieldy.
<br>
<br>Logging In:  Once the G/LT is started and the PK confirmed, a second login is required by UbiSoft for the Profile Created and the ability to utilize web-based content and tools.  Having written SAS code for over 20 years, SQL code for more than 10 and possessing over 20 years writing macros for every kind of software imaginable, this is overkill.  Given the sophistication of the software, RS2014&apos;s programmers should be able to make this game start with a simple double-click by merely linking the software and PK to the MAC address on the host PC.  This is but one of the tell-tale signs of this G/LT as gaming-platform software.
<br>
<br>Game Play:  RS 2014 purports itself to be both a game and a learning tool, but fills neither role particularly well.  As a game, it awards points and level advancement based on (seemingly) arbitrary ability to hit particular notes as they approach on the interface.  In order to advance in the game and begin learning more complex pieces, the player must successfully pass through a series of &quot;lessons&quot; the software deems appropriate given performance on particular tracks the user has accessed.
<br>
<br>Learning Tool:  I have been playing Iron Maiden&apos;s &quot;The Trooper&quot; for over 25 years (note for note on all rhythm parts confirmed by multiple tabs I have read) but have never had a tremendous amount of success with the solo phrasing.  After going through the track in game about 4 times, I was assigned a lesson regarding &quot;position changes.&quot;  Similarly, I have played Rush&apos;s &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; since 1982 but have always felt my execution of the signature riff needed polish.  After half a dozen runs playing every note (again confirmed by multiple tabs acquired over the years), I was assigned a lesson for &quot;bends.&quot;  (The only bends in the track are in the solo, many of which require a trem which I don&apos;t have on my LPC).
<br>
<br>Downloadable Play Content (DPC):  Being a Huge Rush fan, I wanted to make use of the 5-song expansion pack.  While I know the overwhelming majority of the tracks note-for-note, but in need of polish, I purchased it online as at Least One of the THREE websites regarding the pack stated that it was compatible with RS2014.  Having non-backwardly compatible expansion packs is yet another of the tell-tale signs this is gaming platform software.  This is something one would expect from Microsoft after 4 new iterations of MS Office, not something one would expect from a second-generation G/LT.

<br>The Bottom Line:  While RS 2014 is the Best $50 guitar lesson one would ever hope to buy, it is neither a jack of all trades nor a master of one.  The installation and login procedures are more cumbersome than logging into a Swiss bank&apos;s accounts database and the AI intended to assist guitar players in improving knowledge, technique and skills is lack luster at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3925256">Expand</a></span>

Some of it is very simple, but there are other areas that were made extremely difficult.  I just finished a lesson on palm mutes, for bass, then they go to a practice track that is so fast a beginner is lost before it really starts.  They could of very easily built up to that type of speed or at least allowed the &quot;riff repeater&quot; to be used on it.
<br>Session mode wants me to play chord tones on the down beat for 20 minutes, but after 30 minutes of playing has not recorded a single minute.  If I&apos;m not playing it correctly there needs to be some help from the game/software.
<br>As you progress through the &quot;missions&quot; there is a little box that tells you what your missions are but only there for a bit then it goes in to advertising (telling you what new songs you can buy) mode so if you miss it, you must click on another option then go back to see what they are.
<br>When playing &quot;Return to Castle Chordread&quot; it is very hit and miss you can play a chord clean and it will not register and other times it will use a chord played as two different chords.
<br>Long and short of this is that is can help you learn guitar, but there are so many problems that should have been addressed before release.
<br>For $80 I feel a little ripped off.  If you want to complain on &quot;STEAM.COM&quot; which you must use, it is a nightmare to log in to, and customer service is a concept that they have never heard of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986248">Expand</a></span>

It was impossible to get the sounds working with my setup (motherboard with integrated Realtek soundcard, Creative SoundBlaster Z soundcard). Despite several attempts with different drivers, trying all the Ubisoft tips for editing the .ini file, disabling the other soundcard, even removing the Creative soundcard altogether, the in-game sound just would not work. The sound in the loading phase still works, but when inside the game, eternal silence. This is the only program where sounds do not function (including 100+ games and several audio tools installed on my machine), so it definitely has something to do with how the game handles audio. Before buying, pay a visit to a search engine and ensure that your setup does not match the ones that have had this problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893984">Expand</a></span>

Makes me feel as if I am in one of my map editors when using the tool to slow down speed and select witch parts to repeat with some other tools. I feel as though my skill in learning to play is improving already but something like this cannot be tought over night so it&apos;s gonna take weeks or if years to learn but I have the time and I feel I will get alot better. There is a tool out on the internet where you can build your own musics and then put them into the game so you can learn to play them too with your guitar witch is fascinating. The toner tool inside the trainer is real cool, maybe not the best but it works cool.
<br>
<br>Its very cool to see for the first time my guitar being plugged into a computer and working flawlessly. The stickers that came with the installation disc along with the cord help a bunch. There are quite a lot of DLC&apos;s for this training program but with all them tallied up costs a fortune, have to be a millionaire these days to buy all of them. UBISOFT really put the protection on it super hard, harder than any other program I ever seen yet, supposedly you need steam and uplay installed and running at once for it to launch and work correctly witch is a huge downer but I can see why with all the special tools and everything in game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good trainer, definitely has my vote on that. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3887608">Expand</a></span>

I had a great experience. best game ever. Also i love the added football mechanics, the ball floating into the net had superb quality. Finally all rockstars suck apart from me as i can play 2 notes in 10 seconds on a REAL guitar.</span>

As you may guess, i bought Rocksmith 2014. As a Gamer, you should find games that you could get the most of it (challenge, fun, learning, re-play, etc), Custom songs are just another Big feature to get into.

Downloadable content always makes sure you have something to play, that you WANT to play. I just wish there was more. Its more of a learning tool than a game so although I appreciate it and stil use it. The only time i&apos;m really haveing fun is when i&apos;ve masterd a song and jamming to it as hard as my black little heart can bare.  The rest of the time.

<br>
<br>First, it is damn near impossible, it seems, to get the visual and audio to synch without having to restart the game 20 times (it&apos;s too delicate to change latency without making you restart the whole thing).
<br>
<br>Second, I&apos;m already a musician, just new to guitar. I know I&apos;m in tempo and have the correct fingerings, but it still just says MISS so I can&apos;t figure out why it&apos;s failing my chord. Occassionally it will give me a little arrow indicating I am possibly out of tune. But would it be too much to ask to say it thinks I&apos;m early? Late? Missed a string? Something. ANYTHING to help me determine whether it&apos;s an audio/video latency issue or an actual performance (mine) problem.
<br>
<br>Last. I just want to punch the voiceover guy. The point of the game is to learn, but if you do less than 70% or so, the feedback is very negative. &quot;Not so good.&quot; &quot;Poor performance.&quot; &quot;Disappointing.&quot; You know what? F^&amp;k you Rocksmith. I&apos;m trying to learn and you&apos;re not encouraging me at all, your belittling me and that&apos;s a real sh*tty approach to teaching.
<br>
<br>Great concept. Poor execution. And I&apos;m crying BS to anyone who claims to have to learned to play well solely from this game. $2.99 for a single song in DLC is also highway robbery. It could be worse though - you could be playing the PS4 version which makes this look like a miracle of technology. I do not recommend this game for beginners. Go spend $20 - $30 bucks for a real lesson with real feedback and actual starter chords without the shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7325428">Expand</a></span>

<br>Correction: &#x201C;Rocksmith is the fastest way to be upset while learning guitar&#x201D;
<br>
<br>There are a lot of good features in RockSmith 2014, and yet it is missing the most basic tool when learning an instrument. What the developers of a Video Game have done, is what they do best &#x2026; made a video game.
<br>
<br>This isn&#x2019;t an instructional tool. Its biggest flaw is the missing TABs (what my noob self would have called the music sheet.) Rocksmith assumes that you are a novice user assuming you have being playing guitar for at least 2-3 months+. Often assuming that you can keep up the pace, and if you can&#x2019;t &#x201C;ce est votre probl&#xE8;me, ce ne est pas mon probl&#xE8;me.&#x201D; This leads to the constant stopping and starting which means you spend more than half your time on your mouse/controller rather than you guitar. A truly frustrating experience.

<br>Of course you can change speeds and other little tricks, but still for the beginner this is a useless tool. I went to the forums and suggested an idea and the general consensus was that Rocksmith could use and added feature, but won&#x2019;t be coming to 2014 edition. After a bit of debate I realise that it need a music sheet.
<br>
<br>So I took to the internet looking for a solution which I found in Guitar Pro or TuxGuitar which creates music sheets (Tabs) of the songs you are playing. Suddenly Rocksmith became really useful, as I could learn the whole song gently in my own pace with Guitar Pro or TuxGuitar and come back to RockSmith to learn the song and its timings. The track in the back ground help with you building a mental picture of how the song should sound while keeping it highly entertaining, ironically what Guitar Pro or TuxGuitar are missing as features.
<br>
<br>Rocksmith makes learning the guitar entertaining, but only if you know how to play the guitar in the first place. While I can&#x2019;t say that it&#x2019;s bad, I can say there is room for improvement! If Rocksmith, Guitar Pro, and TuxGuitar collaborated then I could see the final result being the all-time best tool for learning the guitar.
<br>
<br>But the biggest crime here, is Ubisoft and their customer relations. I sent off a suggestion to them and still a month later have yet to receive even an acknowledgement of the email. As a customer how can you endorse a company that completely blanks you as worthless? It seems standard practise for Ubisoft &#x201C;This is your problem, this is not my Problem.&#x201D; just seems to ring too true&#x2026; which such a shame.
<br>
<br>Update:
<br>I emailed my suggestion (the above) to Ubisoft on the 24/01/2015 @ 15:58.
<br>This review I posted today (05/03/2015 at roughly 1:30pm).
<br>I got a email reply today (05/03/2015 @ 15:13) for my suggestion. It was a basic thank you for your suggestion and was all they needed to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rocksmith-2014-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5052746">Expand</a></span>

Beginners often have bad habits and personal lessons can cure those issues. Plus music theory and ideas about different guitars will expand your guitar capabilities. It&apos;s great for bass as well.
