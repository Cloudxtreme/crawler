It was challenging, had great customization options, and even the story wasn&apos;t half-bad. It was developed by Black Box, the same developers who made this game. So i expected something similar to that title.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t come close. It&apos;s not very challenging. The races are fairly easy and the cop chases aren&apos;t that difficult either (just roadblocks; no spikes or the other crazy stuff that was in Hot Pursuit). It has a very short single-player campaign (like 3 hours at most). It has absolutely no customization, and a very very weak story.
<br>
<br>The only redeeming qualities of this game are the diversity in the environments, the very good graphics and great visuals, as well as the gameplay that happened outside the car. That was a nice touch, though nothing groundbreaking.
<br>
<br>Also, a final thing that i liked in this game is the races when there would be a mountain collapsing, or stuff exploding, and you have to evade this stuff while trying to win the race. I know it was done before; but still, it added a certain degree of excitement to an otherwise stale racing experience.
<br>
<br>Some people are bashing this game, because the driving doesn&apos;t feel real. While that&apos;s true, it didn&apos;t bother me. I know that this is arcade-style racing, so i didn&apos;t expect it to mimic reality. But i at least expected the game to be longer in duration, have some car customization in it, and more exciting cop chases. I was very disappointed that it has none of these.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll probably be ignoring Black Box from now on, and just stick with the good folks in Criterion Games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=4377881">Expand</a></span>

What makes this title mediocre is the rubber band AI and the feeling that you aren&#xB4;t really connected with the street but rather hover over it. This game on normal mode is way way longer than 2 hours. People who pretend that they made it in about 2 hours are just bragging with fiction. For an average Gamer like me (and I play the nfs series since the 1998 nfs hot pursuit came out) this takes for 2 hours only to finish the first stage. Maybe because I encountered a terrible sand-glitch near to the beginning ... basically the car begins to jump backwards and all you can see for seconds is a sandy-colored screen...then for a short period of time you see some cars...and so on. They also could&#xB4;ve left out the scripted action-elements where you just klick a key several times and that&#xB4;s it - you don&#xB4;t even need to do it hastily...plenty of time...even if you&#xB4;re about to get crushed in your car (as in the very first scene of the game). Of course I could overlook all these errors if the AI wouldn&#xB4;t be rubber-bandy...  And: don&#xB4;t even try it without having a cntroller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=4004619">Expand</a></span>

<br>need for speed hot pursuit and the run have this disgusting feature in common:
<br>
<br>you don&apos;t have fun while racing because there is no racing. there is just a sick script that kills all your experience and make you feel like you are straining in a maze that some inadequate loser built.
<br>
<br>this game is beyond horrible. pretentious, horrid, bloated, a complete failure.</span>

The selection of cars also much much better than in other NFS titles.<br>BUT ... If you consider this a racing game that&apos;s more inclined towards arcade, why put that idiotic reset function, what was wrong with pressing R like in the old times. Let me explain, you are racing through a village and you have 250km/h and you hit a bump in the road, you jump straight into a telegraph pole, reset from 2km back. You are racing at high speed and a police car pushes you into incoming traffic, reset again... that is incredibly annoying and i can&apos;t understand why no one is saying that here. You take a wider curve and you go off-road, if you stay there for more that 1 second you get reset again. You have a limited number of resets per race (5 or 10 depending on difficulty) Also you can&apos;t modify your cars at all performance wise. You can change color and you have 3-4 tuning kits BUT (again yes) you can only change your vehicle while visiting a gas station during the race and there are gas stations only on certain tracks (you don&apos;t know in advance which). So if you can seldom change your car why such a big selection of cars ? Another thing that i find it incredible is that you can&apos;t see the track shape before the race. Of course there are the regular things for NFS titles like opponent catch up, police targeting only you and while computer drives cars they are faster than while you&apos;re driving them but i got used to that.<br>About the story there is nothing to say (from me) same old bad acting and 3d actors that have no message. ( i really liked Maggie Q in Undercover).<br>My advice is try it at a PC store or at a friend, no idea if a demo is out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1967698">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are average, but that&apos;s about the only static part of this game.  Everything else is constantly changing - the controls are responsive, then the game won&apos;t even let you downshift.  The AI is typical EA/BB fare, with rubberband competition to make the game &quot;exciting&quot;.

Or to have a cop magically alter the laws of physics to turn a tap into a punt?<br><br>I haven&apos;t completed the story and I probably won&apos;t, its simply not worth the frustration.  There are a few fun moments ingrained in a sea of awful aggravation.

Nearly three years of development and assistance from DICE and they still haven&apos;t managed to deliver a decent (not good, decent) game.<br><br>I could easily write a three page review with all the problems this game has. I am however struggling to find something good in it...<br><br>The graphics and optimization are complete failure. DICE pride themselves on having an engine that can render life-like graphics but forget two things: 1st off  life-like doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it looks good, both The Run and Battlefield 3 lack any kind of style, and 2nd off any engine can render high quality graphics at the cost of hardware. Frostbite isn&apos;t revolutionary in any way, considering that it requires Dexter&apos;s computer to run and display everything as it should. I ran NFS The Run with everything set to Ultra at 1024 x 768, not the highest resolution, but games can look brilliant on it, unfortunately The Run looked worse with everything set to Ultra at 1024 x 768 than Undercover with everything set to minimum at 800 x 600...<br><br>In terms of gameplay, The Run is as basic as it can get. Not a bad thing, Hot Pursuit was basic but yet awesome. Unfortunately The Run only has enough gameplay elements or content to be considered (at best) a demo. One that takes up around 16 GB of HDD space.<br><br>I played it for about 2 hours hoping to get a good enough opinion on it... and to my surprise I actually finished the game...<br><br>The challenge series are the same thing as &apos;&apos;The Run&apos;&apos; / Career, not even worth mentioning...<br><br>The multiplayer is the same as the challenge series, but on multiplayer :P Speedbook... Autolog is back but unlike in Hot Pursuit it&apos;s just an excuse for the multiplayer being complete and utter s*it.<br><br>The story, while no-one was expecting an Academy Award winner, it&apos;s probably the worst in any game I&apos;ve ever seen. Jack&apos;s voice actor is a combination between Batman (TDK 2008) and Adam Jensen both with d*cks in their mouths.<br><br>Bottom line The Run doesn&apos;t even feel like a 6 month game, let alone a 3 year one. As a PC game it&apos;s nothing more than an benchmarking tool that doesn&apos;t even work... not to mention it costs 60$ more than it&apos;s really worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1986664">Expand</a></span>

The parts where you had only push one button, when asked, were done fine. Everything else is just a train-racing game. There are invisible rails for opponent cars, there are rules that apply only to the player, and never to opponents, there are trees you can fly through, and there is a constant line 3 meters away from the road that forces a &quot;rewind&quot; action, no matter what the situation. Everything is hard-scripted, just like the COD:MW3, but there it was done correctly. Here it is nothing more but an obvious idiocity and lazyness of game developers. And so this review would not an all-talk, here&apos;s few things that prove my point. The reason this game could not be called a racing game is that no real racing rules apply to it. Every event is timed. Be it an opponent move or some cutscene, whatever. And to run all those events correctly a lot of things gets ignored. Opponents position, speed, situation, player&apos;s actions - none of it matters. The game will show you an awesome opponent crash scene, and won&apos;t give a f*ck if you already wrecked him into a cargo container 100 meters before. The cop on some low-tier car with a 304kmph top speed WILL get before you the moment your 350kmph nitro ends and will do an instant-stop in your face. The game will reset you if you go more than 3 meters into the flat field, and won&apos;t give a f*ck to the fact that you can easily go back to the track and keep going. The game will show a nice &quot;WRECKED&quot; message for *scraching* your car to pedestrian side walk or another car, but the same time will completly ignore some street poles and even trees. And this only applies to the player&apos;s car. Opponents are TANKS ON RAILS. They don&apos;t care. Even if those rails leat to obstacles. The game is confined into simple rules, that make everything in a game nothing more than a decoration behind a &quot;press ENTER to win&quot; text, thus making player nothing more than a dumb ape. Another half-assed arcade racing console game that puts NFS series into deeper sh*t than it already is. But I&apos;d still give this game a mark of 3 for nicely done &quot;on-foot&quot; scenes and &quot;good-enough-for-a-console-port&quot; graphics. &quot;Most Wanted&quot; is still the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1982230">Expand</a></span>

But the thing is: this game is not so fun as other Need for Speed. EA should release it only for download and by half price. It is more likely a Demo. Is not the best NFS, but is better than  Undercover and ProStreet</span>

The game randomly forgets my keybinds and theres no way to change it during a race, causing you to exit then change then reload. Extremely SLOW loading times (over a minute) even with a SSD + i7 2600K + GTX570. Everytime you start the game it forces you to watch their logos, no skipping allowed like in every other game. Game goes to a crawl with SLI enabled. At 1080p you still see jagging everywhere, AA desperately needed. Sky flickers like mad unless I run in windowed mode. Voice, subtitle, and animations do not sync up. Low quality cut scenes (come on now, in game looks better than that pre rendered crap). Car is randomly unresponsive which causes you to crash into things. Driving is very arcadie, with many driving assists, ex turning causes you to automatically &quot;drift&quot; around a sharp turn, no handbreak required. Crappy cars can out run you easily even when you&apos;re already doing 180MPH. Races are extremely short. I think I have spent more time loading than racing. Save your money. This game isn&apos;t even worth $5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115607">Expand</a></span>

I mean honestly leaving fps caps in games is so zero effort on the devs part that its not even funny. Not only does the game look choppy @ 30FPS but the way thees games are made it cause the input lag to go through the roof :/</span>

Only few locations look really good, but I&apos;m sure this could be done with old engine. You can&apos;t even change your car when you want, you have to drive into a gas station  (and by the way lose few positions) which sometimes is even in the end of race. And this police Nissan GTR - WOW. It has to be an AMS Alpha 12 version with 1500bhp as it goes from 200-300km/h faster than my McLaren MP4-12c with nitro. Racing is enjoyable, but even on hard difficulty the game is easy. Whole The Run is about 300 miles not 3000 as game can be finished in 2 hours. I&apos;ve had Xbox buttons in qte, but as I removed my gamepad there are keyboard keys. Generally game is not worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1945215">Expand</a></span>

The cars feel like they have Wight to them still feels real arcadey to . Nice selection of cars quite a few of repeats diff models , the roads (tracks) are real nice looking nice scenery blasting by and you do feel like you are moving at a nice speed . The cops do get on your ass and the road block do catch ya now and again it has some challenge to it .. only things i dont like is how the lvls are slit up, you race for about 2 mins at a time(not finished the game yet) and have to overtake a number of opponents to win, keep in front of them for so long and time and check point races.. the story is as week as you would expect from a racing game (you cant skip the cut scenes is always a piss off ) the game seems to run easy .. Mp is meant to be a high light of this game i have not tried it yet . the game is diffidently worth one dollar for every fps you get ..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1944436">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s right, the PC version is a console port as usual but this time EA did not even bothered to unlock the fps so even if you have a super rig you will be stuck at 30fps. EA shows once more how much they care about PC gamers. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!</span>

I&apos;m getting tired. The newest installment offers too little, too late. The PC version is terribly laggy and buggy. The FPS rate is slow, which is a killer for a racing game. The cars are mostly unresponsive. The gameplay is 2 days (if you have a job). What annoyed me to high heaven was the restart system which takes you back to the latest checkpoint if you so much as go one meter off the road. If that sounds stupid and ridiculous to you, believe me, it is. The bugs are everywhere. Sometimes the game freezes, sometimes the sound will go weird, and the cutscenes let&apos;s say presenting a hidden cop in the bushes can only be problematic - when the camera is back to the car, it turns out the car has hit the tree because you didn&apos;t have enough time after you regained control over the car.<br><br>I also had a big problem with the sense of reality - the cars, as mentioned, seem heavy and tank-like almost - but give them a smallest crash and they go literally flying into high heavens, spinning like crazy as if they&apos;re made of paper. Overall, I think NFS should be wise to just shut down while they are somewhat ahead - it&apos;s clear they don&apos;t know how to make a good racing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1945697">Expand</a></span>

Most of all i like physics of the car, you can feel weight and speed. But it&apos;s still arcade, so you will have no problems with driving. In my opinion,  The Run is the best NFS since the time of Most Wanted. Autolog is still there and multiplayer as good as it was in HP. So, the main problem of The Run is that it&apos;s too short and sometimes a bit boring. 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1946881">Expand</a></span>

The reason its gone to crap is my game dies on me 4-5 times every race. It seriously takes me about 30-40 minutes per race now before i manage to get all the way through it without crashing. Game is also a complete port feels horrible without a 360 controller and there are very few graphical options. On another note for anyone wondering about the on foot sections they are cut scenes with mediocre quick time events and they  don&apos;t really add much to the game. Finally this has to be activated through Origin which is extremely touchy and will crash your game anytime you lose internet connection. Altogether this game has issues and im glad that i only paid $20 for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1996936">Expand</a></span>

The controls are a perfect mix between arcade and simulation where they feel like the real cars but can still be driven impatiently. You can really feel the difference in handling, weight, torque, etc. between the cars, and especially between the old and new cars. The 60s-era Shelby Cobra is small and nimble (but has trouble gripping in tight turns) where a modern Mustang is powerful but very heavy and slow to turn. There are two things that ruin the game. The first is the UI, which is horrendous. It wasn&apos;t just not designed for the PC, it wasn&apos;t designed for Humans to use. Getting stuck with a car not meant for a track on the hardest difficulty means game-over because you can&apos;t switch it out! This is more than a bit frustrating. There&apos;s no way to skip cutscenes and there&apos;s no reason for that besides to frustrate me after having lost or restarted a game. Long load times for restarting a race are also not needed, just stick my car back at the beginning! The second problem is, obviously, EA DRM. Better-tuned graphics may have been nice but the game is still pretty enough. I&apos;d say that if you&apos;re at all interested in cars and racing, you must play this game! The road racing gameplay is the core of the game here and will take a patient player (and maybe someone will real race car driving knowledge) to get right on the harder modes. I&apos;m still giving the game a 10 because the gameplay really is that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952266">Expand</a></span>

<br>To start with something new, the gameplay is actually fun somehow. Not counting other aspects like going off the road or whatever, it&apos;s not really dull. Moreover, the graphics are fine for me. However, that&apos;s all what I can say about the good things.
<br>
<br>I guess everyone agreed the main problem in the game is the physics. It&apos;s too ... awkward (you&apos;ll definitely know if you play the game). Muscle cars have boat turnings while some of the exotic cars are drif... well, slidy. It&apos;s so hardcore to drive some of the cars probably.
<br>
<br>There are also some bad things about the game, like the &quot;story&quot;. You can just treat it as a background information of what the main character Jack is doing. Besides, if you watch the locations closely, you&apos;ll find some places in different stages really familiar (if you know what I mean). Another point is that the game is kinda fast food that you simply have no intention to play the second time when you have completed the game. The cars are so ridiculous and repetitive that you can see some cars in tier 1 actually appears in the higher tiers. Moreover, you can literally change your controls but practically it will reset every time you shut down the game. Why?
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s not exactly really boring but it&apos;s not definitely good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=3914762">Expand</a></span>

Finally, we have a chance to see the story in nfs or racing in general, to this beautiful artwork taken from the BF3 which performs superbly here, everything is great but the game is a little too short and has its wady.Moja rating 8 / 10</span>

I had a good time beating the game, and I recommend it, especially if you can find the Limited Edition on a good deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1934470">Expand</a></span>

The frostbite 2 engine makes the whole world just stuningly beautiful and there is only so much that words can describe. Intense white knuckled racing is absolutely addicting. The autolog helps you compete with your friends and makes the game so much more competitive. Multiplayer is splendid and is even more enjoyable with friends as winning gives you much bragging rights. A huge variety of cars to choose, from vintage muscles to modern supercars. This game gives you that adrenaline feeling that few games on todays market offer. A must have for any racing fan, be it arcade or sim fan. This game is absolutely fun and I have no idea why IGN gave it such a crappy score. The only thing I agree with their review is that this game is slightly short but that may perhaps be that Im enjoying myself so much and finished the game too quickly which leaves me craving for me. This game is a masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1929681">Expand</a></span>

The two hours comes from the in game clock which doesn&apos;t include restarting levels when you fail and cut scenes. Remember you never race on the same track/road twice. There&apos;s around 40+ road levels. I liked the first need for speed on the 3dO and this one.</span>

I loved cinematic experience, whole game felt like 3-5 hours interactive blockbuster movie about racing across whole USA, i felt like if i was in cinema but was not just watching movie, instead i was able to control character (man and his ride), and i understand that game became so scripted and linear and that whole set of gameplay features, including customization, was cut to fit this cinematic experience to make game feel as seamless movie, for same reason QTE was added (i usually hate QTE in action games, but in movie-like games like this one, i really like interactive cut-scenes with QTE) and thats why i dont really complain about it, because it worked good. However it could be done a little better, game have some flaws and stupid moments even as cinematic expirience, for example the way you change cars is quite unrealistic and stupid, i would prefer to see character to call his friend and ask to drive car at some place or even 100% scripted change of cars in cut-scenes would work better for this game, also the way cops try to barricade road felt stupid, but thats small bits of game, the core of game  DRIVING and RACING, done pretty well! Every race is quite challenging, even despite you have 5 checkpoints per level that simplifies game, cops trying to push you out of road, rivals can use shortcuts better than you, arcade physics and controls probably best in series after NFS SHIFT, tracks have really hard sharp turns, there a few racing modes (race, catch-up series, time trial, boss fights, loose cops from tail, and something else), and they are all really enjoyable, they give what i last saw in NFS Carbon (and that missing in other latest NFS games such as Most Wanted 2012 and Hot Pursuit 2010, Shift 1-2)  A REAL TENSION! To win the race you should drive pretty well, you need to think and you need to think fast, otherwise you crash and restart checkpoint. Game would not give you a chance to relax, i would not bore you for a second (for example NFS HP 2010 and NFS MW 2012 just a pure boredom), you will finish playing it in the same breath, and whole play time, like i said before quite a breathtaking.
<br>So, yes, game not perfect, have not much gameplay to offer, but what it exchange everything for quite a solid coin it has to offer and its breathtaking cinematic experience. Stop treating this game like a realistic simulator, you have NFS Shift for this, treat it like an interactive movie and you will understand how enjoyable it is.
<br>Also this game have good gameplay value, you can replay it many times and enjoy. But there is one thing i really hate about this game  LIMITED EDITION PRE-CUT DLC, i really hate the fact that some cars that present in game cant be selected and and tells you that you need limited edition of game, and that you cant upgrade you signature edition to limited without purchasing full game again, this is unfair EA business!
<br>But overall experience is solid good, not perfect, just good! So my score is 7 of 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2860033">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I found it to be kind of an all american driving game, classic race across the country and take in all the great views kind of thing, real nice.  Sure there are things i can nitt pick about, like the skin textures on the characters being over done, but its a console port and really im in it for the driving not to ogle character models! Also the scenery unfortunately kind of flies by too fast to really take it in, but its still quite clear that its great looking.
<br>
<br>The quick time events i could totally have done without, but i will give it +1 point (not only to offset the morons that give games 0&apos;s) JUST for using a Ministry song in a QTE where you get to kick a cop in the face.. pure class.
<br>
<br>I guess it comes down to what you are looking for in a driving game, i dont care for playing online because guess where you find the vast majority of cheaters.. also do not give a rats ass about linking to (or having) a face book account, playing dress-up, or what professional reviewers think of ANYTHING. I wanted an arcade type driving game with solid controls and it delivers. Not going to give it a 10 because there have been no games in the past year that deserve a 10.. NONE! But 8 for overall pleasure +1 for appropriate use of a Ministry song works, if anything i feel it should have cost a bit less but thats just mainstream video games in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=1993496">Expand</a></span>

Some says that game needs only 2 hrs for complete - it&apos;s not true. While playing i felt like i was taking part in movie. Great feeling. Recommended title! Must buy!</span>

Definitely the best NFS game in a long time. Although criticised for the short singleplayer campaign, the story sets it apart from the previous games, making it feel more like it has a set goal, rather than a random set of races! I loved the fact that as you progress through the field you see a wide variety of cars - &quot;ooh, thats a nice Supra&quot;, &quot;is that really a MK1 Golf?&quot;.....Graphics and sound are great, runs perfectly when it works, but there are issues. Firstly, I couldn&apos;t get my Xbox 360 controller to work. I had to use a usb controller and Joytokey combination and although this worked, it wasn&apos;t flawless as in the QTE scenes it still displays Xbox controller buttons, which don&apos;t correspond to keyboard controls. However, I found that just mashing every button on my controller worked anyway!
<br>
<br>Secondly, it feels like no effort was taken to improve the &apos;port&apos;. Visuals are quite poor in some ingame movies and sequences. However, I feel that a lot of the criticism is from people expecting too much from this game. Some people complaining that it isn&apos;t realistic enough..... Hello!... This is a Need For Speed game. If you want realism, buy Shift or GTR! Also, the story may be short, but the challenges and multiplayer make it last indefinitely.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s a fun game albeit with annoying flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818012">Expand</a></span>

This time around we have the Run. is it a cross country epic or does it burn out in the first lap lets find out.
<br>
<br>Story wise there&apos;s not much here you play a driver of a fast car and you are trying to win a cross country race without being disqualified by the mob standard story fair with no real twists or turns.
<br>
<br>What dose have twists and turns is the game play which is tight as ever you play across several maps mostly in a car but sometimes you have to get out of the car (Gasp), but only in an amusing QTE sequence every once in a while which are action packed and exciting and the tight game play is prevalent over to all modes.
<br>
<br>Graphically the game is great. a little more time on the human models would be good, but the cars look fantastic as do environments as you race across America to survive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685306">Expand</a></span>

Boy, was I wrong to avaoid it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s closer to the old NFS games like Hot Pursuit and NFS II SE than any of the other modern NFS games, The Run suffers from little more than terrible characters and plot, the combination of which are not enough to ruin an otherwise excellent game. The big stable of cars are a challenging and rewarding to handle - the driving model in The Run was a breath of fresh air compared to the sprint-car drifting style of most other modern NFSs. Braking in time for a tight corner is very satisfying, and each car feels believable and unique. I miss the lovely engine start sounds from Most Wanted 2, but Mustangs roar, Datsuns howl, and McLarens shriek with ferocious realism.
<br>
<br>One can&apos;t ignore the supporting star in this game: the tracks. Recreated in loving detail is an excellent approximation of a cross-USA race. Wooded state parks, narrow city streets, sprawling avenues, hilly and winding county trunks, and astonishing mountain ranges are all a blast to drive and the sheer attention given to the billion things you drive by brings you into the illusion of a continuous world larger than the new Most Wanted or Hot Pursuit could simulate.
<br>
<br>One of the biggest complaints I&apos;ve read about the game is the length - I finished my first Run in 2:12, but that completely ignores the entire campaign of very entertaining challenge events, which are also played for time and are just as much fun while more functionally showcasing the game&apos;s many cars. Besides that, the Run is meant to be played more than once for competitive multiplayer high score - if it were very long, one couldn&apos;t do it more than a few times.
<br>
<br>Anyway, more story would showcase the game&apos;s weak spot - the plot. Yea, it sucks. It&apos;s kind of like the story for the first Most Wanted, but in that game it felt like EA was in on the big ridiculous joke and in the Run it seems like Black Box might take it seriously, and it just makes you cringe. That said, it&apos;s a racing game and the plot doesn&apos;t matter that much to me.
<br>
<br>As one more weak spot, the game has quick-time action-packed press-the-buttons-as-prompted instant-fun sequences. You&apos;ve done it, we&apos;ve all played Dance Dance Revolution. Some of them were pretty fun, some of them weren&apos;t. You beat up a lot of cops. Sometimes it doesn&apos;t show you the button to press, and you have to figure it out by trial and error. It never stopped me from continuing the game, but that can get annoying.
<br>
<br>At the end, I loved it. While I enjoyed the game&apos;s recent NFS contemporaries, I like this more. Lots of fun, great driving model. Will temporarily satisfy desperation for Need For Speed 2015 reboot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=5520062">Expand</a></span>

Pretty poor effort from EA here (as is becoming standard these days). Graphics are okay, but stuck at 2007 console level. Some good level designs, and some nice variety, but they&apos;re so frustratingly few and far between. There&apos;s also a distinct lack of innovation here. The only challenge is finishing the level. What would have been excellent is a dynamic game that pushes you to win - like a real race. For instance, there are multiple &quot;Gain 8 places&quot; levels, where you have to beat 8 other cars over a set distance/time. Would have have been better is a &quot;Gain as many places as you can&quot; and the better you do here means the more time/advantage you have in later levels (obviously with adjustments since you don&apos;t want the game to be impossible if you&apos;re not all that good). But alas, EA couldn&apos;t innovate themselves out of a wet paper bag. They&apos;ve been pushing the Need for Speed franchise for years, and it&apos;s becoming stale. It&apos;s very, VERY short. Anyone who purchased this at full price got ripped off. A $15 game at best, it would have worked well as an add-on pack to a longer game. I&apos;ve not even finished it yet, and already I&apos;m wishing there was more races. As for the gameplay, it&apos;s very easy. Cars are unrealistic (which isn&apos;t bad - it&apos;s quite fun), but coupled with the extreme shortness, it&apos;s unsatisfactory. And yet the damn thing is a 15GB download! What the hell is taking up all that space? It&apos;s also ho-hum in terms of &quot;achievements&quot;. I despise the feel-good, lack of ability, lack of innovation, modern &quot;achievements&quot;. For instance, you get &quot;unlocked&quot; profile icons just for playing the game. What. The. Hell.? Where&apos;s the fun in that? How is that an &quot;Achievement&quot;? &quot;Achievements&quot; used to be something that you had to strive to complete, an actual challenge (and not everyone got them), rather than just freebies given away for playing the game as normal. Steam does it too. You get &quot;Achievements&quot; just for completing a level. That&apos;s insulting. Overall, 5 out of 10. What racing there is (and it&apos;s in short supply) is fine. There&apos;s just not enough of it, and the game is so linear and controlled that it&apos;s just not as much fun as it could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2437242">Expand</a></span>

Ready? 1) Framerate is capped at 30 FPS with no anti-aliasing. 2) The game crashes throughout the campaign, particularly at stage 8, and resets your controls layout in doing so. 3) Checkpoints are as inconveniently placed as possible. 4) Facial expressions are non-existent. 5) You barely get to use more than 5 cars throughout the campaign. 4) The so-called 3000 mile race only lasts 2 hours. 5) Cars are copied + pasted for each tier, with BHP, top speed and acceleration statistics being completely wrong. 6) Tiers are pointless- you only use Tier 4 cars up until stage 9. 7) You can&apos;t possibly do the cinematic sequences (NOT QTEs but the avoiding of gunfire &amp; explosions and oncoming trains) first time. 8) The story sucks hard. 9) Autolog is pointless if you don&apos;t have any friends that play the game. 10) There are massive gaps and much unused potential. The game is unfinished in the campaign. 11) Quick-time events and cheezy &quot;seen it a million times&quot; sequences 12) Hot Pursuit was better. 13) EA Black Box went downhill after Most Wanted. 14) They&apos;re charging the same price as a full retail game! 15) Origin, and online pass if you&apos;re on console. 16) If you try and install from disc it always gets stuck with 8mb to go at 99% so you have to download the whole 15.8 GB. 17) 3rd person camera is terrible/takes time getting used to. 18) No interior view. OK I&apos;m finished. Now, allow me to justify my rating of this game. First off, 30 FPS is by no means unplayable- especially for a racing game. The crashes which occur during stage 8 only happen once, so it will not crash again if you decide to go back and play it.  Although the game is short, it&apos;s intended to be, because it plays like a film, so they want the player to play it one sitting just as they&apos;d watch a film in one sitting. The quick time events are clich&#xE9;s but they make a nice break and vary the gameplay. More crucially, the story provides a backing and links between each stage/event, and is by no means intended to simulate a feature-length film. Remember, Hot Pursuit didn&apos;t even have a story. The concept is credible, but the execution is flawed in many aspects. There&apos;s a lot more that could have been done, granted, but I&apos;d rather have a 2 hour campaign (which is longer btw if you account for restarting events) which is short and sharp rather than long and tedious. It would be easy to copy and paste 3000 miles of open road, but that would be boring. Instead, The Run offers some of the best driving roads, with the latest cars and above all, the best graphics ever for any racing game. Frosbite 2, 1920x1080 and Ultra settings. Now that&apos;s a combination. If I&apos;m honest, graphics are almost entirely what I&apos;m crediting this game for. The variety in environments- from sun, sand, snow, grass, countryside, desert - everything is there. As you progress through the story, the graphics get better and better. Admittedly all you do is a cycle of 3 event types (overtake, checkpoint and random cinematics) through different scenery, but the simplicity of the game means that if it were any longer it would be boring. There&apos;s quite a lot of variety in the tracks, with 56 events in a series of 10 stages. What&apos;s more, you can go and replay these to beat your best time or even better, take the competition online with no waiting time to play! You literally join instantly in a playlist (of which there are 5 online modes). The great thing about the online is that regardless of your rank/level, skill or experience, you can still enjoy the game because there are plenty of objectives and accolades which earn you XP, so winning isn&apos;t everything (unless you&apos;re top rank of course- by which time you really should be going for wins instead). There are plenty of emblems (titles and icons as in CoD or Street Fighter) and 9 pages of mottos which you may actually want to use. The Run is a combination of Hot Pursuit, Heavy Rain, Test Drive Overdrive and NFS Undercover. Speaking of which, Undercover was way more buggy and had worse graphics, with a terrible story and copy + pasted roads. The Run is much better than people think. I only paid &#xA3;10 for it, and bare in mind that although the campaign may be short, there&apos;s still online and the challenge series. No Other game comes close to delivering the same kind of experience- that special moment where you&apos;re taking each hairpin with perfectionist precision, with a beautiful car and fast graphics. In Hot Pursuit, there may have been a better line-up of cars, and tiers had a point. You could play as cop and racer. But The Run feels somewhat less arcade. You get manual transmission and there are no gadgets to mess about with- just simply nitrous as with other NFS games. It&apos;s the simplicity, combined with the awesome environments and simple but satisfying handling mean that the game is appealing to virtually anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2513488">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: The reload time takes HOURS even in a gamer PC. In the extreme, the game is unplayable. Even if you do everything perfectly, the game will put a &quot;ghost car&quot; coming from nowhere to hit you.
<br>
<br>In overall, I would suggest to NOT buy this game.</span>

In some ways it&apos;s the best racing game I&apos;ve come across in a very long time. The story line is bare boned but original and good. The graphics are INCREDIBLE! Driving through the desert in a sandstorm was an experience just because of the scenery. Unfortunately the lack of AA does show when you&apos;re looking at your car. You CAN choose between body kits and colors on your cars as your level increases but, so far, I&apos;ve seen no engine mods (probably because every one of these cars runs like a scalded dog from the word go). The difficulty of the game is pretty much as expected from any race title. Playing on hard difficulty, I find a challenge in every third or fourth stage. I haven&apos;t unlocked Extreme difficulty yet so I can&apos;t comment on it. The major weakness in this game is the car&apos;s handling. The Run would be well suited as an arcade cabinet and that&apos;s the only reason I can&apos;t give it a 9 or 10 rating. In the end though, it&apos;s fun and looks awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=2436089">Expand</a></span>

Only thing going for it are the for the time amazing first time out of Battlefield games used Frostbite engine graphics which make roads and scenery look amazing, but from there it just goes down hill at break neck speed.
<br>
<br>Driving first of all feels just awful, no matter which car you drive they all feel like boats on 4 wheels with abysmal handling. Also pretty much all cars sound like vacuum cleaners. Idea of panUSA race is a great one, but poorly executed. Racer AI is insanely rubber banded and scripted not letting you pull ahead if youre a good driver. Narrative is just cringe worthy and stupid action out of the car QTE segments just kill it. Youre also faced against mafia hit squads in Cayennes that can keep up and over take your Audi R8 V10 and other super cars making the gameplay even more frustrating and to top it all off throw machine gun mounted helicopters at you.
<br>
<br>All that makes me think whether EA wanted to make a Call of Duty game or NFS. In the end it seems they made an ugly love child of both of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-the-run/user-reviews?user_review_id=6783469">Expand</a></span>
