Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!
<br>
<br>Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.
<br>
<br>When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn&#x2019;t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.
<br>
<br>Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.
<br>
<br>That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it&#x2019;ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it&#x2019;ll be something some people will complain about.
<br>
<br>One other complaint, and maybe it is something I&#x2019;m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don&#x2019;t like the way zones sit for  &#x201C;squares&#x201D; off the road for each road you make. I&#x2019;m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn&#x2019;t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.
<br>
<br>Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn&#x2019;t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.
<br>
<br>The sound isn&#x2019;t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.
<br>
<br>Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062122">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is much better than SimCity, with more features.
<br>I spent hours playing on this and never got bored, and the best part is it&apos;s only $30 at launch.
<br>This could have been easily $70 game like simcity because this game is more polished, less buggy, full mod support, and most importantly so much fun!</span>

<br>There may be some rough edges (if you go looking) or certain elements some may dislike, But the best thing this game offers has the potential to resolve all issues.. It has been built to support Mods! Mods give a game the potential to not only fix or tailor elements of the game to the players liking but can also provide more content! I am yet to see the scope available in terms of how deep mods can go but the fact that certain options like &apos;unlimited money&apos; and &apos;all unlock&apos;s are included as packed in mods, it certainly seems like modding has been on the developers mind for quite some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062088">Expand</a></span>

Cities: Skylines is great for a relaxing time while watching your city slowly expand while building a few roads here and there.
<br>
<br>Much of the fun kind of stops there, though, as there are not any real obstacles to overcome. Crime, fires, health issues, and even economic problems, which would normally be fairly decent threats and the main source of difficulty in city-builders, simply don&apos;t pose as an issue.
<br>
<br>Another huge issue is that the sound quality is terrible. When zoomed out enough to actually see the majority of your city, an extremely annoying wind sound plays endlessly. The music is also sub-par, which is not what you want in a game in which you spend most of your time watching things build up. Essentially this game is best played on mute while Pandora plays in the background.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is nice for a glorified ant farm, but in the end its true value lies almost entirely in the fact that is a much-improved version of Sim City. Those who are really interested in city builders will be pleased, but most other gamers might want to set this one aside at least until it goes on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5208142">Expand</a></span>

Comparatively EA&#x2019;s 2013 Sim City was a disaster, and that&#x2019;s one reason Cities has done so well. However, I don&#x2019;t think it will replace Sim City 4 Deluxe on my shelf anytime soon. Cities has a solid foundation, but its limitations are glaring. Without mod support and DLC, Cities is an average experience with no innovation.
<br>
<br>Cities looks fantastic and runs smoothly. While zoomed in, I see bustling sidewalks and speedy cars zipping around my tidy neighborhoods. There&#x2019;s enough detail to feel immersive, but not so much as to overwhelm older (or weaker) hardware. Load times can be a bit long tho. At first, city building is not all that different from Sim City. Players need to connect to an external highway, build roads, run utilities, designate zones, and watch as their cities come to life. Once populations reach certain points, players get access to more buildings and services. Each citizen has a name, address, education level, age etc. Players can select an icon above a citizen or car to automatically follow them around.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, once towns hit 30,000 or so citizens, Cities&#x2019; shortcomings become apparent. Foremost, Cities lacks variety. All buildings look similar. Players can&#x2019;t build space centers or towering skyscrapers. No army bases or national parks. No private schools or hockey rinks. Towns look generic. Players can&#x2019;t micromanage stats either. Socioeconomic policies are rudimentary and have negligible impact. Tax revenues are too generous. City building merely entails constructing some roads and zoning for residential and business. That&#x2019;s about it. What a startling lack of innovation. Cities is so featureless that players debate its merits over Sim City 4, a game which launched 12 years earlier.
<br>
<br>Town services are horrid. Landfills pile up insanely quick. There&#x2019;s no sewage processing, so all sewage is pumped directly into waterways that become polluted within a few hours of play. Creative players will find ways around this. I&#x2019;ve used in game assets to create my own sewage processing facility (no mods), but doing that ate up massive swaths of valuable real estate and tax revenues. Power stations are anemic. At early levels, the better stations are heavy polluters and resource hungry. And even little towns will need multiple stations or acres of wind turbines. Players will need to build dozens of cemeteries, police/fire stations, schools to service relatively small footprints. Players can&#x2019;t connect multiple towns together. That was a fan favorite feature in Sim City. So each town must be self-sufficient. The game automatically exports/imports goods to and from imaginary neighboring towns. Players can&#x2019;t arrange trade agreements. Cities tries to offset this limitation by providing players a larger sandbox. But it&#x2019;s just not the same as linking a mining town to a farming community or a suburb to a technology hub.
<br>
<br>As towns grow larger, Cities devolves into a traffic manager simulation. Unexperienced players will likely rage over this. The Cities&#x2019; AI is laughably stupid. Vehicles always travel the shortest route regardless of obstructions or traffic. By default, they will not take detours or travel alternate routes. I&#x2019;ve seen dozens of big rigs pile up on a dirt road but ignore a 6 lane highway one red light away because the route was 1 or 2 miles longer. Bus stops can have a dozen or more buses piled up and blocking traffic for 10 blocks. Train stations, docks, and airports will be flooded with unbearable congestion. The worst part about traffic is how early it wrecks towns. New players will need to commit hours of trial and error to fix traffic problems in even the smallest, most basic towns. Not managing traffic will shut towns down completely. Businesses won&#x2019;t receive deliveries. Power plants won&#x2019;t receive fuel.
<br>
<br>Traffic can be managed, but not effectively. I&#x2019;ve built towns with 300,000+ citizens and spent half my time rerouting roads. The process resulted in the destruction of meticulously zoned sections. Without mods, traffic is helplessly broken even with the latest DLC.
<br>
<br>Players can&#x2019;t send tornadoes ripping the suburbs nor can they summon earthquakes. That requires DLC. Want to see your town at night? DLC. Like snow? DLC. Cities is a barebones package without DLC. Unfortunately, the DLC&#x2019;s have their own shortcomings. The other deficits&#x2014;and there are plenty&#x2014;require mods to fix. Thankfully, the mod community for Cities is robust, and many of its shortcomings are addressed by dedicated fans at no charge. Without those, I wouldn&#x2019;t be playing Cities at all. Thanks to its fans, Cities can be fun.
<br>
<br>Cities: Traffic Manager Simulator should only be purchased on sale. It&#x2019;s an incomplete package that requires DLC, mods, and tweaking to make it a decent experience. Sim City 4 Deluxe might be showing its age, but it&#x2019;s considered the gold standard by many gamers for good reason.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=7369085">Expand</a></span>

You have four demands that keep you ever expanding your city and those are: residential zone demand, industrial zone demand, business zone demand, and services demand (being schools, hospitals, police, electricity, water, etc.)
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-The game does a good job at encouraging expansion. You never stagnant because there is always something to build. You can take out loans so if you don&apos;t have money saved but demands for zones or services you don&apos;t have to wait.
<br>-Roads Roads Roads Roads Roads. Everything revolves around round. Everything must border a road to be built. You also have traffic. Creating a blueprint for your city is 90% deciding what roads to build and how to connect everything so traffic doesn&apos;t get congested. If you are like me when you are driving in a city and curse at the city planner for nonsensical/impractical design you will be humbled by this game when you realize these little simulated folks are cursing your name just as vehemently.
<br>-You have population milestones that expand your technologies and give you a sizable monetary bonus.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-When you zoom in the graphics look blurry. Like an out of focus photo but it&apos;s not really a big deal.
<br>-Some buildings require a certain population level in order to unlock/build. Like a forestry industrial zone. Why do I need a certain population to cut down trees? Thankfully you can turn this feature off and be able to build everything right from the beginning so even that is hardly a negative.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: The best at doing what is does plus you just know we are going to get expansion packs. it&apos;s a game worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5128235">Expand</a></span>

This could be the SimCity 4 successor that we have been waiting all these years for. Everything that SC2k13 did wrong, Colossal Order tried to make right. City sizes are 9x bigger, and easily modded to 25x bigger than SC2k13. They didn&apos;t only make things better, they also introduced many new features such as districts, specialized industrial zones and dynamic water movement. Modding support is also a huge feature that is offered. The Steam Workshop has over 1000 mods, models and maps already online less than 24 hours after the release. There are a handful of requests for features that didn&apos;t make it to release, but the devs promised that they would continue working on this game to include as many new features as possible. (Such as road &amp; highway tunnels, disasters and day/night cycles).
<br>
<br>This is only the first day of the launch, and the game is already extremely stable, and looks beautiful.
<br>I look forward to seeing what the devs and the mod community comes up with in the future!
<br>
<br>This game was created by a small indie development team and look at what they produced. I highly recommend this game to anyone who felt disappointed with SimCity and wants to play a genuine city simulator that has the fun of previous versions, but the new features that modern gamers want to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062898">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Long version:
<br>
<br>With the catastrophic release of Sim City 5 in 2013, I have felt being left alone, betrayed, frustrated. Maxis and EA destroyed the Sim City licence, and got all the panning it deserved. Other developpers tried to fill the void, but without achieving greatness.
<br>
<br>Now meet Cities: Skylines.
<br>
<br>From a graphic point of view, this title has a real appeal. It looks like a toyesque feeling about buildings, vehicles and people. Some may dislike it, I personnaly love it.
<br>
<br>Speaking about lenght, Cities Skylines is a City builder. You can actually build BIG cities. Not towns. You start with a small area, but you can extend to other land tiles as your city grows. Up to 9 2*2km tiles, creating cities up to 1&apos;000&apos;000 inhabitants. Yeah, that big.
<br>
<br>What about the simulation side. Well, in the contrary wih Sim City, the RCI system does work, as in you actually need all of them to make your city work. You have to balance, and can&apos;t just build parks to make your citizens happy. Water, energy, crimes, health, education, amusement, everything is covered, and feels realistic.
<br>
<br>Complicated, this game can be. Especially when it comes to traffic management. And it is difficult to have your goods and people flow in a packed city center. Much like in any real big city around the world. But you are not without tools to achieve it. Roundabouts, highways, metros, train, buses, you can basically use everything you can to make it happen.
<br>
<br>I could go on for hours talking about all the good things, I&apos;ll just list some cherries on the cake: areas management, policies, and mods. Yes, real, free, endless mods. Not lousy DLCs.
<br>
<br>Is the game perfect? No, it&apos;s not. It lacks some endgame challenge (money is really easy to come by) and randomness events (climate calamities for example) to make it the best game ever.
<br>
<br>But for now, it&apos;s a deserved 10. Go get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5061795">Expand</a></span>

Over the years I have created many custom buildings (mainly Paris and medieval themes) and mods (amongst other the Jupiter (weather) and the Aurora mods) for simcity-4. Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.
<br>
<br>I have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines&apos; modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is.
<br>
<br>Additionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities.
<br>
<br>Bound by an NDA, it has been challenging for me not being able to respond to all the comments, questions, critisicm, (sometimes unjust) speculation on the forums. And I kept thinking if only you could get to play the game for half an hour and - like me - become captivated by studying the little CIMS in their daily routine, or laying out the most amazing road interchanges. Finally a game I can enjoy again without having to shoot someone.
<br>
<br>Off course some I do share some of the criticism that also has been shared on the forums. I could even  create a list of a dozen or more features that I would like to see changed or improved. But all that is driven by my enthusiasm for this game, and there is a time a place for everything. So for now I am just giving this game a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062027">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is what was supposed to be Simcity 5. The game has all features and full 3D rendering to be the truly successor of Simcity 4. With great mod support, and seamless integration into steam workshop, it will easily be much more moddable than SimCity 4 and will grown much more, much faster.
<br>You have basically what we wanted for Simcity 5: same ideas and mechanics of Simcity 4, with 3D graphics, improved simulation and huge plots.
<br>
<br>Things that i dont like much is the current low variety on buildings, but this should be soon fixed by modding community. The fact you can change several game rules by mods, enhance graphics like added SSAO and god rays is just like the final touch. Where also cities XL failed, this game will probably be the gold standard of the genre for years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5120171">Expand</a></span>

I like the upgrade tool for roads, makes it easy to just build and upgrade later if traffic gets bad. The progressive unlock mechanism for everything is also making it easy for me to learn the game. The unlock steps are not far in-between so I find the pace descent.
<br>
<br>Creating your own districts (with a paint-brush) and specializing the industry there and cherry-picking specific laws that only affect that district is great. In fact it&apos;s something I&apos;ve never seen in city builders but now that I use it in this game is seems so obvious... Cool idea.
<br>
<br>City mechanics like traffic, pollution, cash, jobs, services etc. are working well so far. I&apos;ll update later if I get the chance with more info once the game progresses.
<br>
<br>Update:
<br>
<br>After playing the game a bit there&apos;s two major comments I&apos;d like to make.
<br>1. The steam workshop mods are great, and expand the game nicely
<br>2.  The game is a bit too easy, and I find myself not really challenged at this point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062566">Expand</a></span>

There is obviously some room for interpretation in a game, but to give a 1/10 or even a 2/10 to a game that is obviously the best in its genre is (regardless of whether you like it) quite simply a sign that you&apos;re mentally challenged. Stay tuned for an explanation of my stance -
<br>
<br>If you like city builders, chances are you played SC4 - this game has been the go-to game for city building enthusiasts for a little more than a decade. Some people tried to bask in its glory (Cities (X)XL i&apos;m looking at you) and there&apos;s even been a sequel - and we all know how those worked out.
<br>
<br>Cities Skylines takes all of the great features of SC4, does NOT dumb them down (this is a plus if your IQ is higher than that of a potato) and expands upon them (See traffic, Colossal Order has had lots of practice with traffic-based games and this one delivers too). In my 20 hours of gameplay so far I only noticed ONE bug, there is no always-online DRM **** and the graphics, while outdated, aren&apos;t something that sticks out as a bad thing. With the huge map sizes (up to about 25 times the space you had in SC5), decent amount of features and wonderfully bugfree engine you&apos;ll have lots of fun with this.
<br>
<br>Anyway, to the low score reviewers: You might not like this game, this is fine - give it a 6 or 7, but if you go ahead and give a 1 or 2 to a game that is clearly the the market leader in its genre you obviously are mentally challenged. As for that matter, I&apos;d even call people stupid who rate the newest instance of Call of Duty 1 or 2 stupid - the publisher might be greedy and the game might be ultimately the same as the last 5, but 1/10 - really? Gain some perspective.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063949">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m a veteran of the sim game, and this game doesn&apos;t feel crippled in anyway to me. I can look at pretty graphs and statistics. I can do whatever the hell I want. Yet, it also looks to be pretty accessible to the beginner and doesn&apos;t overwhelm them. I have NO idea how they managed to strike the perfect balance between myself and the newbie, but they did.
<br>
<br>There are very few bugs -- that&apos;s saying something since as of the time of this writing, it&apos;s day 1 of release. This is a good thing, because I played for five hours without realizing that I hadn&apos;t saved yet. No crashes -- and I&apos;m on linux so their QA did their job really really well.
<br>
<br>The developer is going to add in some DLC, the game already feels &quot;complete&quot; and there is more than enough content to keep you occupied. I actually look forward to the next DLC to see what they add.
<br>
<br>EA can forcibly insert **** up their rectum. This game is the true successor of the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062931">Expand</a></span>

<br>All those things are fixable though. With a couple of patches, DLC, as well as community mods, I am confident that a year from now this will be the best citybuilder ever released. Is it worth it RIGHT now though? If it was full price, I&apos;d suggest you wait just a bit. But at 30$, it&apos;s a steal.

Basically you start on a map the size of SimCity map, and then dynamically buy surrounding areas as your city grows. I bought 8 SimCity sized areas that are integrated into a single map, and I haven&apos;t passed 50 000 residents, so I have no idea how large you can go. The game also has a very cool elevation system for roads and tracks, which means you can twist and turn them on several layers across each other, it&apos;s very cool.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this is the best city builder that I have ever played. It&apos;s very well optimized and stable, and for now I feel I actually need help in keeping me away from my computer as I have a tendency to play it for more hours that I probably should, and ignore my commitments...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063935">Expand</a></span>

Lots to do and so much potential for future development like mods and DLC. There&apos;s a learning curve so don&apos;t expect things to work just because it worked in SimCtiy. You need a decent spec laptop or desktop to fully enjoy the game.</span>

If you like city builder games you will love this one. During my first 3 hours of the game i didnt even manage to fill one tile of land. Anyone who has played SimSh!tty 2013 will know what i mean. Buy the game now and support the devs for the good work!</span>

<br>
<br>Cities XXL was nothing new from the meh Cities XL. Cities Skylines is a massive improvement. It&apos;s the city building game everyone has wanted for years. Sim City 2013 was a HUGE disappointment and Cities XXL was a money grabber. Cities Skylines is well worth the 30 dollars, even if it was priced at sixty it still is a great deal! This is the best city building game since Simcity 4.
<br>
<br>There is so much content in this game to keep you busy for a long time. I know people who have put 30 hours into this game and are still playing. Did I mention that it has mod support? There are over a 100 mods on the Steam Workshop already. Cool. You don&apos;t even need mods. I do recommend them though, as they add a lot to this game.
<br>
<br>The only thing wrong with this game is the tutorials. It doesn&apos;t explain anything very well, but I can&apos;t think of a city builder that does. A few bugs here and there. Nothing major or gamebreaking.
<br>
<br>Please buy this game and tell Paradox that this is what we expect next time! Do not screw us again with the Cities XXL crap!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063852">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For the price, this game is worth it. Bye bye SimCity and EA. I hope the community from SimCity 4 will hop over and here and populate the Steam Workshop.</span>

I spend so many hours in this game already and I just cant stop. The best thing is they dont try to reinvent the wheel. The developers are clearly fan and former players of Sim City and it shows. Well done a must buy for any Sim city 4 fan.</span>

SimCity2013 wasn&apos;t really even a playable game, I lost interest with SC2k13 in 15 minutes and found the graphics outdated and dull (can&apos;t understand how people thought they were great).  Skylines is very very playable so far although there are a few annoyances like clicking the school icon both (a) shows the overlay on the map of school coverage, but (b) also picks up a school building as if to build it. So because of (b), I cannot actually click on a school to get info about it in this mode until I back out to regular map viewing mode. Kinda weird. But nothing to get upset about.
<br>
<br>Graphically, maybe it&apos;s me, but from a sheer &quot;graphic&quot; quality standpoint, Cities XL (or that series) is still the best, cleanest, Nicest AA and textures, game of the bunch. That game sucked, but that&apos;s not my point. Graphically, it was the best of these 3 with C:S coming in second. I find the lack of AA (even with it turned on) a bit rough around the edges. Moving around is just not a clean feeling, pixels in the distance flickering around, even at details maxed out. But from a  &quot;scale&quot; and feeling like you are in fact looking at a big city with big distances, C:S gets the feeling across well.
<br>
<br>Despite both SC2k13 and this game using 2km grids, maybe it&apos;s the scale of the buildings of something but there is waaaay more space in THIS 2km grid than SimCity. In SC you felt your elbows bumping within 5 or 10 minutes. In This, playing several hours, I&apos;ve yet to feel the need to expand yet beyond the first 2km grid although I do own another 2 to use.
<br>
<br>If my review sounds like I&apos;m nitpicking, well I am because I&apos;m giving it a 9, closer to 9.5, and basically I think by now everyone knows the good points. The &quot;bad&quot; points are few and mostly related to the visual presentation.
<br>
<br>My system is a desktop i5 with 16Gb of RAM, an Nvidia GTX 750ti, running at 1920x1080 and everything is silky smooth as far as FPS. Even Far Cry 4 with everything on runs like butter on this setup (40-50fps). But unlike FarCry, I think this game will tax both GPU and CPU equally especially more the CPU as the population grows. I can see that a laptop with onboard GPU might not be up to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063901">Expand</a></span>

There a lot of micro management involved, lots to think about including pre-planning,  road layouts, districts, utilities and a lot more. If you are looking to build a city quickly you better know what you&apos;re doing, because things can get out of hand quickly, so Cities: Skylines does take a little patience, but it&apos;s certainly worth the effort!

I&apos;m not a huge fan of city-builders (the only ones i&apos;ve played are this, Tropico 4, and Sim City 2000) so I can&apos;t critique the game as much as others but I will try to offer some decent criticisms. The game seems to be lacking some road functionality, Traffic often takes the same lane on a 3 lane road and this ends up causing huge traffic jams. There&apos;s no way to connect a road to another and not have it create an intersection, this is especially annoying when using highway ramps or one way roads. There seems to be a lack of unique buildings. I found this glaring when trying to increase my tourism. Supposedly tourism is supposed to be a big way to get money but there&apos;s no real way to draw tourists other than making these big, unlockable, &quot;unique buildings&quot; which do nothing other than drawing tourists in very small numbers. There&apos;s also no way to terraform the environment. You can&apos;t make a hill or level a mountain. This becomes annoying when trying to place a large building because you have to find a place that is totally flat. Airports are my biggest grief with this. Due to the generally bland nature of the maps (almost completely flat with some trees and rivers here or there) all your cities end up looking similar. Citizens seem to die quickly and in waves. No matter how much you&apos;re growing you will come across &quot;death waves&quot; where hundreds, if not thousands, of your citizens will die within a few days. This is annoying and makes it hard to judge what your true growth is or if you&apos;ve come across a serious problem.   I&apos;m sure there are more issues I came across but I can&apos;t think of them now. Overall the game is enjoyable and I intend on going back to it. The devs seem intent of fixing at least some of these issues and supposedly on releasing a ton of DLC. In the mean time, the game has great mod support which can fix some of these issues and make the game much more enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5103605">Expand</a></span>

Paradox has more than delivered with this gem. I found it to be extremely intuitive, immediately captivating, and regrettably addictive. You need to pace yourself with this puppy because it is easy to lose hours of your life building up the next metropolis. My only slight peeve, and the reason this fell short of a perfect 10, is that the population requirements for some features seem a bit egregious. Certain, shall we say, basic necessities are withheld in the beginning of the game and an unseasoned player can get the feeling that it takes FOREVER to obtain solutions for issues that can become problematic very quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5064538">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And yeah the game is awesome, some mistakes from the traffic AI and missing something&#x2019;s they promised to put in time. (Like tunnels)
<br>
<br>I feel the game have a lot of potential, is rely good at this point! But is missing something, like missions and the feeling that you can specialize your city, like a gamble city or a tourism city.
<br>
<br>Traffic is like the most important thing to figure out; well they are the Dev of cities in motion... but please fix the AI problem fast!
<br>
<br>Missing also way to destroy your city. And weather.
<br>
<br>But in general 9/10
<br>
<br>The Steam work shop is the best idea of this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5064324">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great graphics for a city builder, looks like a game from a triple AAA team although you can see the holes from them not being one at the time of creation, the major flaw being the lack of buildings or maps in the game.
<br>
<br>Enjoyed it for a solid 15-20 hours but ended up with a great amount of cash and the only real thing you were doing is just expanding, sounds like a weired criticism but I think were I&apos;m trying to get to here is that it could of done with a bit more challenge in it or some events that changed the theme a bit.
<br>
<br>Also there was no real tutorial whatsoever and had to figure stuff out by yourself, most of it was pretty intuitive but I feel they could of tried to explain or at least have a text in the options or help section for the public transport which can get pretty complex and results in trial and error most of the time.
<br>
<br>You feel a bit lonely in the game because you never really hear anything from anyone, no objectives to do no nothing, only a stupid little bird on top that you couldn&apos;t remove till a future patch.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s ok I guess, I feel that if it wasn&apos;t for the major downfall of the Simcity game back in 2013 this game wouldn&apos;t of received half of the critical acclaim it had and still is receiving.
<br>
<br>Hopefully with the money they get they can create an even better game in the future and give some competitivness in the market for the genre which I will receive open handed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5467128">Expand</a></span>

<br>I hate to compare the game to SimCity at all because overall SimCity was just not very good but there are a few things that SimCity got right such as expanding onto a building, for example, adding more garages to an already existing fire department. I also love all of the specialization in SimCity that I&apos;m having a hard time finding in Cities, such as gambling. I really liked how you could see everything actually happening in SimCity, for example, if someone went to school, you would actually see them physically go to the school (by the way there are no school buses here). However, I do understand that each and every person actually doing something in the game could cause it to run slower or use too many resources.
<br>
<br>I love how big the maps are in this game and overall I&apos;d give the graphics a 7/10. Even with the graphics turned all the way up on my PC, there seems to be some fade in the corners, I suppose this helps the game run smoothly but on a top notice PC I feel like I shouldn&apos;t be seeing that.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d love to see this game go to the extremes though. I mean I&apos;d even like to see things such as cell phone towers added in and having the responsibility of maintaining coverage, as well as other things such as ISP and Cable TV contracts and things of that nature. I&apos;d just like to see more of what really goes on in a city, in Cities: Skylines. My biggest complaint is that there just isn&apos;t enough to do in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5485465">Expand</a></span>

Some nice ideas (water management, electricity management, transport system, laws and exceptions) but the lack of deep management kills the surprise. Too casual, too light for me for a city builder in 2015 but still it&apos;s a good game in this poor era.</span>

<br>If you are and have been a Simcity fan, you will HAVE to get this!

<br>My only complaint is the cartoony look of the game, which I assume is to help it run as smooth as possible, and the cities can look kind of generic and plain, whereas older sims had more way to spice it up.  Hopefully with the mod community, it will make it much much better though.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a solid addition to the genre overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5164554">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of all - this is really one of the few games for the last days, which started and worked &quot;from the box&quot;. No massive critical errors, crashes and bugs. Game was finished, polished and released in good condition. This game don&apos;t ask us to be a beta testers for our own money. THIS - is nice rare exception in game development nowdays.
<br>
<br>I will not tell you much about &quot;how good it is&quot; - you can see all info about the game in pre-release trailers and notes.
<br>I just would say that this game considered many mistakes of last SimCity. Added many new interesting features  and micromanagement abilities.
<br>
<br>But... Some things I don&apos;t like:
<br>
<br>- game is VERY easy. You can set the city fast and leave it for an hour. When you come back - it will still leave and bring money. Fire, diseases, criminal and other stuff - will not bring it down. Game don&apos;t bring any challenge.
<br>- it is  unbalanced :  little city will ask for big number of firestations (big and small), but it will be enough to set just 1-2 little hospitals and just even 1 police station.
<br>- pollutiondon&apos;t bring any problems. When there is a factory or trash dump on the land - it has local pollution, not spreading by the wind or any other way. If you remove this building - land becomes clean as heaven&apos;s garden in a moment.
<br>- there is no wind direction. You can set factory anywhere you want - polution over the wind doesn&apos;t matter.
<br>- there is no any option to set a grid on the land - for planning roads and city.
<br>- Setting road bends is very low controlled. Easy on small distances, but very problematic on big distances.( setting grid on the land could give some help with that - but there is no such option, as I already said)
<br>- (!!!) there are one-direction roads to set, but no exit and entrance ramps. This is most thing I don&apos;t like.  If I  try to connect one-way directed road like an exit or entrance ramp - it becomes to be an intersection with traffic lights. So it creates traffic jams, while rams was seted to avoid it.
<br>- 1 bus station can work only on 1 route. For any new route you will need new bus station = LOL
<br>- there is no such depth in trading, resource gaining, producing comparing to SimCIty.
<br>
<br>Well, there are many other such small (or big) things I don&apos;t like about this game. Game fixed, added and expanded many features from SimCity, but also ignored many other good features from it.
<br>
<br>So:
<br>release with no critical bugs and crashes - 10/10
<br>no freezes, stable - 10/10
<br>graphics and picture - 7/10
<br>music - 6/10
<br>unbalanced and too easy, brings no challenge - 5/10
<br>-------------
<br>My overall score - 7/10
<br>
<br>I hope developers will fix balance and add more depth in game. Will see.
<br>Have a good game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5064522">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game plays like the 2013 version of Simcity, but does better - yet the overall finish of the game feels a bit clunky and not as polished as it could have been.
<br>The sim part itself seems fair and well made, yet it&apos;s unclear which parts are simulated, which are not and so on - and it seems very easy to get started, which may be good but it kind of lacks the challenge.
<br>
<br>It looks good and plays well, definitely the best city builder game seen since Simcity 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5068033">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is fantastic, every bit as good as SimCity 4 but more polished. It took me about 30-60 minutes to get used to the interface and since then it has been a joy to play. I&apos;m still just getting started, my little town has grown to a huge city and I&apos;ve only just filled 1 2km square, I&apos;ve just scratched the surface so far and haven&apos;t even looked at the huge number of mods available on Steam Workshop.
<br>
<br>The developers have done a great job with this game and I only paid &#xA3;14.99 for it which IMO is an absolute bargain. If you like city building sims you will love this game, I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062825">Expand</a></span>

<br>You will not be disappointed with your purchase of this game. If you&apos;re on the fence about buying this or not, pull the trigger. It delivers the city building experience I&apos;ve imagined since since SimCity 4. Very nicely done. Honest thanks to the Dev team for making such a wonderful experience.

<br>You will not be disappointed with your purchase of this game. If you&apos;re on the fence about buying this or not, pull the trigger. It delivers the city building experience I&apos;ve imagined since since SimCity 4. Very nicely done. Honest thanks to the Dev team for making such a wonderful experience.  I&apos;m excited to see where the community takes this game with SteamWorkshop support. 29 USD is an amazing value for the product you&apos;re getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062325">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great job for this first Cities Skylines release, which seems very stable and well implemented/tested. The &quot;complexity&quot; is maybe not (yet) that huge, but I really can not complain for the 28 Euro price. I hope, this is just  the beginning and more content will be released soon. So far, thank you Colossal Order. And goodbye Maxis.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5069710">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>only problem i find is that it&apos;s not always obvious what&apos;s wrong with a city or why something don&apos;t work. also, freeways annoy me as they need to be built in a special way for the road to go the right way!
<br>
<br>still a great game i will spend many, many hours in! all for 27.99&#x20AC;... its a bargain!
<br>Double the game, for half the price!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-skylines/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062765">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hope they will add more customizations to players . Then this game will be truly a masterpiece.</span>
