It was essentially 1 long cutscene with very little interaction.  No puzzles or problem solving to speak of.  I think the hardest thing you had to do was find an ornament for a Xmas tree.
<br>
<br>The ending was forced and pointless.  It was quite clear that the game is pushing you to surrender, even if you try to stand up for yourself and fight, you&apos;ll get a couple of your friends killed and are forced to surrender anyway.  I was looking for the option right at the end labelled &quot;give me the damn gun&quot;.  And now it looks like in the next chapter we&apos;re playing nice with our captures.  Yeah.  Right.
<br>
<br>Sorry Telltale.  I very much enjoyed Season 1, with it&apos;s clever puzzles and difficult choices.  Season 2 thus far has been a poor imitation.  Hope it improves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4012100">Expand</a></span>

I usually don&apos;t mind this, as the story telling is the most interesting part of these games, but the actions of our characters this time around left me baffled on a few different instances.
<br>
<br>More specifically, the way some of the characters behave does not fit in a world that is 1.5 years into a zombie apocalypse. Was the absurd jump in time in Episode 1 of 16 months necessary?
<br>
<br>The &quot;surprise&quot; about halfway through this episode was great, but shouldn&apos;t overshadow bad dialogue in a lazy plot. A solid experience, but I expected better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4017397">Expand</a></span>

As a fan of season 1 naturally I was eager to pick up the new seasons material.  With my season 1-5 choices in place and my 400 days finished up, I played Ep1 and Ep2 back to back.  So let us start by examining the basic facts.  The story leaves the end of season 1 with the untimely end of our would-be hero, leaving one damsel in distress as a damsel in cardiac arrest, meanwhile, leaving a whole gape load of questions and plot holes that will hopefully be cleared up as seasons progress...... ok ... so far so good.  Plot holes can be good (if curiosity clears it up later).  **First Impression**  S2:Ep2 We are greeted in the usual Hollywood fashion we have seen in the TT franchise and the familiar bright and faithfully comicy feel that you either love or loath. First it starts out with our newly trained &quot;heroine&quot;  been thrown into a myriad of confusing and somewhat bizarre situations, not too astray from our previous season; from bounding over tree stumps like a 11 year old cyber ninja; to sewing your own sutures after being ravaged by a traitorous canine that will attack you regardless of whether you feed it or not........ but after a fair examination of the content, what do we actually have?  **Too early to say?** The good points:  The story; let&apos;s be honest folks, TWD is a beefed up visual novel with a risque approach to illusionist choices.... and that is not a criticism..... it&apos;s actually a compliment.  Not in a good long time have I been engrossed by such a novel...... and it&apos;s all about the plot, the attachment to characters and the &quot;feeling&quot; of pressurised choices that draws you into the &quot;game&quot;.  It&apos;s a refreshing and crispy alternative to the predictable world of generally aesthetic play in apposed to &quot;game&quot; a form of competitive activity or sport played according to rules. **Bad points**  Please do not expect any true form of competition or alternative objectives, the &quot;games&quot; core story is fixed and as such &quot;watchers&quot; should expect as such.  Even the structure of the &quot;game&quot; suggests the feel of story in opposition to play *cough Season 2: Episode 2 etc... *cough*hint.  **Final Verdict** Story 9/10, Ambiance 9/10, Visuals 7/10, Controls 6/10, Interactivity 4/10 (sorry but true), bonus points: Shock Value 9/10  **Overall** Not a &quot;must-buy-game&quot; for the masses but if you are hungry for something you can allow yourself to be drawn into, I would give this title a very firm and fine thumbs up...... god it&apos;s like waiting for the next episode of Game of Thrones.......  7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4150160">Expand</a></span>

<br>but for the story,you can play
<br>
<br>I am playing this game for the 8th time(season 1 5 epsisodes + DLC + season 2 2 episodes)
<br>it became routine;people fight
<br>Prolonging a game for 2 years is not good at all
<br>release all episodes at once once in a year
<br>Addiction gone to madness and I am not enjoying the game anymore
<br>
<br>I have noticed one change;we can stop long arguments now;it gets irritating
<br>episode is a little longer
<br>
<br>overall it offers nothing new,
<br>The choices does not alter the main game,so it does not matter what choices you make;its only the way people interact changes
<br>
<br>The game gets predictive &amp; routine
<br>misunderstandings &amp; arguments
<br>
<br>If you didnt play,stop reading now
<br>
<br>Spoilers ahead: &quot; As predicted by users,Kenny returns</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4019564">Expand</a></span>

In the first game the choices you made actually mattered; however in this game it simply doesn&apos;t feel like it even makes a difference - the plot or main narrative remains the same. We&apos;ll still play it though, and look forward to the next one :).</span>

<br>What you get is an interactive tv episode where most of the interaction is talking plus a few action scenes with quick-time events. Occasionally you can control clementine like in a classic adventure game but puzzles and exploration are barely existent. The dialogues between characters are often limited to the minimum and the overall challenge is laughable. Seriously, a three year old could beat this game.
<br>
<br>What irks me the most is that the majority of the dialog options and choices don&apos;t matter very much and the game will always progress along a given path and you&apos;ll always end up at the same spot at the end. The only thing you can influence are the fates of two of the characters and it remains to be seen if that will actually make a big difference in later episodes. I honestly doubt it.
<br>Other than that you&apos;re starting in different places depending on who you went with at the end of episode 1. This has no effect on the storyline because you&apos;ll end up at the same place with exactly the same crowd after in the 4th chapter.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s also a bit annoying is that you can&apos;t skip any cutscenes so if you replay scenes you&apos;re bound to sit and watch all dialogues again. Bad choice in my opinion because the writing is certainly not THAT good.
<br>
<br>Regarding the storyline: I found it interesting enough but I didn&apos;t like the way it went because I would&apos;ve made a few choices differently than I was allowed to do. I know that there are limits to how much diversity you build into such a game, but sometimes I was asking myself why I just didn&apos;t watch the show instead.
<br>All in all the episode is rather short. It took me just about 2 hours to complete it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4014603">Expand</a></span>

The rest of the group is so bland its not even worth mentioning, and everyone is so self absorbed and useless that you just cant care about anyone you&apos;re with.
<br>In a game with little to no gameplay,  you need to either have a compelling story or good characters to keep yourself going. This season of The Walking Dead, unfortunately, has neither.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4013845">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The next episode of the badass trilogy is here and I&apos;m with Clem, I&apos;m so pumped up right now...
<br>Anyways so Clem&apos;s group, who are real d*cks... don&apos;t tell them that. So anyways The group runs away from Carver and Junkie girl from 400 days. We then cut to a bridge where my lookalike &quot;friend&quot; decides to put a bullet in Matt&apos;s head he is a friend of mine and he gets thrown off a bridge. Next we cut to a skilodge where Sarita AKA my new girlfriend finds the new group and argues with Walt and Me, but then...
<br>Clementine is seen, Thank god! So anyhow we then talk for a bit and I explain how I got out of the damn alleyway from that piece of crap Ben but I shot him and ran like hell.
<br>We then cut to dinner where Clementine has to choose who to eat dinner with, obviously me...
<br>But then argument 2.0 starts and I get real mad and call Clementine &quot;Duck&quot;.....................
<br>Next the guy Nick the d*ck decides to confess on how he shot Matt to Walter who then choses his fate later in the walker attack.
<br>But then, Carver and his group including Junkie girl come in with AK-47s and shoot the s**t out of those walker bastards, but then we become hostages to them, well not Luke and me... but Carver then reveals that his could possibly be the father of Rebecca&apos;s unborn child. Congratulations Alvin, You are not the father! But then Clementine finds me and I have to save everybody but however she argues that if I shoot, I would cause Alvin to be killed in the process. Which then leaves us at the end of our story arc with another trailer. Overall this episode was awesome, but I loved how I was not dead... the final score for episode 7 is a badass 9.9?10, A game which cannot be missed.
<br>I&apos;m Kenny from the walking dead and I review it to save lives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4010177">Expand</a></span>

And yes Episode 2 is absolutely better! Love the game, love the character, and yes Clementine! I don&apos;t care how long it takes to make the next Episode but I just wish TTG would create more... jumpscare, LOL!</span>

It has a bit better action than the first one in my opinion, and great surprise. Same length 90-120 minutes aprox. Still short I think, but this is what we should expect from the new Telltale Games.</span>

The bunch of misfits Clem is stuck with are still a bunch of lazy and incompetent slackers, opting to send Clem off to do everything--including zombie killing duty it seems. The only person to be sympathetic this time around is the complete **** from E1, and that quickly nose dives as she becomes just as self absorbed as the rest. Only when you near the end do you get a glimmer of hope that you might be able to join up with competent people, but we all know that can&apos;t last: we&apos;re only in Act two of these dreary season after all.
<br>
<br>The realism and immersion is utterly destroyed when you realize they are trying to have the player do all the things Lee did in S1, but in the body of an 11 year old girl. There&apos;s acceptable disbelief for story and gameplay&apos;s sake, and then there is just plain embarrassing writing. The character model for Clem is clunky and robotic rather than natural, and facial expressions appear to have been recycled from Season 1 characters. Clem&apos;s voice actress is so damn bland: I think she can do an excellent job if given proper direction but the monkeys writing this drivel seem to have told her to give her best impression of a adolescent robot. I understand that they want to make the dialogue &quot;neutral&quot; so everyone can feel like they&apos;re Clem, but the charm of S1 was choosing how Lee acted and acting out the role we wanted to play; It wasn&apos;t BEING Lee. We saw how Lee&apos;s character responded to events in the way WE chose. &quot;Being the character&quot; only really works with a silent protagonist guys: having Clem&apos;s delivery be boring and uninteresting leaves me wondering where her damn personality went.
<br>
<br>Overall, my expectations were low after E1. Even those low expectations were not met. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4010186">Expand</a></span>

<br>I had a slight doubt in Telltale with them having 4 games in development and all, but this convinced me otherwise. Best episode in the series.</span>

Anyway, i do always ask &quot;What&apos;s next?&quot; after chapters like that. But now I&apos;ll ask &quot;Who&apos;s next&quot;.

It had its moments, sure, but the characters were under-developed and the choices felt flat. Episode 2 is a much better chapter in almost every aspect. It has a ton of incredibly difficult choices, much more character development and while the action sequences are completely uninspired in comparison to The Wolf Among Us, the visuals and framerate have been improved dramatically.
<br>Episode 2, especially at the end, is a gut-wrenching, devastating and hard to digest ride. You thought that &quot;dog&quot; scene on the first chapter was too much? Well, get ready. This is the kind of content we want Telltale to put up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4011090">Expand</a></span>

The only reason it is 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because, as Clem, I kept wanting to say, &quot;They crossed the bridge and are after us! We need to prepare!&quot; but all I could do was ignore the danger and appreciate the fantastic reunion with Kenny. I really didn&apos;t like Kenny in season 1. As Lee, Kenny was my rival, but also a hot head and could not always be depended on. But, as Clem, I could not resist hugging Kenny. Great episode, but I just wish I could have properly expressed my fear over the impending danger.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4012772">Expand</a></span>

But I have to say, this is some of the best writing I think I&apos;ve ever seen from, not just Tell Tale, but from video games as a whole.
<br>One major problem in the last game was the quick-time events; they were awful. Some times in the last game commands wouldn&apos;t work and when they did, it was just so you could see Clementine do some dull dodge or hit something. This time, while they haven&apos;t been omitted unfortunately, their much better. Everything is quicker and &quot;Gritter&quot;, nothing feels like it&apos;s for show or that any action you take here is unnecessary, it all looks and feels great.
<br>The story has also change. Instead of being a life-less A to B, 2 hour walk it&apos;s somber look at the group as circumstances change and people are forced to make big calls; including you (Clementine). Everything feels like it will effect the group, no matter how big or small and it&apos;s that tension that drives the game to new heights of quality.
<br>This game also seems to be setting up a new recurring villain, Carver. Carver is **** scary; nothing more needs to be said; you&apos;ll have to play it for yourself for why.
<br>Overall this episode is just amazing. Miles above anything that will come out this month; this episode is the true beginning of season 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4015589">Expand</a></span>

I completed The last of us on PS3 and really now coming back to season 3 of this.. feels a bit, empty..  You know after TLoU this is sort of empty.
<br>
<br>Its cool to follow the story though and I really like Clementine but I&apos;d like to leave all the other eedjits behind.</span>

<br>
<br>Although we could see the beginning of some heavy and impactful decisions being made in episode one, and saw a few returning tides from Season One, this episode in particular is where things really start to show strain and an emphasis on important decisions is made. There are definitely more choices in this episode than any of the previous ones- in action segments and in plot driven ones alike, you&#x2019;re forced to make the tough choices nobody likes to be in charge of. No matter what you choose, you&#x2019;ll most likely regret it- and not always because it was a wrong decision, but simply because you won&#x2019;t know what may have happened had you not acted as you did. One can only imagine this boosts replayability tenfold, however, you&#x2019;d have to replay things several times in very similar ways in order to be sure you&#x2019;re creating the same catalysts and situations that should turn out in nearly the same fashion, or else things could spin off in an entirely new direction. Curses, Telltale, you intelligent devils!
<br>
<br>One thing is certain in A House Divided, and this is that your consequences will change the very course of the game. Inevitably, some people are going to die- maybe now, maybe later, and you have somewhat of a say in that. Some people will be disillusioned with you and others impressed. Old and new allies alike will turn to you or against you. Such is the way of this world, it seems. Interestingly enough, you won&#x2019;t just be dealing with the same old decisions from this episode and this particular season, but from the entire series as a whole- Season One and 400 Days included in varying degrees. Tough choices, tough choices&#x2026; The connections you build- however shaky or however firm are definitely going to play a large, important role later, as I would imagine the people you form them with will to boot.
<br>
<br>Concept: Continue the journey of an adorable little girl and her companions in the desolate, bleak world they now inhabit- fleeing both from the rotten dead and those walking in their path, the living come to kill them or otherwise harm them.
<br>
<br>Graphics: These graphics aren&#x2019;t anything you haven&#x2019;t already seen seven times over up until this point, and I am sure will be something you will continue to see afterwards as well. However, it must be said that this and the previous episode have been two of the most varied color schemes- especially in comparison to the dreary shades of grey present for the majority of Season One. Don&#x2019;t let that lift your spirits however- things are far from rosier in outlook&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Sound: Although many voices will seem familiar, they never seem entirely reused- though I am sure they have been. The musical accompaniment underscores the tense moments and action perfectly, and complements the cast work as well as the story itself.
<br>
<br>Playability: Easy as ever to grasp, the controls have been refined well this season, and continue to handle good enough for me to thoroughly enjoy the experience beyond the story itself. It&#x2019;s definitely taken some good cues from Wolf Among Us.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: You might not enjoy the choices you&#x2019;re given, but you can&#x2019;t doubt the excitement and anticipation their immediate and not-so immediate results bring. Surely this sets the tone for some future episodes, and will be one to remember later as well&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Replay Value: High.
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 8.5</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4137811">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1)  The Story line is still intricate as it was in the first Walking Dead series.  They take great care to tie up all loose ends, and it&apos;s chalk full of twists and action.  It&apos;s the main reason I come back to this game, to be honest.
<br>
<br>2) The Choices you can make are always on point, the dialogue options cover everything I would want to say in a given moment/conversation.  The plot doesn&apos;t have any hiccups depending on the option you choose, it&apos;s always a smooth story no matter the choice.
<br>
<br>3) Voice Acting has never been a problem in this game.  The only person who&apos;s voice acting is lackluster is Clem, which is unfortunate, but doesn&apos;t detract from the game much.  The surrounding characters are excellent.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>1) Character Diversity:  Is it just me, or are there 2-4 types of characters and that&apos;s it?  The really-really good guys who the player is supposed to stand behind 100% (Clem, Lee, Omid, Christa, Kenny) , the screw-ups (Ben, Nick, Duck) who seem to be in the game for the sole purpose of messing up to advance the plot, and the middle-of-the-road uniquely bitter/angry/strange people.  I can&apos;t find an exception, and it&apos;s an unfortunate missed-opportunity that detracts a little from the game.
<br>
<br>2) Long Pauses:  I found the flow of the game was often interrupted by long pauses in the game as the player is forced to search for things that were not  pivotal for the plot (the angel on the christmas tree).  Sometimes, the conversations dwindled on for too long as well.  Just annoying filler.
<br>
<br>3) Graphics:  I know I know, the graphics are beautiful!  A work of breathtaking and innovative art.... for still frames.  But over the course of the game, as the initial impression wore off, I feel like the graphics were a detractor.  The bug-eyed characters sometimes made me laugh when I was supposed to cry, and the overall lack of realism takes the game down a notch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4017690">Expand</a></span>

The tough choices that need to be made often have you questioning yourself, and whether you care for any of the characters. My one and only criticism of the game is that at times it feels a little short. For me, the episodes need to be just that little more longer (and not with cut scene&apos;s).</span>

This is the last season of this game, which I have bought. Every time a new episode is released, I don&apos;t remember anymore what was happening in the last one.
<br>For me this is unacceptable.</span>

Amount of times Clementine should&apos;ve died but was saved by a miracle is so high, it becomes difficult to believe to game. Almost all situations feel forced.
<br>
<br>Logic has been thrown out of window (why run from zombies when you can shoot at them until they get close and eat you? Also it&apos;s such a great idea to use the youngest member of the group in all dangerous events and not even give her a gun!).
<br>
<br>While in s1 choices didn&apos;t really matter, at least they made  difference and short and middle term. In this game -- they just don&apos;t. 4rd time in a row I&apos;m being asked about something and the option I choose doesn&apos;t matter at all. The person I&apos;m talking to ignores it and script just keeps going.
<br>
<br>To prove, typical dialogue:
<br>
<br>&quot;Clementine should stay here. She&apos;s...&quot;
<br>&quot;She&apos;s what?&quot;
<br>&quot;She&apos;s just a little girl, Luke.&quot;
<br>&quot;Maybe I should stay here.&quot;
<br>&quot;Hmm... Naw. Come on, you can handle a little recon.&quot;
<br>
<br>*Proceeds to take Clementine on dangerous mission, dismissing 20-something male volunteer.*
<br>
<br>Awesome, isn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>Things I liked:
<br>
<br>Graphics.  I find it&apos;s graphical style to be really beautiful and unorthodox for videogames.
<br>
<br>Immersiveness. Despite the lack of realism, the game is still pretty immersive and makes you care about Clementine.
<br>
<br>Also, story is bad in comparison to season 1 of this game. It&apos;s still better than in 90% of other videogames.
<br>
<br>Generally, I recommend this season for most players. But if lack of internal consistency and logic of story hurts you, this game is probably not for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4165315">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played the whole season 2 and episode 2 is the second best episode this season, with episode 1 being the first best then episode 3 being alright, episode 4 being quite bad and episode 5 being a real disappointment...in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Obviously the second episode had good parts and not so good parts. I loved meeting Kenny again, it was like season 1 (which was amazing) was replaying in my head. I liked spending time at the ski lodge and the intense ending. I also liked the intense beginning of episode 2 with Carver visiting the cabin, spending time with Pete in the truck and later finding Pete&apos;s corpse (really sad moment). The scene on the bridge was also quite unique.
<br>
<br>But Pete was killed off way too quickly; his character had so much potential and I liked his character from the beginning...He was much wiser than the rest of the cabin survivors and it would have been so much better if he survived a few more episodes at least, I&apos;d love to see his reaction to Carver and the upcoming events. When he got bit it made no sense. TellTale really shouldn&apos;t have killed him off - that was a waste.
<br>
<br>Another thing, Matthew. I felt like Matthew&apos;s death was unnecessary and there should have been a choice that would make his death avoidable or at least determinant. I feel TellTale just used this as an excuse to show us how reckless Nick has become after Pete&apos;s death - We can already see how Nick is depressed so there was no need for that little scene.
<br>
<br>Talking about Lee with Kenny was really heart-wrenching but there should have been more dialogue options to talk about the past, I feel it was too brief and in real life it would never be that brief - I know it&apos;s the apocalypse but it should remain realistic. Like seriously all Kenny says is that he got &quot;lucky, real lucky&quot; and that&apos;s the end of it. Dull.
<br>
<br>Moreover Nick&apos;s death is extremely disappointing in this episode and in episode 4 as well. In both episodes he dies in a stupid way. Episode 2 his death is so silly and very avoidable, Clem should have had the option to shoot the walker with the rifle Carlos dropped or stab it with Matthew&apos;s knife and what you say to Walter determines his outcome (seriously, he chooses to save or not save Nick after what an 11 year old girl says?!). I saved him in episode 2 but when I saw his death in episode 2 in a Youtube clip, I felt like that was really unnecessary and there just to get rid of Nick/add silly drama in the mix. After his death in episode 2, no one bats an eye apart from Carlos asking where he is to which his reaction would be the same as if you didn&apos;t tell him. Disappointing. Nick&apos;s role in episode 3 was pretty bad and his death in episode 4 was off-screen and even worse, Luke&apos;s reaction was disgusting and as usual only one or two people gave a damn and that was Rebecca and maybe Clem. Clem&apos;s tough to read and TellTale have made her into a very cold person - that&apos;s another disappointment, I know Clem has to be tough and everything but toughness and coldness don&apos;t necessary compliment each other. Lee had a better personality, sorry. I like Clem but she&apos;s different now - a badass, which is good but also a girl who seems cold and doesn&apos;t care about anything which is horrible.
<br>
<br>Also I&apos;d like to point out that teaching Sarah how to protect herself this episode made no difference later in the episodes which was very stupid.
<br>
<br>Overall there should have been more action in this episode. Clem doesn&apos;t do much other than talking and walking and I can say the same for episode 5 and most of episode 4. Apart from that and the problems I have mentioned above, this episode was quite alright....mostly because it&apos;s better than episode 4 and 5 and I rate it around the same as I did for episode 3; 6 or 7/10.
<br>
<br>I hope season 3 is better written just like season 1 and I hope that characters aren&apos;t so easily killed off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-2---a-house-divided/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862554">Expand</a></span>
