A New Vegas DLC that was worth the wait. Better than Dead Money, and MUCH better than Honest Hearts, Old World Blues gets the exploration/combat/story mix exactly right. Sci-fi campy without going over into stupid, it&apos;s actually made me laugh a few times, and think, &quot;Thats really twisted..&quot; at others.<br>The characters you meet are... unique, to say the least, but interesting and funny, too. The voiceovers are very well done and fit each NPC nicely. Some of the architectural design is a refreshing change from the standard &quot;vault interior&quot; we&apos;ve all come to know so well, and is a pleasure to explore.<br>Highly recomended. You&apos;re nuts if you don&apos;t pick this up!

Well worth buying, if only for the NPC interactions. Muggy, the Toaster and the Light Switches had me in stitches.</span>

There is some excessive dialogue at the beginning and end of the DLC that, once passed, led to a very enjoyable experience.  I thought this DLC was more interesting than Point Lookout and more importantly, you ended up with items that weren&apos;t worthless outside of Big MT.  An icing on the cake is the superb housing you get for completing OWB that is accessible nearly anytime you&apos;re outside in the Mojave.  My only major complaint about OWB was the gearing of weaponry towards Melee/ Energy Weapon users.  Regular gun ammo and explosive devices proved to be quite rare, so you had to pick up melee or energy weapon skill to defeat hordes of robot scorpions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712476">Expand</a></span>

The various locations in the Big Empty are all interesting to explore and stuffed with fun new weapons and armour.

Be warned though that this is far more Fallout 2 in flavour than any of the other DLC in either FO3 or NV. Its 50&apos;s pulp sci-fi through and through and highly entertaining to boot. A DLC that adds a decent amount of content and add something unique to the world. I clocked 16 hours on this DLC and I didnt explore everything. There are still a few minor bugs but nothing here thats going to ruin the experience in any way.<br><br>If you&apos;re a fan of Fallout 2 this is a no brainer. Simply put this is the single best DLC released thus far, and a real credit to the writing talents of Obsidian. Its funny as hell in that dark Fallout way.<br><br>Buy it. Play it. Love it. 9 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707961">Expand</a></span>

It sports a healthy dose of sidequests, new weapons, lore, and monikers the classic Fallout dark humor in all its glory. Speaking of humor, the ones that exist here are the strongest in the franchise with more brilliant fourth wall breaks and expositional dumps that aren&apos;t as hard to chew through as one might imagine. Although that seems pleasing, it takes an incredibly long amount of time for the game to actually get started and it hurts the overall pacing of the game.
<br>
<br>Your companions (appliances) are some of the best characters in the Fallout universe by downplaying their serious motivations given that they are household electronics. They are a lovable bunch and actually play a role gameplay wise. Gameplay wise, Old World Blues does its absolute best to integrate classic New Vegas gameplay into the mix given it takes place in one giant complex and it works..for the most part. While the usual caveat of stealth action and some new perks are great throwaways, the enemies do very little to challenge you and makes encountering them monotonous for the most part. The locations you are confined to explore in addition are not particularly interesting save for the lore that exists within this decently sized area that should take you about 5 hours to see all the ins and outs of Old World Blues.
<br>
<br>The funniest Fallout addition has quirks in keeping you interested when playing and exploring, but its combination of classic humor and general nuttiness is something so refreshing if you tire of the spells of seriousness that exist in the other DLCs, which makes this one the strongest of the bunch,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=6880713">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros: The plot was pretty solid and had right amount of &quot;wackiness&quot; to it. The length (&lt; 10 hours) was also quite nice, considering you have to interrupt the main plot when playing this. You also get some ok bonuses on completion.
<br>
<br>Cons: Some balancing issues what comes to difficulty level. I found the enemies to be too though. Basically you normal weapons do minimal damage against them and you have to use the special weapons provided by the DLC. These work only marginally better. You&apos;re also constantly low on ammo and aids, which isn&apos;t all that fun. This whole thing felt a bit artificial and forced. There are also some repetition in some quests that were boring and felt like a cheap way to add more length to the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343110">Expand</a></span>

<br>&quot;Merril4Life&quot; - It`s sad when DLCs have to salvage the game taht could have been so much more. DA2 is NOT epic, awesome and intricate. Look towards DA:O for that.

I like the game to be challenging, but groups of 4-6 fast nightstalkers for example leave you no chance apart from getting to higher ground or barricading yourself in a room with a door. From there you get to watch the AI wildly glitch and twitch around because they can&#xC2;&#xB4;t reach you... That&#xC2;&#xB4;s not the only flaw - sometimes it seems the enemies are spawning in totally inappropriate places, blocking your progress with a group that will take many reloads until you&#xC2;&#xB4;re ever going to be lucky enough to beat them. That&#xC2;&#xB4;s slightly frustrating... Being overrun by a mob of about 5 fast nightstalkers (strong melee opponent), 3-5 Lobotomites or Trauma Harnesses (strong ranged &amp; melee) and a robot (scorpion) or two occurred several times and often enough leaves you no chance but to run away. Being that this occurs with very well equipped level 40+ characters, I can&#xC2;&#xB4;t help myself but consider this bad balancing. Also, enemies from &quot;Wild Wasteland&quot;-encounters and others will spontaneously spawn out of thin air right in front of you. How can there be such cheap flaws?<br>Otherwise, the setting and story are rather engaging - apart from the annoying and rather uninteresting &quot;Doctors&quot;, the enemy design, the background info and story about occurrences in the Mojave are fun and motivating. Sometimes it is even fun to be surprised in battle by another foe that joins the fight. Thanks to the shortcomings however, I ended up quitting the game several times simply because I didn&#xC2;&#xB4;t feel it was fair or designed with the right amount of care...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705410">Expand</a></span>

Fallout remembered it&apos;s true nature and stopped trying to be too serious too often and made a dlc based on insane brains in tanks. World is full of challenging enemies, and the premise of romping around a secret tech base inside of a mountain is great. New weapons are funny, useful and cool.<br>Now the negatives, the enemies are SUPER perceptive. I had sneak of 100, wearing a stealth suit. I have ninja perk, and i still could not sneak up on people, ever. for sneak crits, i HAD to use a medium range weapon at least, unless I got real lucky. melee crits (the most fun and satisfying) were impossible. Perhaps this was a glitch, since if they detect you, they will never go back to being safe mode, only &quot;caution&quot;.<br>Other negative, most of the locations are too shallow, go into a base, and its literally a single room with a couple robots and some ammo. I was expecting LOTS of computers with cools stories, background, and other cool stuff. Half done experiments maybe, experimental robots/bio-creatures. they  didn&apos;t deliver. Though the rare story it did fill in was interesting. When i finished it i still had the &quot;thats it?&quot; feeling. Too few side quests and linear story.<br>Still a great DLC, but I feel it could have been much better with added depth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=1710296">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an open area like the core game that you get to explore and interact with, though it has a futuristic feel and you&apos;ll be coming across a lot of new and powerful laser weapons.</span>

<br>
<br>Surely, scifi-campy  the appliances, the stealth suit and such are quite funny, but there are a few points that I have gripe with OWB.
<br>
<br>1) The main quest is very short. 3 tech to Mobius, then back to base. It lacks the multiple solutions aspect of FNV; only there is two not-so-big choices about whether to kill something or not. Both the main game and Dead Money have more options in the questline.
<br>
<br>2) While the appliances are funny, getting all the upgrades are boring fetch quests. Worse, that the ending almost guilt trips the player to do those side quests, saying that I was &apos;rushing things&apos;, explicitly.
<br>
<br>3) The rewards don&apos;t feel fitting. Three mega powerful perks for a neither long, nor very rewarding, nor difficult main quest? That is a bit too much. At least for Elijah&apos;s LAER and the CoS sniper rifle you need to look for them, but  that is also pretty much about it. Look for them. Not someone like Kangaxx or Firekraag guarding them.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still not bad, the characters (appliances, the 6 robots)  and the ending slide are quite well done. But I don&apos;t think it deserves such a high score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=3410475">Expand</a></span>

It is so ridiculous and annoying that I was even confused about it. Every time I heard the voice of Dr. Mobius I had a strong desire to punch...lets just say it irritated me a LOT. Writing is not funny and is dull, this &quot;mad scientist&quot; crap is not fresh nor it is clever (it actually never was). Quests are mediocre too, just grab and bring like a dog. Things I really liked were new bad arse perks, cool weapons and fancy-looking lobotomite enemies. Um, that&apos;s all. I have never been so glad to return to Mohave Wasteland before. Honest Hearts is way better. An if you ask me, main game is better than all DLC&apos;s together.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=2624016">Expand</a></span>

The soporific and idiotic sense of humor ruins everything.<br><br>Not sure what were they thinking, but this is seriously boring as hell. I&apos;m starting to give up hope about ever seeing an epic DLC as it was Point Lookout, The Pitt and Broken Steel on FO3.<br><br>My verdict: Don&apos;t even bother with this, it&apos;s absolute garbage content, not even worth a goddamn cent. Go buy some bubble gums or Antidepressant. This reminds me of FFXIII, it was so damn boring that i couldn&apos;t beat it no matter how hard i tried.<br><br>My Rating: 1/10<br>Legendary failure DLC of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705684">Expand</a></span>

A very refreshing change after Honest Hearts. I LOVE that the professor from The Venture Bros. is a voice actor, plays a similar character, and references The Venture Bros. Very good game. Didn&apos;t really feel like DLC at all, but more a natural continuation of the game.</span>

However since getting it I&apos;ve played it more times than I can remember and intend going back to it yet again in the near future. The ONLY problem with it is that you can loose hours without knowing it while playing!</span>

You couldn&apos;t put in the the vanilla game, but it&apos;s here.</p><br><br><p> Unlike Lonesome Road, Dead Money, and even Honest Hearts a little, Old World Blues is completely free-roam, which is what we love about Fallout really. You do get sequential quests, but you also have a decent amount of control over which you do first. There are no human characters, but the robots are great. Really good. Any negatives? Well it is somewhat hard in places, groups of nightstalkers are never fun and you can expect to die several times from them. I don&apos;t remember them being this hard in the Mojave. But then, I say it&apos;s hard, others say it&apos;s challenging. Better than being too easy I guess. And I suppose the locale, which is fine, is a little uninspired</p><br><br><p>Old World Blues is like a &apos;stand-alone&apos; DLC. It&apos;s got almost nothing to do with the rest of the game, You&apos;ll complete it and it will have zero effect on the Mojave. But it&apos;s a great break in pace.</p></span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115940">Expand</a></span>

Plenty of humor and dialogue, though the first half-hour of the Think Tank arguing amongst themselves gets tiresome, especially the excess of phallic jokes. Toaster is a riot. Blind Diode Jefferson is my personal favorite AI, though I can&apos;t really explain why. Players will find that Big MT is the cradle of the Mojave&apos;s Cazadors and Nightstalkers, as well as the holograms of the Sierra Madre (Dead Money), and Rex&apos;s Cyberdog brethren. There are plenty of new killing toys to play with too. Old World Blues could almost stand as a game on its own.

<br>Old War Blues is the highlight of New Vegas DLCs, with a more sci-fi take on the Fallout universe and its fantastic and witty dialogue. Each character is unique, with a lot of great uses of skill checks to reward players for investing into their characters. The opening scene can mislead or disinterest players, but once it is over the player is given full range to explore Big Mountain and what secrets are hidden within. Most of the other DLC and portions of the base game do tie in somewhat to this DLC, and explain quite a few of the events that the player will or have already encountered. Like Dead Money and Honest Hearts, Old World Blues offers a new environment that gives a break from the usual bleak ruined cities and Mojave desert, and unlike other DLCs, seems to be the most polished one with the most content to offer. It has taken me far longer to explore Big Mountain then other DLC areas, yet it was absolutely worth the effort to explore every last inch of the place. While the main storyline to this DLC may seem repetitive, it offers more to explore and gain in each area the farther you progress, and rewards patient players with lore and extra content you would miss if you speed through the storyline.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-new-vegas---old-world-blues/user-reviews?user_review_id=7463209">Expand</a></span>
