<br>Pacing Done Right
<br>Bullet storm Full Clip Edition is a remaster&#x2026;
<br>This is for people that missed the game last generation
<br>I was one of those people and I&#x2019;m so happy I finally had a chance to play&#x2026;
<br>Bulletstorms 6  hour campaign is one of the best paced first person shooter campaigns I&#x2019;ve ever played through&#x2026;
<br>Here you play as Grayson Hunt who goes rogue after learning he&#x2019;s been killing innocent people&#x2026;
<br>And throughout the journey you&#x2019;re accompanied by different characters, but primarily your accompanied by Ishi, who is now half ai half human which leads to interesting scenarios in the story&#x2026;
<br>You&#x2019;re only mission is to get off of the planet.. And doing so the only way you know how...
<br>With guns&#x2026;
<br>This campaign is a blast and the dialog and storytelling is lighthearted comedic relief in the style of borderlands&#x2026;
<br>you have a leash that you can use to pull enemies into you or into spikes in the environment, you can kick them away and shoot them as they go slow mo in the air&#x2026;
<br>And killing enemies in all of these different ways gives you more skill points which are spent on both upgrading your weapons you unlock throughout the campaign as well as for buying ammo itself&#x2026;
<br>Enemies do drop ammo and there are occasional ammo crates.. but you&#x2019;ll most likely be refilling your gun with bought ammo&#x2026;
<br>And you do run out fairly fast, thankfully you are able to carry 3 weapons at once and the game is very generous with its skill points, so you never feel desperate&#x2026;
<br>Each weapon also has a charged attack just in case you do run out of ammo and don&#x2019;t want to switch to a new weapon right away or of course use them on the mini boss enemies you run into&#x2026;
<br>But the delivery of this campaign is brilliant&#x2026;
<br>Its fast paced, varied, and never overwhelms you...
<br>it isn&#x2019;t just enemies around every corner...
<br>it gives you downtime of crawling through tights spaces or climbing across gaps&#x2026;
<br>of listening to the banter between you and the characters you meet..
<br>This spacing allows enemy encounters to be fun instead of a nuisance&#x2026;
<br>My only complaint with this game at all is the fact that your squad is practically useless..
<br>There&#x2019;s an annoying enemy for example that you can only do damage by shooting its back&#x2026; and he of course has a magnet in him that follows you, never pays attention to your squad members&#x2026; and they&#x2019;ll just stare at him instead of shoot his back..
<br>It&#x2019;s frustrating and does hurt the flow of the gameplay a bit&#x2026;
<br>And enemies feel a little too bullet spongy...
<br>I hated using the assault rifle here even though in shooters that&#x2019;s my favorite weapon type&#x2026;
<br>Enemies take like 2 full clips to kill.. which had me ignoring that weapon for most of the game and just sticking to heavy damage weapons like the shotgun&#x2026;
<br>And the final annoyance.. The sniper rifle... you have to steer the bullet in air... no thanks.
<br>After you complete the campaign you can play again with all guns unlocked and equipped from the start so you aren&#x2019;t stuck with just 3, and there&#x2019;s also an echo mode where you can chase high scores and a multiplayer mode&#x2026;
<br>Which is dead&#x2026; during launch week.. So yeah&#x2026; good luck.
<br>This is basically a survive as long as you can with a group of up to 4 players. Killing waves of enemies as they come at you...
<br>And when I say the mode is dead... I literally couldn&#x2019;t find anyone&#x2026; so I played by myself&#x2026;
<br>Thankfully Bulleststorm is worth picking up on its own for its campaign...
<br>On sale though&#x2026;
<br>Not right now
<br>I give Bullet storm Full Clip Edition
<br>an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7221275">Expand</a></span>
