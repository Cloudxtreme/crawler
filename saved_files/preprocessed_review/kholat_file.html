Horror games for me have never truly been &#x201C;horror&#x201D;, I will admit that they have never been high on my list when it comes to choosing what to play. The horror genre had started to rely a little too much on &#x201C;Oh look something large and ugly&#x201D; is jumping out at me and let&#x2019;s not even mention the tendency to love the colour black.
<br>
<br>So when Kholat passed across my screen, my interest was piqued, promising open world progression with an immersive exploration experience powered by the unreal Engine 4. Horror games in my opinion have always sought to limit your freedom as a way to heighten your sense of tension. Kholat however manages to provide that freedom yet at the same time impress a sense of claustrophobia. Within a few minutes, the game had passed the goosebumps test, the shudder up my spine of a genuine scare and not one of the &#x201C;things jumping out at you&#x201D; variety. That sense of fear didn&#x2019;t leave through my playthrough.
<br>
<br>The freedom afforded to you by the game could be a blessing or a curse depending on you, the explorer. After the opening video, you are placed in a deserted train station, no heads up display, no objectives, just you and your desire to explore. There are no readily apparent ways forward and the initial finding your way towards the hiker&#x2019;s camp is up to you. There was no doubt in my mind however when I saw the path below that it was about to get interesting.

Unfortunately that was the best part. The game is yet another walking simulator a la Dear Esther only with enemies (annoying orange thingies). Luckily, there aren&apos;t many of them. The game is an artistic attempt to explain why 9 Russian students went missing in the Ural Mountains in 1959 sadly by using paranormal theories and ghosts (the orange thingies). A failed attempt in my opinion. The core gameplay is all about walking and collecting collectibles-notes that drive the story forward. With the shift button you can run but only short distances. When trying to run you will always hear heavy breathing which gets annoying after a while. The game has a map but it doesn&apos;t tell you were you are. You notoriously don&apos;t know where you are. That and the orange enemies are a major source of frustration especially at the beginning. On the positive side not knowing where you are makes you remember locations and using that knowledge you always trying to locate yourself on the map which is somewhat fun. Poor optimization. At 1080p the game runs on average 40 fps on a high end pc. Only for hardcore walking simulator fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kholat/user-reviews?user_review_id=5528769">Expand</a></span>

This game lets you figure it out yourself instead of it having to lead you with jump-scares, violin scratching, or a monster following you around. The atmosphere of the game is fantastic. Although the game does not make use of the more conventional &quot;get frozen, get warm, or eat if not you die,&quot; the games does make you want to know more about what is going on. There is no clear indicator of where to actually go unless you actually get there. For many people this will be a downer as most current games lead you there.
<br>
<br>Graphics-wise, this game is amazing. The visual effects help create an atmosphere which you have to experience by playing it.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack-wise, this game keeps it simple. I would have liked to hear a bit more music, as the composer sounds competent. In some games you just mute it or lower it. In this one, well, I feel it let me wishing for more as it is used properly and competently created.
<br>
<br>Story-wise is amazing. As nattigre pointed it, the story is inspired, but not based on the  Diatlov Pass Incident. Sean Bean is in here.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-- competent. Do not expect guns or magic powers or combat systems. It is just walking and it is done right. Running is your only weapon, and you have to use it right.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is well-crafted. IMGN.PRO did the best with what it had, and it is amazing.
