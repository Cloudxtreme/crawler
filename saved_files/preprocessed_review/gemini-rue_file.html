On top of the mechanics though is an excellent story. Set in a post war, high tech society the game evokes memories of a game called Flashback that was on the Sega Megadrive. My only complaint is that there&apos;s not more of it, it took me about 4.5 hours taking a peek at a guide once or twice. The story, voice acting and setting are all very well executed and if the worst thing you can say about a game is that there is not enough of it then there&apos;s not much wrong with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=1833308">Expand</a></span>

It harkens me back the good old days of games like Rise of the Dragon and Blade Runner.  The graphics are certainly not anything to write home about but the storyline, dialogue, and sound more than make up for this shortcoming.  Speaking of sound, there is not much music in the game but the ambience and sound effects shine through.  For example, the background rain and thunder during the beginning of the game, and the silent drone heard while walking into the lunchroom .. these effects suit the mood very well.  I am VERY impressed with this game and urge anyone enjoys old school adventure games to pick this up, it is worth way more than its $14.99 asking price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=1672300">Expand</a></span>

Puzzles are for the most part easy, sometimes so easy you miss the easy answers.  Music and atmosphere are top notch and the game&apos;s overall story definitely ranks up there as one of the better ones in an adventure title.  The bad?  Well the voice actors are definitely flat, very monotone and somewhat hinder the game&apos;s overall story.  Another low, the combat, it&apos;s just too awkward and infuriating at times.  It&apos;s especially awkward fighting multiple enemies with your hits no registering but the enemies do, which leads to some deaths.  Overall though for $10 it&apos;s hard not to recommend the game, yes the graphics look like Scumm&apos;s from the early &apos;90&apos;s but it&apos;s hard to fault a game for the graphics when they don&apos;t hide the fact of their art direction.  I thought the retro SCUMM graphics looked fantastic, but I can understand why others wouldn&apos;t enjoy it.   FYI game clocks in around 6-9 hours for one play through, definitely a weekend game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=2090288">Expand</a></span>

Some people might be turned off from the graphics, though I personally loved them. I&apos;m glad the developer took the time to de-grade the graphics to like a 16bit form, instead of a fancy over the top type. It made me remember the glory days of monkey island, and i really enjoyed seeing all interesting BG&apos;s.
<br>The gameplay itself is interesting, in that you aren&apos;t just clicking to move and interact. Sometimes you partake in fire fights, which turn the game into a kind of strategic gun fight involving cover, aiming, and reloading. Another interesting addition was the mini-games, hidden characters, special steam achievements, and added commentary to a playthrough.
<br>The audio and music was also very well done, and fit beautifully in creating a thick environment and universe. The kind that makes me now want to get the OTS.
<br>The only complaint I have is you can&apos;t just access your inventory or menu, unless you first click on a &quot;hotspot&quot; area.
<br>Anyway, I urge all retro-adventure gamers to try the game out. I believe there&apos;s a demo version from the official website.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=1822424">Expand</a></span>

I guess, this is the greatest positive side of all amateur games.<br>Yes,  technically speaking  they might be weak(as so in Gemini Rue) but who cares? An Adventure Game  Lover isn&apos;t interested in graphics as long as Game itself has a good  story to tell. Stories like  Gemini Rue has  for example.  As an Science Fiction junkie Gemini Rue&apos;s plot simply ravished me; made me sad, made me anger made me nervous, made me think. Without a good game  atmosphere these things can&apos;t be done. Actually good isn&apos;t the right word I should use word,  top notch.  Thanks to musical tones and again top notch dubbing, Gemini Rue captured such a emphatic game atmosphere which even many professional games couldn&apos;t .<br>As for last words? Buy this game! Support this game!  Games such as these deserves to be supported. Ironically I don&apos;t remember where to heard or saw this game but fortunately I played this game. It has satisfied my years of adventure game hunger. A taste which will make me search for new ones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=2437119">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is a gem for anyone who loves adventure game and deep stories. In this you start play as a detective who looks for a man who can find him where his brother is, but he never turns up for your meeting and so you go looking for him. This friend also knows the location of your character&apos;s brother, who he&apos;s trying to find.
<br>
<br>You also get to play as one of the prisoners in a rehabilitation centre omnimously named, Centre 7. You play as a man named Delta-Six who has his memory erased for the second time because he had attempted to escape. As him you attempt to break out yet again.
<br>
<br>Again, I highly recommend it to everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3406972">Expand</a></span>

The best I can do is say that Gemini Rue isn&#x2019;t terrible but too many people here are going way overboard on their praise of this game.
<br>
<br>The main reason to play adventure games (I think) is for the story. GR&#x2019;s is a cut above most of what you&#x2019;ll find in the adventure genre but it&#x2019;s still not what I&#x2019;d call &#x201C;good&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s simply okay. Nothing particularly memorable, though there are at least a few twists thrown in.
<br>
<br>Likewise, I loathe navigating through the UIs in these games because they often turn simple tasks into complex ones because of poor design. GR has several moments like this, too, where you&#x2019;ll know what has to be done but have to figure out the exact way the game prefers you do it.
<br>
<br>I will give it some points for puzzles at least having rational solutions instead of falling into the trap of &#x201C;adventure game logic&#x201D;. When you have to reach a ledge, for example, you&#x2019;ll pull over a crate to stand on instead of throwing a rubber chicken at a cat who will get a dog to chase it who will knock over a vase which will startle a mule into kicking you up to the ledge. Again, though, it&#x2019;s so annoying to have to point and click around to figure out the exact right combination of menu instructions to get up on the crate &amp; climb up to the ledge. I&#x2019;d much rather have a jump or climb button and be playing a different game.
<br>
<br>The gunfight minigame is a nice diversion from all the pointing and clicking but is inferior to any action game. It was a fun challenge, at least, to get the Steam achievement for not getting hit once during them.
<br>
<br>The graphics are retro, which means they are not so great and are around mid-1990s standards. Considering this, they at least do a good job of conveying the &#x201C;dirty future&#x201D; atmosphere the game is going for and set an appropriate mood.
<br>
<br>So if you like adventure games, I&#x2019;d say you will enjoy GR. If you aren&#x2019;t crazy about the genre, though, you won&#x2019;t find anything here to change your mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3907733">Expand</a></span>

The game has an involving story and unusually good use of pixelated retro graphics but is somewhat on the easy side.
<br>
<br>The game is set in a dystopian future and features a story that starts our mysterious and gradually reveals more about what is going on. The story has philosophical aspects touching on the relationship between memories and personal identity although it doesn&apos;t really explore the subjects in any great detail. The story is the best aspect of the game and is helped by the fact that there are two branches of the story unravelling at the same, the two of which later converge. I found the story very appealing and it kept me wanting to keep playing to find out what would happen.
<br>
<br>The pixelated graphics suit the atmosphere of the game very well and the visuals are nicely done. I think pixelated graphics have been overused in recent times, but here they are used to good effect.
<br>
<br>Sound effects are adequate but nothing special, voice acting on the other hand is considerably above average and matches the personalities of the characters well.
<br>
<br>The actual gameplay is the weakest aspect of the game. Puzzles are somewhat bland, not all that creative and mostly a bit too easy. The action sequences are nothing special and don&apos;t add much to the game. You could perhaps argue that in a strongly story driven game like this, having easy puzzles may be a good thing, as harder puzzles would only be frustrating when you want to make progress to find out how the story continues. Whether or not you accept that arugment I think that the somewhat lackluster gameplay pulls the game down a bit and keeps it from being the really great game that it could have been.
<br>
<br>All in all this is a highly recommended game for all point and click adventure enthusiasts, ar least if you think a good well-told story is at least as important as good gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498122">Expand</a></span>

The story was engaging enough that by the half way point i was interested enough to want to see how it ended.  Some twists at the end were enjoyable, if not fairly obvious and not surprising at all.
<br>
<br>Graphics  Obviously blocky and throwback style.  In some scenes it would be nice if they were better to clearly define things more, but overall I didn&apos;t find them problematic at the highest setting windowed mode.  The style is cohesive throughout and honestly after the first few minutes i didn&apos;t even really remain fully aware that it was such a low res game as I was following the story.
<br>
<br>Story  Good, but in some areas cliche.  The dialogue for the main character could have been a bit better, but some of the supporting characters are decent.
<br>
<br>Gameplay  The gameplay is what you would expect from a classic point and click type game.  The interface and double-click to repeat action method works fine.  How to examine items and use one item on another in your inventory was not self explanitory and really should have been more clear.
<br>
<br>Overall Cons -
<br>
<br>The combat is good in some fights and terrible in others.  While it is fully explained and you are trained on it, it just doesn&apos;t work as well in the real battles against multiple targets.  It&apos;s a bit clunky, and you can easily miss your target while they hit you ever time causing deaths.  On that same note, there are 2 specific areas that it is easy to die, and the game doesn&apos;t let you save after the chase/dialogue leading up to them.  This doesn&apos;t make it more difficult as you are guaranteed to get through the first one eventually by trying all the combinations of things you can do.  The second one is more luck and skill with the clunky shooting system.  In both cases it just makes you repeat walking/dialogue scenes for no reason instead of autosaving right before the fight.  Does this harken back to old school &quot;hard&quot; games... well maybe, but it just makes it hard for the same reason as those, cheapness, especially since there is really no thought process to these specific instances,  just do them until you get past.
<br>
<br>The real MAIN complaint i have about the game is a staple of the genre, but a foolish one.  Items and people in the environment that you need to progress, or objects you use in the environment will either not be there, or you won&apos;t be able to interact with them properly until you do something else to trigger their active state.  In cases with people showing up or calling you, this is fine as it is plausible.  But trying to unlock a door and being told you can&apos;t and then after doing the properly scripted events coming back and doing that exact same action that works fine, is just... stupid.  Similarly with finding a few items in the game that aren&apos;t there, but after you talk to the right people there they are in the same exact spot plain as day (and not put there by the people you talk to).
<br>
<br>I am not necessarily a huge fan of the genre, in fact I haven&apos;t played one of these games in probably 15 years.  I do remember playing The Dig, King&apos;s Quest 6, and a star trek one about 15-20 years ago when i was a young kid.  I generally get stuck eventually and have to look up a solution or two in every one of these games.  So this isn&apos;t exactly my forte, and take my review accordingly.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day it&apos;s a 8-12 hour game depending on how stuck you get.  The story is good, but gets pretty predictable by the 75% mark, but still worth seeing the resolution.  I got this game on sale for $2.49 on steam and spent about 10 hours on it.  For that price i have no complaints, but certainly at anything over $5.00 or so, it begins to push the money per hour of entertainment ratio that can be found elsewhere very easily if you enjoy other genres (like MMOs which give you a higher return rate on money/hr of ent.  the more you play).  Especially given that most of the time is spent running around trying to figure out what the hell to do and where to go, so a good chunk of that time is just thinking time.  If you were to follow a walkthrough and the do the whole game in one sitting it would probably take about 3 hours just to see the story play out.  If $9.99 or whatever it goes for normal price is worth the cost of a 3 hour movie to you, then by all means pick this one up, even if you just want to see it play out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3851748">Expand</a></span>

Youll even recognize some of the voice actors in it. Its got the same oldschool graphics and the point and click system best for adventure games. Great story, voice acting, game length, and puzzles can be hard at times. I reccomend to any fans of ADV games.</span>

It reminded me in some ways of the SNES Shadowrun visuals, especially due to the setting. It has a really enjoyable dark story in a gloomy dystopian world. The puzzles are easy to grasp but still make you think enough to not just click your way through the game and its dialogues. The mechanics overall are kept simple and rely heavily on the storytelling aspect of the game which indicates how you can overcome obstacles encountered. This is done in a pretty linear fashion that takes you through the story step-by-step. But with every puzzle solved, you learn more about the protagonist(s) and the people he meets as well as the dystopia all around him/them. The creation of tension is what drives the whole play-through and if you like a good story with a decent adventure element and some puzzles around it, give this a try. The only thing really spoiling the game are the mediocre graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802523">Expand</a></span>

This game was developed with Adventure Game Studio, so the graphics are extremely low resolution by any standard (320 x 200). In spite of this very low standard of graphics, the game plays very well. The point-and-click mechanics all work very well, you can interact with the environment, use inventory items, climb boxes and ladders, and engage in dialogs with characters. The main appeal of Gemini Rue is the sci-fi story. It is a very ambitious and dramatic story told without a hint of sarcasm. There are times when the story really pulls you in, which is the sign of a good story.
<br>
<br>There are also times were the story falls flat, where you can tell that the writer is a very ambitious college student (Josh Nuernburger). For instance, Boryokudan means &quot;violent gang&quot; in Japanese, and is the official, boring name that Japanese police have given the Yakuza so they sound less romantic. It seems Mr. Nuernberger decided Japanese was cool and typed &quot;mafia&quot; into an online translator. The way this word is pronounced by the voice actors is also bad. &quot;Boryokudan&quot; is very difficult for an English speaker to say correctly, and the voice actors have merely pronounced the word as it is spelled, with no attempt at approximating the Japanese pronunciation.
<br>
<br>The voice acting for the main characters is very good. Azriel (the main character) and the Director are excellent. For some of the lesser characters (the street vendor in particular) it seems that they just grabbed somebody off the street to read the lines.
<br>
<br>There is some challenge to this game in terms of figuring out what is going on and what is the logical next action to take, so it is engaging without being too difficult. There are a few puzzles in the game but none that I got stuck on. There were two instances where I got stuck and consulted a walkthrough, but this won&apos;t be necessary for most people (I tend to get impatient). There are a few action sequences involving shooting which are very easy.
<br>
<br>Overall I would say this is an excellent game for people who like point-and-click adventures and sci-fi stories. While very enjoyable, tt is not a perfect game and the graphics and production can seem a little amateurish at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3898310">Expand</a></span>

With It&apos;s noir sci-fi dystopia and the smooth jazz/ambient music the game sets an excellent mood  with all the rain, trench-coats and spaceships you can ask for. Yet, this mood can be somewhat distrubed by some minor annoyances: as another  metacritic reviewer wrote, the game&apos;s interactions often are too linear and directed toward the advancement of the plot  moreover, the game has few locations and after a while, they begin to feel over-used. What kept me playing though, is the quality of the narrative and the overall story  aside from that, the voice acting is well done and the flow is really good.

I played those games, and although I didn&#x2019;t thought much about them, I did enjoy them, specially the two most recent ones. So when I saw this game in a steam sale, I decided to give it a go, since it&#x2019;s a fairly recent installment from Widjet Eye Game&#x2019;s, but my experience with it was mixed.
<br>
<br>As I was playing this game, I was shocked to witness a pixilated sprite work, worthy of an early 90&#x2019;s game that made interaction with objects a frustrating exercise in pixel hunting. Let&#x2019;s just say that if you compare Gemini Rue&#x2019;s visuals with Blackwell Convergence (released back in 2009), the difference is quite substantial.
<br>
<br>In 2011, i really can&apos;t understand this design choice, some people might call this old school or retro. I however, call this a silly gimmick that only adds unnecessary frustration to what should be a fluid gameplay experience.
<br>
<br>But my gripes with the game don&#x2019;t end here, there is also the matter of the game&#x2019;s lack of polish, like rendering glitches, graphic artifacts, menus that only open when they decide, clunky controls, horrid item interface, bad animations, trial and error puzzle solving, and general low production values, that make this game a chore to play at times.
<br>
<br>However, Gemini Rue does a few things right, that somewhat save it from being terrible:
<br>The very engrossing, and somewhat mind bending, story that makes you reflect about the meaning of human condition, the amateurish but still very well done voice acting, the fantastic soundtrack and the general art work all add in turning, what otherwise would be a mediocre game, in to something more bearable.
<br>
<br>In conclusion: My experience with this game was very mixed, in one hand I hated the visuals and the frustrating gameplay, and in the other, I really enjoyed the story, so in the end I can only recommend this one to a diehard point and click adventure fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=4015774">Expand</a></span>

It is atmospheric, the story is thrilling and after all its just fun to play with the right amount of puzzles, dialogues and freedom. Despite its minimalistic graphics it manages to pull you into the world, even more so, it uses the graphics to their advantage.

<br>Gemini Rue has probably the most captivating story of all time in any game that I have played.  It&apos;s story line is movie quality.  So, why not a 10?  I thought a couple of the dialogue sequences to get someone to do what you want by constantly clicking another option after reengaging with them was tedious and unrealistic.  The graphics could have been better, though that&apos;s a minor complaint as it didn&apos;t take away from gameplay.  There was also a little bit of a lull to the gameplay/story in beginning-middle of the game.  Then it took off again and had one of the best plot twists a video game.  One of my top 5 favorite games of all time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3943966">Expand</a></span>

Fantastic story and impressive atmosphere, not only the oldschool pixelated visuals that always suited this genre best, but also fitting music. The overall neo-noir feeling and atmosphere reminds me of Blade Runner a lot and that&apos;s always a good thing. The future, intriguing detective story, dirty streets and rain, lots of rain, add in the tones of saxophone in the music background and you&apos;re there, that&apos;s why I loved this game, it struck a cord. The problem I had was with it is gameplay itself, which was always the problem with this genre. It&apos;s slow-paced, fine and ok when it works, but frustrating and annoying when it doesn&apos;t. Pixel hunting, trying to use everything on everything and all that stuff, this is really boring, I want to enjoy the story and continue without these interruptions, I don&apos;t want to go over all screens countless times, trying all sorts of stuff, I hate being stuck in adventure games, it&apos;s not about skill, not even logic, it&apos;s just an annoying process of finding out where you&apos;re supposed to click and artificially prolonging the game time. That&apos;s why adventures are mostly dead. But these problems aside, I really enjoyed Gemini Rue for it&apos;s story and the atmosphere which was an achievement masterfully done even on low budget much better than in many AAA titles. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=4647896">Expand</a></span>

The style of the game with the noir-dripping atmosphere is really appealing as well as the conversation choices you&apos;r given.<br><br>After a 4-5 hours of playing the game I might say that the  &quot;puzzles&quot; can be quite hard nuts to crack. But still, it&apos;s sooo rewarding getting back to the game the next day, with a new perspective of the problem which might just solve it. Great satisfaction.<br><br>Some minor problems (which aren&apos;t that big) is that it can be quite hard to find what objects that actually are interactable. You really have to let your mouse pass over all things that stick out just the smallest. This is somewhat neutralized by the games &quot;smallness&quot;. There aren&apos;t any vast areas to traverse which limits your problem-focused area. Which is good.<br><br>One other thing I noticed is the voice-acting. It sometimes feels/sounds like its recorded by &quot;amateurs&quot;. Now do not missunderstand me. It IS good, it just sounds like it was recorded at my place. With a basic mic and not in some expensive studio featuring famous-voice-acter-1 and famous-voice-acter-2.<br><br>I would HIGHLY recommend this game for those who like games with substance.<br>Yeah.

This game is very reminiscent of the old late 90&apos;s game Beneath a Steal Sky (which you can get for free by joining a certain &quot;good old games&quot; direct download site), but without the zany humor.  The puzzles are manageable, the more arcadey aspects are actually fun, and the atmosphere is awesome.  I had a good time all the way to the end, which unfortunately isn&apos;t that long.  Less than 10 hours, I&apos;m guessing, maybe less than 8, but it was a great time.  Get it.

Well- with this game, you&apos;re there!
<br>A sci-fi romp following a split story between a prisoner who lost his memory, and a detective- you point and click your way through this beast.
<br>
<br>Seemingly taking ideas from point&apos;n&apos;click adventures before it (Beneath a Steel Sky, Blade Runner, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream), this one manages to meld the lot and create its own beast.
<br>
<br>Story is solid, with some twists in the tale, &quot;trust noone&quot;.  Puzzles are plentiful, but sometimes a pain as items appear when a puzzle is solved on a completely different screen- or a dialogue box that you happened to have missed.  There are no &quot;real&quot; muliple endings, what you get is a linear story, but if you do something at the end you can get an extra line of dialogue.
<br>
<br>Graphics are very welcome.  Instead of looking &quot;old&quot;, the lo-resolution pixel art gives the game character, screamingly familiar to a mid-90&apos;s adventure.  Effects, such as rain manage to give the world a sense of life, even though the setting is so dark.
<br>The zoomed in pictures in dialogue were OK at best.  Compared to the games smaller pixel art, it felt to me that these had far less character- most of the time not fitting to the ingame graphic and voice.  Without these, I felt the game would have created more of a link to the player with their character if it were just the pixel guys opening mouths and bobbing their heads.  I hope they include an option to turn off the dialogue graphics in their next game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay was mostly point and click, with a gun fight mini-game.  Point and click was standard,  right click and you can (eye), (hand), (foot) etc.  The game is fairly short at roughly 9 hours, and a few more if you want to find the achievements.
<br>
<br>There is a problem that you can&apos;t pull up your inventory to look at items (there is no inventory button).  In order to look at an item you need to right click on an ingame object, then right click on your item (makes little sense).
<br>
<br>Bugs:  There were some graphic bugs, but nothing game breaking.  I found that sometimes the right have of the screen was garbled after a load.  Also, if you have an instance of Chrome in the background, dialogues could not be shown / heard.  It was all skipped.  One screen also had a graphics &quot;layering&quot; problem, where the background was infront of the forground (groundfloor of the apt building).
<br>
<br>Overall;  Gemini Rue is a great point&apos;n&apos;click adventure that should&apos;ve been released in the 90&apos;s... But it&apos;s out now!  There are a couple of bugs, but they don&apos;t break the game.  The amount of character and soul put into this project is worthy of a lookup, this is a game I&apos;m proud to say I&apos;ve completed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3942994">Expand</a></span>

If u can get past the graphics (which are terrible, but which also makes it a great game) and play purely on how good the story is and gameplay (point and click system) then you will love this! i couldnt put this game down untill i finished it without a walkthrough.

<br>am ehesten vergleichbar ist dieses kantige juwel mit &quot;beneath a steel sky&quot;, und auch wenn gemini rue nicht ganz so weit in richtung verst&#xF6;render umwelt und epischer geschichte geht, hat es eine absolut einsaugende atmosph&#xE4;re. die schaupl&#xE4;tze sind d&#xFC;ster und dennoch wirken sie warm, sodass man gerne zeit dort verbringt, die sprecher sind erste liga, und die psychopathische musik toppt alles. allein die musikalische untermalung kann ein schummriges unwohlgef&#xFC;hl erzeugen, welches schwer noch weiter gesteigert werden kann.
<br>vielen bugs bin ich begegnet, oftmals konnte sich das spiel f&#xFC;r eine sprache nicht entscheiden und schwang pl&#xF6;tzlich f&#xFC;r ein paar s&#xE4;tze oder textbalken ins englische. manchmal ist es nicht konsequent darin, avatarbildchen der sprechenden personen oben links zu zeigen und generell hat man technisch das gef&#xFC;hl, dass nicht genau bis zum ende geplant worden ist. seltsamerweise schaden diese m&#xE4;ngel aber nicht und tragen noch zum ohnehin schon seltsamen und komischen spielgef&#xFC;hl bei.
<br>
<br>nur ein bi&#xDF;chen kurz ist es, nach 12 stunden war schon ende und das spiegelt sich auch in den wenigen schaupl&#xE4;tzen wieder. aber das ist meckern auf hohem niveau. es ist sehr schwer sich vorzustellen, dass in den n&#xE4;chsten paar jahren gemini rue von einem anderen adventure &#xFC;bertroffen werden kann und ich kann nur sch&#xE4;tzen, f&#xFC;r welche massiven nachwirkungen es im nachhinein gesehen wird.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=2625248">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t say much else about the game without spoilers, but it is a dark and gritty space tale that jumps between two characters. Definitely worth checking out If you enjoy older adventure games like King&apos;s Quest &amp; Monkey Island.</span>

The one comment that seems fit is that the graphics in this game are akin to that in &quot;Beneath a Steal Sky&quot;. In other words, horrible even for 10 years ago.  Made by a single developer, this game comes across as the type of thing one would find in a developer&apos;s portfolio for a job interview, not a released game.  The voice acting is stilted and not evocative in any way. To it&apos;s credit, the story is somewhat interesting and there is some humor in it.  The best news is that there is a demo freely available from the distributor&apos;s website.  I strongly advise anyone thinking of buying this game to download it and try it out.  If you like what you see in the demo, it&apos;s probably worth the money. Myself, I could not get past the horrible graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=1559334">Expand</a></span>

I was duped into playing it from one of those best adventure game lists. It&apos;s basically a very simple and cliche memory erasing and reconditioning, existentialist plot with a very predictable ending. The dialogue is poor, and its basically a 1 hr game dragged into 10 times its length because of horrid pacing and super clunky mechanics and gameplay. A game that&apos;s only been a few years old that uses super low grade blocky graphics and terrible mouseover detection. You&apos;ll spend 90% of your time just moving your mouse over random blocks of color, hoping they are useful objects to use. For an adventure game, the item usage is also clunky and terrible. The production values and writing are gawdawful and amateurish, with lots of spelling errors, bad logic, really bad directing, plot design, game design. It was like a lazy game made for a school project and done in a few weeks. If this is the sort of game quality that should be expected from the best adventure games around, I think the genre is already dead as we know it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=3181251">Expand</a></span>

Fairly original plot that pulls you in, good music, fairly atmospheric sci-fi / film noir hybrid feel to it. Game is by the same company who did the 5x Blackwell games (also well worth a play for point &amp; click adventure genre fans). The timed &quot;combat&quot; mechanics can be a little clunky at first. Character swapping was done well though and the two halves of the story seemed to be paced just right. Gameplay is around 8-9hrs overall. Here&apos;s hoping for more Wadget Eye adventure games in future.
<br>
<br>PS: Ignore the morons whining because low-budget Adventure Games Studio engine indie titles don&apos;t have the same GFX or gameplay as $66m Crysis 3...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=4904947">Expand</a></span>

<br>Somewhat simplistic in puzzles and at times extremely annoying in their implementation.  Here&apos;s an example:

:[SPOILER FOLLOWS - Example taken from actual game]:
You click on glass door.  Door is closed.  You punch it.  No, says the game.  Can&apos;t do it.  You use a stick on the glass door.  Excellent!  Now there is a hole in the glass door, but the stick is stock in it</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Solid Adventure.

<br>
<br>:[SPOILER FOLLOWS - Example taken from actual game]:
<br>You click on glass door.  Door is closed.  You punch it.  No, says the game.  Can&apos;t do it.  You use a stick on the glass door.  Excellent!  Now there is a hole in the glass door, but the stick is stock in it (I know - what?).  You use the stick and pull it out.  Now you use the hole in the glass, reach through it and unlock the door.  You click on the handle and FINALLY (oh, thank the Adventure Gods!) the door opens.
<br>This could all be accomplished by figuring out that the stick should be used on the glass, and i thought we were passed that stage in Adventure Game Design where artificial time stretch was necessary to such a barbaric extent.
<br>
<br>Nonetheless, even though Gemini Rue uses these heavy handed gimmicky mechanics throughout its entirety, they do not go very often to such extremities as described in the above example.
<br>
<br>Story wise - nothing new, still pleasant.  Good sci-fi, post revolution, semi-dystopic, pseudo-freudian, penopticon of a setting, which creates a good atmosphere throughout.  Good mechanic of playing for two characters, which in this game works very well dues to a good cohesive glue of the main story.
<br>
<br>Overall - Solid Adventure.  Enjoyed.  Recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gemini-rue/user-reviews?user_review_id=7286845">Expand</a></span>

For some reason, they also added in combat which is beyond boring. The game also suffers from numerous technical issues such as the game skipping through all dialogue for no reason, or the screen turning black upon loading a save game. Both of which are quite frustrating. However, the game as a fantastic story and was well worth playing through just for that reason alone. It takes a while to pick up, but once you get near the end you&apos;ll be wanting to find out what happens next.
