If you only intend on playing the game once or maybe twice then this game is a fantastic gem; a great experience. If you want to play more than that then it has some surprises in store. First of all the UI and controls are ok but they could be so much better on the PC. Every once in a while (rarely but it happens) you just get royally screwed by these forced camera angles. Also sometimes it just won&apos;t let you click on a space and the cursor doesn&apos;t even show up. This happens a ton when you use grappling hooks and it makes them unusable. At first the game seems like it has a lot of depth but you will exhaust it soon after a couple playthroughs. You will know where aliens are waiting for you on maps and the base building is really, really shallow. The lab is completely worthless and spamming workshops is the best strategy. Research is extremely shallow as well. There just simply aren&apos;t enough things you look forward to getting.  All they needed to do is add completely random maps and balance the base building/satellites/research and this would have been an absolutely phenomenal game able to be enjoyed for hundreds, maybe even thousands, of hours. Right now you are probably looking at about 20-50 hours before you realize there is nothing more for you in the game. It&apos;s a real shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2712134">Expand</a></span>

The maps are too small and repetitive (The makers of the game said the player will not see the same map during the campaign...Well that is not true) 2. The maps are too scripted (Enemies wait for the player to reach a trigger zone, than they start to move around and attack. They do not move around the map by themselves.)3. Weapon upgrades are too linear (Laser is better than simple projectile weapons, plasma is better than laser and projectile weapons etc.)4. The campaign is too short 5. Weak tactical layer (no stand, crouch, lay...) 6. Weak strategic layer (Build satellites, workshops, power generators, laboratories, and a few other building and that all...It is nothing like in the old UFO:EU) 7. You can&apos;t chose the nationality of your soldier (why can&apos;t we?) 8. You can&apos;t place your base where you want on the geospace (why can&apos;t we??)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2760341">Expand</a></span>

<br>Being an old XCOMJAFTSStorm veteran, i think i&apos;m allowed to a little cynism. Well, let&apos;s recap the pros and cons, shall we?
<br>
<br>UP:
<br>-New Graphic Redone: after 18 years, it was expected. Visual glitches and cameras bugs? They were expected too. If we wait, the patch will come.
<br>-New Turn System: simpler, faster. Nothing to discuss about it.
<br>-RPG Characters Personalization: faces, voices, armour colors, perks, nicknames. Nice adds.
<br>-More Objectives: very limited(defuse bomb escort save), but always a plus.
<br>-PERMADEATH MODE: for serious gamers.
<br>
<br>DOWN
<br>-Inventory Is Gone: EH?! What the...? I cannot pick objects, i cannot use objects or weapons unless i equip them before mission? I cannot save my dying fella with a soldier who didn&apos;t start with a medi?Unrealistic at least. Dumbed down at worst.
<br>-Only One Base: HUH?!? No more transfers, no more base specializations, NO MORE BASE DEFENCE MISSIONS?? Guess the magichated words: dumbed down.
<br>-Enemies wait like morons until you see them: i didn&apos;t believe it, then i saw it. What the hell? You&apos;re the invaders, brainless idiots, just invade! You expect me to blast you, and only then you make your whole turn?!
<br>-DOOM3 Greatest Hits: exception to last rule, sometimes they appear FROM NOTHING, like teleported, in your line of sight. Alien Powers? Human Bugs?
<br>-All the World is country: you can kiss goodbye desert, arctic, farm scenarios. Gonna fight in Egypt? Pennsylvania market!    Well, I was expecting way less from the guys who ruined the civ series with the V chapter.
<br>The game is fun, dynamic, entralling. But dumbed down. Don&apos;t compare to the original, and you&apos;ve a good game. You DO compare, and you&apos;ve some irrealistic, simplified remake that&apos;s better than others(after-series, extraterrestrials, ecc).
<br>I am an old player, the original was my life, yet I mantain an open mind.
<br>But I&apos;m gonna beddy-bye with two night demons in my ears: Dumbed and Down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2683050">Expand</a></span>

I wasn&apos;t expecting nor desiring just a re-skinning of the original, but I wanted something that would give me the same level of experience that I had playing back in 1995. Unfortunately, there is not the same level of tension and malice that was in the original. The music, fog of war(&quot;where did that shot come from?!&quot;), dynamic enemy placement and movement, dynamic battlefield inventory(&quot; yes kiddies, when Bob went down, I ran through a hail of plasma bolts to pick up his medkit and heal the team.&quot;), aliens attacking your bases, soldier skill advancement, and other mechanics made me feel like the threats were everywhere and that I was in control to deal with the threats. With the current game, the removal of so many game mechanics for the sake of &quot;streamlined gameplay&quot; feels more constrained. I guess you can only make so many decisions on a gamepad controller...and continuing on this thought, this game, like many others, has been designed, primarily, for a console. It is an unfortunate truth, but most non-MMO games are oriented to consoles because that is where the money is, and console players are not seeking the same type of gaming experience as a PC player. I don&apos;t have a problem with the game itself, it is OK, not my bag, but it&apos;s OK. I pose to you if this game had not used the X-COM IP, what would you have thought of it? For me, I would have given it a pass, but since it had the name, I bought it,and with it some expectations. It&apos;s a shame. PC gaming reality has set in. Deep gameplay now goes no further than a console controller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2691514">Expand</a></span>

You have to ignore the payed reviewers, ie all the 10s that seem to think this game has nothing at all wrong with it. It is similar to the original in structure and gameplay, but in general it is highly simplified. Everything is simpler, this makes it less frustrating and tedious, but also means you have less control over pretty much everything. For instance, in combat, there are no more TUs, no more saving TUs to look around the corner after your move, or saving TUs for reaction fire. There are no more individual stats, so you don&apos;t have to go through and sack half the soldiers you hire because they aren&apos;t brave enough. While this is pleasant in some respects, it does mean that any time things go wrong, it is almost always because of some random number generator in the game. There is no saying: &quot;what could I have done differently?&quot; It is just a matter of chance in combat. Honestly the worst thing in the game was that it lacks the tension and suspense of the original. I was never creeped out or put on edge by what is happening. It feels more like an action game than a game of suspense. This is mostly the result of the music and the alien appearance sequences. In the original, if your character moved somewhere bad, he just died, in this game, the aliens have a spawn cinematic and don&apos;t get reaction shots when you soldiers first appear. There is no concern about walking into a room and getting instantly killed. This makes the game much easier, but also makes the game much less suspenseful. Perhaps there could be a game mode where aliens don&apos;t have cinematic sequences, and also get overwatch shots immediately on spawning. So all in all, much much easier than the original, still quite fun, and not worth $50.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2683115">Expand</a></span>

<br>The good:
<br>- Interesting action and movement system.
<br>- Four operatives classes (Heavy, Assault, Sniper and Medic) and their little perk systems.
<br>- Money issues. Yes - that&apos;s good. Adds difficult choices into the game. New guns this month or new base facilities? In old UFO and XCOM you never had money problems (except first month maybe, but mainly because of facilities constructions).
<br>- Everything that is researched gives some benefits.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- World of Warcraft style aliens packs with &quot;aggro&quot; behaviour. For those who don&apos;t understand. Aliens stand in group and do nothing unless you (or civilians) are close enough to &quot;activate&quot; them. Even worse is that when you aggro them they have they own activation movement. It&apos;s most annoying on terror missions, when aliens are aggroed on civilians then they discover you and activate again to move closer or hide better.
<br>- Simplified old game. Only one base. Can send only one fighter at a time to intercept alien crafts. Only 4-6 agents during mission. Very little variety in fighters and fighter equipment.
<br>- Research goes to fast and easy (at least on Classic difficulty). I didn&apos;t even have to build a single research laboratory yet everything was going way to fast. I never had money to introduce most of my discoveries. Especially with certain alien interrogations.
<br>- Cover system is somewhat odd. Sometimes a soldier just hiding behind a wall is considered a target, because he can lean out of it to be a target o_O. Sometimes it is possible to hit someone through a solid wall. Sometimes (on destroyed packs of lorries, hiding behind driver&apos;s cabin for example) you can&apos;t shoot out of a cover, because game doesn&apos;t recognize destroyed walls.
<br>- Hit or miss shooting system. You either hit or you miss. Bullets that don&apos;t hit disappear and do no damage at all. Compare to old UFO and X-COM where astray bullets destroyed random stuff, sometimes hit further aliens/civilians/x-com operatives.
<br>- Awful voice acting. Especially the council... &quot;Remember. We will be watching&quot;. Boo hoo.
<br>- Chrysalids are now laughable enemies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2714694">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t think I have ever even played a beta build of a game that was this buggy.  Line of sight bugs out fairly often, with soldiers unable to shoot on enemies that are clearly in sight, shots are frequently taken through walls, the camera on large ufo missions pops to the exterior view so you can&apos;t see your soldiers, bits of terrain flicker and move your soldier to the wrong position when you try to use them for cover, perks fail to trigger, denying your soldiers their benefit, unit&apos;s abilities disappear, meaning they cannot shoot and are useless, and the strategic objective has bugged, leaving me unable to advance the campaign and forcing me to restart.  There is no excuse for releasing a game in this state. Especially when it has so much potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2689531">Expand</a></span>

I started off playing it and was instantly struck by the very limited number of equipment slots, the forced nature of having to choose from simultaneous attacks, only being able to attack UFOs with a single interceptor (which if that fails you can&apos;t send another). It seems unrealistically limiting.
<br>
<br>Fighting past these initial impressions i got on with playing and for a while really got into the fast paced action style of play, would have probably given this a 7 at that time. Then i got further into it and realised that actually the controls are awkward and clearly converted from concole, rather than designed for PC, and they can be unsresponsiv too. Numerous times I&apos;ve been unable to move or select things and even the wrong thing has been activated. The most damning thing, in my opinion though, is the game cheats - I know that&apos;s a stupid thing to say but it actually really does. I was having significant difficulty on a mission and decided to cheat myself - play a move, save after success etc. What i discovered is that even though the chance to hit may say 66% (which it did in my case) no matter how many times i replayed a particular shot, with the same soldier in the same position it missed every time. Must have retried about 20 times. So now I&apos;m left wondering what exactly IS deciding whether shots hit or not, because it doesn&apos;t appear to be chance!! This on top of all the other little niggling bugs, glitches, limitations has really damaged my enjoyment of the game and left me feeling very mediocre about the whole thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2692534">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you&apos;re brand new to the series, you will most likely enjoy this game a lot.  If you&apos;re a die-hard fan of the original like me, you will most likely be disappointed once the novelty of playing a new XCOM game has worn off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2691544">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As I said, this game is different from UFO: EU(X-com: UFO Defence in america) it is however not worse or dumbed down. They may have simplified the tactical combat, but simplifying is not the same as dumbing down. Dumbing down is making the game easier and losing strategic depth in the process, simpifying is making a game easier to understand while trying to maintain or improve strategical depth.
<br>
<br>And XCOM: EU does the latter. The strategic base management is probably even more complicated than it was in the original and the tactical combat is, while streamlined and symplified, just as deep or even deeper than the original game.
<br>It now involves units working together instead of having 14 nearly identical soldiers just scouting if every direction. Ammo is now more important unlike what many 1993 fanboys are saying. Guns still need reloading you just don&apos;t need to equip your soldiers with ammo anymore. And most of all there&apos;s the completely new cover system. Now, when you move your soldiers, you actually need to think about flanking aliens, because shooting aliens in full cover isn&apos;t going to kill them. I&apos;ve come across a situation where my assault soldier tried to flank an alien but revealed another alien in the process which left him exposed. I then moved my support soldier in to throw a smoke grenade to protect my assault and used my heavy to suppress the flanking alien to avoid him shooting at my assault... Tactical situations like that would almost never occur in the original X-com so i completely disagree wit people who say this game is dumbed down.
<br>
<br>The things that were simplified are mainly things like Time Units and i think the new system is actually better. It might kill the nostalgia a bit but this system is faster, easier and makes every decision more important and rewarding.
<br>
<br>So, to come to a conclusion: I think this game is absolutely brilliant! I normally wouldn&apos;t give a 10 to a game. But I&apos;m sorta doing this to cancel out the zeros that were given. Because even if you preferred the old X-com, it&apos;s ridiculous to say this game is worth a 0...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682287">Expand</a></span>

You only have one base. The soldier management is bad. The tactical gameplay is also very simple. You have very few option.

The short story is: I like it. I am playing it. So, it gets an 8. Could it have been better? Oh yes. As an X-Com remake, it falls a bit flat. Simplified is a commonly used description, &quot;on rails&quot; is how I&apos;d describe it. It seems that somewhere out there in a secret gaming steering committee, an edict that games must become less complicated has been issued. Unfortunate if you believe, like me, that original X-Com succeeded, at least in part, due to it&apos;s complexity. Why should saving the world from an alien threat be easy? It shouldn&apos;t. This XCOM wants to do away with all logistics, deeming them &quot;un-fun.&quot; Managing multiple bases and multiple away teams is a hassle, they seem to think. And trying to arrange how multiple assets will deal with multiple simultaneous threats is just a big pain, in their book, much easier (and fun-ner?) to just pick one from a list. Weird trigger based alien spawning, channelling the action in corridor sized maps, tiny squad sizes, no free fire, blah blah, you read all this before. So yes, it&apos;s not a very good remake of X-Com. But that&apos;s not all a bad thing. It&apos;s still a good game. Some games are better for their simplicity. This game does some things pretty well. It&apos;s tense and fun, soldier customization is nice (could be better - why can&apos;t I pick my class or home nation?), there are advanced difficulty options (Ironman mode!), cut scenes are fun, kill cam is nice. However, there are things it could do better without changing the nature of the game as it was envisioned. Graphics rendering is sometimes sluggish, there are tons of clipping problems, there are camera and movement bugs, voice acting can be a bit shaky, textures could be a bit nicer, an option to remove the additional click for ability confirmation would be super. So despite all of this which mostly sounds negative, I still think it&apos;s an 8. Good enough so that when I get home from work tonight, I&apos;ll be playing XCOM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2685714">Expand</a></span>

You can decrease their numbers (quiters), but you can&apos;t save all, even on normal. It&apos;s like every time three new fires starts and you can put only one out. And you can do nothing to prevent that. If you&apos;re lucky random missions and council orders will help you, but that&apos;s save&amp;load game, which sucks. You don&apos;t have the power as a gamer to act when you want -- scan territories, put down alien infiltrations, you only react, and if you&apos;re not lucky with random events, you&apos;re screwed. I drop the game, as soon as I realised I can&apos;t be a commander, I can&apos;t sent several squads to investigate simultaniously different problem sites. WTF, I mean -- why I can use only one squad at a time, and on top of that I can&apos;t give&apos;em order to go and survey the country I know being under threat. I can only react. With one squad. I say **** that **** I want to run an efficient organization, Xcom, not this crappy excuse for &quot;last hope of humanity&quot;. **** it, it could be a great game if not for it&apos;s strategic component. Unless it&apos;s fixed, this game doesn&apos;t worth your money.

Wow, I thought at first, I&apos;m in for a real treat. Not. To keep it simple, after more than 10 years(15?), I expected more. After civ5 one had to see this coming, since good old Sid seems to have a new philosophy: &quot;streamlining&quot;. Oh you gotta learn to fear this word. It basically means they are taking a great game, stripping it of most of what today is apparently considered &quot;complex&quot; by the average gamer, and pumping it up with cool graphics. This new xcom is not a terrible game, to be honest. It is playable, it is also vaguely enjoyable for some time. But after you stop and think that the intro cutscene probably takes more space on your HD than the whole original game UFO defence, you start wondering. So, lets see. 1) No random maps. It does get old, fast. Aliens are placed in the exact same places. So, if you get the same map, it&apos;s a breeze to complete (and it&apos;s very boring). 2) more or less the same tech tree as in the original UFO. Now this was a letdown. So you have the usual laser techs, autopsies, some fighter techs. There are two more armors (which you will never use if you know whats good for planet earth) compared to the original, and that&apos;s as &quot;modern&quot; as it gets. Oh yeah and plasma, the mid-late game uber tech. I remember not developing plasma in the old Ufo just because I liked the idea of human soldiers in their blue personal armors and armed with mankind&apos;s best laser wapons, so yeah, I&apos;m doing the same in this one. Game is easy anyway. 3) No inventory for soldiers. I&apos;ll pause a sec here. So now you may equip one main weapon, one secondary weapon, and ONE extra item. One. Extra. Item. Next time you have to decide if you want to bring ONE grenade OR wear a nanofiber vest under your armor, just remember the magic word: streamlining. It&apos;s not b******t, it&apos;s streamlined. See how easier it is to accept. Streamlined, I&apos;m starting to like the sound of this. 4) No more Time Units. Now, this is sort of a meh. It&apos;s different from the original, not necessarily worst. It makes the game VERY boardgamish, like I don&apos;t know, bloodbowl, or necromunda. I like bloodbowl and necromunda. Actually, one of the games that comes to my mind A LOT while playing this XCOM is the pc version of bloodbowl. THe game also plays a lot like a blood bowl game, including the &quot;hmm should I or should I not blitz that guy&quot; feeling (if you played bloodbowl then you now what I mean. If not, well go play bloodbowl! Now!).
<br>5) Only one base. Very streamlined. 6) max of 6 squad members at a time. Oh now this is SO streamlined! Old XCOM was like 14? 16? and NO, it was not tedious, it was damn fun. It&apos;s a war, you are saving earth from an alien invasion! and you get a plane that can carry only six men?? 7) overall tactical combat is faster and cooler (cooler, not better..),and, yes you guessed it, streamlined! no more crouching, aim or snap shots (or auto), you got cameras following your dudes all over the place, cutscenes when you get out of the skyranger, cutscenes when you first meet a group of aliens, cutscenes when you leave the mission, cutscenes when you RETURN TO BASE after the aforementioned mission..no, I&apos;m not kidding, there is a cutscene for almost every tech, autopsy, live alien interrogation. Only cutscenes in this game probably take more space on my HD than all the games I played in the 1990-2000 period. 8) soldier promotion. A random class is awarded to your soldiers upon completing their first level. Cool, I though at first. So if my rookie kills his first alien from a distance, he&apos;ll become a sniper for having demonstrated his particular aptitude with long range etc etc.. no, not at all. It&apos;s random. So no more &quot;this guy is a sniper because you decide his stats are good for a sniper class. No, he IS a sniper, he can only use a sniper rifle. Also, when soldiers level they increase their 4 stats (old ufo were like 8 but hey! streamlined!).
<br>So bottom line, not an awful game, it has it&apos;s moments. As a successor of the greatest classic series of all times, it fails. Some would say miserably. Will be all but forgotten in a few months, while UFO and Terror from the deep will proudly sit in my pc forever, reminding me of how scary and hard and awesome saving earth in 640x480 may be. So tell you what Firaxis, I wanted to be wise and analyze and examine and think this out before voting. But then I decided to streamline my thoughts, so you get a 3 (because I played it a bit and it&apos;s not total crap)
<br>When in a tactical simulation you may choose between 15 hairstyles for your soldiers but you can&apos;t crouch, something&apos;s terribly wrong. Or streamlined.
<br>
<br>p.s. Firaxis is paying royalties to the Warhammer 40k brand I hope. ALL your soldiers and equipment look like space marine stuff.

<br>
<br>The original one also gave you a lot of more options, although I liked SOME of the solutions they used to accelerate the game&#xB4;s pace. However, it could have been more tactical.
<br>
<br>Its cool to customize your soldiers, but you should be able to choose the path for each of your soldiers to follow (to become a  sniper for example) but you cant. The game does that automatically for you.
<br>
<br>Some say it was dumbed down. It was, it doesnt matter how many people denied it. It was marketed as a remake but its a new (and simpler) game. I would have loved to see the old xcom reffited to allow for a faster pace (the old missions could take hours), but in the process too much flavor was left out.
<br>
<br>Sorry, but in the end, old midi music was creepier than this Final Fantasy Tactics with aliens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2689507">Expand</a></span>

<br>As the dev diaries throughout the game wait for the release stated, anything difficult or somewhat &quot;Not fun&quot; like base defenses or assaults have been cut out, as has the ability to send a reasonably large squad. It has been replaced by a Decent perk system for each soldier class.
<br>
<br>The Difficulty has a huge gap between Medium and &quot;classic&quot; which truly brings out the soldiers inability to shoot, while making the weakest aliens capable of killing swathes of units in full cover with one or two shots.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is fairly fun, stripping away the already incredibly barren strategic layer to do combat with up to a arbitrary six units each.  Choosing the units is a headache for human soldiers due to it being a cluster of lists, and the aliens lack any customization other then their individual names. Furthermore, instead of allowing humans vast customizeability  like in the campaign, the units are effectively pigeonholed into three to five &quot;sets&quot; of skills.
<br>
<br>Worse,  there are roughly only a dozen maps total, and only five Multiplayer maps, complete with knowledge of the best cover.
<br>
<br>While not a bad game, it is a thouroughly mediocre game for the time spent developing it, and it is not spiritually a successor to Xcom: UFO defense. It&apos;s a very different fish for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2684188">Expand</a></span>

Went ahead a bought it and I have to say, that wasn&apos;t a mistake. So I came here to see what others were saying and was pleased to see the majority agree with me. I also wanted to address the main objection the ones that gave it a negative review have: it&apos;s depth of strategy and, stemming from that, those who say that just wanted a retexturing of the original (which, if Firaxis did that, they would be saying &quot;just get the original on Steam for 4 bucks, Firaxis just sold us an update&quot;). They call it &quot;tactics&quot; but what they really mean is strategy (tactics being squad based planning, which this game clearly has and if they say it doesn&apos;t they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about). Is the global strategy dumbed down? Yes, yes it is. Is this Xcom circa 1990? No, no it is not. Examples? Sure: You can no longer manufacture things to sell to the countries for money (there is a different, simpler dynamic). Manufacturing of guns and weapons as far as I can tell is instantaneous (don&apos;t really have a problem with that, but since the major complaint is that this isn&apos;t a retexturing of the original, I&apos;ll put that in there). There are no longer any ammo conservation concerns during missions, you just need to worry about reloading (though there are a limited amount of special abilities). You can have only one base (but you can have an high number of interceptors and satellites so that, in my opinion, makes up for it espc since in the original the presence of your base had no effect on the game unlike real life or this game). The manner in which you build your base has consequences, unlike the original one. Can you ignite the entire map and let fire spread? Yes. Destructive environments? Yes. But you can&apos;t shot a GUN at a wall (you can throw grenades or fire rockets however [more realistic]). The basic complaint here from the negative people is that it isn&apos;t Xcom. They wanted a simple retexturing and updating of Xcom. I can understand that, but it&apos;s also something that you can get elsewhere (UFO Afterlite series for example). What they fail to realize is that there are a number of things that were annoying and negative about the original. Cone of sight? (Kantai *COUGH*) Who sees in that? If an alien is right next to someone but not within a side square they&apos;re not gonna see it? Gimme a break. TUs are still there but they have been updated to be more realistic, because, seriously, why does it take time to turn around in the original? The first part of a mission in the original might as well be a ballet with all the squad members twirling around to get around the vision cone. No sniper rifles in the original (seems like an oversight to me. Yes they had &quot;rifles&quot; and &quot;heavy weapons&quot; but that seems kind of dumbed down now doesn&apos;t it (Kanti, Lysh *COUGH*). There are more, but there is a character limit here.
<br>
<br>This Game actually expands the tactical and strategic options beyond the original. I&apos;m sorry, but having to manage you backpack like Kanti complains this game took out, that&apos;s not tactical or strategic. Being able to construct a base that makes sense and has position bonuses (like this new game does), makes sense. The main point is this. If you want the exact same, original, authentic, experience and gameplay you got from Xcom, but with updated graphics DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I don&apos;t want you buying it and then coming here and throwing a fit because it&apos;s not the same, exact Xcom. But if you want a different, enjoyable experience that takes most of the good of the original and adds new concepts and ides to it while still being true to the original, then you can&apos;t go wrong here. Are there some things that I miss? Sure. Are there some things here I didn&apos;t even know I wanted? Hell yeah there are. Would I recommend this game? Def. And that, in the end, is all that really matters</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682727">Expand</a></span>

(FYI -- beat the game on normal within 2 days, straight A&apos;s on monthly reports)
<br>First off, all battles are pre-destined; no individual rolls per move.  Example: 2012 Xcom: EU -- When the battle starts, the AI now knows and has determined (regardless of aim percentage) what will hit, and what will not hit.  You can save a game during a battle and soldier one will always make a shot, move soldier 2 to a particular grid square, he will make a shot and soldier three will miss.  Re-load the game, and the EXACT same chain of events will happen!  Then, depending on &quot;AI difficulty,&quot; the aliens will then move in for the kill and miss or hit.  Keep in mind, it already knows exactly what can and can&apos;t kill you, so depending on the difficulty setting ... it either misses or hits you as it sees fit.
<br>In the original, you could re-load the game, and have the same soldier shoot at an alien -- every time you re-loaded, it &quot;re-rolled&quot; the move, and depending on the shot percentage, you would either hit or miss.  The same was true for the alien movement.  If you had a 25% chance to hit, you actually hit your target once or twice out of four or five times.
<br>Anyone who&apos;s played games developed or associated with Sid Meier knows the AI is a HUGE cheat.  Who here has ever played any Civilization game and attacked an AI opponent, who was still in the Stone Age, with tanks; only to find out that upon attacking, that same AI opponent has miraculously teched to modern weapons and tanks, too.
<br>So, regardless of how well you do with your tactics, it doesn&apos;t matter -- the AI &quot;decides&quot; when you win or lose, with the illusion you&apos;ve somehow outsmarted it.  Poor, poor AI design.
<br>Now onto the other horrible changes -- You can no longer customize your soldiers as you see fit.  In the original XCOM, you had approx. 50 slot to place items on each soldier and it required a significant amount of micro-manage.  This though was not a chore, but a pure charm, considering that what, how and how much weapons/items your soldier was carrying, determined speed, stamina, shot percentage, reload speed, etc.  Every choice had its pros and cons.  In 2012 XCOM -- you have 4 slots per soldier, and each slot only holds a certain type of weapon/item, i.e. slot 1 main weapons (a rifle or machine gun), slot 2 sidearm (pistol) slot 3 class specific item (rocket launcher, smoke grenade) slot 4 misc (medkit, grenade, ext.)  That&apos;s right! Each soldier can only carry ONE!!! grenade now (unless you waste an xp upgrade on them so they carry two) You get one rocket, one grenade, one medpack with only one use.
<br>On top of that, you can only have four soldiers per mission (upgradable to 6), which makes the game unnecessarily hard in the beginning, considering there can be a dozen or so aliens (who NEVER miss, depending on difficulty), and your capped at 4.  That&apos;s at least a dozen incoming alien grenades at a four-man squad, whose max aim parentage is capped at 25% (not that it matters) on higher difficulty.
<br>Is an alien behind a wall or a tree?  Want to shoot that obstacle out of the way so another squad-member can have a clear shot?  Well guess what?  That ability is gone now, too.  Unless you can see the alien, you can no longer shoot freely at random objects, unlike the original -- that&apos;s a HUGE removal of tactics.
<br>Remember, that means you</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2690552">Expand</a></span>

While not a bad game in its self, the visual effects and game play can be considered enticing it is in no way a faithful recreation. The main reason is that they have stream lined the game for the average gamer in today&apos;s age. For example, maps are no longer randomly generated and in comparison very small. Each town map will only consist of 1-3 enter-able buildings and there is no longer the heart-stopping event of walking down your own ships ramp. To compensate for this they have lowered the amount of enemies you will encounter, and the amount of troops you can field. Also the &quot;LOS&quot; system is completely different then the original game as well, its been reduced to a &quot;gears of war&quot; style based combat that will have your units being able to shoot through walls, trucks, and the occasional entire building to hit an enemy on the other side that is only &apos;visible&apos; to 1 of your squad members. In tandem with this aliens them selves are no longer random as well, they are strategically placed in groups around the map and will not ACT in any way until one of your units spots the group, giving the aliens a free &apos;ACTION&apos; move. Therefore if you come across a map you&apos;ve already played you are able to take strategic positions against a group of aliens you haven&apos;t even discovered. Further limitations occur within the base, currency is never a problem even when they removed Construction times on items, and the ability to sell what you make. Only one base is available and it will never come under attack. Also the game is incredibly rushed the larger alien ships seem to appear almost instantly and can be shot down by normal-human aircraft. After you clear just a single of these vessels you get the ability to trace the UFO back to where they come from, and develop powers for your units. The only reason they say this game can provide &quot;Hundreds of hours of game play&quot; is because they Expect multiple play throughs, which again is a contradiction to the original where 100 hours may not finish even one.
<br>
<br>The final result is, if you haven&apos;t played the originals in an extremely long time or at all you will have an extremely fun time as it is a successful game (even if it is extremely easy unless on the hardest difficulty). Although if like me, and you have the DOS version installed on your computer which you boot up now and then, this game will feel like a disappointment and I would not recommend the purchase at 50$</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696921">Expand</a></span>

<br>- free shooting (clearing walls for sniper etc)
<br>- action points instead of two movements
<br>- UFOPEDIA! - the Archive provided in Lab is a JOKE! There should be UFOPEDIA with nice drawings
<br>- realism - have You seen lock on Sniper rifle? Is this a cartoon or action strategy?
<br>- UFO ranks: medic, navigator etc.
<br>- random missions
<br>- random number generator
<br>- more things to research

Many missions are buggy (its fun losing a whole squad to a disabled bomb that still blows).  Cars constantly blow up (seems Michael Bay had a hand in this games development...) at even the slightest provocation taking your men with them, wouldn&apos;t be so bad if the &apos;flame&apos; visual indicator wasn&apos;t buggy and only showed up 1/2 the time.  The alien AI is pretty simplistic with them just standing around for you to find them on any given map.  The strategic portion of the game was really dumbed down since the original, apparently picking up a med kit from a fallen ally was just &apos;too complex&apos; for todays gamers...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2683764">Expand</a></span>

It is a very faithful representation of the original, and if you were a fan (like I was), you will probably enjoy this as well.  The fact that the economy/base building aspect wasn&apos;t cut was a huge plus to me.  Now, to be clear, there are a few changes/issues.  Difficulty is not so high, and you won&apos;t have everyone die as soon as they step off the transport for the first mission (this can be either good or bad).  The soldier voices are all bland American accents, and while it&apos;s a small thing it&apos;s jarring in a squad of international operatives.  The loadout is a more simplified than I&apos;d like, but not enough that it annoys me.  Anyway, apart from a few minor issues I feel XCOM is an extremely fun game and well worth a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682335">Expand</a></span>

The easy and normal difficulties make the single player portion of the game new-player friendly, while the classic and impossible difficulties, combined in the Ironman (autosave only) option transform this game into one of the most tactical and challenging experiences ever created.
<br>
<br>While the single player has tremendous replay value, there is also a full-featured multiplayer side, which includes LAN play, unranked, and ranked matches and the ability to build your custom team with thousands of options.  And yes, you read that correctly, this game has actual RANKED multiplayer, using the Elo rating system (similar to WoW, LoL, and Starcraft 2).  All this means that XCOM: EU provides one of the best single player experiences along with competitive multiplayer you won&apos;t find in any other turn based strategy game on the market, period.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2681914">Expand</a></span>

XCOM challenges you to do it all: make tough tactical choices with your squad, and strategic ones with panicky nations around the world.  There&apos;s nothing like that primal scream you let out when your hand-picked assault element gets vaporized, or when your rooftop sniper picks off a Sectoid Commander like a bolt out of the blue.  Sure, there are weaker elements, like the air intercepts, limited maps, or simple dig&apos;n&apos;build antfarm base, but they&apos;re ourweighed by the appeal and challenge of This fun, well-built game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682268">Expand</a></span>

Ignore Lysh or whatever his name is. Honestly this game is astounding and even though i wasn&apos;t there for the original XCOM, this game somehow manages to turn a turn-based strategy and management sim into something that is out of this world (no pun intended). The game itself is very very fun but be warned- when your soldiers die- it almost feels like part of the time you spent in the game itself died. Trying to NOT get invested is difficult. Your soldiers level up after battle experience and after each battle you&apos;ll garner resources from the aliens you&apos;ve killed/ captured. With regard to the mangement system , Firaxis has managed to turn something that should have been tedious and boring into an intriguing and tactical. Placement of different Facilities inside your base actually counts towards the effectiveness of said buildings. Missions issued from the Council of Nations that funds the XCOM initiative are sporadic and almost always unique. One day you might be saving a Council member&apos;s buddy from abduction. the next you&apos;re giving laser pistols to the Chinese Army to get more engineers into the XCOM initiative. You, the player truly are the Commander of the XCOM project, from researching new weapons to fight the aliens, managing missions and your base, to actually controlling your troops on the ground and interceptor jets in the skies. This game truly has limitless potential, especially if Firaxis will later release the ability to mod the game. The inclusion of Multiplayer with the ability to play as the Alien Menace is also very fun and very cool. Definitely one of the best games I&apos;ve seen this year. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2681964">Expand</a></span>

<br>this might work in terms of game mechanics (1 accessory slot) but the original game had a backpack with space, belt with space. Additionally, you only had as much ammo as you could carry, which made for interesting situations. I&apos;ll cut the boring list of what this game is not short.

I spent the last week playing the original X-Com to see if all the things I loved and hated from the original were still there. Not all of them were but that isn&apos;t a bad thing. The game can and will treat you in the most brutal fashion possible if you make poor choices. For those of us that played X-Com on Super Human back in the day this is a great reminder of the level of foresight needed to keep ahead of the alien menace. Play has been streamlined and the range of options has been reduce. The clunky inventory management has been removed. Your soldiers take only what they need. While I can appreciate this minor re-visioning I think the option to scrounge from the battlefield mid combat was part of what made the original X-Com great. The software its self is flawless. 16 hours in and not a single bug encountered. No glitches, hitches, or any such frustrations which plague current day pc gaming.  In all this game stands an excellent chance at revitalizing the turn based strategy Genre and I hop the franchise lives on in this format for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2683920">Expand</a></span>

That would then explain how the marketing team was able to pull off a top sales item in a pre-release sale.
<br>
<br>&quot;Well core principles from the original that we wanted to build on was basically everything&quot; -Jake Solomon(Lead designer) I personally believe they removed just about every single good tactical piece from the original. If by build, you mean remove, then well done. In this game you are unable to interact with the ground, or move invetory of one soldier to another soldier. What a soldiers takes into battle is what they get, no more and no less(Unless they use the items they bring in, then it&apos;s used up and leaves them with nothing).
<br>
<br>Only allowed one operations base, and to go with that only a single strike team can be deployed at a time. This causes a &quot;choose your own ending book&quot; style of play. Not a bad idea, but its not XCOM.
<br>
<br>&quot;Another big thing we did to the game was we added cover&quot; I can only LOL. Just because you didn&apos;t recognize it in the older game, doesn&apos;t mean it was not there. Furthermore, I often have my soldiers throwing grenades through walls and objects that should cause the grenade to either detonate or change trajectory however passes directly through the obstacle.
<br>
<br>While other times I may throw a grenade or line up a &quot;seemingly&quot; perfect clear flanking shot to have it be obstucted by off to the side objects. Major failure to utilize the Unreal engine&apos;s capabilities.
<br>
<br>&quot;We got these great dramatic scenes where you know your snipers can line up a super long shot and you&apos;ll see it[Camera] follow it right down the barrel&quot; -Jake Solomon
<br>
<br>I&apos;m finding that my definition of &quot;Super long&quot; is quite different as even down a clear street in the game I cannot shoot very far at all. While my forward soldiers can see and identify the E.T. My sniper in the back when trying to shoot, is told no targets. Out of range? Unlike in the original game where you could shoot freely, this game requires that you take aim at a hostile, in sight target and also that it&apos;s within a certain range of the firing soldier. While having a completely destroyable map, what good was all that design work when you fail to allow the player to shoot at that map intentionally? Oh, I know the answer to why the game fails here in this aspect. The invetory system being removed along with the addition of unlimited munitions created a major catch 22.
<br>
<br>&quot;Mission control was really important because that&apos;s where the geoscape is, and that&apos;s the heart and soul of the game&quot; -Greg Foertsch
<br>
<br>The heart and soul of the old game was infact the geoscape. The geoscape in this new mess is nothing more than an interactive, push (X) to continue, movie.
<br>
<br>The missions are linear and not randomly occuring which kills the replay value. Not only are the encounters not random, the maps are also not random, nor is the placement of the enemies within. Which is a formula for major dissapointment, not only in an XCOM game, but ANY tactical game. The enemies, no matter which difficulty, are just waiting for you to find them before they become &quot;Active&quot; The enemies do not make actions until you stumble upon them, sometimes you can make a lot of noise and maybe they will move. Generally not, it seems that the A.I. doesn&apos;t care how many explosions or windows are broken, until after you see them. More aptly called Artificial Downs instead of Artificial Intelligence.
<br>
<br>&quot;We wanted to introduce a new system over time units to allow a little more free space in the player&apos;s mind so they didn&apos;t have to keep track of how far they could move and what actions they could take&quot; -Jake...
<br>
<br>Dear Jake, I&apos;m certain there is absolutely no shortage of [empty]space in your mind.
<br>What&apos;s a worse scenario? Using 7 extra time units because you moved to the wrong space or using your entire turn and putting your solider one spot out of cover on account of the new lousy camera?
<br>
<br>During my most recent mission, I had 4 squad members deployed, one on the roof of a two story building, two of them directly below looking out the windows and one member along the side of the building.
<br>The member on the side of the building spots 3 hostiles, the member on the roof cannot take action against them. It is quite clear there are no obstructions preventing the roof top member from shooting with his sniper rifle yet cannot fire because &quot;No targets&quot;, so I choose overwatch for that member and the aliens start to move. The very first action the alien takes is to shoot at my rooftop sniper with his plasma pistol causing a 9 damage critical hit. The alien did not move before or after firing. Too bad the game was released in it&apos;s current state. I find it nearly unplayable as a strategy tactical game. This game was at minimum 8 months of intelligent tuning away from being finished.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2685452">Expand</a></span>

This way you get a game that evokes the awesomeness of the X-Com games of the past, but brings in new elements to re-imagine it. Let your nostalgia go free and enjoy something new and awesome. I found the tutorial a little confusing (does it have an end?) but I&apos;m loving this game. I heard somebody say that it&apos;s basically like crack and I highly agree.

This is more like Mass Effect than XCOM. There&apos;s almost no tactics involved, the game holds your hand, tells you what to do, and blocks you from doing anything that might resemble &quot;player choice&quot; at every stage. The actual &apos;choices&apos; the game does present you are akin to &apos;do you want a red or blue plastic cup&apos; -- they are utterly meaningless. UFO Defense and TFTD were games about tactical combat and strategic planning, not cutscene driven narrative. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is all about clicking &apos;attack&apos; and &apos;move&apos; hotspots and watching cut scenes. There&apos;s no strategy involved. Do you consider &apos;Paint by Numbers&apos; and &apos;Connect the Dots&apos; to require strategic thinking? The awful voice acting, prebuilt repeating maps, and inability to design your own bases really don&apos;t even factor into the final verdict because the core game is just so utterly, utterly pointless. The people that rate this game highly deserve to continue eating such dumbed down generic spew. I&apos;m just sad that instead of getting another good XCOM game we got... this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2686788">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A brilliant and ambitious re-imagining of the original X-COM games.  Not 1:1, and many of the features have been streamlined, changed, or removed, but it still captures the same fundamental feeling of terror, and each round of the game&apos;s turn-based tactical combat is a knuckle-biting affair.  Absolutely a contender for GOTY 2012.</span>

The game has been dumbed down for console players. The multiplayer options suck. You can&apos;t play the campaign with buddies.

<br>
<br>You are limited to 4 squad members to start, you cannot build or manage new bases, the maps are pre-done rather than random (and can repeat through a game), and virtually all of the strategic portions of the original X-Com have been deleted. I suspect this was done to &quot;attract the CoD/GeoW audience&quot; but it just makes the unsuitable for any true strategy gamer and its slow pace will certainly keep away the FPS fans. Now this is not specifically a &quot;bad&quot; game, and if you are the type of gamer who thought &quot;wouldn&apos;t it be cool to command a Gears of War squadron (dressed in Mass Effect armor) in a turn-based game but without all those unnecessary strategic elements, new base building, and micro-managing&quot; then this is the game for you. X-Com EU has loses the overall strategic gameplay, and is all turn-based action with Mass Effect armor and guns. Not for me, but who knows, there might be an big undiscovered market for this game type.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682603">Expand</a></span>

The bits that added little to the (classic) original have been removed or altere while tactical (combat based) and strategic (&quot;base&quot; based) options have been added that actually add to ythe thought that&apos;s required to succeed. Examples Disembarking  - man that was a pain, one well placed grenade and your entire squad wiped before you&apos;d started your second turn and split up to avoid being one large target for me this always meant a reload of a saved game. It just annoyed me when it happened, now it doesn&apos;t. &quot;Bug hunt&quot; endings. Scouring maps for that one last alien who had decided to stand in a cupboard, 90 minutes trying to find it, ending up just being bored and making a careless mistake or just quitting the game - gone...Unrealistic micro customization - In the original you could force any soldier to become anything. That&apos;s not realistic at all. A 5 foot 3 sharpshooter moulded into being a musclebound heavy weapons carrier &quot;just because you need one&quot; It might offer you control - but at the expense of any level or realism. The movement simpified in use, but actually increased in tactical options. Moce a squad member a level? Easy!  - No special button to take the view up or down required, how about over a wall or through a window. SImple, no 3 level menu system to go through, it will calculate it, and you will know whether you have the ability to continue with another action after or not.  All the calculations are there if you play, but they are transparent to the user, leaving you just to work out what is best rather than micro analysing action points. Supression fire? Opportunity fire, different levels of cover? These allow you to work out some pretty snazzy tactics. Your troops level in a way that makes it fab. Actual abilities are learned that expand your tactical options, some are passive, some used on a turn based &quot;cooldown&quot; - all make a difference if used in the right place. Morale, Psi attacks. It&apos;s all there - it just doesn&apos;t require micro management. I thought I would miss micro management - but I don&apos;t - not one bit. For me - someone who loves to see a proper AAA turn based game (at LAST - after Sooooo many FPS..aren&apos;t FPS bored to tears with the same game being sold over and over and over and over) Xcom is a breath of fresh air. The moddability of the PC game means we can expect maps, missions and TC&apos;s in the next few months that will keep this game on my hard drive and being played almost indefinitely. 10/10 Best game I&apos;ve played since Jagged Alliance 2 or Rebelstar. Well done Firaxis, after the relative mess of Civ 5 you are back with a bang. Best game of 2012 by a mile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682539">Expand</a></span>

I feel that Firaxis have tried to capitalise on the popularity of the original with the &quot;older&quot; gaming crowd, whilst simulateously simplifying the game to run on the limited user interface of a console (and indeed, to appeal to the more &quot;casual&quot; gamer)  It&apos;s been a massive disappointment to me and a complete waste of money.  At least, do yourself a favour and play the demo first but bear in mind that the game really does not get any better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2688209">Expand</a></span>

Siliconids and Mutons and Etherials, and so on, are on earth again! If someone tells you &quot;You cant destroy Buildings, there is no reaction Fire and there arent any different fire modes&quot; he is flat lieing to you. Some peoples should actually play the Game first and then make a review. But thats just my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682016">Expand</a></span>

I watch a single Alien shotgunner walk through 5 &quot;reaction&quot; overwatch shots, not getting hit a single time, and instantly critting my Heavy in the face. **** It&apos;s a good game, but it&apos;s weighed down by similar ridiculous moments. Similar to how someone standing in full cover, BEHIND a solid wall, can be insta-killed with plasma without even scratching the wall. Another example is how an alien walses through the entire map in one turn and insta-crits my most valuable soldier. This game is based off nothing but luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2689118">Expand</a></span>

And Gameplay will get you hooked in no time. Replay value is tremendous. And if you want quick fix just jump in to the multiplayer. Highly recommend to all true gamers up there!

Losing a soldier or failing a mission is all a part of the gameplay and is implemented even from the first mission. The customization of your soldiers brings losses to a whole other level as well. I love this game and will be playing it for a long time to come!</span>

Ignore the hater and trolls, they are still stuck in nostalgia limbo to even make a thorough and non-biased review. The developers decided on a smaller squad to stress the importance of tension and making your squad actually mean something. The graphics are wonderful UE3 engine works well with this type of game and I like the art style direction. This will ensure this game will age properly. Overall, this game is a masterpiece and should be a candidate for GOTY against Dishonored. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2682567">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3203596"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This is a great game. It really is. But there are a few caveats you should consider before buying it.
<br>
<br>Most importantly: You *will* have to helplessly watch some of the soldiers  you lovingly named, outfitted and leveled  die. And it&apos;s even more likely you will watch innocent civilians die on your watch. The latter are nameless and you may not find yourself caring about them as much, but still...
<br>
<br>Another thing I found... unusual... is that the developers did their utmost to make gaming the outcome of random rolls impossible. All shots fired are based on pre-rolled seeds, so quick-loading wouldn&apos;t change the outcome. If there was quick-loading. But there isn&apos;t. There&apos;s quick-saving, yes, but there&apos;s no quick-loading. You will have to go to the menu to load a game. And the menu isn&apos;t available while there&apos;s alien activity or a cut-scene. And did I mention that higher difficulties cause the game to continuously save every little thing, so loading a save won&apos;t revert to an earlier state anyway? That&apos;s even more... um... unusual. The developers said they wanted players to commit to their actions. I say it discourages experimentation. You cannot simply try things out, because it may cost you soldiers.
<br>
<br>Speaking of cut-scenes: Every time a group of aliens spots you, there&apos;s a cut-scene. Every time one of your base team members makes a remark, there&apos;s a cut-scene. Every time your troops leave the base or return to it, there&apos;s a cut-scene. And so on. While all of these cut-scenes are short, they will most definitely become aggravating over time and reduce the fun of a second play-through.
<br>
<br>I would have given this game a rating of nine, because I enjoyed it an awful lot, but the reduced replay value made me subtract a point. The number of paid shills on this board cost it another. I&apos;ve read quite a few of those ten reviews and they all smell funny. That kind of behaviour mustn&apos;t be rewarded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203596">Expand</a></span>

I played the original XCOM game back in the mid-90&apos;s and I kept seeing people talking about this game called XCOM: Enemy Unknown, not realizing they actually remade it a couple of years ago. As soon as I figured it out, I went and got it.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think there are comparisons to be made with the original XCOM/UFO Enemy Unknown game despite the various similarities.
<br>
<br>This game has two major flaws.
<br>
<br>The first one is that it doesn&apos;t look good. Its uninspired main screen menu tells you it doesn&apos;t aim to be visually beautiful. It&apos;s not a big budget game with mindblowing graphics. I even wonder why they didn&apos;t chose to do cinematics with real actors instead of poorly animated computerd generated characters. Live acting would&apos;ve reduced the cost ( it&apos;s a 2 days work, really ) and it would&apos;ve made the game look better overall. But that&apos;s a personal opinion, of course.
<br>
<br>The second flaw, and probably the most important one, is that this game is unforgiving and brutal. It&apos;s not a Ninja Gaiden Black or Dark Souls type of challenge that forces you to sharpen your skills by practicing - and ultimately defeating the game with a feeling of accomplishment. This XCOM game is just ruthless and you can&apos;t do a thing about it. There&apos;s only a tiny difference of difficulty between easy and normal, and the normal mode is very, very hard. The game doesn&apos;t tell you what to do to augment your chances of winning, especially concerning everything surrounding the base management. It won&apos;t tell you how to make profits and how to augment your chances of victory. There&apos;s a lot of stuff you get to learn by yourself at the cost of tens and tens of hours of gaming filed with what I&apos;d call gamer rape. You are most likely to restart your game once or twice. By the third time you play, you probably will master most of the elements of the game, but it&apos;s still very hard to beat.
<br>
<br>The combat mode is probably the best part of the game. Those who like military strategy will fall in love with this game. It&apos;s the strategic aspect of the game that kept me from giving up on it after realizing I had to invest on satellites when it was way too late. The combat mode can be very gratifying if you come up with strategies as you fight your enemies. If you send your squad to random spots without thinking of the consequences, you&apos;re most likely to get a severe beating at the hands of a formidable AI that could reduce Garry Kasparov to tears.
<br>
<br>But then again, the difficulty of the game catches up and you&apos;ll find yourself in terrible situations more than once. Your soldiers will die and you will fail some missions unless you save and load repeatedly. The AI isn&apos;t to blame here, because if you have a smart AI, why make it dumb to alleviate the difficulty? All they had to do was to reduce their hit points and reduce the damage they could deal to you to make the game easier. But it seems the people who made this game really wanted to make it almost impossible to play for an average gamer who can&apos;t spend days playing a single video game before he actually manages to understand the mechanics of the said game.
<br>
<br>Many so-called hardcore gamers will tell you this game is just like the old school games and that it was made difficult willingly. Sorry, but I don&apos;t agree. The good ol&apos; hard games were hard because they were poorly designed and had close to no beta testing whatsoever. Battletoads, Friday the 13th, etc. etc. they were hard games because the people who made them had no idea on how to reduce the difficulty - or they simply didn&apos;t care. There&apos;s hard and then there&apos;s hell-worthy hard. This game falls in the second category.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also something that bugs me in the combat mode. Sometimes I put my soldiers in specific areas, thinking they will get a higher accuracy percentage, but it turns out they don&apos;t. I think this game required a little more tweaking here and there concerning this department.
<br>
<br>Scenario-wise, it&apos;s very boring. They missed the opportunity of hiring a good writer who could&apos;ve come up with a respectable story. Instead, we get dialogues worthy of a 10 year old boy playing with action figures.
<br>
<br>The music is pretty good in this game. It&apos;s highly reminiscent of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but it still holds its own. There are some good tunes in this game.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, this game is still amazing despite the harsh criticism I have on it concerning the difficulty. You end up getting the upper hand of it, but it takes so much time ( definitely 20hours+ required to know what you&apos;re doing ). I mean, we either go to school or have jobs. Sorry to put it this way but let&apos;s be honest here. This game will only be loved uncondtionally by people who don&apos;t have a life. Normal people who play video games a couple of hours once in a while will quickly give up on it. I think that commercially speaking, this game is a failure since it only appeals to a very tiny portion of gamers out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=4179319">Expand</a></span>

<br>The thing about Xcom is that the mechanics themselves are fantastic, they really are. The turn based squad strategy is fun, the overall research/building strategy is fine. The problem lies only in two elements:
<br>
<br>1. Difficulty settings.
<br>2. Random Number Generators.
<br>
<br>Let it be said, if you&apos;re fairly casual with strategy and you play this game casually on &quot;normal&quot; setting, the game is absolutely fine. No problems there. This review is not for you then, just ignore. That&apos;s just not for me.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re very serious about strategy, you&apos;ll almost certainly find &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty too easy and &quot;Classic&quot; fitting in general (at least if you&apos;re only planning one playthrough). Sounds great, right? Could have been except for one thing: the variance on Classic. Everything is a roll of the dice, which is fine, but the variance is insane. You can do everything right and still lose the game in one brief moment of bad luck. I&apos;ll illustrate the problem with this one scenario that actually took place for me:
<br>
<br>Turn 1. Your squad arrives in the woods. You move them into defensive positions just in case you&apos;re being charged right off the bat. They&apos;re all in cover, they&apos;re all in Overwatch (guarding). Three aliens attack, the squad takes down the first one. The second one uses a skill that automatically deals 1 damage, it hits one guy.
<br>*BREAK* Let me here say that one damage is nothing, it really is nothing.
<br>So, the guy who got hit with the whopping 1 damage rolls a dice and panics. He panics by turning to his right and trying to execute his friend standing right next to him because... well, who knows. It&apos;s the standard panic reaction in this game. He rolls another dice and misses from point blank range. Just can&apos;t hit. Well, fine you think, but alas. Behind him is a seasoned veteran, a captain who has seen many battles. He rolls a dice too, he also panics. Now, he has taken 0 damage, he has merely seen one dude take one damage. Well, he handles panic in the same way and decides to execute one of his friends. He chooses your best solider (and medic) and nails her right in the back of the head with a critical hit, killing her instantly. End turn one.
<br>Turn 2. Bring up menu, quit game.
<br>
<br>Things like this just happen, they just do. You can restart the mission whenever they do, but it wears you out. Or it did with me. Worst thing is, they could fix everything wrong with this game so easily.
<br>
<br>1. rebalance panic.
<br>2. remove critical hits.
<br>
<br>Just those two things would limit the variance to a degree where the game would feel hard but fair. It&apos;s really all they needed to do and then the game would probably be a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5540895">Expand</a></span>

Try naming them after your loved ones, and you&apos;ll get attached to them. That&apos;s the thing about XCOM, it doesn&apos;t trivialize death; it even has a memorial for your lost soldiers. Haven&apos;t played multiplayer, but singleplayer alone justifies the price tag. There are some lags here and there but they&apos;re minor.

At first, the experience was ecstatic. I clocked in over 20 hours&apos; playtime in a weekend! I was expecting the gameplay to be very dull, not accessible and for all the base management to be confusing and overly complex. But I was wrong - this game couldn&apos;t be any more accessible and easy to get into. I loved the simplicity of the mechanics but the depth that it could present the player with. In terms of combat and variety in soldiers, aliens, customisation, level design etc. Enemy Unknown is fantastic. You will never play the same map twice, which is highly impressive - especially given the variety of areas. You really feel a sense of control and importance - the theme of being a commander during a time of crisis is portrayed nicely without being mundane. Every action, every turn, every decision feels meaningful. And that&apos;s perhaps the best thing one can say about this game. Later on however, you realise the flaws in its design.
<br>
<br>Now, I&apos;m the kind of gamer that likes perfection - I will restart until I get the result I want. Naturally, this isn&apos;t well-suited to turn-based games. Although I highly enjoyed the concept of XCOM and its gameplay, some design decisions and bugs make the game unplayable without the so called &quot;save-scumming&quot; tactic. The most noticeable issue is that of finding the aliens. The fog of war is so thick, your soldiers have to practically walk within a few tiles of the enemy to see them. But this is the real kicker: THEY GET TO MOVE EVEN THOUGH IT&apos;S NOT THEIR TURN! So many times I have been cheated by the game because I spent about 3 turns dashing forward not finding any enemies, and all of a sudden I move ONE TILE forward and a bunch of them appear out of nowhere and surround me DURING MY TURN! This is clearly unfair and really takes away from the tactical element. It&apos;s just plain cheap and bad design; although it&apos;s not game-breaking most of the time so I can cope with it. The second major issue I have is line of sight and chance to hit. I find that the percentage you see is almost compeltely random and counter-intuitive. So many times I have moved my soldier to a tactically better spot to increase my chances of hitting the enemy, only to lose sight of them or to lower my chances. Whoever did the calculations for hit percents clearly didn&apos;t test it in practice - there are so many ridiculous examples where you&apos;re next to the enemy and miss yet can have a high chance of hitting them from obscure angles and, in rare cases, through walls! Having played fast-paced action games for so long, the idea of turn-based combat did seem ridiculously novel at times. I mean, you can target an enemy that&apos;s directly behind another enemy but not hit the one shielding your target. The visual representation of the combat is horrific at best. Oftentimes, the games will show plasma on your character even if the alien missed you but it shows that it hit, and vice-versa. It&apos;s as if the graphics/UI team had no communication with the gameplay designers and those that code the mechanics. The camera issues in this game are inexcsuable. Especially for levels with verticality and those inside buildings, the isometric design really exposes how bad of a job the developers did of using Unreal Engine 3. First of all, framerate drops. Then, when you try to select your units or point to where you want them to go, it keeps moving about or there is so little consistency between what you see on screen and what&apos;s actually going on. It&apos;s kinda hard to describe, but once you play the game you&apos;ll see plenty of minor bugs and the occasional major one (e.g. my Hover SHIV got stuck in a wall and couldn&apos;t move). I have read reports of corrupted saves and problems with the autosave feature too.
<br>
<br>Although XCOM is an unpredictable game, it is still linear in progression. It also has some scaling issues with the campaign; where you get all the awesome gear and have a kick-&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; base with the best weapons, jets, armour, research etc. only to be able to use them for a couple of missions before the end. In the latter half of the game, I had full satellite coverage and was drowning in money I might as well have wasted it. In early game, resource management feels really important and meaningful. Towards the end, you just sit on your wealth and can&apos;t really use your resources to help you further in combat. Although I think that&apos;s my playstyle. Indeed, XCOM is perhaps the best attempt I have encountered when it comes to balancing progression rewards with length of game.
<br>
<br>Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game which convincingly sells the concept of Turn-Based strategy to those unfamiliar with the genre. However, the quality of its in-engine execution is shody and at the micro-mechanical level, it&apos;s almost broken. In terms of design and its vision, XCOM EU is ingenius. It definitely has replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=4679902">Expand</a></span>

Fortunately the game doesn&apos;t take it too seriously and is therefore enjoyable even if it features &quot;evil alien invaders&quot;.
<br>
<br>The plot was surprisingly varied, considering we&apos;re talking about evil alien invaders, but it actually just need to support the turn-based in-field combat mechanics change throughout the progress of the game.
<br>It was the first time I approached turn based combat games (and the only turn based strategy game I ever played before XCOM: Enemy Unknown was Sid Meyer&apos;s Civilization V) but I found XCOM: Enemy Unknown gameplay system pretty straightforward and enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Game graphic is nice, I wouldn&apos;t have changed anything on that part, music instead sounds often repetitive even if it matches the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Now, the cons.
<br>Percentage system is not totally random but randomly predetermined: if you miss a hit, no matter how many times you reload a savegame and/or change actions before that very hit, it will miss (even with 98% hit chance).
<br>The movement system gets you hard time with ramps/levels/obstructions.
<br>Finally, this game has a few bugs, one above all it may happen that the game still runs without any visual issue or crash BUT no matter what button you press, you can&apos;t do anything and you need to force quit the game (happened 1 to 3 times per finished game).
<br>
<br>To recap, if this game was made for PC in the first place a lot of things would have been better, but it is clearly adapted to consoles limited controls (gamepads != mouses) and then ported to PC.
<br>The good thing is that, controls aside, the game has a lot of customizable options and since it uses the unreal engine it&apos;s pretty solid.
<br>Also, the game runs on linux, I&apos;d say it runs really good on linux and I can only praise that.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy turn based strategy combat games this game is for you, if you don&apos;t give it a try anyway, I really enjoyed it as my first time turn-based combat game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=4628944">Expand</a></span>

While it remains a solid tactical squad based strategy game, it does not live up to the lofty presence of the original Xcom.
<br>
<br>The series, for those unfamiliar with it, is based on leading a secret covert operations group, known as Xcom, as it attempts to secretly defend earth from an alien invasion. The game does allude to all of this being top secret, which seems a bit ridiculous as you play through the game, but that doesn&apos;t really matter to the gameplay. You act as supreme commander of the Xcom project, managing and building up a base of operations, sending out satellites to detect alien presence, managing the happiness of funding countries, researching and leading squads of up to six soldiers into battle that can then be leveled up as they gain experience.
<br>
<br>The game, like any other game, has evolved with its modern iteration. It is a sharp, fun and responsive squad based strategy game that has streamlined a lot of the annoying micromanagement features of past games, but has also simplified things and put a cap on squad member leveling up. It is a more accessible, but simpler game than past generations. That is good for the casual player, new to the genre but a detractor to seasoned players who enjoy the complexity.
<br>
<br>The game, in the most basic sense, plays like this. You have a base that you expand with various modules that you can build into your secret mountain hideaway. As you research new technologies new modules open up for upgrades or more efficient research. You launch satellites to gain funding from the various nation groups across the globe and to spot alien incursions. When incursions happen you deploy a squad of soldiers into a tactical, squad based &quot;seek cover and advance&quot; type gameplay that dictates a methodical approach to combat. As missions are failed or ignored panic will rise. Victories reduce panic. There are a handful of main story missions for advancing the game that are unlocked by certain milestones in the game, but the vast majority of missions are procedurally generated battles with aliens. There are basic research items, but as you kill aliens and do autopsies, capture and interrogate aliens, or shoot down and capture alien ships more research items are unlocked to gain better weapon and armor and new gadgets.
<br>
<br>There are four basic classes. Assault, heavy (machine gunners), snipers and support (medics) which each have their own skill trees that you can utilize as they level up. All four classes are needed across the game to face different situations. Medics to stabilize downed squad members, snipers to provide cover, heavies to deal huge damage in short bursts and assault troops to act as front line combat soldiers.. Later in the game psionic abilities are added which add some more variety to your soldiers, but psionic abilities are rare and only have three tiers.
<br>
<br>The aliens you face are variations on a few base models, but the variations offer enough change that the game continually changes and evolves as you proceed. New challenges are thrown at you every few missions that force you to think more carefully about how you combat the alien menace.
<br>
<br>The game looks good. It won&apos;t blow anyone away. It has its own style, but nothing that really sticks out as uniquely distinct. The technical side of the graphics are good enough and slightly better than your run of the mill top down game. Sound effects are well done and add to the experience and the voice acting is well done with squad members reacting to the battle.
<br>
<br>The controls on the PC are very easy to work with. Consoles are also surprisingly good, though moving the cursor around with the joysticks can be slow. The iPad controls are cumbersome and you can end up moving soldiers to areas you don&apos;t mean to because you have to press an area twice to move there.
<br>
<br>If you like squad based strategy games you I would highly recommend Xcom, even in its simplified version. If you don&apos;t like strategy games I would say Xcom probably isn&apos;t for you. The game can be pretty brutal, and may frustrate you as your favorite squad members are killed. Overall, a good game for strategy fans that may fall a bit on the simple side for veterans of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=5008379">Expand</a></span>

My second attempt was much better as I finally grasped what was going on. The game is very good and climatic. The combat system is somewhat simplified in comparison with the classic but it came out as an advantage. What I disliked in the classic was looking for the last alien that hid somewhere on the map. Here you do not have to do that. Game progression is fantastic. Besides random maps you got fixed missions, which makes game more attractive - you did not have this choise in classic. You can make your soldiers to become cyborgs or enchance them biologically. Each soldiers class is needed and this is a great improvement over the classic title where you could get ultimate killers good at everything. Here you got soldiers that can be achieved only at their profession, which is sensible attitutude. Graphics and animations are quite pretty. I beat the game and I feel like coming back once again to this title to play the campgain once more. I hope they will make another title in the franchise. I am really looking forward to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=4660470">Expand</a></span>

<br>The tactical game is fun. Stances are gone and cover is much more important. Much better here than the likes of Aftershock. The balance is poor. On normal difficulty it&apos;s much too easy. On classic it&apos;s too hard.

It&apos;s good for when you&apos;re in between games or want to do a casual tactical game.

<br>
<br>&quot;X-COM lite&quot; is probably the best description I could come up with.  In 18 years (that&apos;s right, 1994 b**tches!!) since the original game was released, they&apos;ve made no serious progress towards a better game mechanics.  Other than the graphics, I can&apos;t find any aspect of this new X-COM game that is better than the original.  Every aspect of the game has been dumbed down and hollowed out to the point of making it almost foolproof.  Thanks for not letting me fail, my self esteem has never been better thanks to this game.  But seriously, all the developers had to do was take the original game, add modern 3D graphics and they&apos;d be done - instant classic reborn for the 21st century.  Instead they had to tinker with the mechanics of the game in some serious ways to make it &quot;easier&quot; and more &quot;accessible&quot;.  I get it, the original X-COM was not the most user friendly game to play, but ultimately it&apos;s complexity was part of the reward of the game.  It was a lot more fun to save the world when you were fighting as the underdog, and every little action made a difference when things were in the balance.
<br>
<br>You kiddies have fun with your little 6 person platoon.  Back in my day, we&apos;d regularly go into battle using this little craft called the &quot;Avenger&quot; that could shoot down the biggest ships and carried a 26 person platoon ready to deploy at the crash site.

Having clocked about 97 hours on the Steam version, what was an enjoyable experience starting from normal mode became frustration as I spent more time with the game.  Some of the frustrations I&apos;ve experienced so far were enemies that teleported in and out of view at the end of a turn, SHIV (tank-like units) that get stuck or can&apos;t shoot, line of sight issues, and rocket launchers not hurting target is just a taste of the what&apos;s to come.  Although not gaming breaking on easy and normal modes, these bug heavily affect game play on classic mode where you can lose entire squad due to any of the above.  For example in my classic playthrough, I often get three or more enemy groups teleporting in front of my squad and wiping them out (this happens often).
<br>
<br>Also, the way the game decides on your chance of hitting is finicky and broken.  You can miss often when your shot chance is 75%-100%.  If your shot chance is 50%, don&apos;t expect to land any shots at all.  Having an MBA and taking more than enough math courses (and statistics) for several lifetimes, it makes you scratch your head why you sometimes fail to connect on even 85% chance to hit shots.  I&apos;ve never had problems with other games that rely heavily on chance (like Final Fantasy Tactics) before until now.  Even the original X-COM was fair in determining chance and probability.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is enjoyable when the game engine decides to behave itself.  However, I would not recommend paying full price for this game until Firaxis decides to patch up the bugs.  You should be relatively fine if you play on easy or normal modes.  But if you play on any other modes, expect to see severe bugs and broken game mechanics often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2733224">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is not so bad as someone described it, still be assured, this is NOT your old XCOM.
<br>What i found very bad? The AI is more like an AS (Artificial Stupidity) and tries to compensate by cheating, hitting 100% and dealing tons of crits (not making the game harder btw, just annoying), is this THAT bad? Yes &apos;cause leaves no feeling of strategy... in a wannabe strategic game, the aliens will always behave like stupid, just they hit you more often and harder.
<br>You can ONLY equip 1 main weapon (only the one fitting for the class the game chose for yr soldiers), 1 side weapon and 1 (or 2 if you unlock certain perks) grenade/Medikit/Stunner/etc.
<br>The campaign is way too scripted, i tried as hard as i could to make it last longer (squeezed 70some hours out of 2 games classic+impossible) but that just means grinding mission after mission (after a while they start repeating).
<br>I only listed the bad aspects of the game, so why a 5? &apos;cause for a while you can have some fun with this alien game... For a while, then you will put it on yr shelves and leave it there forever and go back to the old (real) X-COM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2725928">Expand</a></span>

The downsides: I don&apos;t want to give the narrative about console ports on pc again, but... here it is: mediocore graphics, simplified game mechanics, slowly responding interfaces, reduced tactical complexity tue to reduced control options, cheesy cut-scenes, railroaded storyline...
<br>
<br>The bright side: Only a few minor bugs at release (positive thing... I&apos;m old...), no major balance problems. Nice story and technology concepts.
<br>
<br>Enemy Unknown is not a bad pc game and it&apos;s not one you will remember in two years either. But it&apos;s still a pleasant experience to play and probably worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2721036">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m giving this game a score of six mostly because of it&apos;s low replay value. I had a similar experience to some other reviewers in that I was obsessed with this game when I first got my hands on it, but after about 25-30 hours into it I got really sick of it... I no longer felt the need to upgrade my crew because they already felt maxed out, the environments and missions did start to feel repetitive, and pretty quickly I ran out of things that seemed worth researching in the lab. Despite having so much fun in the first days of owning it, I really can&apos;t see myself stomaching another playthrough.
<br>
<br>All of this being said, Xcom is a great game and for a lot of people, 25-30 hours of grade A, engaging game play is worth the price of admission. My only recommendation might be to wait until the game goes down in price if you are looking to pay 50 bucks for a game you can sink dozens and dozens of hours into.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2726248">Expand</a></span>

Playing on normal difficulty is adequate enough for overlooking the mass majority of the issues that plague this game, but upping the difficulty makes its glaring flaws all the more apparent. First things first: This game is uses a combat system that is similar to Fallout 2, with the addition of a cover based system to help your troops not get shot. Naturally this might sound awesome, right? Well... unfortunately  Firaxas and 2K couldn&apos;t spring for half decent AI that seeks to employ superior tactics. They opted instead to give the AI bonuses to aim, health and critical hit chance on the higher difficulties. This turns the game from a test of intellect and tactics to seeing if you can avoid getting steamrolled by dimwitted, cheating AI that kills your soldiers from half way across the map, with full cover to boot. Get used to that cause its going to happen. A lot. And when it does, your dopey soldiers (the &quot;best of the best&quot;, as the game describes them) will panic, freak out and either run into enemy fire, hunker down in front of enemies, wildly shoot at them, or my favorite, shoot at your guys with surprising accuracy; another thing that&apos;s lacking from the best and brightest the world has to offer, as they can&apos;t barely hit the broad side of a barn. Yet they can kill your own troops with ease when panicked. These two companies, having a vastly warped sense of &quot;turn based combat&quot; will ensure that two things happen if you go scouting. 1. Upon spotting an enemy group, the enemy will get a free turn to position themselves against your soldier, DURING your turn, or 2. Your soldier will idiotically charge to where ever he or she was told to go instead of pausing to ask for new orders. This ensures your troops get slaughtered pretty quick, even with hunker down/ overwatch combos. If that isn&apos;t bad enough, cover is as durable as wet toilet paper, meaning that when you get shot at your cover will either crumble or catch fire, exposing you to a follow up barrage or forcing you to high tail it away from the vehicle/whatever, leading to a storm of plasma fire. Don&apos;t get me wrong; I like the fact that the scenery is destructive and can blow up. Its more that the devs wanted to inflate the sense of &quot;difficulty&quot; by stacking the odds against the player, rather than taking time and effort to create an AI that gives the player pause when it humbles them with strategy and tactics. The strategy element has some good elements to it, having to manage panic, finances and supplies. The problem is that what could have been a great strategy element is is reduced to something much more simplified and dull. Countries will freak the hell out if you bungle a mission, regardless if you managed to put a huge dent in alien forces before dying or rescuing a VIP/butt load of civilians in the process; they&apos;ll count as dead if you die. Either you kill everything in sight or you fail the mission, period, despite the fact that your mission (in about half the cases) is to stop terror attacks or protect VIP&apos;s. Partial credit would be nice (as was evident in the old XCOM games) but has given way to that CoD mentality; everything has to die no matter what, even in the face of objectives or feasibility. When the **** hits the fan (and it will), nations in the same continent will start to panic big, even though they didn&apos;t get attacked. The funding (something that wasn&apos;t an issue in the old XCOM) is scarce and serves only to once again, inflate the difficulty, despite the fact that you are the &quot;last, best hope of humanity&quot; and would naturally get loads of cash to do your job (see: the old XCOM). Because of requirements for even the basic of facilities, you could find yourself crippled if you opt for cash missions to purchase satellites, weapons, armor, or new troopers, all because the Dev&apos;s were too lazy to include a &quot;personnel requisition&quot; option that was present in the old XCOM. Worse yet is the fact that you can&apos;t sell any weapons or items you craft to council members; you&apos;re stuck with them. If you&apos;re lucky, a nation may ask to get that tech off you, but instead of negotiation they just tell you what you&apos;ll get. Gone are the days of being a dealer of all things alien. The story itself is good in the beginning but starts to fall apart once you research Psionics. In regards to the setting and logic behind R&amp;D, it is truly laughable. Instead of reverse engineering alien tech and creating weapons that use materials from your own damn planet, you&apos;re forced to rely on alien materials (of which don&apos;t exist on Earth) to construct alien weapons that rely on... alien power sources. Humanity is well and truly boned if this is how we&apos;ll fight the aliens; if XCOM dies, everyone&apos;s back at square one. I don&apos;t even like the old XCOM and regret it&apos;s purchase, but I saw the potential for a truly awesome game. Sadly, it looks as if we&apos;ll have to wait for the realization of that potential, cause it isn&apos;t here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811495">Expand</a></span>

On Normal difficulty the game is too easy, with enemy AI being dumbed down... yet on Classic difficulty they get free accuracy and critical hit buffs. Ironman Mode is unplayable because one year after launch and there are still frequent bugs and crashes that will count your mission as a loss after you restart the game.
<br>
<br>While you definitely get your money&apos;s worth with EU&apos;s lengthy campaign, be prepared for a lot of frustration due to your troops getting one-shotted regularly in the early missions, 3 marines missing their overwatch shot in the same turn on the same enemy, your troops shooting each other while panicked (in cover!), and not being able to hit the broad side of a barn until your unit is so kitted out they look like a Space Marine from W40k.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833883">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Innovative combat system (cover/flanking, two-stage movement)
<br>
<br>- Storyline of sorts
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- Strategic (globeview) part became silly and boring: you are limited to one base; items are manufactured immediately; you can&apos;t sell what you&apos;ve produced; moreover, many items are free and unlimited (like grenades or standard guns); basically you just assign research and build a few base facilities, the rest can be done right before a mission.
<br>
<br>- Few things to research and manufacture: only one advanced type of interceptors, several laser and plasma guns, a few armours, and some special items.
<br>
<br>- No inventory manipulation
<br>
<br>- Often unrealistic battle situations: e.g. chance of hitting an alien almost doesn&apos;t depend on distance, or you may stand just one step away from a high wall and be considered &quot;exposed&quot; from that side.
<br>
<br>- Overall, many things in the game don&apos;t seem logical/realistic. How is it possible that it takes 8 days for a few eggheads in my lab to research some mysterious crazy alien technology and immediately come up with blueprints for a new weapon (which the engineers will make for me in no time)? Or what is the connection between having satellites over three African countries and 33% increase in budget? And besides, where are all the other countries? Why don&apos;t I ever have missions there? It all makes role-playing quite difficult.
<br>
<br>- The game is short and not so replayable. It took me 28 hours of play to win the game while reading carefully every research report and being sometimes too strategic and cautious. And since you have a very linear story, you don&apos;t want to start over and hear all the same stuff again. I expected more.
<br>
<br>All in all, though the game, at least its tactical part, is still interesting and fun, it feels more like a simplified and cut-down version of the original XCOMs. Apparently, 2K will introduce more features as DLCs (something Microprose couldn&apos;t back in 1990s), which may be the reason for producing this game as it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942481">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>XCOM is a series known for its difficulty, encouraging players to use tactics to defeat a considerably more powerful force. Though it&apos;s had some &apos;rocky&apos; games in the past, the original was met with critical acclaim for breaking a lot of ground in the Turn-Based Tactics genre. For its time, UFO Defense: Enemy Unknown was  very well developed, with cover mechanics bringing a whole new level of tactics.
<br>
<br>Since the release of UFO Defense, there have been a total of 9 games released to the series, with XCOM: Enemy Unknown being the 8th. One would think it safe to assume that great strides have been made to the gameplay since 1994, a grand 18 years ago at time of release. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
<br>
<br>XCOM: EU&apos;s improvements are decent  updated graphics bring the immersion up noticeably, nice customization options to personalize your troops  plus gameplay has been streamlined to accommodate for console releases.
<br>However, the issues are also numerous. Poor QA testing has left many bugs even a year after its release, a large number of features were removed for &apos;streamlining&apos; (I assume), and the continuation of relying on RNG to decide the outcome of a match flying in the face of &apos;tactics&apos;. Cover has little effectiveness, accuracy issues meaning a point-blank shot can display a 20% chance to hit, repetitive mission mean a player can lose interest quickly and a lack of randomly-generated maps removes a whole level of dynamic gameplay.
<br>
<br>What is interesting is that, despite these glaring issues, XCOM: EU is still a lot of fun to play. For that I have to give it merit  it&apos;s clearly a very good game, but I wonder how much that has to do with it being part of the series.
<br>
<br>On my Realistic Review Scale it gets a 4, slightly below being an average game due to some glaring faults.
<br>However, on the Metacritic Scale where an 8.5 is average, I&apos;ll have to give it a 6.
<br>
<br>A very good game marred by poor design decisions and QA  but isn&apos;t that the tune of strategy these days?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674157">Expand</a></span>

<br>I find this game to be extremely disappointing, poorly developed and a piece of mass produced poo. There are SO many problems I have with it from the tactics to the inventory and development of your soldiers. The voice acting is extremely poor, the development of the story is poor and the limitations in research, engineering, hiring/firing, building countries up etc are extreme. Stupid things like you can either have a scope (which would surely be attached to your rifle) or a grenade on a soldier... WHAT?!?!? Do you not think a bloke that had mainstreamed that many steroids (judging by the ridiculously stupid graphics of your soldiers) would possibly be able to carry more than a couple of items? Maybe if the option was &apos;either carry a house or a bus&apos; then carrying only one would make sense. Having soldiers from China, England, France, Germany etc is a nice twist in that they all have their own flag (although here is an important fact... Scotland does not have it&apos;s own army, neither does England (nor Wales or Northern Ireland). They are all part of one force called the British Army and having served in it, screw you developers for mucking about with it). However, apparently wherever your soldiers are from, they are in fact all American from their accents and spoken languages.
<br>
<br>Even were I not still trying to get over the sadness of this not being the hoped for 1993 game revamped, I would score this game poorly. It has some amazing ideas, great graphics, interesting twists and game play tweaks that could make a smile but it has far too many flaws to be good in my books.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=4242824">Expand</a></span>

The good idea was soldier classes, but sniper class is way overpowered in compare to others. Still XCOM: Enemy Unknown is solid game and good tribute to original X-COM.</span>

The line of sight is unpredictable and shooting down ufos is extremely boring and might as well not even be a part of the game. Maybe it&apos;s just my computer but the voice overs simply don&apos;t work.</span>

Such as the bulls*it free move aliens get during your turn, and some crash to desktop bugs (which are extreamly rare.) But that doesn&apos;t make this game bad. Aside from those problems, i sit and play this game for hours at a time. Its fun and addicting. You also get attached to your soldiers, and get legitimately sad or pissed off when they die. All in all, its problems held it back from being the best game of last year, but it still one of my favorites.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=3158035">Expand</a></span>

Less techs to invent, less items to create, less abilities to use... There are lots of this &quot;less&quot;. Some trying to say that it&apos;s simplified version of XCOM i will stay with &quot;dumbed down&quot; term. So i believe if Feraxis made it a new IP this game could be accepted a way better. So it&apos;s simple if you played old XCOM - avoid this game. You probably will be greatly disappointed. It&apos;s nowhere near the original and i recommend you to start looking in direction of indie game called Xenonauts (in beta stage atm). It&apos;s not XCOM by name, but it&apos;s XCOM by spirit. But if you like beating game in 2 days on normal without losing a single soldier and never heard of original IP - try this. It&apos;s not a bad game after all. And if you liked this new XCOM try the old one after (or Xenonauts i mentioned above).
<br>So about score. If that was a new IP i would give it a solid 9. But as i remake of original XCOM...let&apos;s see...25% of 10 is about 3. Arithmetic average is 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2692539">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>TACTICAL
<br>+Feels frantic and tense, at least in the early-mid game before your dudes get bulk health.
<br>+Looks nice. A good visual update to the series.
<br>+Options you didn&apos;t have in the original, like suppressing enemy units and flanking. In some respects combat more tactical.
<br>-Heavy class becomes more or less useless except for suppression and rocket-launcher by the mid-late game.
<br>-Squads felt too small and made losing a unit even more crippling than the original.
<br>-Inventory dumbed down ridiculously: Why can&apos;t my soldier in powered jetpack armour carry more than one grenade or rocket?
<br>-Dumbed down targeting  in the original, blowing open a wall with your plasma rifle was a viable tactical option, for example
<br>-Action system abstraction can sometimes be grating.
<br>-NO RANDOMISED MAPS. This was probably my biggest gripe. Cripples replayability, criminal lack of effort. This would&apos;ve been a 7 for me otherwise.
<br>
<br>GLOBAL
<br>+Looks shiny, sounds cool. Very atmospheric, and the cutscenes/lore for everything is generally pretty good, even if they do recycle some templates.
<br>+Progression felt very rewarding, expanding options tactically by where you decide to expand and establish satellites.
<br>-Arbitrary dichotomy where you always have to choose one nation to ignore. Can we seriously not just buy a second skyranger?
<br>-Only one base  no base defense? That was a vital part of the original game.
<br>-Randomised classes for recruits could mean highly unbalanced teams  enjoy your four useless Heavies who will just take up space.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s all I can remember from playing this last year. Decent purchase, but nothing special and a lot of design decisions which seem highly questionable. It would&apos;ve been nice to maybe have a more modular version of the game where you could get more strategic depth by enabling old-school options at the start of the campaign, to appeal to both audiences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=3202022">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_2799203"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">A solid remake all-in-all. I played the original DOS games and most of the sequels, which are hard acts to follow. This newest incarnation manages to have the core of what made the original extremely fun: well crafted turn-by-turn combat, variety of weapons and equipment, resource management, researching and reverse engineering alien tech, etc. The graphics are very good; the temple ship is truly a masterpiece of a stage.  There is a lot not to like as well, of course. Normal difficulty is too easy, taking 40 hours to beat for me. XCOMEU is far less complex than the original, in a bad way. Combat has been oversimplified, with the boring &quot;move, shoot, repeat&quot; scheme. The original with time units was much more fun; you could spend all your time units shooting, moving, swapping a weapon out oof your pack, or all three. I was displeased to discover that there was only one alien base in the game (several in the OG). The end stage, while very fun, was disappointing - no Mars? Really? Very anticlimactic ending. When you investigate a crash site, you are dropped practically on top of it in a tiny area. The enemies are now &quot;aggro&apos;d&quot; WOW-style and just stand around until you approach. They don&apos;t move around otherwise.  I miss the old crash site maps which were larger and required exploration. The maps in general become repetitive. I also think the overall atmosphere of the game is too tame; the eery stage music of the original is permanently etched in my brain. Oh, and lastly, where is the Snakeman? A lot of negative points said here, but as I said, the heart of the original is still there and I was glued to my PC for the few short days it took to beat it. Worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=2799203">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m rating it so low because it is not a strategy game as it is billed. There are several major reasons for this.
<br>
<br>First, the &quot;random&quot; aspects are not actually random. I&apos;m not talking about how savescumming is prevented due to the random seed. I&apos;m talking about how the computer is a cheating bastard. I had a mission once where the first enemy to fire scored a critical hit every time. It didn&apos;t matter which enemy was shooting, where they were shooting from, who their target was, where their target was, the cover their target was in, or if the enemy that was shooting took their shot before or after another enemy moved. I tested this by retreating continually and forcing the enemy to follow me to take their shot. I crossed the entire map back to the start point, and without fail the first shot taken by the AI every turn resulted in a critical hit.
<br>
<br>Second, the cover system is absolutely horrendous. There are four levels of cover. 0 is no cover. 1 is &quot;half&quot; cover. 2 is &quot;full&quot; cover. 3 is &quot;full&quot; cover with the Hunkered Down ability active. These aren&apos;t the actual numerical values as the game uses them to calculate anything, they&apos;re just my observation. Okay, now that I&apos;ve explained that, forget about it, because the game will. Enemies can and will shoot you through walls. The shots will visibly pass right through them. They will shoot you through floors. They will shoot you through bus stops. They will shoot you from fifty feet into the adjacent room behind a solid wall where the only way you can see them is from their red outline because even the camera can&apos;t see them. A car provides the exact same amount of cover when it&apos;s intact as it does when it is a smoldering wreck. It&apos;s very annoying to get hit by an enemy who is making a shot that is simply not physically possible.
<br>
<br>Third, the computer is a cheating bastard. Yes, again. They don&apos;t follow any movement rules, it seems. When you encounter enemies they immediately interrupt your turn to move into cover. Floaters can teleport onto your flanks at will. Berserkers can interrupt your turn to move. Thin Men will literally drop from the sky on your flanks. Sectopods can take three actions per turn. Enemies will spawn right in the middle of your squad. Groups of enemies will teleport around the map if you lose sight of them. In other words, there is no strategy involved in placing your units, you just need to hope the game decides to be nice.
<br>
<br>Fourth, squad panic is simply awful. XCOM is supposed to be the world&apos;s most elite military force. So why do they act like they&apos;ve never been in a firefight before? One of your units takes a hit, and your other members of the world&apos;s most elite military force turn all the way around, take aim on the person beside them, yell &quot;HELP ME!&quot; and shoot them in the face. Losing a squad member because they got shot through a wall is bad enough, now you&apos;re just rubbing it in for no good reason.
<br>
<br>Fifth, global panic. The first thing I want to point out is how incredibly stupid this sort of conversation must sound. &quot;Hello, is this XCOM, the world&apos;s most elite military force focused on fighting the alien invasion? This is the President of the United States. We have decided we are being invaded by too many aliens to require the help of the world&apos;s most elite military force focused on fighting the alien invasion. Please stop saving our citizen&apos;s lives.&quot; The second thing is that the system is simply broken. Not taking a mission in a country increases the panic levels of all the countries on that continent for some reason, not just the one being attacked by aliens. This means that no matter how well you are playing the game, you will eventually lose. A game where you are guaranteed to lose is a very badly designed game.
<br>
<br>Sixth, I have an underground complex filled with advanced technology, soldiers who can practically blow things up with their minds, multiple satellites over every continent, multiple heavily armed interceptors stationed on every continent, but when three cities get attacked by aliens at once I can only send one group of six people while the other ninety-three soldiers twiddle their thumbs in the Barracks.
<br>
<br>To summarize, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is not a strategy game. It fails at the most important element of a strategy game: Rewarding strategy. It would get a 0 for that reason, but it&apos;s actually quite entertaining once you realize it&apos;s not a strategy game and start to play accordingly. That, and it changes the lights on my keyboard to coincide with the enemy turns and I think that&apos;s neat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xcom-enemy-unknown/user-reviews?user_review_id=3180546">Expand</a></span>
