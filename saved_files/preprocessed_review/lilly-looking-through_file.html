The presentation of the game is nothing short of magical. The art is beautiful, the music is dreamy and ethereal, and the characters&apos; animations are most exquisite. The kids, Lilly and Row are so cute and animate so well that right from the start it was unbelievably endearing. The game immersed me in a feeling of childhood, with all that innocence, curiosity, cuteness and sense of awe and adventure, like I never have experienced before.
<br>
<br>Speaking of the actual gameplay, it plays like a point and click puzzle adventure where one needs to figure out how to get past the obstacles of each screen to progress to the next. I can&apos;t spoil you, so I&apos;ll just say that along the way you pick up an item that not only serves as an excellent, original and creative device for the puzzling itself, but adds to the wonder and magic of the game and its world as well. Some of the puzzles are quite hard to figure out, but the hint system, which highlights items/actions you can click makes sure you&apos;re not missing out on where you can click, so you can focus on the puzzles themselves. If you have no patience for this genre (or in general), though, or you can&apos;t stand low tempo, relaxed games, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it.
<br>
<br>Despite all that I loved about the game, which was, in a nutshell, that it provided me with a nostalgic reliving of the magical feelings of childhood, the game has some problems. Mainly, it&apos;s short, around 2-3 hours long, which is a pity and a little frustrating. Towards the end, the puzzles get a bit repetitive in &quot;theme&quot;, and their mechanics get a bit more cryptic, thought one can argue that&apos;s the point of a puzzle game. But more importantly, and again, without spoiling, the end has little closure and feels more like a cliffhanger than an actual resolution  it&apos;s surprisingly abrupt and open. Also, it creates the idea that there will be a &quot;sequel&quot;/continuation, one feels that there should be, that the game/story isn&apos;t quite finished.
<br>
<br>It pains me to give such a relatively low score to this game, because, in spite of its failings, the game is so magical and endearing that I was really impressed. It was one the most memorable gaming experiences ever I had. I really hope that there will be more and longer &quot;Lilly&quot; in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lilly-looking-through/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773575">Expand</a></span>

The music has an ethereal quality that doesn&apos;t distract. In a nice touch, as you put on or remove the time-changing goggles the music changes too, depending on which &quot;time&quot; you&apos;re in.
<br>
<br>As is typical for the genre, there are times when the game becomes not quite a pixel hunt, but &quot;let&apos;s mouseover the entire screen to see what I&apos;ve missed (or what&apos;s changed).&quot; Unfortunately, there are also times when you click on things without a clear understanding of what your actual goal is. When you do make a successful attempt, Lilly&apos;s actions may actually surprise you, as she does something you may not have been trying to get her to do in the first place. In other words, there is one solution to each screen, and only one. Most of the puzzles make sense (if only in hindsight), but it does mean that if you&apos;re not on the developer&apos;s wavelength, too bad. The game does not save after you complete a puzzle, but only after you complete a screen. If you leave partway through a screen, you&apos;ll have to repeat your puzzle solutions up to that point on that particular screen (which should take less than a minute, as you&apos;ve already done it once).
<br>
<br>There is only one game at a time, which means that if other people in your house want to play as well, they&apos;ll either have to play your game or wait until you&apos;ve finished. Frankly, as this is being marketed as a family game, I don&apos;t understand the lack of multiple player slots at all.
<br>
<br>All that said, I did find myself enchanted by the game  for the first hour. An hour later, however, I found myself finished, frustrated, and a bit stunned at the overall lack of purpose. My total time played was 2:33, but that includes a 15 minute period where I literally kept trying different combinations of switches on one screen simply because I had missed seeing an important lever and had no idea what else to do. If I had noticed it earlier, I would have had around 2:18 for my total playtime. It&apos;s also important to note that much of the game&apos;s running time is simply you sitting back as a several-second animation plays out every time you click on something. You cannot cancel an animation, even if it&apos;s the twentieth time you&apos;ve seen it (and with some of the trial-and-error puzzles, you will be sitting back and waiting a lot).
<br>
<br>The irony here is that the first Kickstarter stretch goal allowed them to actually make the game longer, so I&apos;m at a bit of a loss. Every Indie game is a labor of love (I would hope), but this one feels so much more so, and so special (even to the point of being developed and voiced by a family) that it really does pain me that I can&apos;t recommend it at full price. Yes, it&apos;s obvious a lot of work went into it. Yes, I hate myself a little. However, how do we learn, grow, and improve, if not from our mistakes? How will we ever know about those mistakes if people constantly bury the truth in favor of praise for our hard work? I&apos;d rather have a constructive criticism than an insincere &quot;attaboy&quot; any day. With that in mind, take a deep breath, &apos;cause here we go.
<br>
<br>Not only is &quot;Lilly...&quot; short, but the puzzles tend to feel repetitive, particularly with four consecutive color-matching puzzles on the last four screens (the final screen also combines that same color gimmick with mechanics from an earlier &quot;cross the pond  puzzle). I stopped having fun after the second color puzzle, but when I realized that final screen was yet another one (the fourth in a row), I actually began to resent the game. This color-matching idea is milked so often, it leaves me wondering if these were the stretch goal additions.
<br>
<br>And then...the &quot;ending.&quot; Which is to say, there isn&apos;t one. While avoiding spoilers, I&apos;ll say that it literally is a cliffhanger; that is, it would be if we cared about the characters. How can we though, without any reason to? Lilly and the little boy are cute, but there&apos;s nothing else to them. I understand minimalist storytelling but, for me, it doesn&apos;t work. I&apos;ve chased a red piece of cloth (and the boy) across ten screens, only to have it be replaced at the end by something so completely random, open-ended, and esoteric that I&apos;m left thinking there was absolutely no point in my playing; no reward for my work, no reason for the red piece of cloth to have existed at all. It&apos;s such a thoughtless MacGuffin that it feels like a bit of a slap in the face.
<br>
<br>I sincerely hate writing this but, as a gaming experience, &quot;Lilly Looking Through&quot; gets two stars out of five. The game&apos;s length, repetitiveness, and ending completely undermined the joy I felt the first hour of play. That said, the love, creativity (for the most part) and passion is there for great things in the future, and I really do hope &quot;Lilly...&quot; finds a solid enough market that Geeta Games can keep growing and producing games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lilly-looking-through/user-reviews?user_review_id=3714402">Expand</a></span>

I will say this though, the art is gorgeous and its very clear that tremendous amount of attention went to making the game look good. The game is much like Machinarium in that it has no dialogue, the art is great, and similar has game play, but it&apos;s just not executed as well.  Lily is setup so that each screen is it&apos;s own little adventure game with very little interaction between scenes.  This causes the puzzles to feel episodic and filler like.  The developer could dropped more scenes anywhere in the game without disrupting the story or game play. It was interesting design choice, and I will credit the experimental attempt but it just doesn&apos;t feel like your accomplishing anything.
<br>
<br>My biggest criticism comes from the fact that the game feels shorter than it is due to the fact that you get almost no story and the early levels are extremely easy. With about 10 scene in the game, all plot is concentrated in the first and last scene.  Beyond that you can&apos;t deduce much of whats going on in the world other than it&apos;s post apocalyptic.  Finally, the ending is an extremely unsatisfying cliff hanger.  I was left with a feeling that the characters were better off if I had never played the game.
<br>
<br>Despite this, I still say the developers deserves their due. The effort is clearly visible in the wonderful art and environment that was created even if the game design didn&apos;t pan out so well.  Interestingly, enough I think a big part of my criticism would go away if narration was added to make the game more story book like.  The game certainly looks like a story book but didn&apos;t really seem like it committed to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lilly-looking-through/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797612">Expand</a></span>
