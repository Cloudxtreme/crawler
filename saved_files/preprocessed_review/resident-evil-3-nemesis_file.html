I wasn&apos;t a big fan of this one, but it&apos;s not a bad game either. It has some cool moments and boss fights, and the atmosphere feels pretty claustrophobic which works for a horror game. However the problems with the first game start resurfacing with the bad inventory design and combat that&apos;s unrealistically clunky. The difficulty select is a joke, only easy or hard. Playing on easy is basically a cheat where you start out with a crap load of weapons, ammo and healths in your box whereas hard mode starts you off with absolutely nothing. The game itself really didn&apos;t hold my attention for more than a few hours, I&apos;m not sure what it was. It took me like 2 or 3 weeks to beat it because I kept going for long periods of time without playing it because I just didn&apos;t care what was going on anymore. Resident Evil has never been strong in terms of plot but at least I didn&apos;t have to force myself to finish RE1 and 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-3-nemesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2493766">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am The Destroyer. I will break games, complain about the littlest detail, and tell you whether or not the game is worth buying. A lot of things to say here, but can&apos;t due to the 5000 character limit. The game will be judged under year 1999 standards, the year it was first released for Playstation.
<br>
<br>1. Story
<br>The story takes place in a fictional mid-western town called Raccoon City. The T-Virus has been unleashed, it&apos;s citizens decimated, and turned into zombies. Playing as Jill Valentine, you must find your way out of the city. However, that&apos;s easier said than done when a Tyrant continues to stock you...
<br>This story has been done a million times before, but it never get&apos;s old. The great part about it is the cut-scenes are balanced, not bring too long or too short.
<br>
<br>2. Voice Acting
<br>There are a few areas where the voice acting could be improved, but all around, the voice acting is fine.
<br>
<br>3. Graphics and Visuals
<br>You are going to be amazed when you see all the glass, rubble, fires, destroyed automobiles, and otherwise destruction everywhere. This is what it should feel like in an apocalypse. If this doesn&apos;t blow you away then nothing phases you.
<br>
<br>4. Gameplay
<br>Gameplay refers to survival-horror, customization, and various puzzles you solve within the game. Put it all together and it&apos;s Awesome!
<br>
<br>-Survival-Horror-
<br>Survival-Horror will only be found on Hard difficulty, and doesn&apos;t exist on Easy. On Hard difficulty, you will be pushed to the limit as you try to conserve enough ammo &amp; healing to get through an area. But the most intimidating part is that every time you enter an area, enemies could be completely different. You might get Zombies in one area, and then Zombie Dogs in the exact same area the next time you play. This keeps the game fresh as you never know what to expect.
<br>Unfortunately, those who love the survival-horror genre will be disappointed with the &quot;dodge&quot; feature. Once you master this, there is no survival-horror left at all! You can essentially run around and kill everything with a knife. This takes away from the experience to the point where it shouldn&apos;t be present in the game. Another issue is the lack of boss enemies.
<br>
<br>-Customization-
<br>Unless you&apos;re playing on PC or Dreamcast, customization is rather limited. More cannot be said due to this being a spoiler free review.
<br>
<br>-Puzzles-
<br>Capcom nailed it on the puzzle part. In fact, all of the puzzles are really enjoyable.
<br>
<br>5. Soundtrack
<br>These tracks will play mind-games with you during gameplay, and this is something you&apos;re gonna watch out for if you hope to survive. There are times when these tracks will attempt to overpower your emotions by playing only when the enemies spawn, or just playing when enemies are simply nearby. With enough experience, you&apos;ll understand what this means.
<br>As far as the music itself goes, it is amazing. There are no bad songs, from cut-scenes to gamplay, to even a menu screen.
<br>
<br>6.. Personal Enjoyment
<br>Oh my god! The amount of saves &amp; reloads I had to do in order to explore an area on Hard mode. I completed the game in 7H 23M, and got an F-Grade for it, but I don&apos;t care. It was one of the best moments of my life. You spend so much time trapped in the city and... well... - let&apos;s just say there&apos;s no other feeling like what you&apos;ll be feeling when you complete the game for your first time. You have to be there to experience it.
<br>
<br>7. Overall Verdict
<br>Despite a few flaws, this game is worthy of preservation, and deserves to be saved. The final verdict for Resident Evil 3 is an 8 out of 10! One of the best Resident Evil games made so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-3-nemesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5000186">Expand</a></span>

You never know when he will attack you. He is stronger and faster than you. Also he follows you to other rooms! It&apos;s really fresh game. RE2 was just like RE1, but this game is something new. It could be a bit longer.</span>

The tried and true game play is there, the cheesy lines are there, the survival horror is there, the decent story is there, and the zombies are there! The last game in what many consider to be the golden age of not only Resident Evil, but survival horror as a genre. This is one of those &quot;must play&quot; titles for 90s gaming.</span>
