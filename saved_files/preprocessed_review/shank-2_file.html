Shank 2 is still visually stunning, still offers great over-the-top action, and still has a pointless scenario (but that&apos;s not important). What it changes are the controls &amp; difficulty, but only to make them worse. Shank 1 required too many keys (half of them being unnecessary), and it&apos;s even more broken in Shank 2.<br>But it&apos;s in the difficulty that it gets very bad. While the game is slightly more difficult &amp; more frustrating during the &quot;normal&quot; parts, the bosses are unnecessarily hard, very hard, and unlike in Shank 1, require no specific strategy, they&apos;re just hard, like in a japanese schmup. If you easily throw your monitor through the window, skip this game, you probably won&apos;t see more than 1 or 2 levels of it, and it will be better for your health. If however you enjoy dying a hundred times in a row &amp; replaying the same thing the whole day, then go ahead.<br>It has an online survival mode but to be honnest I haven&apos;t been able to find anyone playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shank-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2139638">Expand</a></span>

A trailer shows us a bloodbath action gameplay and everything seems so awesome, but after you play a few chapters it becomes a very boring, repetitive game. There is small variety of weapons, only three in each category, but the good thing is that every weapon has it&apos;s unique combination of hits and finishing moves, so you can choose what you like the most. As for enemies, there are few kinds, they use melee and ranged weapons, also there are &quot;gorillas&quot; - that&apos;s how I call these big guys, which are harder to kill. In some point you will have to use a minigun turret to kill incoming enemy and some other things to do, which I don&apos;t want to spoil. And the gameplay is based on the story, so it&apos;s not just a hit&apos;n&apos;smash game. Graphics are really nice, especially when you slice enemy with chainsaw or do counter-attack. But there is one problem with mouse cursor, somehow it won&apos;t disappear to some players and is visible in game, so I think there will be a patch to fix this. Despite that, it&apos;s not that bad game, which have a big potential, but in current time it lacks variety of gameplay and length of it. But worth the time to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shank-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2131935">Expand</a></span>

A Devil May Cry in 2D, Shank is anything but brainless action, requiring you to carefully swap between weapons to chain together the lengthy and effective combos needed to slay the game&apos;s most persistent enemies.  A silly turret section later on proved immensely frustrating, but aside from that, this is a gold standard 2D beat &apos;em up.</span>

Okey so the Story of the first agme was pretty much finished. Nevertheless Klee Entertainment now will take a look at the past of the protagonist. I guess everyone will understand when i say, that the storyline can not live up to shank 1 standards. Is that bad? not really. So what did they change? The combat! Some mechanics have been added, like the counter-attacks, that let you take out enemies in an instant, and the usable weapons feature, which enables you to pick up weapons of your fallen enemies. So Shank 2 has some frantic and mind-blowing combat mechanics. Visually Shank 2 tries to connect to it&apos;s prequel, but i personaly think it doesn&apos;t look as good as that. But that impresion only regards the cutscenes. The in-game graphics are pretty nice. So if you liked the first game you should play the demo. If you just like 2d brawlers you will get one of the best combat systems that has been developed so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shank-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2314470">Expand</a></span>

While I am disappointed that the co-op campaign of the first game was replaced with a mere wave survival mode in this one, the single player campaign delivers the same sort of experience as the first, a beer-soaked, white-knuckle, bullet-riddled rampage through a grindhouse version of South America, and that&apos;s nothing to complain about. I would best describe Shank 2 as a 2D &quot;Stylish Action Game&quot;, a term that never really caught on, since people think God of War invented this style of gameplay when, really, Devil May Cry did it first- and better. To be fair, the Shanks are closer in style to God of War, and though there is a combo grading system in the game you can get by perfectly well by mashing the buttons until you have smeared your enemies into the pavement. Shank 2 delivers fast, brutal action, varied weapons and cinematic boss battles, and despite the short length of the game it is excellently paced and good fun to play throughout. I hope this is not the last we have seen of our headbanded hero and his messy adventures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shank-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507846">Expand</a></span>

The survival mode is king, too bad there&apos;s just 3 maps for it, but it will prove worth the price for you and your friend if you have 2 controllers. One of the best local coop game I have ever played.</span>
