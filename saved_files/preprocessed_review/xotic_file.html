Not an incredible AI for the enemies that will try to take you down while shooting around trying to grind up points, which will help you to rank up on leaderboards, i actually enjoyed playing this game, it&apos;s one of the &quot;Indie&apos;s Gems&quot; you better grab it and i feel you will think the same as me !</span>

I like the  different game modes especially the Essece Attack. I don`t like when it gets stuck in a few places and sometimes the AI don`t agro the player and also i wish the AI will be much aggressive in the hard level.

<br>
<br>The object of the game is quite simple, try to score as many points as possible by causing chain-reactions, simple design but addictive too when you&apos;re trying to beat your own scores and see how you compare against other players on the leaderboard.
<br>
<br>You can also earn experience points to upgrade your weapons or skills.
<br>
<br>A good amount of levels to play including bonus rounds and very good map design too.
<br>
<br>The devs have said that they will include more graphics options in an upcoming patch so I&apos;ve taken one point off the total score for that but the support is there and new levels are planned for the game.
<br>
<br>Great game, great fun and well worth the price :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1758438">Expand</a></span>

A game that came out of nowhere and became one of my favorite. A unique point based FPS where enemies are only an obstacle between you and the perfect chain. The game gives you alot of very nice looking and well designed levels, 8 upgradable weapons as well as an upgradable character, different types of enemies from the pushover to formidable champions and shielded turrets. The easiest way to desribe the gameplay is you run, jump and fly around mutliple levels shooting red plants that explode creating a chain reaction, the longer the chain the better the score. While keeping up the chain reaction of the red plants you can collect crystals, destroy other plants, vases and what the game calls Brains I think for additional points. To get to the crystals which are usually somewhere high up you can use your shield ability which doubles as a platform you can genereate under yourself when jumping. There are usually three objectives on each level: destroy all read plants, collect all crystals and kill all enemies. The levels end when with the death of the last enemy a portal opens. The main selling point of the game is the replayability. This is one of the few games which upon completing a level makes me think I can do better.  As a cherry on top if you are in Europe as I am you get a great price that does not exploit the EU customer like many other games on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1760794">Expand</a></span>

Xotic is a real gem, original gameplay makes it unforgettable and very enjoyable. In general, it&apos;s colorful and neat-looking arcade shooter that involves some classic elements, as well some new ideas.  The storyline is simple, but it has it&apos;s charm. Your character is a saviour, created to liberate the universe from entity called The Orb.  Mysterious  villain strips planets of life to prolong it&apos;s existence, so there&apos;s nothing to think about... We&apos;re about to save some planets! Gameplay is based on making the highest score possible and there&apos;s a few ways to do that. Mostly - you need to create chains, shooting scabs (it seems like The Orb seeds... or something like it;)). The longer the chain, the better. You&apos;ll need to be quite fast too, you will achieve points for speedy clearance of levels. There&apos;s plenty of powerups and bonus points scattered all around the levels ... and dont forget The Orb minions trying to stop you.  So as you see, there&apos;s plenty to do. Especially when you want to gain 5-star rating on a specific level, it gets pretty challenging. Mastering the best way to achieve chains, bonus points and so called &quot;aerial combos&quot; (collecting bonuses while in mid-air) is hard, but you&apos;ll get hang of it. Game offers campaign and variable speed/accuracy trials - it will suck you up for a few hours of exciting gameplay. Atmospheric and indeed FUN gameplay. It won&apos;t cost you much (4 euros now on steam holiday sale), if you&apos;re fan of arcade shooting you need to pick it up.  Xotic was updated not so long ago, offering new game modes and extended tutorial so as you see - developers seem to care about the content. There&apos;s also some new levels in the making, marked in game as &quot;Coming Soon&quot;. Xotic lives and im looking forward to new content!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2073624">Expand</a></span>

Here is just how I scored 10/10. Read others reviews for an explanation of the game&apos;s concept/premise.......... Overall I give this game a 10/10 because I enjoyed playing it so much. A game will get a 10/10 from me if: I stop being bored! Begin to thoroughly enjoy myself! Forget what i&apos;m doing! ..and can&apos;t hear anyone speaking to me because i&apos;m so engrossed. THAT is when a game gets 10/10 Audio: 10/10 - The music is relaxing but upbeat and fits the mood of the game so well. - The voice that announces &apos;awards&apos; and bonus points for special feats in the game changes octaves when repeated making it sound almost musical. - General sound effects such as explosions, firing weapons, turrets going nuts on your ass sound solid and fit the game so very well. - Everything sounds like it should and fits the mood of the game to a Tee. I think they did an incredible job on the audio. Graphics: 10/10 - Often when playing games I find myself picking apart games because they put too much emphasis on graphics and not the gameplay. However, XoTiC manages to cleanly Tick the box for both. The graphics are colourful, clean and fun as well as running very smoothly with crisp, clean edges round everything! (I&apos;m talking bout that kinda competition gaming smooth that limits you to ONLY your skill and NOT having to put up with any weird mouse drag kinda like what some might find can happen in the Serious Sam series) - The colours are beautiful and I just keep playing over and over again because everything just looks so awesomely pretty! (and for a full hetero guy im about to start flicking a rainbow out my manskirt. Can&apos;t wait to pit this on my big screen!!) Gameplay: 11/10 ---- Enough said... But I can&apos;t shutup just because of that! - It&apos;s the kinda game you can love to play even if you suck at it! It&apos;s just because it&apos;s so pretty. But for the people who LOVE this game it pulls off a massive 1 better than most games that I wouldn&apos;t be reluctant to give a 10/10. But I can honestly say that the past few years of gaming has been utterly boring! ..it&apos;s just sooo damn NICE NICE NICE to Play with a New toy kinda like when a new gaming console comes out! - This game pulls off a completely unique experience that NO other game to date has ever come close to. Probably looks like I got paid to write that! But no, the GAMEPLAY is what really shines about XoTiC. Has there ever been anything like this?? XoTiC - An organic, run &apos;n&apos; gun, rainbow explosion out my panties!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1761063">Expand</a></span>

This really creates a lot of re-playability in the game, as you&apos;ll want to go back and fine-tine your route through the level to achieve the highest score, the fastest time, and a solid ranking on the global high-score leaderboards.  Classic old-school arcade action all wrapped up in a modern first-person-shooter package.  I love it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1758968">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Xotic is one of the strangest FPS-Arcade games I&apos;ve ever played. While the player is not using an actual arsenal of modern-age or futuristic weaponry, the Macroterra Symbiont is still a cool weapon from an indie title. Another thing that is cool about this game is the graphics, it uses beautiful lighting and mapping, and it feels almost like it was made like a perfect mix between 9 and Star Wars.</span>

Xotic is one of the more original fun games I have played in a long time. Its extremely addicting game play playing the levels over trying to be more efficient each time. With gorgeous colors and interesting animation you feel fully drawn into this alien world.  The controls feel great and you can almost fly as you throw down hologram platform in between jumps.  I foresee this really taking off in the PC market and look forward to anything else this design team put out!

Mouse and Keyboard Players will be in pure bliss as it really rewards your speed, movement and aiming ability. The innovative Hologram riding game mechanic (you can create platforms at any time) is absolutely wonderful with the fast paced game play. The level design is top notch. It is ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL that this hasn&apos;t sold 100s of Thousands of copies.<br><br>Currently, I am number 1 on the leader boards. I have competed against some serious people and have truly enjoyed playing levels over and over trying to master the intricate timing and aiming required to achieve victory. I have played this for at least 50 solid hours and have enjoyed every second.<br><br>THE GAMING INDUSTRY NEEDS MORE GAMES LIKE THIS!!!

This game falls short in all three areas. The gameplay is floaty and loose, with very little visibility due to the game&apos;s art style. The levels are broken up into goals which basically amount to &quot;collect or shoot all glowing things&quot;, which is simple, but when coupled with the cheap &quot;die and you have to restart&quot; mechanic, it quickly becomes tedious and irritating. Finally, this game fails to satisfy in the action department, being riddled with slow, boring missions involving finding the last target among the many indistinguishable nooks and crannies in each map. Ultimately, this game is only for you if you like pretty lights, and if that&apos;s the case, there are cheaper ways to entertain yourself, like sitting in a four-way intersection .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2078376">Expand</a></span>

<br>it&apos;s really ridiculous how little the give you to start with here but anyone can plainly see they left plenty of room for additional DLC, which presumably they will charge for in the future. so if you spend the 10 bucks on this, don&apos;t plan on stopping there, you can count on spending more later because basically what they give you here is half a game.
<br>
<br>DO NOT PAY MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS FOR THIS GAME. BETTER STILL, WAIT AND BUY IT WHEN IT&apos;S 75% OFF (AND WHEN IT INCLUDES THE INEVITABLE, OBLIGATORY DLC). OTHERWISE THIS IS NOT A WORTHWHILE PURCHASE, THIS IS ONLY HALF A GAME, ONLY HALF A GAME...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/xotic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2014533">Expand</a></span>
