Let&apos;s start with the good points. The main menu is very nice - that gives the one point. Game looks pretty decent in the terms of graphics, but what doesn&apos;t nowadays? Problem with the graphics are that they don&apos;t run very well. I consider my PC somewhat high-end (Q6600, GF8800GTS, 2GB) but still the mouselook drags. Sounds are average, music is good, but why the music stops playing when the game loads? And talking about loading, it does it ALL the time. Loading times take ridiculously long, and I think I was looking at the loading screen more than actual gameplay during the first 15 minutes. Let&apos;s take an example: you walk in a (tube)jungle for about 50 meters - LOAD 30s - you found a person, talk to him/her - LOAD 30s - you find yourself in the plane, take a picture with your camera - LOAD 30s - you are again talking with the same person as before - LOAD 30s - you are on a beach.... Seriously? What the heck is this? Have the developers actually ever played this game, because it is not a bit fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-via-domus/user-reviews?user_review_id=410122">Expand</a></span>

As with the show itself, the compelling flashbacks reveal more and more of the character until you discover that you may not be all that you wish you were. This parallel to the show&apos;s overall structure, in (excruciatingly short) miniature is an innovative way to get the emotional appeal of the show across in a (pathetically) brief time frame.
<br>
<br>In short, this would make a really great game.
<br>
<br>PS Hurley&apos;s comment when you snap out of a flashback is worth the price of admission for the die-hard fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-via-domus/user-reviews?user_review_id=78851">Expand</a></span>
