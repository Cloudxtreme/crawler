Need to chisel out a gem? Nope, need gloves. Not to mention, the game gives back no input on this, so you have no idea what you&apos;re doing wrong. I have the disc version, which means it has the seal puzzle. Now, I&apos;ve tried the correct combination of gems on the board. IT DOESN&apos;T WORK! I even checked 10+ online walkthroughs. The puzzle doesn&apos;t work! The story is also uninspired, but the voices...

It actually CANNOT be completed without a walk-through, not because it is hard but because there is a fatal error that prevents the puzzle from resetting. In addition, the game crashed twice in just an hour of game-play and the protagonist became &quot;stuck&quot; on the landscape several times, forcing a reload. The graphics are buggy as hell, pixel-hunting abounds, and several hotspots are missing. Don&apos;t take my word for it, read a report of the critical bugs at: www.geocities.com/ataniel/center2.htm Even if this game were complete and bug-free, it would still be mediocre; with all the bugs and glitches it is absolutely abominable. This is the worst puzzle game I have played in my life, you have been warned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth/user-reviews?user_review_id=404166">Expand</a></span>
