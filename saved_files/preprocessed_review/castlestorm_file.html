With startling aptitude, it cracks jokes while juggling elements of tower defense and real-time strategy, and enough depth exists beneath its seemingly casual game-play to endear it to hardened strategists.
<br>
<br>The plot involves a knight&#x2019;s humorously epic quest to steal back a crystal from an evil Viking plotting to rule the world, but really, the heart of this game is in building a castle and then using its standard-issue giant ballista to fling projectiles  like exploding apples and boulders that split into three boulders  to bring your opponent&#x2019;s fortifications crashing down. At the same time, you have ground units you can send out to try to weaken the enemy&#x2019;s defenses.
<br>
<br>Suffice it to say that there&#x2019;s a lot going on here, and it&#x2019;s a credit to CastleStorm&#x2019;s  beautiful design and gentle learning curve that it never gets out of hand. Almost without realizing it, I eventually found myself taking full advantage of the gamepad, jumping from Y to sort through magic abilities and then to X to summon new units and then jumping to A to fire projectiles. In each step, I made transitions between up to 15 units and spells with the use of the right bumpers, occasionally finding the time to tell my friendly-fire prone ground units to duck out of the way of incoming projectiles with the B button.
<br>
<br>You typically have two ways to beat a level in CastleStorm. You can either destroy every room in your opponent&#x2019;s castle or send your ground troops across the battlefield to knock down their gate and capture their flag. One of these is far more satisfying than the othe. But CastleStorm also includes an editor that you can use to design your castle. You unlock new rooms by playing through the 12 levels of the campaign; in addition to barracks for your ground units and aeries for your flying beasts, you can also slot in special chambers that do things like make your troops do more damage or grant you bonuses to the gold you collect for taking out your opponent&#x2019;s forces.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is inevitable in a game like this, and Zen has made some very interesting decisions with it. You have three modes to choose from, the most obvious of which is a head-to-head fight in which you and your opponent race to destroy each other&#x2019;s castles or, less interestingly, capture one another&#x2019;s flags. But CastleStorm also includes two cooperative game types that are actually more fun than their single-player counterparts. Last Stand is a 2D brawler mode in which you and your partner each control one of the Hero characters. These are powerful melee fighters who are typically only available for a limited time in the campaign. But the most interesting of the three is Survival, in which one member of your two-person team controls the castle&#x2019;s ballista and sends out troops while the other controls a Hero character on the ground. Co-op Survival is a fun exercise in coordination and communication that gives both parties plenty of interesting and useful things to do.
<br>
<br>The Verdict?
<br>CastleStorm draws from a seemingly unmanageable array of inspirations and thoughts including real-time strategy, tower defense, and Angry Birds, and does so with remarkable creativity and humor. Touchy ballista controls may cause troubling gameplay on occasion, but the charms of CastleStorm&#x2019;s multiple gameplay modes, varied campaigns and units, and quirky presentation keep the action on track.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlestorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=3383509">Expand</a></span>

Its simply enough for anyone, with enough depth to keep you interested. The storyline that follows the campaign is quite nice as well, although I ended up skipping parts because I was simply interested in the gaming. Its one of those games you will go back to from time to time, very good little game indeed.</span>

                                        <span>This game reminds me about the old-day of flash games, with something to shoot to defend your territory, and to spend your resource wisely to spawn units to destroy enemies&apos; fortress.
<br>
<br>I think this game is a hybrid of shooting, strategy and resource management, which is not the same as the angry birds mentioned by other reviewers.
<br>
<br>Anyway, the art style is great and attractive.</span>

<br>I think I got it in a bundle which resulted in it being $1 or less, which is about what it is worth imo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlestorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5300656">Expand</a></span>

<br>It looks cheap, it plays OK, and will hold up a mans interest for an hour or two. For ten dollars on Steam, one can get much better games for less.

<br>Fun game.  I first encountered this at a convention, on a Wii U as a download.  Using the analog sticks and Wii U gamepad wasn&apos;t bad, but was pleased with the way the controls translated to mouse and keyboard.  The game also lets you rebind keys.  In hindsight, I could&apos;ve been more patient and gotten this + both DLC campaigns for $4 during a sale, but I jumped the gun at $15.  I&apos;d rather not do that with EVERY game (I honestly could stand to save the $$), but I can&apos;t say I have regrets
<br>
<br>FOR THE CASUAL GAMER
<br>play a few levels to beyond the 1st campaign.  See if you like it.  Do it on Normal mode or even Casual mode.  Try out multiplayer
<br>
<br>FOR THE AVERAGE GAMER
<br>at least play through the entire campaign.  Go back and get more stars.  Try out other modes like Survival, Hero Survival, and Skirmish.  Grab about 80% of the Steam achievements.  Play even more multiplayer games
<br>
<br>FOR THE HARDCORE GAMER
<br>5-star all of the campaign levels.  Try out the other modes in more in-depth.  Earn all Steam achievements.  Go crazier with MP games.  Go back to SP games and try out other ways to beat levels.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>-90% of the music complimented the game well.
<br>-sound FX are solid
<br>-During the FMV and nonFMV cut scenes, there are generic voiceovers, which surprisingly did the job for me
<br>-controls are intuitive enough
<br>-keyboard keys can be rebinded
<br>-There were meaningful choices in which equipment to upgrade, and when
<br>-other meaningful choices like prolonging the level until you get the bonus objective, or letting more enemy troops on the screen so you can activate Shooting Frenzy and get more damage done to the castle
<br>
<br>-campaign humor was there
<br>puns, cultural references, and even references to other video games.
<br>-engaging storyline, with characters that stood out
<br>It was enough that for reason I couldn&apos;t finish the game, I&apos;d go online to see how the campaign ended
<br>-variety of game modes...
<br>--some levels require you to capture the flag.  Others to destroy the castle.  Others let you do either
<br>--Then there are levels you play as the hero.  Some levels restrict certain types of equipment (e.g. no troops, no castle, or no use of Ballista)
<br>--others have it on &quot;hpyer mode&quot; where the cooldown for Ballista shots significantly reduced, letting you go hog wild
<br>
<br>-getting all the stars on campaign mode wasn&apos;t a pushover (due to the last 5%), but was still doable
<br>I had to either replay about 10 levels immediately b/c something slipped, come back to it after unlocking a new Equipment, or after having some $ to level up making it much easier to do so.  There were 2 or 3 levels, I did replay multiple times till I finally got all 5 stars.
<br>And yeah, I have quit games out of sheer frustration in cases where it was stupidly hard with virtually no margin for error.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>-4% of the time for the music... it got &quot;meh&quot; or even repetitive
<br>-every time you boot up the game, it defaults back to &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty.  You need Hard to have a shot a 5-starring levels
<br>-some portions of the game got repetitive
<br>For example, destroy castle.  Next level, destroy castle with the same setup.  However, to be fair, the game&apos;s relatively simplicity doesn&apos;t seem to allow that much ways to stray from this
<br>
<br>DUNNO
<br>-I have yet to try multiplayer</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/castlestorm/user-reviews?user_review_id=5846203">Expand</a></span>
