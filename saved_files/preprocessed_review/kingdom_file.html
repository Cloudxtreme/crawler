<br>The art style is good the pixelated graphics still manage to hold an air of quality and animation is equally good.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll admit that since I&apos;ve started writing these reviews I&apos;ve taken sound into account a lot more than I used to. This games soundtrack is great. While it&apos;s not something you can listen to on its&apos; own it follows suit of the games graphics and asthetic. It manages to maintain that retro feel without compromising itself.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is simple with the entire game revolving around two actions, moving left and right and dropping coins. Everything you do in this game will probably be the result of that last simple action but while it sound simple on paper the game complicates it to a ridiculous level. There are no tool tips and while the tutorial is quite well done it doesn&apos;t extend nearly long enough to explain anything other than the basics. If you plan to play the game without first reading your way through the entire wiki then you probably won&apos;t get far.
<br>
<br>Subjectively this game has a much lower rating than you expect : 5 it&apos;s painfully average in comparison to its peers in the genre. While the whole games execution is quite good the lack of enough explanation to how the game works drags it down quite a few points.
<br>
<br>Objectively it scores a 7. It&apos;s an enjoyable game that is above average in comparison most other games in the market but doesn&apos;t strive to deliver a deep enough gameplay to warrent any higher. The bad explanation of game mechanics drag it down from what could have been an 8.
<br>
<br>In the end this game serves as a harsh reminder that in an Indie game one bad feature can spoil everything because there just isn&apos;t that much content than in a larger game.
<br>
<br>Final verdict: 7</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=5854035">Expand</a></span>

The problem lies at its very foundation and the fact that the player is left with very little to no info on what to do and why. At the very end of an incredibly scant tutorial you are left with three words &quot;Explore,build, expand&quot;. So you do explore, build and expand to the point where no wave of monsters can destroy your fortifications. Soon you discover a demon portal, but your archers are too weak and too few to destroy it so you look for something to help you in the woods. There you are ambushed by a horde of demons, because apparently you didn&apos;t notice it&apos;s getting dark. You die. Again. You have to start from scratch. Another three to five hours of your life wasted and you&apos;re not really any closer to solving, how to beat the game. That&apos;s when I decided that enough is enough and removed the game from my hard drive. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the game itself is fun, but with no clear purpose to aim for it gets boring after several tries. If you got a lot of free time on your hands, have fun. I know I had some for a time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=5999300">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lovely game.  Some of the most gorgeous pixel graphics and music you will find.   Just having it playing and watching what happens is almost worth the 10 score alone.  However it&apos;s also a strong game with simple and easy mechanics that will take a while to master.  What I like most about it though is that there&apos;s no hand holding and the whole game is just full of mystery.  These mysteries will probably all be discovered when the game becomes (inevitably) wildly popular, but I&apos;d recommend just going in cold and discovering them yourself.  Great game and great passionate devs and publisher you should support so that more things like this get made and released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=5577503">Expand</a></span>

<br>What i did not like:
<br>
<br>The game is too punishing in its ways. The player must not make even smaller mistakes or he risks to loose to the next red moon - which leads to certain steps required to be taken - leaving little to nothing to creative design. So each play-through kind of follows the same pattern - making it only different in a slightly different random seed level layout.
<br>
<br>Too often it felt like i was loosing to chance rather than my poor decisions.
<br>
<br>So i would only rate this game a 5/10 - its simplicity is its charm but also its limitation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=5659372">Expand</a></span>

Are you prepared for the Blood Moon? Kingdom is a 2D side-scrolling, tower-defense-esque strategy game. The game is simplistic, yet brutal and demanding, and I loved it.
<br>
<br>In the game you gather coins through hunting or farming to be able to pay for increases in population, or defenses. The point of the game is to outlast the nightly onslaught of demons from magic portals in the forest edges. It isn&apos;t a very deep strategy game, but the game still manages to be very brutal and exhaustive in what it needs, and if things are completed in a timely fashion, then you have no chance of survival. The one downside on that is that you could argue a lack of replay-ability as certain things must be done to survive, and if they aren&apos;t done exactly right you won&apos;t win.
<br>
<br>Kingdom features an 8-bit graphical style, with nice overlays and a dark color pallet. The soundtrack is ominous and really sets the mood for what comes out to play every night.
<br>
<br>My knock on the game is it only has a single save file, and the game re-does the intro sequence each time you start over. You do have the option to skip through it, but it seems that could have been avoided entirely with multiple save files, and a game that remembers if you&apos;ve done the tutorial. Maybe even a check box at the beginning of the game to let you choose to do the tutorial? I feel like I am nitpicking, but it did bother me at every restart.
<br>
<br>The game really hit home with me, and is one of those strategy games that I lose myself in for hours and hours. I would definitely recommend the game to just about anyone. Each night is exciting and anxiety-filled, and the daytime is such a rush of getting as much done as possible and choosing what is most important.
<br>
<br>Oh no...how many days until the Blood Moon? It&apos;s tonight? Uh oh.

<br>It undos all the fun you have up to the end point.
<br>
<br>1. Half your army will become useless
<br>There are 4 portals you need to destroy with 2 on each side. Once a side is clear no more enemies will spawn leaving you to focus on one side.
<br>
<br>However your army will not move to the other side but will sit useless. And new recruits will always be spilt on both sides so every 2 people you will recruit one will go to the useless side. It makes matters worst if you have two shield men on the useless side as they will keep your archers together, when they could be used to make you income on your safe side.
<br>
<br>2. Portals will become useless if you build too many
<br>When you destroy a portal you can build your own portal which lets you transverse large distances. When you clear more brush you&apos;ll be able to build portals beside shrines. Your portal will no longer let you pick where and how far but instantly transported to nearest shrine which could spawn very close to your portal, and once a portal is used you can&apos;t use it till next day, so then you are running around back on your horse late game.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t stop building production
<br>Lets say you want to extend your portal, so you build a wall, but you find out you simply can&apos;t get builders there in time. If you could cancel the building everything will fall back to your previous line, but you can&apos;t so if you overreach its game over.
<br>
<br>How can this game be fixed?
<br>1. be able to unassigned shields (knight) units to avoid clumping.
<br>2. don&apos;t bother with secondary portals to shrines
<br>3. should move unused armies to other side to double forces
<br>4. be able to cancel a building construction
<br>5. be able to unassign any job</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kingdom/user-reviews?user_review_id=6460856">Expand</a></span>
