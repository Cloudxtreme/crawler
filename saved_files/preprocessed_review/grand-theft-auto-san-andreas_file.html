<br>The story is probably the best. I havent skipped a single cutscene trough out the entire game. It made me **** in excitement to know what the next thing to do was. But it was a little bit repetitive sometimes i thought. The sound is veeeeeery good. The soundtracks from the radios fit prefectly. The voice acting is great and the sound from ALL the different veichels are awesome. Actually, what made this game for me was all the veichels i could drive, anything from different types of planes to helicopters, tanks, dirt bikes, bulldozer and bmx.

In other words, I play these games for the gameplay. That being said, I find San Andreas to be the greatest GTA game of all time. The driving is probably the most important aspect of a GTA game. It&apos;s what you&apos;re going to be doing most of the game. Yes, you can walk on foot, but most of the time missions require you to drive to your destination, and it&apos;s not always just a mile or so away. And even once you arrive at your destination, half the time the mission is going to require that you drive anyway. So if the driving doesn&apos;t work well in a GTA game... Well what does? There goes a massive portion of the game down the toilet. But like I said, this isn&apos;t the case for San Andreas. It has the best vehicle variety we&apos;ve seen in a GTA game so far - Cars, airplanes, motorcycles, motorbike, bicycles, helicopters, boats, jetpacks, tanks, etc. each of which having their own advantages in differing situations. For example, a bike is slower in general, but you are able to bunny hop when you&apos;re on the bike so it is good for hopping over fences to get away from cops. Motorcycles have a very high acceleration (short term speed), and a decent top speed, but you won&apos;t have the defense that a car provides. I could sit here and explain each vehicle type in detail but it would be useless - Bottom line, the vehicles are widely varied in this game. Now as for the actual driving mechanics, this game went for the unrealistic, fast paced style GTA game. GTA IV went with a slower, more realistic style. Well, I mean I&apos;m playing a video game. I don&apos;t expect it to be realistic. That adds nothing to the game for me, but the change between the driving mechanics in San Andreas and GTA IV did in fact slow the gameplay down severely. It only did negative. I don&apos;t think they&apos;re going to go back to the old, unrealistic but fun style of GTA games. San Andreas is probably the last good GTA game. Also, the difficulty level of this game was amazing (referring to the missions). It is without a doubt the hardest GTA game, and although there are a few silly, problematic missions where things are hard for reasons obviously unintended by Rockstar, these very few negatives are severely overshadowed by the massive amount of positives. So let me sum it up - It provides the best challenge, it has the best mechanics in a GTA game, and it has the most variety. What more could you ask for?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2015892">Expand</a></span>

Over 110 story missions which are again very varied with lots of nice surprises. Good story too. The progression is paced perfectly, and the game offers so much. It feels like it&apos;s 10 different games rolled into one. So much conetent, so much variety. Only downside: terrible graphics. Other than that, fantastic missions, lots of side missions, innovative collectibles for each area and very rewarding! Fun to play. A real sandbox. You are free to do whatever you want- and there&apos;s so many tools available, this really is open world action at its finest. The thing that stood out for me is by far the variety. You get a taste of everything that can possibly be offered. Ever played a game and wished there was a feature in it? Not this game. There&apos;s almost nothing you can&apos;t do in this game and that&apos;s just in free roam. Every single percentage of progress you make is different from the previous. No other game- even by end of 2011- can offer as much quantitiwise in open-world action, never mind the variety.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769467">Expand</a></span>

The graphics finally look good, the draw distance is much better, and the custom soundtracks rule! The control scheme could offer a few more options or at least flexibility, but on the whole this game is phenomenal.</span>

It haves the same things as the console version, and even with better graphics, but console version is a lot better. Still, it is an impressive game. (8.8)</span>

So what if you can&apos;t mod it, any intelligent PC gamer would know that when you mod someone elses work it is infringing on their rights to sell a unique product. Then again many people just dont care about Rockstar and their goal of making a profit. If it wasnt for the good gamers you wouldn&apos;t have a game to play. I am not sure where most people are coming from when they play the game. Driving is really easy and flying the planes is possibly the easiest thing I have ever done. Don&apos;t be so quick to blame Rockstar for the issues that you have. If you cant fly then dont fly. Overall i love the game tremendously. Much more in-depth missions and just when you think you are doing good they throw a twist at you, which I like. The missions may be straight forward, but they can be hard to complete which makes it a good game because you just have to beat that mission! No problems whatsoever in playing the game, except that the sound has crashed and I can&apos;t get it fixed and there is no patch for it but thats ok because honestly when flying the hydra or the at-400 it can get pretty loud. All in all anyone who has a problem with the game is probably just venting because of their computer systems inability to handle the game since it does use a lot more memory than previous versions did. Well that&apos;s my take on it. Completely awesome and love playing it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=388641">Expand</a></span>

I have the ps2 version, but I got the pc version so I could see it on a monitor. There is a MUCH greater draw distance and the textures are sharper. It&apos;s great fun to just go driving and see hills in the distance, even condos on the hills! It can be breathtaking at times. You really feel like you&apos;re driving around a real city; there&apos;s a range and diversity to the terrain that you just don&apos;t get from imagined environments. The only negative point is the scripting and AI. This was a problem I didn&apos;t notice on the PS2, but on the PC, they stumble around like clowns. Cops in cars will make u-turns, fail to turn tightly enough, and kill other cops by squashing them against a wall. (I picked up a free baton and a gun this way!) Other drivers will sometimes bizarrely turn off a straight road for no apparent reason and smash into a wall. I saw one guy drive over a dock - his car plunged into the water, and he died. The people will walk into each other and get stuck, hilariously calling each other &quot;fool&quot; while they mill around unable to get out of each other&apos;s way (This happened with the gangs). It&apos;s a shame..graphically, you really feel like you&apos;re exploring San Andreas but when things like that happen suddenly it&apos;s just a game again. Also character models are repeated WAAAAAY too often. You can often see as many as five identical clones within viewing distance - five short skirted hookers, or half naked strutting men, or whatever. Once again it detracts from the experience reminding you it&apos;s just a game. But overall these were minor flaws, in the main, it&apos;s a great experience, I even had my GF watching over my shoulder because she wanted to see what the US looked like ....she was a little shocked by the language. :-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=381050">Expand</a></span>

Or kill someone and drive back to A while some people chase you. Or while the cops chase you. Or before time runs out. The side missions are the same. Whether it&apos;s collecting secret packages, spraying &apos;tags&apos;, taking photos or collecting horse-shoes, IT&apos;S ALL THE SAME. Delivering pizzas, passengers, prostitutes or couriering, IT&apos;S ALL THE SAME. Sure, it&apos;s fun but no where near as fun as it was the first time you did it in GTA 3 or Vice City. Probably the only differing missions are the flying missions and there&apos;s not much variety there, either. For such an open-ended game, the missions are so unimaginative, repetitive, and SHORT. The theme of L.A. street gangs is the worst yet. That&apos;s partly because the scope of your typical street gang is too small and offers no real possibly for character development/evolution. And partly because you sense it&apos;s aimed at satisfying those who go puppy-eyed when they see Tupac on TV and who romanticise petty crime. With such a theme, the music is predictably the worst of any 3D GTA game. The sheer size of the game world is impressive at first, but not when you realise that so much of it is dead space and offers severely limited interactivity. I&apos;d prefer a world the size of Vice-city with maximum interactivity than a larger world with great pockets of useless space. The graphics are poor. The inclusion of girlfriends is totally pathetic and surely can&apos;t interest anyone over the age of 13. I&apos;m a millionaire who takes an unattractive girl to a fastfood restaurant for dinner? What the hell is that? A relationship? There are some neat improvements such as customising cars and a pay&apos;n&apos;spray that eliminates any wanted level, not just the first two wanted levels. Driving schools and flying schools are great optional activities in which to hone skills. There&apos;s so much more to say but, in short, Rockstar have to re-conceive of GTA, re-plan missions (don&apos;t make them so straight-forward and short) and get rid of all the cutesy-poo girlfriend nonsense and disco dancing. Vice City was captured so perfectly. There is so much to lampoon both in and out of popular culture when it comes to L.A. streetgangs, yet Rockstar panders to it instead of treating it as it treated Vice City. Since GTA is so popular in Japan, it would great if the next GTA was set there because it so nicely opens up the possibility of again humourously reflecting upon popular culture while unleashing total carnage. Oh yeah, bring back the RAMPAGES! The best repetitive side-missions!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=381957">Expand</a></span>

This game should be used for players have have a really good computer, and shouldn&apos;t be judged if your computer sucks, and you haven&apos;t experienced the gameplay. This game is an awesome game. San Andreas deserves a 10.</span>

They didn&apos;t HAVE to unclude quite so much swearing, and it&apos;s not a very good game to play when parents are around, but all in all, it&apos;s deserving of a 10. You start as a gangster, but after a few missions you give up on that and there is (slightly) less swearing, so just put up with the vulgarities. Also, there are a few... dodgy scenes, but you don&apos;t see anything so it&apos;s not a problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=408223">Expand</a></span>

Access to the modding community. There are so many mods for this game I will never get bored of it. From real life cars, to superman powers and even jurassic park the possibilities are endless. A great game made better by the presence and potential of button happy programmers. The original version will never be as good as the PS2 version, but beyond that the PC opens up whole other worlds for the gamer to explore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697453">Expand</a></span>

This game is somewhere in the single digits of my top 20 favorite games. This game, an open-world third person shooter, is very well-written and funny as hell (I could spend hours listening to the in-car radio listening to the great music and the hilarious advertisements.) The only thing keeping this game from a 10 from me is the graphics. As I have stated in a few of a previous reviews, I am not one to grade down on graphics. However, this game came out in 2005 for the PC, and graphics for this time were becoming more advanced, yet Rockstar did not update or upgrade their engine from the previous GTA3 release. However, this game&apos;s shooting and hand-to-hand combat mechanics are very well done for a third person shooter. In many other third person shooters, I often struggle with aiming and lining up shots. In San Andreas, however, the zoom makes it easier, and lining up a shot much less difficult. The part I liked the most, aside from the story line, was the RPG elements it offered. It is an ambitious system, for a game of its era, in my opinion. It allows customization of the character, CJ, in many different ways, such as clothing, muscle, fat, and weapon skills are upgraded as they are used. The game takes into account these things for how the game progresses. To conclude this, GTA: San Andreas is a very well-written, and story-driven game. Though the graphics are dated, it still makes for a great game that can be played for hours on end, and when its been played already, it still has a whole lot of replay value, to explore more, to choose a different path.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2221504">Expand</a></span>

Mouse sensitivity is a problem for some, I use a microsoft X5 mouse with adjustable dpi settings. This dpi setting changes is a must.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;   Purchased for PC in Nov. 2011.  The best part of this game is the story. It is smart and the characters don&apos;t &apos;seem&apos; unrealistic meaning they obey what their characters are supposed to do.  The map is HUGE and has many different environments. There are many missions to do and is for some reason you finished them too quickely theree are tons of extras to accomplish.  The keyboard controls are remappable with limitations.  You cannot adjust for driving and flying seprately. I find that San Andreas a great evolution from the 2 previous titles and GTA3 and Vice City were both excellant games.  I find San Andreas more replayable though.  The total variety of &apos;stuff&apos; to do is fun if you wanna burn some free time with nonsense.

<br>PC vs PS2: Being released in 2005 and made to run on the ps2 the graphics are dated.  That being said on any modern computer, running the graphics on maximum, it is a night and day difference to play visually.  It is actually pleasent to view the game now.  The draw distance is incrased the the resolution is drastically better.  Although there are no story line differences between pc and ps2 there is the ability to mod the game (personally unverified for V3.00).  Playing on the keyboard is ok but the real plus for me is the free  look with the mouse. In the ps2 one had to use the mini joystick to do free look and it was only ok.  Although the flight controls are far worse on the computer.
<br>
<br>I highly rate this game but took a point off for the controls. Although only manageable at first, after a few hours of game play I found most of the controls to be second nature.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2013532">Expand</a></span>

I also like how you have to do weight training and running in order to gain muscle and endurance which help with how strong your punches are and how long you can speed along on a bike. I also like the missions and the character personalities. The list keeps going on and on, but I won&apos;t drag on. Overall, I would say the game is quite fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2110285">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack and effects are awesome.

<br>The graphics are outdated, the physics suck, and some missions are super unfair (All we had to do was follow the damn train, CJ!). However, GTA San Andreas is still an amazing game. You have a crazy amount of things to do, from car customization to racing to vigilante/ambulance/firefighting missions. And of course, you can simply kill police, use cheat codes, or explore the massive map. The storyline is really really good, as well as the characters, and I actually want to do the missions in order to see what happens next. If you never played San Andreas before, you&apos;re missing out on a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=3740042">Expand</a></span>

You can also use different codes for different items when I needed, Its like when I use the code  of the item I want and then the item comes up.  It&apos;s also a good way to get a feel for the different modes before jumping into ranked matches. The only thing I dont like on this game is 2 players cant play this game it has to be one player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=3194939">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story: This game has a huge and interesting story with excellent voice acting from some famous actors It also has great humour and shocking plot twists.
<br>
<br>Music: The music selection is excellent with amazing music from all genres but specificity 90s gangster rap.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: This is the biggest reason San Andreas is so highly rated, you will never get bored because the story missions never feel repetitive or boring and it includes a huge list of side activities which I cannot list in this review because their is just too much content in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=3268631">Expand</a></span>

<br>San Andreas didn&apos;t age well. The trees, the sky, the water and the textures look like a muddy mess!
<br>
<br>For whatever reason small patches that were included in the Retail-Version (like dirt on the cars and better visibility) aren&apos;t in the Steam Version.
<br>They also cut out many music-tracks due to copyright-bs!
<br>
<br>But the by far WORST part is the hostility towards modders!
<br>
<br>The structure of the engine and the source-code are so convoluted and packed behind barriers, that modding is like stabbing yourself in the arse multiple times with a rusty knife!
<br>
<br>To say it simple:
<br>Modding for GTA San Andreas is a pure waste of time and ressources!
<br>
<br>Did you wonder why you only see maybe 2 Videos of a modded HD GTA San Andreas on Youtube and even less tutorials for modding?
<br>
<br>Its because modding this hostile software is a pain in the d***!
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll need at least 2 seperate programs to insert mods and before that you&apos;ll need to convert the whole game into an early non-steam Version and pray that it will even start!
<br>
<br>The process of converting can f*** up important core-files of your game, so its possible that you&apos;ll have to reinstall the whole mess again,
<br>and if you are one of the few lucky ones, inserting the mods can create graphical glitches
<br>or it just doesn&apos;t do it at all.
<br>
<br>And don&apos;t forget: All the external programs to make your GTA SA look like one of these high-polished YT-modder-videos
<br>are incompatible among themselves!!!
<br>
<br>So if you want HD-walls and that one particular remodelled muscle-car: Never gonna happen!
<br>
<br>You ever wondered why there are thousands of mods for Half Life, Doom, Quake and even GTA V ?
<br>
<br>Because the Programmers didn&apos;t hide their source-code behind a feck-you-sign like a underpaid worker in the love-business in paranoid-land!
<br>
<br>The game itself is plagued by clunky driving and flying-controls (mouse-steering isn&apos;t disabled by default!!!).
<br>You would guess they did at least get that right in a game mainly revolving around driving and shooting, but no.
<br>
<br>The Main Character is out of breath after 5 seconds of running and you&apos;ll have to go weight-lifting with QTE&apos;s to run a second longer.
<br>
<br>Also it lacks funny and extreme characters like in GTA IV and V!
<br>
<br>Best game ever made?
<br>Not by a long shot!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=7375190">Expand</a></span>

<br>For starters, the game is just.. . . .fun, and not alot of other games these days can say that, the game is just plain fun. The graphics arent that great(but that can be fixed with a ENB), badass story and missions, the game does get a tad bit repetitive at times, but most people wont even notice because their blowing up sh*t in a tank, shooting some dude in the face, or running from the cops, there&apos;s a strong online community aswell, the game has 2(you heard me, 2) MP client&apos;s, one called San Andreas Multiplayer AKA SAMP, and Multi Theft Online( i personally like SAMP better). There are lots of side missions aswell, one has you and Catalina robbing a store and a tanker, with some pretty funny outcomes. Great voice acting, great soundtrack, there&apos;s nothing really more to say. If you dont have this game, GET. IT. NOW. I recommend the PC version because people have made some really crazy, cool and funny mods for this game.

Back then I didnt do any missions I just fooled around. I didnt think that game even had a point beside shooting cops and running people over. Now I have played game and got through its very long storyline ( bearly ) .
<br>
<br>My thoughts about story missions are mixed. I play and then 10 great missions come along, but then there comes mission so bad I thought Rockstar didnt even test those missions. Some are hard to the point of not being able to pass them, which is a serious shame considering how fun it is to play.
<br>
<br>Shooting mechanics are ok, but enemy AI is so dumb even for 2004 that makes shootouts scary easy compared to non shooting missions. Choice of weapons is solid , but your best bet is to take mp5 and kill all enemies in matter of seconds.
<br>
<br>As for the world and its many side missions, I guess they are okay , typical gta stuff, nothing more nothing less.
<br>Story and characters are mostly great. Apart from CJ ( who I found little irritating and Thruth ) . Story is pretty one dimensional and if there wasnt entertaining journey between first and last cutscene it would be pretty bad.
<br>Music in game is pretty horrible ( if you are not in the rap ) so thank god there is user track .
<br>Controls work, in most cases. Sometimes CJ wont get on bike for whatever reason, but that didnt happen to often.
<br>Companion AI like enemy AI is terrible. Most of the times he will run around the car like idiot while you are being chased which may end up in him being dead and mission failed. There comes another big issue , when you die all your weapons are gone , which is terrible detail and costs you a lot of time.
<br>Game world is big but some areas like woods and desert may feel little empty , but since this is a 10 year old game it isnt that big of a problem. Some pop ins are noticeable and sometimes can mean a police car spawning whitin 2 feet of you which can be really irritating. Graphics also cannot be that great because its such a big world , but they could separate fingers ( it look really stupid )
<br>All in all its very big game with incredibly long story line and hand full of both great and extremely irritating missions ,  but its still an experience worth having.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4358155">Expand</a></span>

This game should be used for players have have a really good computer, and shouldn&apos;t be judged if your computer sucks, and you haven&apos;t experienced the gameplay. This game is an awesome game. San Andreas deserves 10</span>

CJ will say the N word call people **** and harm people witch i normally would have no problem with but in this game its trying to say that it makes you hard core and trust worthy to your gang. guys come on are you for real here when your going the un funny intense rout you cant do this to your game! side attractions are pointless and have you lifting waits with quick time events and you have to do all of this if you are wanting CJ to be able to run for more then 5 seconds. you also have to eat food in this game to keep CJ strong and healthy. this game is like akward mother simulator take care of precious CJ or he turns into a no good fat fake OG its so stupid. this game is not the greatness we have seen in the other games i cant beleave i hate this game so much when i play the others hours a day to kill time in my summer. but i cant beat the game and there is no other fun to be had. the others were like if you did not like the story well go do all this other funn stuff rampaging movie theaters golf and so much more!!! go buy the others there great but this gets a 3 out of ten i give it credit for having an awesome story and for about 4 hours of fun at first. but if you want to see the state of san andreas go play gta V.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366630">Expand</a></span>

Though the PC version gets a 7 from me, the PS2 version gets a 9. What&apos;s not to love about San Andreas? You get all types of missions and side-missions, a huge world to explore, a very good story and downright excellent characters. As a bonus, you also get the RPG elements that spice up the gameplay and really help you out in the long run, such as having longer periods of running/swimming, weapon dual-wielding and building up an NPC gang that can follow you wherever. It&apos;s a gamer&apos;s wet dream. Alright, now onto the downsides. The PC port is pretty bad. I&apos;m not complaining about graphics being improved or anything for the PC, but Rockstar always gets lazy when it comes to PC ports. Look at GTA IV for example. The in-game settings don&apos;t stay the same every time you launch the game. You have to disable/enable the &quot;Frame Limiter&quot; option just to get certain game elements to work - and things like that usually make me quit playing a game outright and forever, but this game redeems that with the tons of positives. Apart from the PC issues, you&apos;re gonna come across those moments where a mission is insanely too hard or the AI doesn&apos;t work the way it should and it screws you in the end somehow. These are the same things you encounter in the previous games like Vice City and GTA III. Do these things break the game entirely? Not really. But can these things frustrate you greatly? Yes, very much so. Overall, if you&apos;re an old time gamer or a person just becoming a gamer, play this game. Just do it. Oh, and guess what? This game has two multiplayer mods known as San Andreas Multiplayer and Multi Theft Auto where up to 100 players can play on the same world. Be sure to play that too. Yes, both of those multiplayers are still being played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=2886181">Expand</a></span>

First of all, the first cut scenes were good until the &quot;Drive By&quot; scene came up. It was hilarious, in a bad sort of way. I got on the bike and noticed how bad the controls were for PC. Like seriously, it seems like Rockstar looked at the PC port and said &quot;Let&apos;s put Inverted  steering with a mouse, and whatever because PC gamers are fancy. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2005 game. &quot;The gameplay is more important than the graphics&quot; is certainly true...... but the graphics are so bad they&apos;ll take away from the experience. Overall, if you&apos;re looking at reviews and deciding whether to buy the game or not, please don&apos;t make the mistake I made. Other games such as Sleeping Dogs are way better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=3166239">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a great game. Even still in 2014 with IV and V out. But the game is filled with game breaking glitches, poor aiming, poor graphics/character models (even though that the game is 10 years old) and lots of features that are unfortunately useless.</span>

The graphics are below average, if not ugly compared to other new PC games. This was something I knew to expect, because PS2 is a pocket calculator compared to a up to date high end PC. The drawing distance is good, but the buildings and characters look very bad. -2 points. The other frustrating thing are the controls on PC. I do have a joypad, and still they suck big time. Even when I&apos;m using the joypad, the game expects, that I *simultaneously* use a mouse AND a keyboard. Don&apos;t the developers know, that a human being has only two (2) hands. Doing the most difficult tricks with the PC is a bad joke. - 2 points And then there&apos;s there are the camera views, which are very sloppy work. -1 points. Music is much more worse than in Vice City. -1 points. The Gangster theme compared to Vice City&apos;s Miami Vice / Scarface theme is lame and boring. The plot, btw. is a illogocal mess ridden with boring cliches. -1 points. The good parts? There&apos;s much to play and explore. The area is huge. The sub missions are fun.

All their games are really bad, especially the gta games before and after Gta 3, their only good game. This game, Gta:SA, has terrible graphics, lame cut sequences, idiotic missions with vague instructions, many of which are made impossible by the game. Eg, park the car, you start to park the car and some other car comes up behind you and won&apos;t move back and many other such complications. The cars are extremely bad as they are bad to look at and take damage very easily unless you move them very slowly. In game driving is terrible unless its a cycle. I am only writing this review because I am very upset that a bad game like this has a metascore of 94 from the so called critics. It deserves barely 54.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1569326">Expand</a></span>

Game requires you do some crap moves on a computer that I see in my 10 year old daughter&apos;s PS2 games! Ummm... Earth to Rockstar... Adults don&apos;t like doing repetitive motion exercises... too much like work. it&apos;s rated mature, but has crap like this? The developers transferred this from a console game to a PC game apparently without any knowledge of PC gaming. Removing the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; scenes: fine with me, couldn&apos;t care less. Removing the girlfriends altogether would have been more realistic. If I was the protaganist in GTA:SA and Denise mouthed off to me, it would be entirely within character to give her a Molotov rather than flowers. But making it non-moddable unforgiveable with a PC game. Half of the fun of PC gaming is modding them or playing other people&apos;s mods. I mean, Rockstar doesn&apos;t exactly employ geniuses when it comes to the actual story writing. This wasn&apos;t even worth the reduced $15 price tag with all the bugs (patch released for fixes doesn&apos;t work for V.2, but the patch fixes those bugs - just plain stupid Release Management). Gave it a 2 just because I like running people over on sidewalks after driving home from work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=385520">Expand</a></span>

For a game that has lots of driving involved, I can&apos;t believe Rockstar didn&apos;t have the competancy to include support for a wheel. Anyone who thought they might be hooning around the streets, &quot;Driving&quot; their car, will be severly dissapointed with this lame offering.</span>

Also, in some missions, like the driving class to learn car moves, some of them are almost impossible with the settings I have, I try to change my settings, and something always makes it too hard, for exm... On the move I am on now, you have too use the LeftMouseButton to back up, hold Q and E down at the same time to look behind you, then the LEFT key to turn, then the UP to stop reversing and the again to drive forward, all in 5 seconds. It is just flat out irritating, also some of those same missions the car views keep me from seeing the cones and I always hit them. And the graphics, though it does have a high setting, I have to keep it on low draw distance and low graphics for it not to lag, and I have a new pc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=381604">Expand</a></span>

<br>The storyline is pretty cool and fun.
<br>It starts pretty easy and fun but some missions that comes later was horribly hard.
<br>So unless you are a hardcore gamer on GTA then you are gonna need a trainer in those upcoming missions.
<br>Otherwise it has gameplay variety which is great.</span>

It should have had more of the &quot;sin&quot; aspect in it that other GTAs have, especially considering the fact that Las Vegas/Las Venturas is in it, but it wasn&apos;t bad on the whole either in that department. A couple particularly bothersome aspects of the game that should be improved upon in order to make it better would be to include better controller support, and make flying essentially anything much less frustrating. Maybe it&apos;s just the relatively pressure-sensitive joysticks on my Xbox 360 Controller for PC, but it seems like controlling any sort of aircraft is just VASTLY less frustrating and easier in the newer GTA games like GTAIV or Episodes from Liberty City. There is still room for improvement in these latter two games, but it&apos;s not as frustrating in these games as it is in San Andreas or Vice City by a LONG SHOT.<br><br>As much as I think this is an awesome game on the whole, I actually gave up on it due to the frustration of aircraft missions, and the lack of support for my 360 controller. I can&apos;t really blame Rockstar for not including these things considering the game&apos;s age, but yeah... it is what it is.<br><br>That said, I&apos;ll enthusiastically look forward to GTA V, and hope for a San Andreas remake in the future that will let us use our controllers, and make the flight system better in general. That said, I put a lot of time into the game, and it was good. I&apos;d still recommend it to anyone who is interested and thinks the bad graphics and these occasional frustrations wouldn&apos;t hinder their enjoyment of the game.<br><br>Otherwise, you might be better off getting GTAIV and GTA: Episodes from Liberty City instead due to the better controller support, graphics, etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=1942240">Expand</a></span>

The story is really good you play as carl johnston  or cj returing to Los santos after being in liberty city. The reason being his mum has died and has to go to her funral but when arriving cj is picked up by a coruped cop who uses gansters to do his dirty work. The story does evolve and is preety good but I like gta 4s story a bit more. The real star of the show was the world itself but I think gta 5 improved it. Gta 5s open world felt the right size it wasn&apos;t to small or to big. San andreas&apos;s map is huge which is both a plus and a negative. It is fun to travel and explore but iget board pretty fast because unlike other games in the sieres their are some boring areas and driving to missions which are sooooooooooo far away from each other its annoying. The wanted level system feels dated compered to gta 4 and 5. The characters range to unforgetable to forrgetable i try to remeber  the names but there are some characters which are boring and forrgetable cj is a good protagenest and his vocie acter does a good job. Samual l jackson a tenpenny is good stuff as well. The missions range to fun to ok to complete bordom theirs a mission were you have to pick some guy up whos across the map and when you pick him up you have to drive longer and then you take some pictures fun? There is a jetpack which is mind blowing but is not enought to hold a big game like this. The vichels handle very well but this feels like when they tried to get to realistic because it dosen&apos;t have the arcade feel the other games excluding gta 4.Gunplay is different to the console version in the ps2 and xbox you had a lock on but here you got a free aim system which works really well in my opinon but im not sure about the console version scince i havn&apos;t played it yet . The rpg system later used in gta 5 is introduced here and it works really well. Overall I love this game but not as much as some other titles but if you like gta and havn&apos;t played this game what are you doing I would recomend another game if you have never played a gta game but most people would recomend you this one first and i can kind of see why but i wound&apos;t agree its still a fantastic game but it hasn&apos;t aged that well which is fine hell i bet gta 5 won&apos;t be my favorite when new gamesin the francise  come out. Still play this game when you find it is easy to fin my score is 9 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/user-reviews?user_review_id=4435837">Expand</a></span>
