<br>
<br>It still has all the essence of the original, just with a face-lift and a few difficulty concessions - Which are welcomed. I won&apos;t lie, i never completed the game as a child without cheats, despite it being one of my all time favourite games, which is why i am happy i can now play it to completion! If you&apos;re a hardcore Abe fan and won&apos;t take anything less than the original difficulty, then there is a Hard mode, which brings you closer to the original experience.
<br>
<br>Overall, other than a few audio bugs (Which don&apos;t detract from the game thanks to visual cues), this games is amazing and i am having a blast! Well done JAW!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oddworld-abes-oddysee---new-n-tasty/user-reviews?user_review_id=5124241">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m glad they kept a difficulty original to the Abe&apos;s Oddysee, something for those who are familiar with the game. Compared to the original game I have to say the movement was better in the old one because it was faster and instant, but not as realistic as in the new one. The quick-save option kinda ruins the point of the checkpoints, but it can also make the game easier for those who aren&apos;t looking for too much challenge. There were some bugs here and there, but it&apos;s hard to find them and not very game-changing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oddworld-abes-oddysee---new-n-tasty/user-reviews?user_review_id=5213381">Expand</a></span>

<br>And I love it. I used to play this game so wrong. I didn&apos;t care about other Mudokons and always was killing them in different ways. But hey I was probably too young. Now at the age of a quarter century we can play this masterpiece with better graphics and updated sounds.
<br>
<br>Granted the easy and medium modes are no fun because there are no one hit kills anymore. But that&apos;s what hard-mode is for. And I immediately played on hard. After finishing it once I had rescued less than half and was left with a &quot;what the hell&quot; moment. To my surprise I found out that there were more puzzles, more secret areas. Areas I didn&apos;t knew existed when I was younger.
<br>
<br>Thanks Oddworld for this remake and I am patiently waiting for a reboot of Abe&apos;s Exoddus</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oddworld-abes-oddysee---new-n-tasty/user-reviews?user_review_id=5884268">Expand</a></span>

Back in the day I found them to be as moving and beautiful (not to mention really smart, entertaining, and challenging) as any game I&apos;d ever played up to that point. For the most part, my views haven&apos;t really changed, except for the part about me thinking the original first two are beautiful. They still are, but they have to be remembered in the context of what all video games looked like 15 to 20 years ago. With this in mind, one can probably imagine how excited I was to find out they were recreating at least the first one with up-to-date graphics. I will say that this is still a fantastic game, and I really appreciate that they&apos;ve even added to it a little bit. I also hope they keep remaking these. For all the negatives I&apos;m about to throw down, I&apos;d still buy an updated Abe&apos;s Exoddus.
<br>
<br>When I first started playing New N&apos; Tasty, almost immediately I noticed something was different. For all that they added, they seemed to take quite a bit away from it as well, which changes the soul of the game in a subtle and not-always-appreciated way. Maybe it&apos;s the fact that they&apos;ve gone somewhat away from its 2D sideview to give it slightly more visual depth and perspective (which I don&apos;t particularly care for). Maybe it&apos;s that the controller layout is somewhat different for this iteration (which I also don&apos;t really like). But one thing that REALLY stands out right away is that while the graphics are many, many times better than the original, the sound effects are substantially lacking compared to 17 years ago(!?!). The deep, almost didgeridoo-like sound underneath Abe&apos;s chanting is quite a bit less noticeable. The machine guns carried by the sligs sound like little cap guns now, where as in the original they had some beef to their pops (also, I don&apos;t think you can shoot across open chasms from a distant catwalk to one in the foreground anymore, which is a huge bummer because I always enjoyed picking off sligs up close). Basically, I was hoping this would be just a visually updated version of the original, but sadly, it is not (at least not enough to my liking).
<br>
<br>The strength of my grade for this game is based on my love of the original. I can&apos;t say this New N&apos; Tasty really succeeded in giving me the warm fuzzies. It came close though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oddworld-abes-oddysee---new-n-tasty/user-reviews?user_review_id=5539807">Expand</a></span>

Now that the HD version hit the store, I gave it a shot. But there is one fatal flaw: the gamepad controls. Here&apos;s mys experience using a wireless XBox 360 controller (user experience varies depending on gamepad used and on sheer luck) 1. If I use the default XBox 360 controller settings, I can&apos;t &apos;chant&apos;, which is an integral part of the gameplay. 2. Setting up a custom controller mapping makes it so that whenever I go into aim mode, Abe automatically turns to the right and stays locked, which means that I can never throw things to the left of me. 3. Using keyboard controlls and overwriting them with a gamepad to keyboard mapping program is dissatisfactory.
<br>
<br>Since nothing helps to make the gamepad work and playing a platformer with the keyboard would mean I would be going straight to hell, I can only give this game another shot once the devs fix this egregious problem. Until then, I can&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/oddworld-abes-oddysee---new-n-tasty/user-reviews?user_review_id=6092926">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I am so happy, that this game exists, it is so cool and funny. I recommend it to everobody who knows Abe and to everybody who doesn&#xB4;t, but wants to know :-) Sometimes frustrating, but balanced with lots of fun. And that surroundings! Wonderful world of Oddworld! :-) Nice...</span>
