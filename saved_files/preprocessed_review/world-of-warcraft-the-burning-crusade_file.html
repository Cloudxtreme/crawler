And this is the part where writers started to change lore and characters. But I remember it too fondly to give it anything less than 8.</span>

The amount of love and detail Blizzard continues to put in to their product is astounding. And for all those who say that it should have been free: You already get more free content than is offered from 99% of other developers. Pony up the well-worth-it asking price or enjoy your sour grapes.</span>

I absolutely LOVED the Blood Elves - the lore, the architecture, the culture - everything - and they&apos;re the main reason I switched to the Horde. I enjoyed the addition of daily quests and dungeons that were rich in lore and provided a challenge that was worthy of the original game. Outlands was artfully done and I really enjoyed the inclusion of PvP in Hellfire Peninsula, Nagrand and Zangarmarsh, which hailed back to the Sithilus and the Eastern Plaguelands in Vanilla WoW. The Isle of Quel&apos;Danas and the progression of its development via player participation, as well as the accompanying dungeons were one of the highlights of this expansion that I will always remember fondly. Burning Crusade was an expansion that maintained the spirit of the original MMO without altering it to the point where it was unrecognizable, as later expansions did. Though WOTLK gave us some fine additions such as Achievements that gave non-hardcore players an alternative way of enjoying the game, Burning Crusade maintained the challenge and magic of the game that I feel has been lost with each expansion that followed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=2657866">Expand</a></span>

The setting is awesome and all the zones are just amazingly well-done. The new races are my favorite of the whole game, the new instances AND raids were both challenging and memorable, and the addition of arena made the game ridiculously fun. WoW would never again reach the high point of TBC as every expansion afterwards was worse and worse (altho still pretty good).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=3279281">Expand</a></span>

Sadly the new expansion &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; did not turn out as well as i thought but all the other ones were good and i can&apos;t wait to see what new expansion comes out next! :D</span>

I remember I went offline in front of the Dark Portal so I can start off leveling immediately. When I went through it, I couldn&apos;t believe how much effort they had put in this expansion pack. The Graphics, NPCs, Quests (they finally had some kind of story-line), Dungeons were still really hard and Raids were for experienced players. I only got to Karazhan because it was actually that hard. The leveling itself was fun and still hard (something that can&apos;t be told for long). The professions were still hard to level ( I remember it cost me 1000 gold to get  Jewelcrafting to 300). And thought the epic mount got cheaper ( I don&apos;t know if the normal got cheaper,too), but the flying mounts were really big efforts to get (normal was 1000g and epic was 5000g). This expansion pack&apos;s whole life-time was great. From Karazhan to Isle of Quel&apos;Danas (this was my favorite part as it introduced the first kind of &quot;phasing&quot; and another chance to show off your teeth. By this I mean a Title that needed Exalted status and 1000 gold). This and Classic WoW were the 2 games that certainly worth the money you payed for their whole life-times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=1547997">Expand</a></span>

The leveling from 60 to 70 was really nice, but at the moment you&#xB4;re hitting 70 there&#xB4;s nothing different than at 60. Two weeks after getting lvl 70 I feel just boring in the game and I see no reason why to go on playing the game.</span>

The fact that theres tonnes of new things like abilities, races, talents, professions... the list goes on. Its probably not helpful to those not around the level 60 area, but for those who are, they&apos;re in for one heck of a journey!</span>

This was sadly wrong, as this expansion had not, in my opinion added enough content into the original to make it more appealing to new players then it was before.

However, I don&apos;t think that wasting 40 dollars is worth it as they should have given the content for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=396968">Expand</a></span>

With that all said it&apos;s fun to explore everything and get new powers, but I think it kinda broke it&apos;s fan base. I had just gotten to 60 when the expansion came out, but I would feel that for the people who had spent like 400 hours raiding before the expansion came out and had everything would be annoyed as hell that you can get better items just from playing the expansion for an hour. It&apos;s really well decorated grinding when it comes down to it. Furthermore, with the news of another expansion in the works it makes 30-40% of the content in this game pointless because the most powerful items in this game will be overshadowed in the first hour of the next one most likely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=401083">Expand</a></span>

I played the beta and was so turned off that I managed to break free of my WoW addiction.. It&apos;s kind of hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about the BC that turned me off to WoW, but prior to playing the beta I was playing 20-30 hrs a week :(. Something about the expansion just feels vacant, soulless.. The content feels far more contrived than the original. The immersion effect just isn&apos;t there like it was in the original. Somehow the content feels noticeably man-made and less organic. Maybe it&apos;s just me, maybe I just played too darn much of the original, but to me the expansion feels forced and awkward. I never had any of those OMG moments like in the original the first time you fly into IF. Btw, I have 3 60s, but only played my mage. I got to him to 63 before getting tired of the game. I haven&apos;t played the game since. Another thing that drove me nuts, I worked for months collecting epics in the original to get 7/8 tier I gear and was really angry to discover that I could pretty much replace all my epics by level 62. That totally blew. Oh yeah, and the flying mounts look kinda lame. I never got to fly one, but they just look fake the way you hover in place.. Overall the game was a disappointment, but hey I got my rl back and still have a gf :).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=395136">Expand</a></span>

Between the grinding, the Barrens chat, and the tedious raiding you should all see that WoW is a crappy game that sucks the life out of you simply because you have hopes of making your character better.

What came before that date was a bugged, unbalanced and quite grindy game and what came after The Burning Crusade was a bungle of trivial, repetitive trash, cleverly camouflaged as &quot;casual&quot;. On January 17th, 2007 though, World of Warcraft was great and would remain almost perfect for nearly two years. Every aspect of the game was still a proper challenge for people with brains, it had been updated in all the appropriate ways and dungeons were hard so that people had to actually learn how to play and cooperate to get through them. In fact it rewarded teamwork, dedication and social abilities across the board, exactly like an MMORPG is supposed to.

<br>Playing any other version of WoW than TBC is a flawed experience which is either too time consuming and poorly itemized or a poorly veiled insult to your intelligence. So what are you waiting for?

The gameplay mechanics are copied off from Starcraft, only with third person perspective. Too muc laging as well as glitiches. I&apos;m not a WOW nerd, so I don&apos;t give a **** about this game. If you like WOW, buy it at your own risk!!!</span>

When The Burning Crusade ended, an era of free epixx and general pandering to bad players began.  TBC got a lot of things spot on.  The instances were fun, and large enough that they took some time to go through them.  Heroic difficulty was how you expect (particularly at the start of the expac) i.e, takes brains and skill to get them done efficiently.  This was the last expansion to have a proper set of armour drop in dungeons. It gave people that do not raid something to aim for, it also gave the collectors and RPers an opportunity to grab some more nice gear for their collection.  I probably should have stopped playing after this expansion, it was definitely a high point for Blizzard.  The game has rapidly declined ever since.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=2619102">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> WoW needs to die, and this expansion is not helping. This expansion adds repetitive missions and does not improve anything about the game. Compared to other expansions out there, this seems like being handed a cup of sewage and told to pony up money. Sorry, but WoW has already blinded gamers&apos; eyes from the actually decent titles, and this is just another blindfold over their eyes.</span>

If you grind 1-60 yes it can be boring but that just shows how stupid you are (those yellow markers above npc&apos;s head means that they have a quest for you) Then there are so much more than just killing mobs there&apos;s q that requires you to gather herbs and stuff, need to bomb something, visit somewhere and many other kind of quest&apos;s. I know it takes time to level from 1-70 but you don&apos;t have deadline to it. And read the quest they often have pretty interesting storyline to tell you. It&apos;s okay if you don&apos;t agree with me but don&apos;t cry about it .And last but not least if WoW was a free MMO(RPG) it wouldn&apos;t have as much content than it now has. PS.

Most people will upgrade their gear within 3hrs of playing, unless you have full T2 or T3. And the quests let you make a TON of gold. I had made over 35g in 1hr via quests. This game was way worth the $$$. Thanks Blizzard for all your hard work and a great xp! Keep it up!</span>

Such emotional responses to this game, it seems to me that the people who gave it 0&apos;s are people who just hate it because of what others have said about it or playing another game and violently insist it&apos;s over-rated; and the people who say it&apos;s 10 are people who are addicted to the game play. I was really addicted to this game for a while, I would never turn down another activity to play it however. I have a level 70 Mage in this game. In the time I&apos;ve played it&apos;s been really fun, what really captivates me about it is just how complete much of the world seems. The world as a whole is very unified and filled with very diverse creatures, items and environments; the plot is continuous, compelling and epic in scale; the graphics are stylized but work flawlessly with the intent of the game world. From a technical standpoint I haven&apos;t experienced any networking issues that cause me anything more than mild annoyance every two months or so. I feel that Blizzard has pulled off a technical marvel in having as little errors as they have had on the scale they are building on. The negative traits of the expansion are the negative traits of the original game but magnified. For everybody who hasn&apos;t reached level 70 yet, the game play changes completely after you reach level 70, the only things you can do after that point is grind, and it&apos;s magnified remember, so it takes almost four times as long as it did in the original to make progress. so to create a mid-high range level 70 item finding all the materials by yourself will require you to keep track of your cool-downs for anywhere from 4-28 days unless you want it to take longer, and a good 10-20 hours of grinding for other materials unless you want to pay a huge amount of game currency to get them faster. So the devotion required to get one of those items requires you to spend 8-26 hours grinding if you accomplish this in a month as I did, you will have spent 1/30th of your time that month getting an item in a video game. Since I got that hard won object I have had no desire to play that game since, I canceled my subscription eight days later. In addition to that, the news of another expansion pack will mean everybody who grinded for 200 hours in the original WoW to get the best items and found in the Burning Crusade those items can be replaced in an hours time, and also the people who will have grinded for 400 hours in the the Burning Crusade will probably find that their items can be replaced in as little as 4 hours time in the next expansion pack. The fact that there will be another expansion reduces the playability of this expansion and makes all that grinding for rep, gold and items that much more pointless. I paid $100 for this experience including four months subscription fee, before you buy this game, think of other forms of entertainment with an equivalent price tag, I&apos;m not saying don&apos;t buy it, I had an enormous amount of fun with it till the event I mentioned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=401087">Expand</a></span>

The new continent of Outland is expansive and very scenic, and the new quests are extremely well implemented. All told, a must buy for any WoW player. And if you hit level 60 and got bored (like many have, I&apos;m sure), here&apos;s a reason to keep playing. A terrific expansion pack.</span>

It&apos;s pretty hard to broach any single topic without starting an entire discussion. The music in the game, for example, continues to be outstanding; from the title theme that plays during the breathtaking cinematic introduction to the expansion, which is ominous and thrilling, to the simultaneously enchanting and off-putting scores of the Blood Elves&apos; homeland which culminate in a majestic battle-march in the capitol itself, Silvermoon, to the downbeat, dreamy tunes of the alien Zangarmarsh, Blizzard&apos;s audio work remains some of the most engrossing in the business, creating a truly immersive experience. It&apos;s far easier to talk about the things the expansion didn&apos;t do right. Those who weren&apos;t satisfied by the original game will not find any endearing qualities with the expansion, the intent of which, in retrospect, was clearly to supply the fanbase with more of the same old. The only radically new features are flying mounts and PVP Arenas, both of which have become incredibly popular (and staple) parts of the game for many. Character customization for the older races is still lacking, and fans look eagerly to the second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, to supply these things - but for some it might be too late. Still, these complaints are far too minor to compare to the expansion&apos;s numerous accomplishments, and the two new races combined with Outland will provide gamers with weeks upon weeks of engrossing content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=406833">Expand</a></span>

I remember when Diablo II: LoD came out and I was more addicted to a game that I had ever been. When Burning Crusade came out I lvled up to 70 in a bit over a week, did a couple of weeks of instances, pvp, and rep grinding, and then found myself bored as hell. They also should have named it the Grinding Crusade because once you hit 70 anything you would really want requires stupid amounts of grinding and i&apos;m not talking at all about your first flying mount. I had the gold by 70 to get my mount and skill and had bought tons of expensive stuff before I even hit 70. It&apos;s the fact that when you rep grind and such generally there is only 1 item or so per rep that you want meaning you have to grind soo many different reps if you want some decent rewards. Also with flying mounts, they are probably the only change to the actual gameplay, and even then they are really just a method of transportation. You can&apos;t do anything interesting on them aside from fly to different areas and as cool as it may sound it gets boring extremely fast. I even had an epic flying mount before I quit and still wasn&apos;t overly excited. Maybe it is just me but I will warn you many of my friends have quit for pretty much the same reasons I have listed and many more that would take way too long to list. I definitely do not recommend this game, especially not for someone considering getting back into WoW. All new boring content and no gameplay enhancement/changes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=397815">Expand</a></span>

The reputation grinds are far from &quot;same old boring crap&quot; as most instances give the required reputation (if you don&apos;t like instanced dungeons you may as well not play the game, as it is a huge part of the end game and the reason you gear up to begin with), with the exception of the Kurenai/Maghari(sp) reps, which yield items that aren&apos;t exactly necessary for the game, but are nice additions (a new epic ground mount, which you don&apos;t HAVE to have, some vendored gear which has similar counterparts elsewhere, etc). If you don&apos;t like instanced dungeons, there&apos;s always PVP battlegrounds that offer quite powerful epic gear.

The variety in the new quests and overall content is a nice change to what was beginning to get old and really quite annoying (levels 50-60 are a pain. &quot;Hey, welcome to Darnassus. Take this backpack to Suchandsuch in Nethergarde Keep&quot; [NW corner of the world to SE corner of the world with no direct travel &gt;.&lt;]). Instances like Blackrock Depths are waaaaay too long for my taste, and the new instance dungeon formats of trash-trash-boss x3,4 or 5 are a nice. And finally, the inclusion of (now 2) 10 man raid instances allows smaller guilds to progress significantly (and effectively gear up) without making the 25 man guilds feel cheated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=69010">Expand</a></span>

The two new races are a welcome addition for beginners and there is plenty of great high level content including the new world of Outland. Only flaw is that high level dungeons take an awfully long time to complete. You can still solo up to 70 though.</span>

The zones are massive and absolutely epic, beautiful and at the same time enormously deadly, instilling in the players a sense that this world was truly ripped apart by the most hated force in the entire universe, the Burning Legion. Encounters are epic, the items is fittingly themed with orbs of legendary energy and what-not, and that package is very solid. A must-have for WoW vets and those new to Azeroth; the demon-wracked plains of Draenor await.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=403795">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a boatload of solo quests - I&apos;ve completed 15 already in just the first zone and I keep getting more - the new instances are dynamic 5-man affairs with memorable boss fights, and faction rep plays a much larger role: there are a huge amount of new factions with their own special rewards for gaining reputation.

Also reducing the levelling time giving more experience, per quest and less experience required per quest as well. Both of these changes are significant for both the hardcore player and the casual player. No longer if you choose do you have to grind and grind to keep up with playing the game :) The game for me has 3 stages, a levelling stage, questing improving your character to get to 70. At 70 I spend my time raiding, going to instances with 10 or 25 people, learning how to kill certain bosses. Sometimes taking a significant period of time. And for me the third stage is playing other classes, exploring all aspects of the game in my time off from playing my raiding 70. Raids are organized often by guild for specific times, usually in the evenings, so you can spend a few nights per week learning new bosses and annihilating known ones. For those with time restrictions the new daily&apos;s allow only 1-2 extra hours on top of this to get enough cash and materials to support a raiding character. Blizzard have given us choice in this game now. For me I am addicted. This game has many females playing it too. I am an over 50 yr old female who loves this game.

Burning Crusade has Cool pvp sets, it had many fun raids, and heroic dungoens. and those dungeons were rather hard.. the amount of skill needed for these dungoens was awsome and how much you needed to think about what was happening in the fight, if your group wasn&apos;t good enough then you&apos;d never even reach the 1st boss.. that&apos;s what i miss most about the game. i give this game a rating of 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=1447269">Expand</a></span>

That is one thing, but then you have to look at the client patches and hot fixes. Well, when this first came out it was super challenging. PvP was challenging. There were some balance issues but honestly not nearly as so when Wrath of the Lich King dropped. After that everyone else was nerfed and Death Knights became the new OPed class. Really they say they have taken lengths to balance the game more but honestly I feel it required more skill in Vanilla and Burning Crusade than in the other two expansions. True, some things may have been more difficult in terms of facing other players but I can&apos;t help but feel that it was much more balanced in this expansion. Plus many of the things that made all the classes so unique in the first two, were changed in the following expansions, so now there are lots of people with self heals, bubbles (makes them absorb or not take damage for a while), things like that. I miss when I had to use the abilities that were unique to my class in skillful ways to take down the others. Having an advantage balanced by another advantage in some other way. (if that makes sense) Rather than having the same abilities with a different name or slightly different implementation. The instances and raids added during this expansion are terrific and flying just makes travel so much easier. Also the new areas added are stunning in terms of graphics. It was the nerfing and removal of many unique class features that caused it to drop a point on the scale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757507">Expand</a></span>
