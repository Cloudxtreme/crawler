I would like to see it as realtime graphics, this would be one of the best styled sf games. ps. the cinematics are awsome. An advice to developers: please make the next game as action game with better story and gameplay than this adventure ;) !</span>

One of the few games where I had to use TWO walkthroughs to finish the game. This is a long game, and after awhile ... you just resort constantly to the walkthroughs ... knowing that some unrelated object or trivial encounter that couldn&apos;t be anticipated is stopping you from progressing. It&apos;s a shame, because a lot of effort was put into making this. Some uniquely creative thinking went into features such as a preview pic of the next room -- off screen. And there&apos;s no scrolling inventory! Unfortunately there was no basic check of: Does the plot hang together? Hotspots are very easy to locate, yet clicking that hotspot can be trying, and what to do can be completely obscure: it&apos;s schitzophrenic! Multiple walkthoughs are necessary, because different versions of the game were released, E.g., one where approaching a wall lights up the initial button to press, while the other does not! Well, that sort of thing leaves the player quite confused whether the game is suggesting they&apos;ve missed something. Only if you like combing two walkthroughs for missed details are you likely to find this amusing. Toward the end, you just wish it was over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-immortals-of-terra-a-perry-rhodan-adventure/user-reviews?user_review_id=1438201">Expand</a></span>
