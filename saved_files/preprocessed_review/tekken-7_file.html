<br>
<br>The best thing is that the cross over works VERY well; Akuma uses Street Fighter system instead of converted into Tekken&apos;s. This has been proven failed on Street Fighter X Tekken, where all the Tekken characters adopt the SF system. Not just that, Akuma is very well balanced too, it&apos;s hard to spam the hadoken within the game, you&apos;ll need to do close up combos using this character too, but nevertheless Street Fighter player will feel very at home using Akuma.
<br>
<br>Hopefully they will bring more cross over characters into this game (AFAIK Geese Howard from Fatal Fury is coming).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7491194">Expand</a></span>

Treasure mode which is simple more advanced Ghost battle... except Online is thats all? Two years of develpment and only this?! This is a joke, big joke Namco! Where is Tekken Force Mode (T3, T4, T5, T6) where is my most favorite Team Battle Mode?!? Not even Survival?? No?! OMG I was expecting many game modes like in all previous Tekkens, incuding Tekken Ball Online + Tekken Bawl Online + New modes. Im very disappointed :(
<br>
<br>Next lack of characters incuding classic iconic characters; TTT2 got almost ~60 characters, here we have ~35 nice progression Namco Tekken 6 got 40+ We get Panda + Kuma as different slots but no Jaycee(Julia), Lei, Armor King, Baek, Anna, Ganryu, Kunimitsu, Jinpatchi, Wang... Bruce, Marduk ;/ Big Joke! We got again sux Bob, Lili, Leo... OMG!
<br>
<br>Most new characters are too anime oriented and generally bad: Namco try to change brutal fighters into dancers and idiotic girls? There is no Marduk, Bruce, Armor King like I said but instead we got Lucky Chloe, Gigas, Katarina, Josie: all trash!
<br>
<br>Connection Problems
<br>
<br>Akuma; this is not SF where are tons of Fireballs!
<br>
<br>Graphic; worse than in TTT2.
<br>
<br>DLC oriented: Namco will try to sell Us packs with new modes/characters which ond Tekkens got on release! Shame!!! Tekken Bowl Mode in paid DLC? No from me that ez cash grab!
<br>
<br>Two years of development and nothing! TTT2 is still a lot better Im totally dissapointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7359035">Expand</a></span>

Tested 3 sticks so far, no problems. The game is deep and very rewarding to play. Have yet to find any issues with the PC version. Online is smoother than some games that have been out for a while (SFV).
<br>Its easily the best fighting game to come out in years. Ignore the poor reviews, they clearly have not played the game or are not fighting game veterans. highly recommended to those who love fighting games!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7337492">Expand</a></span>

The only negative is that there&apos;s no &quot;team battle&quot; and the graphics is sub par todays standards, and Tekken games are often knows to have great graphics &quot;for a fighting game&quot;.
<br>
<br>This puts Tekken 7 on a solid 9/10 and I would love to see all the old characters returning in some form of DLC, free or payed. I would also be more than happy if the next Tekken game also gets a PC release in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7345799">Expand</a></span>

<br>Somehow Lei Wulong is gone - a charecter with one of the most interesting fighting techniques. Movements are somewhat robotic, physics didn&apos;t advance much from T3 (it looks much better in DoA5 and in MK X), fighters hit each other with a sound of an empty can.

<br>1. Online is crap as hell, even after patch, you cannot connect, waiting few times more than playing to find an opponent (disconnecting and lost connection - typical issues).
<br>
<br>2. Even when you find opponent, there is 1/3 chance you will lag, sometimes you will have 4-5 games in a row that you will have heavy lags. You can easily lose to someone spamming one combination, and there is no fun even if you win, since no skill is involved.
<br>
<br>3. Game has horrible code, it is loading all the time. Character screen? I need to load it. Choosing which side of the screen you want? I need to load it? Finding opponent? I need to load it? Accepting rematch with same opponent and map? I need to load it. For a game with so little textures and objects, this **** is constantly loading - you get old in this game, waiting for anything to happen.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, if you are a billionaire who burns money and just want to waste time by waiting for something to load and then lag to death... still dont buy it, donate to charity. It is the only online game I play that has so many, basic problems. It is as if Harada and his team, spend this 3 years on designing hats and tshirts for characters (which are still ugly ) instead of making online works, online which is the only thing making this game worth any penny. Its a waste of time and money, run, switch franschise, as clearly there is no future in Tekken. If in 2017 they cannot figurate out online gameplay, then really something is wrong with dev team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7418760">Expand</a></span>

Also single player is poorly written and short the game is only great if you are a die-hard fanatic of the genre. Be aware the PC version has anti-consumer DRM trash called DENUVO</span>

<br>2 years ago this game was release on Arcades in Japan, and for this reason, the company had a great time for balance the game completly, before release in consoles. Anyways, this tekken like others tekken. The game was release with many characteres, a great story mode, with a great netcode and etc. Buy it!</span>

<br>
<br>This is an updated revision for Tekken 7.I had resume it in pros and cons.
<br>
<br>Pros.
<br>
<br>- New interesting characters
<br>
<br>- Hi resolution characters images presentation
<br>
<br>- Dramatic cool intro video
<br>
<br>Cons.(AND THERE ARE SEVERAL AND VERY BAD)
<br>
<br>- Irresponsable media hype,troll gamers including kids, casuals, youtubers ambassadors
<br>motivated by free gifts and quick cash grab and flashy presentation creates for the uninformed/missinformed,
<br>a short term illusion of a good purchase before trying out the product for real.
<br>
<br>- Only 3 offline modes. Story that is like a tutorial that I haven&#xB4;t bother to complete
<br>yet and  a pathetic Arcade mode.Plus treasure mode is a stupid joke.
<br>
<br>- Treasure mode only shows a single permanent stage.
<br>
<br>- Outdated and crappy graphics showed in all old characters who are the majority. Pretty evident even in history mode like Nina Williams.
<br>A white crappy glossy finish in all characters.
<br>
<br>- Customization icons for characters are cheesy, stupid, ridicule,hurried, limited and dull copycats of  other games  like the christmas suit copied directly from DOA 5 LR WHAT IS ANOTHER FIGHTING GAME THAT IS SUPERIOR IN EVERY DEPARTMENT AND OLDER THAT TEKKEN 7.
<br>
<br>- Ridicule number of modes, no more stuff like minigames. No beach volleyball, bowling, rpg mode,adventure mode, challenge mode,tekken dojo, not even Time Attack, survival, tag mode, combo challenge, trials, hidden featured unlockers, nothing at all like arcade fighting good games used to have, including previous Tekken releases.What a joke!
<br>
<br>- Several classic and important characters absent that its crazy !
<br>No more kangaroo,Anna Williams(sad),Baek ,Julia Chang ,Lei Wulong(sad),Mokijin(double sad),Raven,etc,etc.etc
<br>
<br>- Special crappy unbalanced copycat supermoves from DOA 5 LR again.( Mindless junk!)
<br>
<br>- Stages are mostly bland,boring, or quite silly like Kinder Gym,and Tekken 7 dev team even dare to copycat several of DOA5.LR.
<br>(You guys have proven worthy and very innovative.SARCASM!!!)
<br>
<br>- Idiotic HUD icons completely irrelevant as smiles on FB. Only issue here is this supposed to be a
<br>videogame not a stupid chatbox.
<br>Happy April&#xB4;s fools? Duh.
<br>
<br>- 5 stages to finish Arcade including the final character that isn&#xB4;t even a proper boss !
<br>
<br>- Character moves and combos severely changed from previous games to handicap them.
<br>
<br>- Online issues that cannot be improved any time soon by the poor sales.
<br>
<br>- Online rankings removed from display controversy because casuals got sick of fighting hardcore freaks.
<br>
<br>- F2P feeling resembling previous game alike from the series.

- Microtransactions and dlc coming ahead. Wasn&#xB4;t the full expensive price for this fighting incomplete game enough?

- Controversial full game price whatever your port.

In conclusion I don&#xB4;t like to make game reviews to depict how can companies
like ruin over tittles that were classics or at least were good before,motivated by greed.
But in the case of Tekken 7 I was shocked of how can a previous success is treated with so much scorn and hate
that can only be traduced like a wish for the total failure and bankrupt for a years ago cool ip.
It&#xB4;s sad to see what Namco Bandai did to Tekken at the end but at least I hope they go away with the madness and reconsider letting it go to die in peace like it deserves.F***!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7336926">Expand</a></span>

One exception is the BGM, tekken 7 seem to have some of the worst music of any tekken games, at times it seems like they release a bunch of cats and dogs in a room full of instruments and let them have at it.
<br>
<br>Tekken 7&apos;s gameplay and mechanics however, may not be for everyone. I grow up in the 90&apos;s and been playing fighting games since Street Fighter 2 on the SNES. Naturally, I&apos;ve been following tekken since tekken 1 on the ps1. I remembered I was enthralled by it&apos;s graphics, freshness and novelty then as it was one of the first few 3D fighters available.
<br>
<br>Now that I&apos;m older and more jaded, I found I look deeper when it comes to games. Tekken 7 while seems complicated at first is actually quite dull when you&apos;re familiar with most of the mechanics.
<br>
<br>A typical fight at high level generally involves both you and your opponent twitching around until one of you gets a launcher and hits the other in the air, after this happens, you proceed to juggler about 1/3rd of the other&apos;s HP away then rise and repeat. As you can see, the launcher is the key and the whole game revolves around who gets launched first, and this process is quite boring. In addition, it takes away the control from the player that gets launched too long.
<br>
<br>It also makes some mechanics unnecessarily complicated, like the infamous korean back dash which is a move that requires the player to do an awkward input (back, back, down-back, back, down-back, back.....). It adds nothing to the enjoyment of the game and only make it more painful to play.
<br>
<br>In games like SFV, while technically flawed with many problems especially online connectivity, the core of the game is sound. It may seems simple at first glance but this actually made the game easier to access and understand. Every win and lost, both you and your opponent knew what happened and you sometimes even feel impressed even though you lost due to how cleaver your opponent was in the match.
<br>
<br>In tekken 7, most of the time when you lose, it will seems random to you and you learn nothing from your lost because each character has a huge move list some with special properties. To truly enjoy this game, you need to spent years, learning and be familiar with EVERY character. If not, everything will seem a bit random to you. I&apos;ve been playing tekkens since tekken 1 and even to this day, some lost still feels random to me.
<br>
<br>Maybe my taste changed over the years, but mechanically, this franchise no longer impresses me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7373108">Expand</a></span>

This is a great fighting game with beautiful and colorful Unreal Engine 4 graphics. You can use your game controller with no problem and with several game modes available playing feels rewarding. I personally love treasure battle which is like an arcade mode, but you can unlock dozens of items and earn in-game money to buy even more (with no microtransactions whatsoever), customization is AMAZING, I love how deep it is (for a fighting game). Combat is fluid and fun and also feels balanced. There is a large character roster to pick from (36 and 37 if you include pre-order). Characters have very different fighting styles and have a lot of personality. Music and sounds are cool.
<br>So, in a nutshell, Tekken is awesome. Well done Namco!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7391084">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s not much fluff or filler for the casual audience, but Tekken 7 was built to be played for years. This is why you will see the game supported by the community for the next 4+ years at tournaments and events. There is a good amount of 1-plater content, including a great customization mode... but the overall story and presentation feels a bit rushed. Still, Tekken 7 is one of the best fighting game experiences of this era. Practice up and learn a few characters, because you will be rewarded with fun mind games and epic moments. Rage Arts and Power Crush techniques are designed to help new players, but these new mechanics are heavily punishable by 3D fighting game fundamentals and skill. Tekken 7 is a no BS fighting game. Learn the ropes, or get owned with style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7371841">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For beginners I would suggest the first thing to go in a training mode. There you can practice combos and explore the character. Learning in the game. For me it&apos;s not a problem, but still I would like to deal not so as it is not very obvious. Tekken 7 is a 3D fighting game, you can dodge not only forward and backward, and to move closer to the screen or farther away - this can help in the battle.
<br>
<br>The fighting system in Tekken 7 is something between Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. It is less skillsability than Street Fighter 5, but your character need to learn and a long train with him. It&apos;s no joke - the list of techniques every character has like, over 100. The same character can fight in different ways. Tekken 7 easy to learn, but difficult to master. I like to hone the skill for the characters, and in this game it is fun and convenient. Management intuitive, and there are several modes against the AI. In Arcade battle, a limited number of opponents, so I suggest you have fun with AI in the &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;. Where the enemy is endless, and for the victory give random stuff to different characters.
<br>
<br>Tekken 7 is and subject company. But don&apos;t buy the game for the sake of the plot! Tekken is the game for local battles or fights over the network. The plot is so-so training crossed with the story. Overall, the story is simple and yields the same Injustice, the story is also very short. But he has excellent points, also I wanted to know the history of the characters (pity the game is not the text of the biography). The game is beautiful and epic video, great music. Well, the best that the game has is the ending. He is well-choreographed, and, perhaps, this is the best episode in all fighting games! I passed the company in the medium difficulty and the last boss I have notably burnt. I was filled with a family history of Mishima, and Heihachi in particular. Unlike MK and Injustice, Tekken 7 reasons for fighting don&apos;t look stupid. You always know why and for what the heroes have to fight. What I didn&apos;t like is the voice of the journalist. He is always calm and monotone, and even in these moments of playing somber music. The company gives us to play for a small number of characters. The history of the characters is in a separate tab. These stories are very weak, and felt like an unnecessary appendage, and even fight for them, only one.
<br>
<br>There is character customization - it&apos;s fun. You can put any character as you wish your fantasy. You can spend money on clothes or to unlock the materials from the past games in the series Tekken.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer no lag, everything is very smooth, so if you lose it&apos;s your fault, not the joists (e.g. as in MKX). The enemy searched not long. If you feel that you are ready to fight against real players, then feel free to go out in a multiplayer game. Ping and lag is not annoying, everything is stable.
<br>
<br>All fans of fighting games should join Tekken 7. This is an interesting, deep, high-quality fighting game. In MKX I spent 100 hours, I think, and then spend less. I&apos;ll see you in battle:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7359276">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story mode actually gives you reason to care about the characters, specifically the Mishimas. It&apos;s a rather tragic tale that really rounds out the main characters of the series. And the character chapters are interesting and sometimes funny/goofy too, again giving depth to the characters.
<br>
<br>Also, as a PC gamer, I&apos;m stoked that Tekken is finally on PC. Easily the best the series has ever looked and you can tell they were playing to the new hardware available when they designed the arenas. There&apos;s a lot of pretty lighting, particles, and stuff to look at in the background and it would all be kinda distracting if you weren&apos;t so laser-focused on the fighting. The characters look great as well and their costumes have some nice physics effects, namely Gigas and Yoshimitsu.
<br>
<br>Now onto the meat of any fighting game and the only part of the game I really take any issue with: gameplay. I&apos;ll just say right off the bat, I don&apos;t like the Rage Arts. I think they&apos;re kinda dumb and cheap. Like when I was playing treasure mode, I got my health knocked down pretty low a couple times, but I never really felt that tense about it because unless the CPU is really trashing you, you can just throw a rage art as soon as it&apos;s available and take out about a quarter of their health. It just feels cheap. When I had to use those, I didn&apos;t feel like I won because I was good at the game, it just felt like I won because I was ok at it and then pressed the &quot;win&quot; button when it was available. People say &quot;oh just dodge or block the Rage Arts&quot;, but it&apos;s super easy to hit the CPUs with it and it really just feels cheap. They look cool and all, but again, it&apos;s only one button press, so you don&apos;t really feel like you did anything cool. The invulnerability frames they&apos;ve introduced kinda suck as well. I&apos;ve seen that stuff in other fighters before and that was one of the main reasons I&apos;ve always gravitated towards Tekken: no **** Sure, some characters have spammy moves, but that&apos;s every fighting game ever. There was no win button and no **** attacks where the attacker couldn&apos;t take damage.
<br>
<br>Also, the story mode gameplay isn&apos;t really all that great either and really highlights some of my main issues with the gameplay. As mentioned, I like the story itself and the flashes of memories during the Heihachi/Kazumi and the Heihachi/Kazuya fights were really cool and added an emotional charge to the fight. That said, the &quot;Story Assist&quot; is a joke. Like the Rage Art, it&apos;s another &quot;easy&quot; button that the devs added to the game for reasons I can&apos;t fathom. The whole point of a fighting game is to learn the combos and git gud. Also, some of the fights felt sorta **** at times. As of writing this, I&apos;m stuck on the Heihachi/Devil Kazuya fight. The last bit where Kazuya knocks Heihachi down to about 15% health and then you have to beat him would be fine if he didn&apos;t become invincible at his last 50% health. How the hell am I supposed to beat him when he&apos;s just plowing through my attacks and kicking my head in? Not to mention that **** insta-kill move he uses. It&apos;s barely telegraphed and he often catches me with it in the middle of an attack since I can&apos;t knock him down or even grab him, so I can&apos;t block or dodge.
<br>
<br>In short, this entry in the Tekken series is good, but would be perfect in my opinion if it had just stuck to the gameplay that made it great. The Rage Arts, Story Assist, and invulnerability frames they added really detract from the fun of playing for me. Incorporating elements of other games like this just makes Tekken a less unique experience and I&apos;ve always liked it for being something different; A fighting game that flows even if you don&apos;t know 15-button combos and super moves. The new features mentioned break that flow and hurt the experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7344401">Expand</a></span>

<br>Less satisfying than actually learning moves the Rage mechanic adds a way for newer players to make come backs but it&apos;s easy to punish at the same time giving veterans a tougher time ending the match if they get sloppy but no less tools to do so.
<br>
<br>Great game, not just a port is well made.
<br>The DRM doesn&apos;t seem to invasive on my machine, They are open about the fact it&apos;s in the game. The Agreement will outline some of what you have to expect from it. I can&apos;t say for sure but feels less invasive than blizzard. So, you be the judge my CPU and GPU don&apos;t over work and I don&apos;t get any odd requests from my firewall telling me this DRM is mostly just for anti Piracy. Or any thing in my log that seems suspicous from a first few play sessions.
<br>it goes to show Quality games (especially digital copies need some quality anti piracy at least from the companies perspective), Not worth the full price unless you like fighting games but it definitely is if you enjoy tekken. PC gives you ability to use more controllers from any console so long as you can adapt it too your PC for this reason, I love the game the depth is more than I can Chew on being new to Tekken. Could potentially keep me busy for more hours than I have to spare :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7349389">Expand</a></span>

And now with Tekken 7, the new king of this genre has arrived. Tekken 7 is better, prettier, smoother and larger than any Tekken before. The story is also the best in the franchise and there are all the other game modes present that you expect in a fighting game - Arcade Mode, Treasure Mode, Practice Mode, Online And Local Versus Mode and so on. From these, my favorite is Treasure Mode where you fight random opponents on any difficulty to unlock new gear, fight money, etc. which then you can use to customize your characters. And the customization possibilities are HUGE, and the best part about it that it is FREE, you don&apos;t need any microtransactions to unlock EVERYTHING! All you need is skills and time. At launch almost 40 fighters are already available with many more coming as DLC characters, it is safe to say that you get more than enough content for your money. Of course all of this would not work if the battles weren&apos;t addictivly fun. Tekken since the beggining has always been all about skills. The combat system is sooo deep, there is nothing else like it. It is not as easy to get good at it like Injustice, Street Fighter and other games in the genre. It takes time and again SKILLS to master it. Casual gamers will easily get destroyed online. This is not a diss to other fighting games, because as I said, I like and play almost all of them, but Tekken 7 is the best of the best. The last few years have been superb for fighting games fans with King Of Fighters XIV, Mortal Kombat X, Street Fighter V, Guilty Gear Drx 2, Injustice and so on but Tekken 7 takes the crown as THE best. Amazing game and a must play for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7351822">Expand</a></span>

Instead they gave a quality game with many quality characters with fun customizations and great graphics and above all that a solid and great combat mechanics and effects. beautiful character design and animations with good sound and cool stage design too. Also it runs pretty good which makes it good a optimized game for PC.

Other top fighters, namely Street Fighter, KoF and MK/Injustice have advanced impressively in their latest installments; but the relic that is tekken just can&apos;t seem to evolve, furthermore many combos can be done simply by hitting 1-button, and the nearly &quot;instant-kill&quot; rage art moves are just laughably broken. Instead of a supplying a proper fighting engine, matches in T7 seem to rely heavily on &quot;who can get their rage move off first&quot;. So many elements of the gameplay don&apos;t even require any sort of skill. In my book, slow motion over and over again also gets old very quickly. And in the end, it&apos;s more of a novelty or gimmick rather than an actual, thought-out fighting game mechanic. But hey, the casual crowd will be pleased!

<br>Complicated and Dated
<br>Tekken 7 is a fighting game with seemingly a bunch to do, but just can&#x2019;t stand up to today&#x2019;s competition...
<br>There is a story mode here complete with cut scenes which is probably the best part of the game...
<br>Its tells the father son struggle of Heihachi and kazuya... as Kazuya sets out to kill his father for killing his mother&#x2026;
<br>The story mode goes a bit all over the place, so it&#x2019;s hard to follow at times, but there&#x2019;s definitely some emotion here, and I did find the story mode to be intriguing..
<br>However this story mode is only 2 hours long&#x2026;
<br>There are character specific chapters to do after you complete the story mode that all tell a silly conflict between 2 fighters and end in a nice short cut scene at the end of the battle, and gives every character in the roster some personality...
<br>To add even more personality to your characters... there&#x2019;s a treasure battle mode here where you can earn fight money and clothing items to customize your entire roster&#x2026;
<br>However there are few unique outfits for each character
<br>A lot of customizable options are shared... and even worse&#x2026; you have to rebuy the exact same article of clothing even if you already own it for another character&#x2026;
<br>This is a decent feature though and you can even change the color of most items here&#x2026;
<br>The actual gameplay though&#x2026;
<br>Its stiff..
<br>Tekken 7 feels extremely slow stiff and annoying compared to the competition like injustice 2&#x2026;
<br>Enemies feel spammy at times with their constant spam blocking and spam dodge attack from behind combos...
<br>This can to lead to many frustrating feeling moments.. Where you&#x2019;ll feel you need to get lucky to progress rather than breathe and go back in with a new approach&#x2026;
<br>This game is not newcomer friendly at all, as all of the cool moves are hidden behind ridiculous combinations of buttons&#x2026;
<br>Feeling like a pro will take a lot of time and dedication to this game&#x2026;
<br>Not recommend for the casual fighting game fan at all&#x2026;
<br>Though there is a more casual addition to tekken 7 called a rage art&#x2026;
<br>When you&#x2019;re down on health and your back is against the wall, you can release a powerful attack like a super move from the injustice games, just with the touch of a button if you&#x2019;d like as this move along with other button combinations are mappable on your controller&#x2026;
<br>And onto the online mode..
<br>It&#x2019;s completely broken for me on the PlayStation 4&#x2026;
<br>I couldn&#x2019;t connect to any matches... so my fun with this game ended when the 2 hour campaign ended&#x2026;
<br>Tekken fans I&#x2019;m sure will love Tekken 7
<br>But fighting fans in general&#x2026;
<br>Tekken 7 is miles behind the competition and needs to catch up&#x2026;
<br>Content feels lacking with the likes of Injustice 2 out there now
<br>And the button mashy memorize a million button sequences get lucky combat is just not enjoyable to me anymore&#x2026;
<br>I give Tekken 7
<br>a 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7337517">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only thing i liked about T7 is it&apos;s visuals and art style.
<br>
<br>The music is straight trash, crappy tuned dubstep.. it is god awful, i turned the BGM all the way down to get even a remotely enjoyable experience when playing.
<br>
<br>Lack of game modes, lack of any real depth.. and absolutely zero personality.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s possibly the lowest point for Tekken ever, Tekken 4 got slammed but it does a better job than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7463595">Expand</a></span>

In the last years, i&apos;ve never seen nothing comparable to this new title.
<br>
<br>During the Tekken 7 release, the game didn&apos;t have any problems for the online mode nor for the content. In fact the roster has 35 characters, each one with his personal style, also the customization is really huge. You can unlock new items by playing the treasure mode, as long as you play you will increase your offline rank up to &quot;Tekken God Prime&quot;, which is separated from the online rank. The story mode has a duration around four hours, if you wish you can play it again at the &quot;ten stars difficulty&quot;, which is really hard. In the arcade you will fight against 5 characters but in the end there aren&apos;t a cutscenes for the fighters. These are the only three single player modes unfortunately, but the online is great. On the pc version there isn&apos;t input lag, the game finds very quickly a new opponent and it&apos;s hard to lose the connection.
<br>The new gameplay innovation is the rage mode, it will be activated when the health is at 40%, by pressing RB (for the xbox gamepad) you will unleash a powerful combo that will deal a huge amount of damage. As long as you will not activate the rage mode, all your damage is increased so you must choose well.
<br>Tekken 7 is a great game, with a huge roster, a good scalability (you can play the game with an old pc, but you need to set your graphic settings to medium or low) and a good network mode. If you are a Tekken fan or a competitive player you must add this game to your collection.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>- The netcode is stable;
<br>- So many options with a good scalability;
<br>- None input lag;
<br>- Unique style;
<br>- The story is not complicated.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- Only three single player modes;
<br>- Poor arcade mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tekken-7/user-reviews?user_review_id=7482771">Expand</a></span>
