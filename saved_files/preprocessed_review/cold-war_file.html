Things go wrong when he finds out that his camera was switched with a x-ray camera that has a flash that causes a fire extinguisher to explode. The head of the KGB and the spetznaz arrive to quickly pin the event as an assassination attempt on the President. He frames the people the President was meeting with and the journalist as a CIA assassin. Matt must break out of the KGB prison., discover he truth of what&apos;s going on, and stop the KGB leader from his notorious plans.<br><br>Game-play:<br><br>	Cold war fails big time here as it feels tedious due to the slow movement speeds. Even when running it feels slow and sluggish. This makes it a pain to sneak up on enemies as on hard mode, they can hear faraway through stone walls and stormy weather. This tediousness ruins the pacing while other stealth games like Hitman, Thief, and the first three splinter cell games keep the pace while not making it tedious. The one interesting feature about this game is the ability to combine mundane object into usable items. It&apos;s a neat idea to be able to improvise equipment in a game, but it feels to basic like it could be so much more. Graphics/Sound:<br><br>	The game is not visually impressive. Textures are dull to look and they look puckish too me. The cut-scenes use an simplistic comic book graphical style to is interesting. Audio quite good where gunshots sound loud and the snap of fingers sounds real. Though the music is kind of forgettable with it&apos;s campish spy music. There is nothing about it that provokes emotions or feeling from it. The voice acting is mediocre with stereotypical Russian accents and Matt&apos;s actor sounding like a **** self centered jerk.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>	Overall I dislike this game enough to not finish it. It feels slow and sluggish like I&apos;m controlling a snail. The guards are cheep with their hearing through concrete while it&apos;s raining outside, That makes you play even slower that just makes things frustrating. I was a nice try on the developers but this game is not fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cold-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2448562">Expand</a></span>
