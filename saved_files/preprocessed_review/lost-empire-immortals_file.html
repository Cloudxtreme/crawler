The story involves flashbacks coming to the main charachter in dream like text sequences which are wonderfully composed and really adds the drama and emotive element. Combat is ok but the FF style mechanics are a little dated. This is a very good game and will please FF fans without question. The rest may find the combat and gameplay a little repetitive and tedious but its worth ploughing through. Will suffer from mass effect comparisons but is no match for the space epic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-empire-immortals/user-reviews?user_review_id=70349">Expand</a></span>

Isn&apos;t this a repeat of their last game. There isn&apos;t even much research to do. Space Empires 4+5 blow this game out of the park, including SE5&apos;s many bugs. Oh, and FYI, Immortals was originally planeed as a patch for the original then Pollux got greedy and turned our patch into a $30 expansion. Shame on them. I recommend buying Space Empires 4 for $10 on steam your space 4x fix, Lost Empires: Immortals is a complete waste of time, and that is being polite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lost-empire-immortals/user-reviews?user_review_id=71004">Expand</a></span>
