Riddled with bugs, missing textures, audio issues (clipping &amp; sound lags), server crashes, soldiers die instantly upon respawning, etc. If you don&apos;t want the game to be judged on these things, then don&apos;t rush it out unfinished! It&apos;s ***WAY*** overpriced for what it is (basically another unfinished CoD arcade shooter pretending to be a &quot;serious&quot; military game with massive pre-release over-hype). I loved Call of Duty as a game in its own right, but the obsession with trying to turn every... single... shooter/franchise... into a &quot;scripted cinematic experience&quot; is getting very tedious.
<br>
<br>+5% GFX improvements do not seem to correlate with +100% higher system requirements. GFX somehow manage to look *worse* in some areas. The issue is not &quot;everyone has slow hardware&quot;, it&apos;s simply a badly optimized  inefficient engine in terms of quality/performance ratio. 4-5hr bug-ridden single-player campaign. &quot;Levolution&quot; just marketing speak for &quot;dynamic map scripting&quot; which is hardly unique.
<br>
<br>&quot;Ooh look! Pretty pre-scripted building collapsing&quot; seems to be the beginning and end of BF4 &apos;improvement&apos; over BF3. It seems the more &quot;cinematically scripted&quot; new games become, the less fun they are to play in terms of actual gameplay. And given the game was released by EA (enough said), you can bet all of the premium priced DLC&apos;s will take priority over bug fixing...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3718130">Expand</a></span>

Nothing feels precise, movement just feels &quot;off&quot; and the unbelievable amount of bugs and crashes is just amazing.  Why release a game that OBVIOUSLY isn&apos;t finished!!!

I was looking forward to this game so much and have been a Battlefield fan since BF1942. Unfortunately, this game is a big disappointment. Not only does it feel like a repackaged BF3 but it is buggy beyond belief. I honestly cant remember the last time I played a game with this many issues. Sounds clipping, rubber banding, server and game crashes. I realize they want to beat COD to release but this game is no where near ready. I really enjoy gaming when it can be done with friends. But after two days of trying to play this game and spending 40% of our time recovering from crashed servers and game clients my friends are trying to return the game. It&apos;s really not worth the headache. Looks like we may have to dust off BF3 again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3698425">Expand</a></span>

<br>Battlefield 4 is certainly one of the bigger FPS titles in the year 2013 but it is also one of the biggest disappointments. Major selling point of this game is  as you probably already know  vehicular warfare, team oriented gameplay, level destruction and beautiful graphics. It does all that, however, not to a point this game would be enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The first impression is very good, you start off on a what looks to be decently engineered map in a beautiful environment. The real disappointment starts when you begin actually playing. There is no co-operative gamemode (which to be honest is partially a good thing as it was terrible in the previous game), the campaign is disappointing and there is a lot of issues with the engine at the moment of writing this review.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Decent graphics
<br>- Many weapon unlocks for your soldier
<br>- Decent voice acting in the campaign
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The campaign is much shorter and much worse than in it&apos;s predecessor (it feels as if not much effort was put into it  might have just skipped the campaign altogether instead of releasing a disappointing one)
<br>- Vehicle unlocks are still around (yes, your jet fighter will be a pathetic piece of junk with nothing to fight with when you get inside)
<br>- No hardcore mode on release
<br>- All guns are toys, they deal almost no damage (at the moment of writing this review, hardcore mode is not implemented yet)
<br>- Map scale too large (in Conquest mode and similar) for the amount of players supported by the engine (active fighting is usually in only one point of the map, whereas the remaining points are half the time empty, one starts to wonder where is that all out war gameplay)
<br>- Numerous engine issues such as broken shaders (objects appear completely black at times), crashes, campaign at certain points unplayable due to bugs (requires checkpoint/mission restart)
<br>- &quot;Levolution&quot; (level destruction/environment changes) is always the same and gets boring rather quickly
<br>
<br>In addition to the above, it seems polish/russian players cannot play the game in English without downloading localization and cracked exes which is ridiculous (polish players can pick Russian, but not English???).
<br>
<br>NOTE: I have been trying to debug some of the issues on my end such as doodling with drivers and so on, this is not a dumbfire review</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3717962">Expand</a></span>

First of all, this game was not ready for release, there are so many bugs and glitches that need to be patched. The beta was clearly a monumental waste of time because I am pretty sure that most people had less issues with the beta than the actual main release. That problem by itself however was not enough to make my opinion of BF4 so bad. Although I could write for an hour or two about all of the bugs, I am just going to leave it at that.
<br>
<br>The other main problem that I see is that DICE seems to have forgotten its fan base. Us Battlefield fans are very loyal and I feel like we stick with BF even when times are tough. However, this game is such an abomination and bastardization of previous renditions that I could hardly call it part of the Battlefield franchise at all. BF4 is basically tailored to COD and Halo fans. The remnants of military realism that BF3 had are gone. What we are left with is an arcade type shooter that could be equated to COD with vehicles. All my life I have known the saying of &quot;If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it&quot;. Why did DICE take a franchise that was essentially not broken and just about perfect in numerous ways, and change everything about it?
<br>
<br>With all that being said, I still think there are many great things about BF4. I am just very disturbed by the direction that the Battlefield franchise is going in and I hope that the true Battlefield fans stand up and make their voices heard.
<br>
<br>OH AND ONE MORE THING!!! Any moron who complains about single player isn&apos;t a true Battlefield fan. If you were a real BF fan you would appreciate that there is a single player in the first place because Battlefield isn&apos;t about single player AT ALL. Who cares about the campaign? All that should matter in a Battlefield game is the multiplayer. PERIOD. I am pretty sick and tired of seeing crappy reviews based on single player. The first game that even had a single player in BF was BFBC I think. So seriously, stop whining about the campaign.....if that is really all you got the game for then you are an idiot for wasting $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3715836">Expand</a></span>

My computer isn&apos;t the greatest, but I&apos;m still surprised that this game runs like total junk on a mixture of low- and medium- settings (and ends up looking far, FAR uglier than BF3). Compared to the hundreds of other PC games I own, this one is too much work to get it to even run.
<br>
<br>The actual game seems okay, from what I&apos;ve played, and steps up the series gameplay in some subtle ways. Paracel Storm (one of the few maps I&apos;ve been able to get onto and play) really impressed me with the way that changes in the environment affect gameplay (rocking waves, changing weather, and a nice level of continuous player-driven destruction).  But, that&apos;s beside the point. I can&apos;t even run this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681640">Expand</a></span>

To the people saying that this could&apos;ve easily been DLC for Battlefield 3, you are pretty much right. I thought they were going to make groundbreaking upgrades to the series, but it&apos;s nothing different from Battlefield 3. There&apos;s still ridiculous bugs and glitches, the weapon and vehicle balancing is out of control, and the players on the servers are awful. It&apos;s already been plagued with people jet ramming and stuff... The graphics look horribly outdated on the Xbox 360, looking worse than Battlefield 3 (I don&apos;t know how that&apos;s possible, but it&apos;s true...) If they patch the game and fix the balancing, my score would be around 7 or 8. For now, it&apos;s going to remain in the middle category.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681365">Expand</a></span>

Over and over and over again. Its too bad, because the game looks fine otherwise. But right now, stay away from it.</span>

I have never seen such atrocious server issues and netcode in a AAA release title.  This game has huge production values and yet they can&apos;t seem to run a steady gaming session without servers crashing on you and wiping all your unlocks and xp.  You will get shot after running behind cover because your opponent saw you out in the open due to the discrepancies in the netcode.  It seems that this lack of care and quality is a trend nowadays.  Large companies are shoving games out the door before they are polished just so they can hit that holiday sales window and rake in more dough.  It is shameless and predatory and this has caused me to lose all respect for the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3711128">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now to the real part  MULTIPLAYER. Jesus ,i was dissapointed so much i unistalled game itself right after 4-5 hours of gameplay. The new weapon mechanics are so boring and frustrating ,mostly snipers.
<br>Vehicles are obviously nerfed down and jets/helis are powered up to the max ,therefore its more safe walking on foot and hiding in the bushes to avoid jets/helicopters.
<br>
<br>I could keep on writing ,but i am too dissapointed because i would rather give this game a positive rating ,i really wish i could.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give that one point for the graphical improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3692446">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So what i got? Overpriced game not tested at all. But... it have MANY DLCs planned, great right? NO! Fix your game before asking customers for more money. If the game was at least playable i would think about buying any of them but now? Not a chance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3714710">Expand</a></span>

<br>It seems like every AAA developer think they can just make the same games over and over and think people will be stupid enugh to buy them, oh wait they can do that because you are stupid enugh to buy them!
<br>If you already have battlefield 3 just stick with it because there is no other difference then &quot;levulution&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685515">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At the moment I am writing, BF4 multiplayer is simply not playable. Also graphics are not much improved compared to BF3, yet performance impact is significat. I would say game is not to good optimized (yet). To sum-up: Product is not complete and need lot of patching. UUnfortunately.
<br>
<br>PS: I judge this game based on multi, I did not finish singleplayer campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3713878">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is plagued with bugs, disconnect issues, horrible netcode (which seems to be standard for BF series) and headache inducing screen shake 24/7.

<br>This game should be a DLC for Battlefield 3.</span>

This is a BF 3.5, the TV missiles in viper is now useless, levolution is just some script, netcode still very bad. I&apos;ve spotted the same bugs than in BF3, and experienced so many crash in multiplayer that i&apos;m disgusted of Battlefield.
<br>Thanks for your previous Battlefield games Dice, was great.</span>

I&apos;ll stick to bad company 2 for my multiplayer fps gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3709117">Expand</a></span>

<br>I rate games on three points. Graphics, Gameplay, Sound. Over BF3, the graphics and gameplay have not been improved. However, the sound has immensely. It is why I give this a three. &quot;Levolution&quot; is simply a catchphrase used to win over naive drones who don&apos;t know all it means is a little extra scripting in each level that has never been hard to achieve. I did not pre-order. I have not bought it and never will. I have been wanting the strategy &amp; gameplay of BF2 &amp; BF2142 to be the starting point and be improved upon. Despite the gunplay, graphics &amp; sound all improving the gameplay has unfortunately followed Call of Duty formula: Ultra fast TTK and Ultra fast gameplay. TTK is so low and life time so short that you are really just dying constantly. The only way to survive is to fly or drive around with your friends repair spamming, but even then when you get focused everything is so weak your destroyed. Don&apos;t bother. At this very moment they&apos;re already working on BF5 which they&apos;ll announce 6 months from now and the same drones will thoughtlessly fork out the cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681803">Expand</a></span>

The story has no depth and it&apos;s just mindless killing. NPC&apos;s aren&apos;t animated. And the biggest fault I have found is that it is just too much like Call of Duty. The only good selling point that I could find is that SOME buildings are destructible. The game just bland killing and explosion to make things seem cooler. The people who play tested this game need to be fired because they OK&apos;ed a tech demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3715299">Expand</a></span>

My hardware let&apos;s me run any recent release at high settings so it&apos;s only poor design strategy from  developers. At the very least, they should write that on the box, or include such information in previews.
<br>Now I see, thats why demo was limited to 64bit machines. Great move EA, I&apos;ve a couple thousand dollars worth of pc games but from now I guess no EA game will be bought at launch. Ever.

<br>
<br>Why?
<br>
<br>1. You need to connect to Origins to play
<br>2. If you want to play online you have to go to their website and search there for a server
<br>3. The game crashes ways to much (I have a good PC)
<br>4. The singleplayer campaign is bad</span>

The maps aren&apos;t really designed for specific modes such as Rush and none of which are overly thrilling to play either. The overall product is riddled with bugs and many matches suffer chronic stutters in play with bursts of lag or just general dreadful texture issues.
<br>
<br>The bullet detection is laughable with many players throwing hacking accusations when actually it&apos;s the game that is woefully inconsistent. With the poor map design; many matches just decline into complete carnage and adding the bugs to the equation, multiplayer just becomes tiresome and tedious. Frostbite 3 is barely a noticeable improvement compared to the jump BF3 made with its new engine. The destruction ceases to impress after a while and as matches become more erratic and chaotic; you&apos;ll barely have time to notice the alleged spectacular scripted crashes and bangs.
<br>
<br>Kudos to EA though  they have done a marvelous job of conning people with a glitzy presentation at E3.  The finished product is nothing compared to the impressive portrayal that we saw at the show with the numerous gameplay videos. Battlefield 4 still feels as if it&apos;s in alpha-mode as this product is clearly not finished and is far too broken to deserve to be one sale.  EA and DICE should be blocked from distributing any DLC until they rectify the bugs but even if this is done, the core game and its gameplay is extremely cumbersome, exhausting and shallow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3718664">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have played many matches where it was all snipers from all angles meaning all you did was die as these elite players cleaned the field.
<br>
<br>The game is altogether un-fun at the best of times, when these exploits are occuring is is simply enraging.
<br>
<br>The game wants you to support your team and work together, but the fact is, if you do not get a kill you are not getting much XP, if any.
<br>
<br>If they really do want the game to be about working as a team, then they need to re-work this entire game from the ground up.
<br>
<br>It requires team work to play, but what about all of us solo players?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681579">Expand</a></span>

For PC players hoping BF4 is finally fixed, you&apos;re going to be in for a bad time. Yes it is the first day of release, but for a game that took over two years to develop, is that really a viable excuse? So many other games come out nowadays that run perfectly fine from the get go. BF4 honestly runs better than its predecessor but fixable issues still exist. The most obvious is the sound on some maps. It will just cut out and not work at all. It&apos;s not an isolated problem, it&apos;s a game related problem.
<br>
<br>BF4 single player in a nutshell: worthless. The pathetically short campaign will assault your intelligence throughout. It doesn&apos;t look like they put a lot of effort into the story but visually it&apos;s pretty nice. Little things irked me. For example moving across a bridge in a storm. Soldiers don&apos;t get blown off the bridge, but 2 ton vehicles do. And not just slide off, I&apos;m talking about levitating and flying off at violent speed. Yet a 120lb female doesn&apos;t get pushed around. OK. Successful games these days are successful because of the little details. You won&apos;t find that in the single player.
<br>
<br>MP maps are pretty damn good though which make up for the lack of single player but I was having random crashes after about 20 minutes in most cases. Brand new computer that is more than capable mind you. The Battlefield franchise is really starting to push me away from PC gaming. It&apos;s the first game I&apos;ve played that consistently makes you troubleshoot every piece of hardware you have in order to get the game to run.

Such a horrible single player campaign, I have not seen yet never, the plot does not exist  it is incomprehensible what started it all and end all. During the game the opponents appear out of nowhere right in front of you in ten meters, only that no one was about, and that&apos;s under the nose of two tanks and two dozen soldiers! Materialized out of the air. Techniques and soldiers do not go and fly above the earth, artificiality of what is happening is complemented by the behavior of weapons. Feel no shooting, no difference, you shoot from a pistol or a gun, a lack of feedback  don&apos;t understand, hit you or not! All this against the background of the advertised Frostbite 3 with his deathly pale flowers and blue  grey scheme, from which you want to puke. Why such an attitude to the customers? Probably not have enough money and time, and probably just don&apos;t care about players  and so will devour! And for that ask for 50$, and as much again for premium! EA, you absolutely insolent. It can hardly be called a DLC for the previous part of the game, but not a new product. Put ZERO, this year is the worst game of all that I had!!! And do not say that the main multiplayer. Mode commander is a big nonsense. Technique unbalanced, system revivals horrible sound lags behind the events. I want to see the finished game, but not a beta test. This is a step back compared to the last part of the game. EA, return the money!!!

Im sorry some are having issues but Ive played a week without any. Its unusual for me to back a game so highly but when that storm rolls in on &quot;Paracel&quot; I just sit there stunned. Ive never seen, or heard, anything like it before.</span>

The netcode is great and the battles in multiplayer are epic and really do take you a trip down memory lane in terms of BFBC2 destruction. It may be considered to be called BF 3.5 but trust me those are the people who haven&apos;t played it. Truly an amazing game, it really has its moments.</span>

Now guns just dont lose accuracy after some only 3 bullets. you can fire longer burst. Suppression blur is removed. there is only a gun sway when you are suppressed without any accuracy hit and blur. guns and vehicles are more open to customization like you have more accessory slots for weapons and vehicles. Map design is very good. there are no choke points so far. you can always come back in game with alot of flanking ways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3676238">Expand</a></span>

The counter-knife system is a thorn in my side, its rediculous and if they wanted to go that route, have a qte to try to make it a struggle, not just a reversal... Its a joke. On top of that it takes far too many anti-vehicle weapons to kill a tank, around 5, more if they are repairing. You only carry 5, so without a support, you wont do jack... The map design is terrible, as well. Has some neat little features but its still a bad design. Rush mode is still as bad as it was in bf3... They took a mode that was fun and great in bad company 2 and completely screwed it up. Having to unlock guns and accessories makes the game very unfriendly towards newbies, even veterans of the battlefield franchise. The premium edition... dont get me started...  You pay extra for perks like... moving to the front of the queue, for full servers... Its a slap in the face to gamers everywhere. This game is a joke, ever since they codified it they killed off the fun factor of the game... They need to go back to the old system and remake bf2 and 2142 with better graphics, but the same gameplay as before... Too bad, this game should be great, looks great, but the mechanics are just terrible...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793890">Expand</a></span>

Well this is basically BF3.5. Netcode still crap, origin is a total joke, no lobby, as less userfriendly as possible in 2014, &quot;premium&quot; things to buy (read : pay2win), no balance, a nightmare for new players, etc. etc.

<br>Thanks programmers for all the fun in BF2, last good game in the franchise. We had a blast.

<br>It&apos;s obvious this product was rushed to market to compete with call of duty and to meet 2 console launches. I might give this game a try in 2 years once all the expensive dlc and bug fixes are released and the game costs less than $20 (with maps).
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t believe a major publisher is trying to charge for basic content in 2014 for a broken game. Shame on EA and shame on Dice.

Not to say it is all bad though, when the game works, its amazing. But more often than not you spawn into game without a gun, get killed seconds after hiding behind cover, audio cuts off, unload a whole magazine into someone 2 feet away looking the opposite direction yet not getting 1 hit marker, rubber banding every couple feet ect.
<br>
<br>What could have been an amazing game was clearly pushed out the door before it was complete. So you essentially paid full price for a game that is still in development, and even now 6 months after they are the game is still full of bugs that have not been addressed. And if you were part of the unlucky ones who paid 60 dollars for a &quot;full&quot; game plus another 50 for the premium service you paid 110 dollars for a game that 6 months after launch is still not fully functioning as intended, something that should have been sorted out before they take your money.
<br>
<br>But as I said, when it works, its amazing. Graphics are beautiful with some additions that just seemed like gimmics and where poorly thought out. Outside of operation locker your screen will go completely white as the snow storm kicks in which doesn&apos;t allow you to see anything. The sandstorm while looks cool from a gameplay perspective is completely pointless as you are just looking at a dirty screen with little triangles off in the distance. Gunplay is inconsistent you can get 1 shotted by someone yet at the same time you can empty magazine landing every bullet and not 1 hit marker. So the gunplay doesn&apos;t boil down to skill but rather is determined by luck and the engine if it wants to work properly or not.
<br>
<br>I wanted to like this game so much however I cannot justify the price tag of a AAA title that is nonfunctioning. Before the game was released I was one of those who watched the interviews and read up all about it about how much better BF4 is going to be than BF3. About how much more responsive the gameplay will feel and how much better the netcode is. It was described as &quot;magic&quot;, &quot;snappy&quot;, and &quot;responsive&quot;. All of which was a lie, that is what BF4 feels like to me, a lie. What was promised and paid for in full price was never delivered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4142086">Expand</a></span>

The netcode is TERRIBLE, it has largely remained unchanged since launch. I highly doubt DICE will ever be able to fix it due to complex technical issues being so deeply rooted into the game code.
<br>To add to the above, there is a suppression mechanic which involves screen blur, weapon recoil increase and optic sway.  Then there is visual recoil where your optic doesn&apos;t actually reflect where your bullets are going. Then there is flinching which makes your gun randomly jump every time you&apos;re hit. The combination of all of this means BF4 completely fails the &quot;shooter&quot; part of &quot;first person shooter&quot;.
<br>
<br>3/10 for the sheer ambition, scope and variance in gameplay and vehicle combat. I will not forgive DICE/EA for knowingly releasing a massively unfinished product, then following it up with claims that the game was ready for release. As of May 2014, Battlefield 4 is still unfinished (in my opinion) and has some way to go before it could be called a polished product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4176731">Expand</a></span>

<br>For them to still be having problems to this day with various bugs, and now for the second time being forced to delay the DLC for the PC players is plain unacceptable. DICE/EA has definitely lost me as a future pre-ordering player.  I won&apos;t fall for hype any further in any games they put out. I&apos;m afraid the BF series has definitely been destroyed and I have no excitement about BF5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082594">Expand</a></span>

The worst people on earth don&apos;t deserve having to play this god awful **** stain on gaming. I normally make informed decisions about games. I&apos;ve loved, or at least really liked almost every game that I&apos;ve paid full price for. This is the one exception. I can&apos;t believe that I pre-ordered, and was actually excited for this game at one point. My hopes were completely dashed. And I can&apos;t even resell it because it&apos;s digital. This is the only game I&apos;ve paid full price for that I regret buying 100%. And I bought mercenaries 2. At least that game had some fun elements to it. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m getting the next battlefield game or not.

<br>My experience has been quite different, I purchased BF4 several months after it was released and I have to say its brilliant. Smooth clean amazing graphics, sounds are just brilliant, and visual effects such as lights and particles as usual are a big exagerated but make it awesome.
<br>
<br>I found the Campaign to be extremely well balanced and fun. Characters voices and animations and acting, the atmosphere, the different scenarios and the general gameplay are just brilliant.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve also been playing the Multiplayer for several months now, it&apos;s what I expected to be with some tweaks, upgrades and really fun levels to play. I loved unlocking all the assault rifles and light machine guns. I did not run into any major bugs and contrary to many reviews I really enjoyed the levels even compared to BF3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4271743">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s still a bad game overall, a few good ideas like carbines and DMR&apos;s for all classes but really nothing is improved in this game. BF3 is better in every way, and goes on sale often. Get that instead, more people populate the BF3 servers than BF4 at any time anyway.</span>
