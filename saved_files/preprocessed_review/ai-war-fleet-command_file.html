I managed to make it through the tutorial and am now able to grasp the basic elements of structures and squads. It&apos;s a tremendous amount of detail, highly complex, and overwhelming for just about anyone, especially novices to this genre. Looking underneath all the complexity, one can clearly see the fundamental RTS elements: gather resources, build structures, create a military, and kill your opponent. It just takes place on a much grander scale than most.
<br>
<br>The game is quite intimidating because of the sheer number of options, the busy HUD, and the non intuitive user interface, but the game allows total control over every intricate detail and that is truly where the game&apos;s strength lies. You have the freedom to control ANYTHING. I can clearly see the long term enjoyment at this early stage, but it will take a lot of patience, persistence, and dedication to get there. Fair warning--this is not a game that offers instant gratification.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2198149">Expand</a></span>

There aren&apos;t much games that combines 4X, RTS, TD together, so if you have concerns, give it a shot. I&apos;m sure if you like any of the game types described above, you&apos;ll like it. If you are a TD player, you can take a defensive role on the border planets for example. As a RTS player, you can lead the battles. As a 4X player, you can develop the plans, which planets to take/leave and so on.

<br>
<br>AI Wars shines with its AI (the name of the game kinda gives that focus away). An AI that learns from you. An AI that you have to beat again and again, just &apos;cause you got it once does not mean that the same strategy will work again. Or that it will work anymore later in the game when the AI found out how you play and adapts. If you notice a plan works too well, it could well be that the AI lets you &quot;win&quot; a few non critical planets and think that your idea is great, only to set the trap for you on one of the more important key systems.
<br>
<br>Another thing that makes AI interesting is that you can&apos;t simply use the steamroller tactics that often give you the edge in such games, i.e. mass your forces and roll over the enemy, build a new front line, roll forwards... If you do that, you already lost because the AI gets more powerful depending on how many systems you invade and &quot;liberate&quot;. Every time you take over a key system, you &quot;give&quot; the AI more &quot;progress&quot;, which translates into more power it may use against you.
<br>
<br>In general an awesome game that only has one sore point: Multiplayer. No, it is actually stunning in multiplayer (seriously, playing this game with a few people is just plain awesome), since you co-op against the AI. What blows is that the game comes without any tool whatsoever for matchmaking. So either you have a few friends you play with or you can only hope to find someone on their boards that might want to play at the same time as you do, you talk it out and agree on a time... no &quot;lobby&quot; system to connect to and hop into a game with some other random player who wants to give it a spin.
<br>
<br>But if you and your friends happen to like challenging, co-op RTS games with a very challenging AI, by all means this is a great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468442">Expand</a></span>

AI War presents the player an impressive and even daunting challenge in a way I have never yet experienced before in an RTS.  The one main reason why I love this game so much? It boils down to the decisions the player gets to make... a multitude of  tough decisions that actually make a difference... and there are no right answers.  Dislike micromanagement? The game design has your back.  Or maybe you love micromanagement... manage away! The diverse array of strategies, tactics, weaponry, tech, etc. as well as a near infinite number of maps, game options, etc. will ensure that every game is not only different, but that every game will contain DEPTH.  You will lose to the AI... a lot. This game puts the pain in growing pains, but it also makes success so so sweet. The expansions are a must. I highly suggest you read the Arcen AI War Wiki for getting started tips. There is so much to absorb and even after 50 hours of play I&apos;m still learning. Chris Parks did a phenomenal job and I hope he continues to make such fantastic games... and ultimately I hope we keep seeing expansions for AI War.  Worth every single penny spent, plus more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2765456">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is set for a team of 1-8 human players working together against an AI that responds to the players&#x2019; action by becoming angrier; sending out larger and continuously more powerful waves of units to attack the players as they try to reclaim the galaxy and drive both AIs out by taking out their 2 home systems. The game has a staggering array of units, some of which are AI or specific NPC faction only, others are basic and the players always have access to them, still others are acquired upon capturing facilities and via research. The plethora of things to play with is enjoyable even taken on their own, and more so once you get to use them in battle after battle.
<br>
<br>The game also lets you fine tune your experience to an incredible degree. The AI&#x2019;s have a wide array of difficulties to set with random or player-selected personalities that determine their mix of units and general behavior patterns. You can also turn certain more advanced units on or off if you so desire, and if you have the expansions, which I highly recommend, you can even turn certain aspects of the packs on or off or even set them with variable levels of difficulty if you like. There are also other factions that can be turned on to add more challenge and diversity to your game. You can even alter certain portions of how the AI gets angrier at the players which is a key factor in the pace of the game.
<br>
<br>The game takes place in a galaxy whose parameters the game&#x2019;s host sets before beginning, if playing a single player game, you are the host by default, and these parameters include the number of star systems as well as the topography of these star systems. The systems are linked via wormholes that become focal points of your strategy and you can set the style of the galaxy from a long single line of systems with minimal connections to webs of connections all over the place. In an interesting consequence of the way the game plays out, a moderate sized galaxy is actually the easiest to play. A small galaxy gives the player less research, which in turn means fewer units to use against the AI, while a large galaxy will take longer to play and the longer the game goes, the angrier the AI gets, and as the AI gets angrier, it attacks with larger and more powerful forces and its defensives get more formidable.
<br>
<br>The dynamic of the AI reacting to the players&#x2019; actions is the core of the game. Unless playing against a very easy AI, the players cannot take over every system, the AI will grow far too powerful as their anger grows from losing so many systems and their homeworlds will become too tough to crack. Some systems are far more valuable and your efforts to wrest systems from the AI should focus on these. A system with a lot of resources, with capturable labs or other facilities that allow new units to be built, old Golems that need to be repaired, and other various things that you want to take for yourself, all are good targets for conquest. A dead-end system with no real value should instead be screened and bypassed. It&#x2019;s not worth the time and AI aggression increase to take less valuable systems. This guerilla warfare system is part of what makes the game what it is. It feels like a typical 4x game in many ways, but it plays out very differently, with the players having to balance the understandable desire to conquer the galaxy with the fact that the AI will become very nasty if you try.
<br>
<br>I heartily recommend this game, but it can be a daunting undertaking and takes a long time to play a full campaign. It&#x2019;s quite inexpensive on Steam, the complete pack including all the expansions is currently 16.99 US dollars and even considering that very reasonable price it&#x2019;s put on sale often as well. Even the demo can be made into the full game by purchasing a key and activating it, so you can try out the actual game for free before deciding to take the plunge. If you like detailed games with a lot of options and permutations, it&#x2019;s a plunge you will very likely enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=4356745">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t even dent them as if the game is bugged or something and they walk over me like I&apos;ve got my head stuffed in a baboon&apos;s backside... Most of the time I can barely comprehend what&apos;s going on and the sheer amount of management required to even get the ball rolling is overwhelming. Keeping track of what&apos;s going on in just one system is difficult and if I had ever succeeded in capturing another my overtaxed (and admittedly tiny) brain would probably have exploded... I don&apos;t really like this game much.

Changing to a non-native resolution makes it blurry and in my case it also stretched the graphics out of aspect.

Please note, this game takes a little effort to get into, but it is very much worth it.</span>

AI War is the best RTS I have ever played, and happens to be 100% my favorite gametype: Coop. Long, deep in strategy, and hooked with great AI, this game was one of my very few game purchases this year.</span>

At first this looks like a Sins of a Solar Empire Clone (in itself not a bad thing) but then it develops into a whole lot more. For a start the player has an asymetric relation with the computer; your opponent owns the whole galaxy and is quite capable of wiping the player(s) out immediately. Of course, it accounts for this by replicating alert levels for the computer, allowing the player to run lightning raids on important installations, possibly crippling the AI&apos;s means of reinforcements in a particular area, preparing it for a full scale assault. All this in additions to it being a wonderful multiplayer experience makes it well worth a purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=738140">Expand</a></span>

The AI is intelligent and can be both reactive and aggressive depending on situation and settings. The combat scale is beyond anything, though thinking &apos;Supreme Commander&apos; will help you understand what I&apos;m talking about. A must play for any serious RTS player.</span>

Some of my friends couldnt handle the simplistic 2d graphics, but for me, once i saw 1000 ships moving out, i think it was well worth the tradeoff (graphics vs units onscreen).

The AI in this game is an AI. It acts like an AI. It&apos;s deliberately designed to play differently then a human. As a result, a lot of the stupid cheating that other games do in order to make the AI a challenge while giving it the human&apos;s rules don&apos;t exist here. The AI is not playing with the same rules you are, but it is playing a well defined set of rules. Exploiting the AI isn&apos;t cheesy in this game, it&apos;s virtually required on higher difficulty (and not as easy as it sounds, the AI gets pretty mean). The goal is to beat the AI while taking as few planets as possible, because the more you take the more aggressive the AI gets in response. Graphics are nothing to write home about. Soundtrack is good. Ship selection is good, and insanely huge if you have the expansions. Any serious RTS fan should give this one a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479016">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The fun is in seeing how far you can push the AI before that happens, and if you get really good, you will win a game or two.  If you can&apos;t stand losing, this is not your game.  If you find losing is a part of the learning experience, you will enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ai-war-fleet-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=2940014">Expand</a></span>
