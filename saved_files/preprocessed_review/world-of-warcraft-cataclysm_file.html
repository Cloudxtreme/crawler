There is no challenge, it is just something you have to waste your time on before you get to the actual gameplay. You are learning nothing during the leveling stage, except how to kill 10 of this, and bring an npc 12 of that.</span>

It&apos;s a simple matter of fact: Cataclysm has reworked ALL of old Azeroth, adding new quests, new dungeons, reworking old dungeons, and creating such &quot;cinematic&quot; experiences, that one would be a fool not to buy this game! Unfortunately, all this loses its luster when you realize something: this game has become so putrescently easy, that all this content is meaningless. Your out the Dark Portal and into Burning Crusade in a few short days. The leveling in this game has been turned into a joke. The quests are easy, and rather than feel enjoyable, it feels like you rush through this game to get to the end-game content. I see people giving this game 10&apos;s because they level so fast, but what&apos;s the point of reworking the first sixty levels if all you&apos;re going to do is fly by them? Is that supposed to be impressive? That in a week you can be having fun in Burning Crusade? Hardly. Next is the graphical quality. Now, it&apos;s a bit of a taboo subject when it comes to WoW, because the game&apos;s so old, it&apos;s more &quot;vintage&quot; than it is &quot;horrible&quot; looking. Unfortunately, I fail to see the validity in that arguement. If a game looks bad, it looks bad. Blizzard reworked the water, and it looks fantastic. And that&apos;s about it. Everything else in this game is a congealed texture-filled mass of color that falls short from &quot;impressive&quot;. The new character models look sometimes laughable (the Goblins especially), and the Worgen &quot;mount&quot; form was so rigid looking, that it feels like a shame they made them run like wolves, and not like, you know, wolf-MEN. As in, anthropomorphous, bipedal wolves. You play a worgen so you can walk on two legs, otherwise you could use Beast Vision and see through your pet&apos;s eyes if you wanted to play just a plain old wolf. The other thing that nobody seems to mention is that, the lore has been so destroyed, it&apos;s appalling. Tauren use the sunlight? Well then how are they Paladins? Unless the sun and the Holy Light are the same entity? But then, why can&apos;t Orcs and Trolls be Paladins? I mean after all, if their Shamanistic ways cause them to revere the elements, including the sun, then they, too, should be imbued with the Holy ways of the Paladin. Right? Well, of course not, because that&apos;s too much work for Blizzard. And Night Elf Mages? Oh, you mean the original race of magic-casting elves that branched off into Night Elves and High Elves? Because here&apos;s a nifty lore tidbit for you: there can&apos;t be Night Elf mages. They lost their ties to the arcane schools of frost and fire. They use nature now. But hey, if it gets Blizzard these resplendant reviews from the bleeting sheep that gave this game a ten simply because it gives them content that hardly lasts half a month, then by all means, rate this game a perfect ten. For those with some foresight, however, I implore you to look beyond this game for one simple reason: You know what happens in World of Warcraft. Say all you will about the new quests, but in the end you&apos;re just reading a block of text, hopping into some played-out vehicle quest, or using some flashy spells that make you incredibly powerful to complete the quests. It&apos;s the same stuff you&apos;ve seen, except now it takes even LESS time to reach level 85. So why even redesign the first 60 levels if you outlevel it super fast anyways? Because it makes Blizzard money, and in the end, this isn&apos;t &quot;WoW 2&quot; as someone so ignorantly stated, this is &quot;WoW: Less Content, Faster Leveling.&quot; I mean, ask yourself. They redesigned the quests and the areas, but is the content still the same? Is there AS MUCH to do? No. But the quests are flashier, so it gives you the ILLUSION that you&apos;re doing more. Besides, you level so fast, there&apos;s no need to go outside of the basic chain of areas to level, i.e. Elwynn, to Westfall, to Redridge, to Duskwood, etc. But no matter what I say, the fact of the matter remains: love is blind. If you couldn&apos;t stop playing Vanilla, or Burning Crusade, or Wrath of the Lich King, then nothing I say will matter. But if you&apos;ve been on the fence about this game, then I implore you to disregard it. Read these positive reviews, and you&apos;ll see they all say the same thing: flashy &quot;new&quot; content makes for a great game! Just wait until the progression drought kicks in, and you wait for the new set of raids, just like Vanilla, Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King. Then you can make all the alts you want. See how long THAT lasts. Just remember: all that glisters is not gold. If there were ever a way to physically show that, all you&apos;d need do is show someone Cataclysm&apos;s box. And let&apos;s not be ignorant, like Plagiarmaster, and mistake my first sentence for an authentic compliment. It&apos;s sarcastic. A joke. Much like this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1450645">Expand</a></span>

Another aspect of the game that i find highly improved  is they way gilds have been reworked. Lets face it this is an MMO you are supposed to play it with others complaining that you can not solo parts is like complain about the lack of race race cars in a fighting game. This gives a guild actual benefits and rewards you for advancing your guild making the for a more cohesive game.<br><br>My only complaint is that Outlands and Notherrend are absolutely untouched even a slight touch up to the 2 would have been a nice change of pace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1522602">Expand</a></span>

Start a Human and go thru Elwynn, Westfall, and Redridge. By the end of the three regions, each with their unique stories (well Elwynn is much the same), you will agree with me. Much better than classic. Everything continues to grow as the years go on</span>

Some of the new zones are beautiful: Vash&apos;jir, Uldum, and Deepholm in particular. But if they were marketing the fact that they &quot;destroyed Azeroth,&quot; well... that is a huge stretch. The Shimmering Flats (now called the Shimmering Deep) is the only place which has changed significantly. All the other zones are essentially the same minus a ridiculous amount of extra flight paths, and small sections of burnt up and/or regrown portions of old zones. Some zones didn&apos;t change at all.<br><br>Instances are the same as they&apos;ve always been despite peoples&apos; arguments that they require more crowd control. That is false. Every new expansion that has come out has required some sort of crowd control because their gear is not on par with the scale of difficulty. Give it 6 months and some high-end raid gear and people will revert back to &quot;tank and spank&quot; mentality. But the worst part about dungeons, raids, etc. is the fact that the group makeup has been exactly the same in this game and in every other MMO. Dungeons: Tank, healer, 3 dps. Raids: Scale up the ratio of dungeons. For crying out loud, can&apos;t anyone come up with something original for once?<br><br>But the worst part of the expansion has got to be the PVP. I&apos;m not even sure what the actual names of the new battlegrounds are because I&apos;ve nicknamed them &quot;Simple Arathi Basin&quot; and &quot;Warsong Gulch 2.&quot; Aside from looks, the only difference between Arathi Basin and &quot;Simple Arathi Basin&quot; is that you fight over 3 nodes instead of 5. There is no logistical difference between Warsong Gulch and &quot;Warsong Gulch 2.&quot; They basically took Warsong Gulch and divided the two sections with a river. World PVP is also no different. People queue up for Tol Barad every couple hours, some AFK, some actually play, and Horde typically win because they outnumber Alliance on most servers. And as far as the &quot;fight&quot; for Tol Barad is concerned, it&apos;s essentially a mix of Arathi Basin and Wintergrasp, but without tanks. Archaeology will bore you to tears and yes, you will get cool rewards for doing it but it&apos;s even worse than fishing. Lastly, there is nothing &quot;MASSIVE&quot; about this game or any other &quot;MMO&quot; these days. Maybe I&apos;m feeling a little dejected about the MMO genre as a whole but I simply don&apos;t find 10 vs. 10, 15 vs. 15, or even 20 vs. 20 very massive. Then again, all the games who babble on about Hundreds vs. Hundreds or THOUSANDS vs. THOUSANDS have performance issues and fail horribly. As far as PVE is concerned, I also don&apos;t find 5 mans, 10 mans, and 25 mans massive either.<br><br>Meh... I guess I just expected something a little better from Blizzard this time around, given all the hype. I&apos;ll give it a 3 because I really enjoyed some of the new zones--aesthetically speaking--but I&apos;ve already cancelled my account and no, you can&apos;t have my stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1465387">Expand</a></span>

What &quot;Cataclysm&quot; is, as a boxed product, is a meager amount of content that costs as much as a full priced game. &#xC2;&#xA3;30 for a couple of extra zones and a couple of new races is just utter robbery which they will easily get away with. It&apos;s unjustified to give out such little content for such a high price without using the reason &quot;We want the money and we can get away with it&quot;.<br><br>So it depends on your stance on Cataclysm. Do you interpret the game as being one solid package, including the content which does not require you actually own the game this review is based around, or do you base it upon the game you are receiving in the box? As far as the boxed copy goes, it&apos;s a solid 5/10 for extremely poor value for money. As far as the full content including free content goes, it&apos;s a solid 10/10. If you don&apos;t own Cataclysm, just get yourself patched up to 4.0.3a and you can enjoy the majority of the content for free without paying a penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1450198">Expand</a></span>

World of Warcraft Cataclysm revolutionizes the way we think about expansion packs, and manages bring something any fan of the MMO can enjoy.<br><br>World of Warcraft is starting to age. Or, at least it was. The graphics are still beautiful, but the model-count is noticeably low compared to any modern game. The previous expansion managed to upgrade the game, creating new zones, new content, new features, and featuring better gameplay. Burning Crusade introduced the flying mount and improved PvP, whereas Wrath of the Lich King spiced of questing with linear interactive storylines and added the oh so appreciated Looking-For-Dungeon tool. Nevertheless, the core of the game, the 1-60 experience, was left in the dust. The vistas in that region were uninspiring, the quest chains lackluster. Dungeons were long and tedious, and it all felt so, out-dated. People have long been bringing up the subject of a World of Warcraft 2. Obviously, nothing lasts forever, and eventually Blizzard would have to create a sequel. Blizzard managed to solve nearly all of its problems with their most recent release: World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.<br><br>Unlike the previous expansions, which were additions and upgrades, Cataclysm is the first real update. It really is WoW 2, but without the problem of a split-player base. Before I go in depth, it&apos;s important to define what Cataclysm is. Technically, the $40 you pay only gets you the Goblin/Worgen, 80-85 content and the ability to fly in the Old World. That&apos;s only because the majority of work the developers put in is already there for everyone. Adding the Shattering of Azeroth makes this the most hefty expansion in WoW&apos;s history, arguably one of the greatest undertaking of any expansion in gaming history. Nearly every single World of Warcraft zone from 1-60 has been completely rehauled. Cutscenes and recurring characters make quest chains enjoyable. Vehicle segments and creative mechanics are mixed in to prevent tedious questing. Graphics have been upgraded, especially view distance and water effects, making for breathtaking vistas. This is the first time since 2004 that I&apos;ve really felt excited to level. Blizzard took everything they learned from BC/WotLK and used it to optimize the Old World. This content alone deserves great recognition.<br>The Goblin/Worgen are two extremely different and extremely interesting races, much more so than the Blood Elves, and especially more so than the Draenei. Goblin as wacky and funny, whereas Worgen present a completely serious storyline. Playing both offers great unique experiences.<br>The 80-85 zones may not contain as much content as the previous xpacs, but each one can completely hold its own. Hyjal is a lore-lover&apos;s paradise, and Vashj&apos;ir is absolutely incredible. Deepholm is a true warzone, and Uldum, my personal favorite, contains everything that is awesome about Ancient Egypt. I have yet to reach the Twilight Highlands, but I have a hard time seeing them being a disappointment. The quests are not all perfect, and there are quite a few generic ones, but ultimately these are some of the most entertaining zones in the game. While WotLK was undoubtedly a financial success, ultimately many &quot;hardcore&quot; players felt disappointed. Far too much of its content was either too easy or too simple. Vanilla raiding wasn&apos;t perfect, but doing a dungeon in Wrath was just boring. The tank would run through one group at a time, AoE-tank them, and move up. In that regard Cataclysm really is seeking out those older players. The dungeons have just as much flair if not more so than the other xpacs, but they possess the feel of a Vanilla/BC dungeon. Pulling different groups of adds requires thinking beforehand, and the group must watch out for patrols. Once again crowd control becomes a near necessity, something I almost forgot about in WotLK. Best of all, I have yet to encounter a tank &apos;n&apos; spank boss. Each boss has its own unique abilities, many of them being very intuitive. If this is how the 5-mans shape up, I simply cannot wait to start raiding content.<br>Other features in Cataclysm are the guild progression system, which I could go into much detail about, and the new professions. I&apos;m running out of room, but both add new layers of complexity to the game and are very welcome.<br>Overall, Cataclysm is a huge thing. It is easily the biggest expansion considering the Shattering, and manages to take what was learned from the previous xpacs and add some of the old lost flair from vanilla. There is literally something for everyone. Blizzard clearly shows that they know their market, and the Cataclysm is easily a solid A+, 10/10. Your $40 may only get you the last bit of the Cataclysm, but you can hardly complain about getting so much for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1450250">Expand</a></span>

Blizzard spent around three years developing this, this is by far their worst expansion yet. All they did was re-skin Azeroth and call it an expansion. Have fun in WoW guys, im out for good.</span>

<br>The talent tree revamp flopped.
<br>The raid content flopped for the most part.
<br>A lot of pvp content that was supposed to come in, never did, and got pushed into MoP instead, and the stuff that should have come out in MoP is not coming out.  That is to say PvP content that had been around in files since the Cataclysm beta were never utilized and instead just recycled for a later expansion, which they have no context in.
<br>Blizzard has become quicker to do knee jerk nerfs, but now waits years to fix any problems they create in their knee jerk nerfs.  Druids are a case and point in this expansion, early on they were doing fairly solid all around, average players stayed in the middle of the pack while playing the class, and awesome players performed awesomely, instead of the druid class&apos; usual performance where average players perform sub par and good players may just barely make out ahead of the middle of the pack.  Blizzard&apos;s methods for remedying this change in performance were to put mechanics into the class that removed key talents and abilities from toolkits thus severely nerfing you no matter what you did.  MoP is showing the same trends in dev behavior.  No they can&apos;t be reasoned with to be shown the errors of their ways, they just dig in deeper when you prove them wrong.

<br>The amount of content put in this expansion is the smallest amount put in any iteration of WoW to date, and all for the same price (for you) as previous iterations.  This also isn&apos;t a trend that doesn&apos;t seem to be going away or getting better, but instead getting worse in the upcoming years.
<br>
<br>Yeah, I could write a short novel on all of the downfalls of Cata, and the problems so far seen in the next xpack MoP.  I can&apos;t do that here, so just walk away with the knowledge and suggestion to stay away from WoW until next year at the earliest, maybe the end of next year to check up and see if anything has been fixed, and the devs have gotten a few humble pills so that way they stop thinking they can treat their customers like crap and still charge full price for less than half of the content advertised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2596751">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the competitive rush of the first two weeks or so, but now it&apos;s slowed down to the exact same sluggish **** as WotLK, just with less content. This quickie expansion heralds the cry that the peak of WoW&apos;s dominance has waned. Say goodbye to the WoW of yore, but hold on to the good memories; WoW was actually good back then. That said, I will certainly look into future Blizzard releases, even this &apos;Titan&apos; project. Blizzard is by no means a bad company, WoW has just gotten old and far too streamlined-yet-grindy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1545739">Expand</a></span>

The questing zones and content are beautifully crafted, but it&apos;s very linear; quest content completely holds your hand in a &quot;go to quest hub 1 / pick up 3 quests / kill mobs / turn in quests, get a cutscene and move to quest hub 2&quot;. Between the heavily-optimized questing model and the over-use of phasing, a lot of the time it feels like you&apos;re playing a single-player game. However, it is technically well done, it&apos;s Blizzard quality all over after all. There are tons of little bugs everywhere, but it&apos;s fairly minor.<br><br>Dungeons are a little wonky when running them the first few times; everything is new for everybody, so that&apos;s to be expected. The rehashing of old content doesn&apos;t sit well with me personally, I can see why they do it and why it&apos;s viable, but it&apos;s a bit lazy to me.<br><br>I&apos;m completely excluding the revamping of the old world here, that&apos;s not technically part of the Cataclysm expansion itself (it was made available to everybody in a huge patch prior to launch).<br><br>Cataclysm itself is fairly skimpy on content once you reach lv85, hence why I feel like I got half an expansion.

<br>
<br>Some of the new areas indeed look nice - but because they&apos;re split all over the world there&apos;s not really a nice connection between them like in the two earlier expansions. And there&apos;s not a main city which would serve as a whole server&apos;s meeting place and a place to hang out.
<br>
<br>To sum up, the Cataclysm was a huge disappointment. The original &quot;Warcraft-feel&quot; is gone. The storyline&apos;s not interesting anymore. BC and WotLK had a lot of influences from earlier Warcraft-series games, such as Warcraft 3. Cataclysm doesn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555696">Expand</a></span>

I went happily along, playing on the same server and faction for six years or so. Then along came Cataclysm- Cataclysm by no means is a terrible expansion, it has nice new features and so forth- and it changed everything. Just as promised, Blizzard changed tons of things in old Azeroth, making the leveling experience fresh and new. I grabbed the game before it released, and was ecstatic to see all the new things. I cruised to the level cap, loving how much more experience and content was required to be completed before one could reach the level cap. The quests were designed uniquely and it seemed as though this chain of fun which I was climbing would never end. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But, unfortunately, it seems that all things end at some time. Once I hit the level cap, I felt the general feeling of overwhelming-ness when you lose your direction. Endgame is always fairly nonlinear. So I spent some gold, gathered up the blues I needed, leveled up my Alchemy and was finally ready for heroics. I ran a few, and sure, they had some new encounters and they were difficult enough, but that was it. No, really, that was about it. There are probably some nice PvP things in Cataclysm, but I was never a huge fan of the WoW PvP. ------------------------------------------------------------------- So I basically went back to doing the things I liked to do in WotLK (which, though not particularly original, was a very nice expansion pack in my opinion). Suddenly I realized that my subscription was about to run out, so I decided to sever the recurring effect because I simply had nothing to do. The end game was so dry- most of World of Warcraft has these neat intricacies all over. Cataclysm doesn&apos;t. Not to me, anyway. By the time I had reached 85 I was only a little bit away from having completed all the quests in all but one of the new 80-85 zones. There aren&apos;t many little interesting things to do in Cataclysm like there were in the past. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I suppose my review will not wholly apply to most readers, primarily  because they would be interested in starting World of Warcraft and my opinion results from the fact that I have played World of Warcraft in the past. One of the main things that frustrates me about Cataclysm, though, is all the changes. My joy from MMORPGs seems to stem from my knowledge of the game. I like to know the name of that city, how to do all those quests, where to get that, who has that, the fastest way to this place, all the easter eggs, all the glitches, all the secret exploit-to-get-to zones and so on. By redoing the old Azeroth, Blizzard annihilated the base on which I had built my knowledge. Nothing had the old mystique that it used to. I used to think, &quot;Wow, I remember that this was like this way back in Vanilla. This is so cool.&quot; I loved to get the old factions&apos; reputations up to the max and get all the mounts and so forth. That sort of bewitching feeling, even when few players were still around, was so cool. But it all vanished, and my love for WoW is  greatly diminished. I feel like developers should not try to do this to their games, the destruction of good content is depressing. ---------------------------------------------------- Perhaps Cataclysm will interest the new and growing group of people who are new to MMORPGs and joining WoW for the first time, but it has certainly left me disappointed. Perhaps it&apos;s for the best, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551832">Expand</a></span>

What&apos;s really turned me off this game I have played on and off since vanilla are two things:<br><br>1. The blatant content recycling. Sure, it&apos;s &quot;revamped&quot;, and the recycling of Azeroth is in some places quite impressive and interesting. But raiding in Blackrock Mountain, again? Killing Ragnaros, again? Taking on Zul&apos;Gurub, again? Love it or hate it, WoW&apos;s primary selling point has always been raiding, and I believe this expansion adds the least to raiding from an overall game experience point of view.<br><br>2. Dungeons are the least fun they have ever been. In my personal experience (mostly tanking), some heroics are harder than raids. Combined with the inevitable cross-realm PUG experience forced on all but the largest guilds by the dungeon finder, this makes gearing up for the end-game content that isn&apos;t something you&apos;ve already done on normal mode while levelling a pretty painful experience. The new guild features are awesome but you&apos;re still forced into dealing with bottom-feeders from other servers you&apos;ll never see again. The community and fun of dungeon crawling is gone.<br><br>I&apos;ve played the PVP and PVE aspects of the game to death now, and I agree with many other reviewers that this expansion offers the least to what is a tired, old horse.

Try to advance your gear after 85 without a guild?? haha laughable.This may be fine if you dont have any kind of a life(or are a kid living with mommy) But other then that guilds are just a pain in the ass anymore.And i think its because Wow IS mostly kids living with mommy now,At least thats how immature most of them act that are in decent guilds.Its really pathetic.Also,every expansion uses the SAME boss models and icons,just changes color/size etc.. Dont waste your time with this,Unless your a kid,then you may fit right in.&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1550166">Expand</a></span>

My first impressions of the game I&apos;d give it a 7/10. First entering a zone, I find myself aboard a boat during an exciting cinematic when a giant squid tentacle comes down and destroys us. All of a sudden we&apos;re under water. Now this was quite the annoyance being under water for 2 of my 5 levels as the angles get really ridiculous, finding where you need to go with the bugged mini-map also makes for quite the aggravating experience. I slightly enjoyed the rest of the zones a little better, but I wont go into too much detail about that. The new dungeons are terrible and completely not enjoyable by any means. Dungeon Finder destroyed server PvE, as everyone uses it instead of making a group that is actually capable of finishing a dungeon, you get a bunch of noobs who waste 20 minutes of your time by wiping on the first boss and leaving. Now, I&apos;m more of a PvP person myself. PvP is one of the aspects of the game that had kept me going for as long as it has. It&apos;s progression was exciting for me up until WotLK, then it became quite dull with the insta-gib combos out there. It was more so who could kill who in 2 seconds over actual strategy. With the release of Cataclysm it completely destroyed this 1 remaining love of the game that I still had. The new battlegrounds are HORRIBLE. I did my fair share of the grind getting all my blue PvP gear aside the weapon. It was more of a job than something enjoyable -- which it used to actually be. Classes are unbalanced, resilience is a joke. Arena is more of a joke now than it ever was. This expansion really put the nail in the coffin for me. After years of playing this game with quite a bit of enjoyment, the rides finally over. The magic this game once had, is finally lost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1580020">Expand</a></span>

WoW is brutal to new players.  It&apos;s a very long 85 levels during which PvP is absolutely broken, dungeons are boring and dumbed down, people will harass you for not having Bind on Account gear (which levels with you and is more powerful as a result) and it&apos;s a repetitious sequence of hit this button followed by this one about a million times.  There is no variety, though the places look different the sequence is the same, every time.  Once you get to 85 you find yourself underpowered and so far behind it&apos;s an even longer grind just to catch up with gear to play where everyone else is.  This part is much more difficult because people won&apos;t take you with them where the good gear is and won&apos;t PvP with you because you didn&apos;t start the new season on day one (so, you can never catch up in rating).  The system is designed so that first come, first server and all else just miss out.  The other major problem I had with this game is the support.  The staff is not knowledgeable about what current issues are or how to fix them.  Blizzard also openly supports racism, despite their claim to the contrary, by allowing people to name their characters with racial slurs.  Their policy clearly states that they do not allow this and to report names if seen, but nothing is ever done about it and the offensive names remain.  A simple search of their website reveals literally hundreds of characters named after racial slurs, either directly or thru letter substitution, IE. q for a g (also against their policy, supposedly masking words by altering spelling isn&apos;t allowed).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1722307">Expand</a></span>

Turns out, it&apos;s not the competition.  Blizzard has done everything they could in the latest expansion, Cataclysm, to kill WoW slowly, painfully, without remorse.<br><br>Cataclysm has a new quest design that is linear.  You pick up a quest, it sends you to the next and so on until a zone is complete.  New quests don&apos;t show up until previous quests are complete, so there is only one way to do things.  In order, every time, on every toon.  Thankfully there are only 5 new zones of quests and the level cap has only been raised 5 levels so after you&apos;ve seen the new quests, doing them again on you alt won&apos;t take long.<br><br>That brings up another point, Cataclysm is short.  Blizzard redid the entire 1-60 leveling process and tries to tack that onto Cataclysm.  The fact is the 1-60 experience was NOT a part of Cataclysm, is not included with the new content and costs nothing extra to see.  So, if you want a new toon no need to upgrade.  Unfortunately the new questing is done in the same theme as the expansion, so you only need to see it once and after it&apos;s done there is never any reason to return to that area.<br><br>In fact, once you finish any quests in an area, there is never any reason to leave a city.  Thanks to linear questing and automatic queues the WORLD of WoW might as well not exist anymore.  It&apos;s just a hassle to run through on your way to a raid.  Not that raiding is worth doing.  There are two difficulties hard and professional raider.  The average PUG (Pick Up Group) can&apos;t clear more than a couple bosses.  People don&apos;t form pugs even on the busiest servers anymore.  Guilds that play together all the time even have trouble clearing the raid content now due to the difficulty with the number of guilds clearing heroic mode nearing 6 months after release in the tens nationwide.  Yes, coming up on 6 months of working on the same raid and only a handful of groups have cleared it in the entire country.  Let that sink in.  Would you like to try a game for 6 months straight and still not beat it?<br><br>The loot tables are pitifully small, the game play for all classes was redone completely and in many cases (I personally play 4 toons at max level) made worse or completely broken.  New content has been very slow to arrive.  The first content patch, 5 months after release, is simply a second presentation of two old raids converted to 5 man instances, one of which (Zul&apos;Aman) wasn&apos;t even changed according to the interview with Scott Mercer.  So, it&apos;s not new mechanics like they promised, it&apos;s in fact just rehashed old content just like Onyxia was.  Populations on servers are in decline, the new patch 4.1 won&apos;t change that.  If you haven&apos;t already bought Cataclysm save your money.  It would be more aptly name Catastrophe, though I suppose the damage was cataclysmic.  In the end Cataclysm is a boring, repetitive grind of daily quests and endless waits in queue&apos;s (there is a bug for battlegrounds where the queue won&apos;t work that had been in the game since Cataclysm&apos;s release), with nothing really new or fun to do.  New content is slow to come and is being sold as much more than it truly is.  WoW is dieing, sad but true.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600652">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t waste your money or your time.  Locked in talent trees, increased homogenization of classes, grindy guild levels and rep, and so much more have sent this game to the pits. I loved the way this game was during Wrath.  It wasn&apos;t perfect, but it was a ton better then what it has changed into this expansion.  Some are even calling it half an expansion for the high level players.  I don&apos;t know what possesed Blizzard to go with All or Nothing changes like they did.  It&apos;s odd that they think they either do this or that, but fail to see the middle ground.  Sadly, WoW has lived its life.  I am VERY certain that this game is heading more and more downhill.  That sad part is that so many WoW players are so desperately addicted they are more then likely going down with this ship while the rest of us move on.
<br>
<br>But hey, it had 6 years in the spot light, and that is a heck of an acomplishment.  No amount of hotfixes or patches for Cataclysm will bring it back to what it once was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489732">Expand</a></span>

And what they did, instead of listening majority of gamers that actually played the game they listened to few whiners in forums.  Cataclism expansion was exactly what it mean to world of warcraft. They killed everything that was fun. Few fast heroics after work? I dont think so.. with 40mins queue time and dungeons themself taking forever. Pugging raids? not anymore. Diversity of what you can do in game? not really... btw how can you call it expansion when there&apos;s less things to do in game then before. Add to this unbalanced pvp, dead world outside major cities, less people online, forcing people to create alts, removing 10/25 as different lockouts, no fredom whatsoever in new lvling zones. Grats to blizzard for destroying game that was close to perfect. I canceled my sub month after release of this $%%^$. One point because archeology, since it was quite cool and something new. Anyway cata is dead for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1617427">Expand</a></span>

I am appreciative of the effort Blizzard has put for in changing the environments and trying to make old content new again for players; such as myself, but, in the end is just repetitive. I am not looking to be &quot;wowed,&quot; no pun intended, but I would like Blizzard to come up with some new boss encounters. Now before I get the &quot;Have you even played this expansion or done that fight,&quot; I want you guys to really think about it, its the same mechanics over and over again. One to two players tank the boss or NPC, and the rest of the group tries to not stand in AOE. While I will admit the FL Rag encounter was fun and with the drop of 4.3 patch the Deathwing fight is very entertaining but everything before that was made extremely easy by nerfs or just a boring mechanic (in regards to4.2 FL patch.) I have to comment on the Looking For Raid feature that has been implemented in 4.3 Patch. I think Blizzards thinking was that  it is a great way to get the average player to end game content and get them gear. On the flip side it annoys the hardcore raiders because it makes them seem like they don&apos;t have anything to look forward to and that they are not achieving anything when they do it on 10 man or 25 man normal/heroic. While I am well aware that the gear is different and content is harder; I don&apos;t think people should be given an easy pass for end game raid content; this was already done in part with Tol&apos;Borad. I do believe Blizzard&apos;s heart was in the right place but the implementation was some-what off. I also feel that there needs to be a challenge implemented into these Looking for Raid groups, steam rolling each boss in new content should not be achievable in the first week of a brand new patch. I personally would like to see a little more challenge!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2018398">Expand</a></span>

Classes remain overpowered for months at a time rather than being fixed within a month. Furthermore, the developers continue to display a lack of intelligence by continuously making poor tweaks to classes and gameplay mechanics. The community continuously gives suggestions to the developers about various ways to improve the game, such as separating pvp and pve abilities and making certain abilities change depending on what kind of zone they are in. Blizzard continues to refuse to implement such a change, and continues on their hopeless act of attempting to balance two parts of the game that are always going to be in conflict.

It was very tedious because quests were just a simple go there and complete a few quests there and then go there and complete a few quests there. But it was still fun. However, this tediousness made the game almost unplayable with more than 1 character to level. Because the second time running all this just like the first time, was extremely boring and it felt more like work. I never leveled more than 2 chars because of that. I gave up with the 3rd on level 81.
<br>
<br>Anyway, the atmosphere, scenery and story line was really well done. But again, there was something that made it uglier: The viewing distance. In WotLK you could customize it to like 1700 and the game instantly looked sooooo much better. But on Cata they axed that and 1250 or something was maximum. The game had DX10 effects, yes, but those were completely negated by the lower viewing distance.
<br>
<br>When I reached 85 I still had lots to do, like raising reputations, getting PvP gear and running heroics, which were really challenging at the start. But only a few weeks after came the patches and attempts to balance. They failed horribly in every aspect, so much worse than Ive ever seen before in this game. It was like a completely different company was in charge all of the sudden. This was no WoW anymore. It became more and more apparent to me that this was more like a Facebook game now. Far too easy, no balance and boring as hell.
<br>
<br>After a few more days I gave up because even the last straw, PvP, wasnt enjoyable anymore, even though it hold me a very long time before. Leveling new and other characters was boring even with a semi-new world, because I simply didnt want to run the Cata zones again. They were just boring as hell. I felt an aversion to those zones like I never felt before.
<br>
<br>I liked what they did to PvP gear, because I never liked Arena games, but when the balance is so bad, even nice equipment wont keep me playing.
<br>
<br>1 point because it was fun the first time leveling to 85, and a few weeks more after that in the challenging 5p instances. But overall it destroyed WoW. Not like TBC or WotLK (I actually liked those apart from the DK bias at the start), but it literally destroyed WoW. Not only because you wont ever see the old world again, which I already missed after playing Cata for a few weeks, but also the gameplay. WoW, even with TBC and WotLK, was challenging, fun to play even when you reached max level, even if it was just for PvP. But after Cata almost nothing was left of all that. Cata transformed WoW into a feint shadow of its former self. I felt like something was stolen from me. I put so much time into my chars only to see them &quot;balanced&quot; to boredom, simplicity and seeing abilities taken away that I loved for 4-6 years.
<br>
<br>After I read about MOP it felt like they are doing an Aprils fools joke. But they actually meant it. Even more dumbed down, even less control and customization for your char, even more cutting down old and nice features, even less freedom, even more childish artwork and Facebook like features, etc, etc, etc. That was the wooden stake into the Vampires heart. Its over. Dead. Gone.
<br>I would feel ashamed if I was a Blizzard employee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544958">Expand</a></span>

The only things nice were the water, new graphics and new race/class options. The quests and environment changes were fun for twenty minutes then it got bland and only seemed like rehashed quests and Wrath of the Lich King buildings.</span>

Original Wow, and BC where 1,000 times better. They actually took skill, time, effort, and knowledge to be good at. What Blizzard has done with WotLK and Cata is almost a shame to WoW. People hit 85 within 8 hours of the release, so leveling was a complete joke. Blizzard tried to make instances harder, but the only people they were hard for were people who joined during WotLK. If you were an original or BC player these instances were a breeze because we know how to CC. When it comes to raiding people should not be able to clear raids the first day they are released. The Tuesday of the raid release patch I logged on and instantly saw someone with 6 epics. People had the Drake mount you get from raiding in the first week. That is just a joke. PvP doesn&apos;t take skill like it used to. It&apos;s who can do the most burst damage. Most PvP arena teams don&apos;t have healers anymore because of the whole mana issue, and lets face it, only being able to heal for 10-15k with most heals is a joke when people crit for 20k+. I&apos;ve been playing WoW for 6 years now, and the only reason I&apos;m still playing it is because I hope that Bliz will changed it back to original and BC some day. People giving this game a high rating are the people who came into it during WotLK. The original WoW players know this game to be a shame. I have yet to find anything good about this game. I&apos;m going to go back to Starcraft 2, and wait for the release of Dead Space 2 in a month.

Yes, in WOTLK, if you wanted the absolute top of the line gear, you needed to be part of a raiding guild and spend the time.  Fine, but if you did not want to raid, there were still quite a few ways to improve yourself through heroics, PvP and achievements and still have fun.<br><br>Now, everything from achievements, to PvP, to heroics are guild-centric, so as a solo player, your options for advancement have been pretty much destroyed.<br><br>I have raised all my alts to level 85, but now what?  I hardly got my guild (consisting of my alts) to level 3.  So many of the achievements are guild related.  Doing heroics with a Pug?  Impossible.  Rated battegrounds without being part of a PvP guild?  Can&apos;t do that either.<br><br>So you get to 85 and that is it, nothing more to do unless you are willing to join and spend the time with an active guild.  And what do I have against guilds?  The drama, the power games, etc.  Why play a game to reproduce the idiocy that takes place at the workplace?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1474814">Expand</a></span>

But the current content is just not worth paying a monthly fee for, especially if you have already done most content in Wotlk, Cataclysm is just more of the same. Blizzard had a real gem on their hands with WoW but it is really showing its age. WoW Vanilla/BC/Wotlk were great games and really fun to play but Cataclysm just doesnt cut it anymore for me. The reason i gave this game a 3 is mostly because i think its just not worth the 13 euro per month + 30/70 one time fee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479314">Expand</a></span>

Its like Blizzard had worked for years on building the best castle ever, making every piece perfect, and constantly adding things to make it more outstanding. Then one day they decide Legos are childish and knock the whole thing down and start from scratch without the creativity they had before. As a player since vanilla, the difficulty is non existent, the quest chains are done in 30 mins, epics are practically free. I would have rated this game higher, but they took away old content forever, preventing nostalgia from taking place in game. I understand times change, but Blizz could have pulled this off if they hadn&apos;t removed so much from the otherwise perfect masterpiece that was the World Of Warcraft. I look forward to Blizzards future games such as Diablo 3 and the others in the Starcraft series. But ill always feel bad when it comes to WoW. Mourning what could have been. Heres to a great game that was finally destroyed by over ambition and greed. I will truly miss this game more than i&apos;ve missed some deceased family members.

And don&apos;t get me started on the story and lore that they have mangled so incredibly. When Chris Metzen was confronted about the lingering unfinished story at the Throne of the Tides, he basically buried it and said it was going to remain that way. This entire expansion was rushed, worked haphazardly, and completely trashed on any sense of story telling and fun. I&apos;ve been a blizzard fan since I was 12, but they&apos;re making it real easy for me now to turn my back on them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1994880">Expand</a></span>

An average rating of 90 speaks volumes of how much credibility these reviewers will have for me in the future.  I&apos;ve been a subscriber to World of Warcraft for several years and game was at one time to best of breed.  Things change however, and Cataclysm is the culmination of a grand company changing course and direction for the worst.  The content developed for  Cataclysm was decent, certainly within the bounds of expectations.  However, it was shallow and introduced a new philosophy of developers determining &quot;how&quot; players should have fun rather than allowing players to creatively determine their own methods of enjoyment from the game.  Part of foisting philosophy and arrogance on the player include a higher focus on guild play, grinding and progression.  This expansion introduced bugs and issues not typically found in Blizzard products.  Community management has fostered a great deal poor gamesmanship and bad behavior.  Horrible expansion and a marked change in direction for Blizzard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1513758">Expand</a></span>

New abilities were not so much new abilities, but revamped old abilities, and new tradeskills were abhorrently tedious.  Leveling wasn&apos;t that difficult, and the underwater zone, though intriguing at first, became a task to deal with.  And there in lies the whole truth of the expansion: It&apos;s just not fun!  It&apos;s task upon task upon task, everything is phased, so if you were logged on 30 minutes before a friend, odds are, you&apos;re not in the same phase and can&apos;t group together.<br><br>I gave up fast, merely 3 weeks into the expansion, World Of Warcraft finally up and died in my mind.  There&apos;s no need to go back, it&apos;s a cumbersome, loathsome beast of a game now, and with every expansion, prior advancement means nothing.  I replaced all my epic end game gear with greens IMMEDIATELY.  No doubt about it, random world drops were far better than anything I had from downing the Lich King.  Just sad.<br><br>This expansion was so bad, and the playerbase is so immature, it&apos;s actually turned me off to all MMO&apos;s, not just WoW.

The only time something new and innovative is put into the game is when they are stealing ideas from up and comers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2051070">Expand</a></span>

Any child can get to the highest level and the best gears... any person can find a group in no time and do dungeons and that stuf... but the harder the game was, the better and addicting it was! That&apos;s why WoW is **** in my meaning these days..

The story line...well, I kept doing so many quests I started to just accept the quests without reading them.  If your an avid WoW fan you will love it.  If your new to the game, there isnt any reason to buy Cataclysm unless you want a different looking avatar (Worgen, Goblins).  The new starting zones are beyond great, the story lines are VERY well done.  But thats just until level 20ish, when your around level 80-85 the quests just keep coming and there seems to be no end to it. If your looking to advance the next levels in WoW go for it.  But once you hit the level cap, its the same old story of PvP and 5 man dungeons and play your eyes out until you have the correct gear score to do 10 and 25-man raids.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490715">Expand</a></span>

But, since I played it it deserves an opinion. First off the Original WoW was amazing, truly a work of art game. Burning Crusade was even better and another great success, but then comes Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm... With the games increasing popularity lead to a decline in the player community being filled with Trolls, greifers and elitist jerks. Also Wrath and Cata are poor in comparison to the previous versions. What makes Cata worst of all is Blizzard tried to squeeze more juice out of old lemons. By that I mean they took the old version and recolored it, including OLD dungeons forcing you to replay what you already had before for loot. Plus, doing Heroics where the wait time is 30minutes+ is unbelievable.... what am I suppose to do for 30 minutes? pick my toes and if I afk while i wait it drops you from the Que! This is ridiculous and is a LAZY excuse on Blizzards part. Further more Blizzard haste to be the most money hungry developer out there currently pioneering the way for $60 games with Star Craft II. I will never buy anything from Blizzard again. I also will add I cancelled my account 8 months ago after years of playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1859674">Expand</a></span>

I sat through burning crusade arena, where those who did BT were on Top and did ok. I even stomached wrath&apos;s failure. But this. This was the end all. They took everything out of the game that gave it what little challenge was left, and flushed it. Instead of people having to play for awhile to actually learn whats right and wrong, blizzard sits down and holds your hand through it. This has taken the community from the small amount of elitist douchebags, to everyone being a douchebag. Every Tom, Dick and Mary from the internet comes on here to spew fourth their trash and say that the game is still hard. Even though guilds cleared &quot;Heroic&quot; versions of the raids in the first week and i even made 2500 in arena in the first week of a season. I thought I could stomach it. Oh yeah. The revamped quests and zones really caught my attention at first. I was liking what I saw. Then after the first week or two, you realize its just the same zone, it truly changed little. And even though they changed the zones, they still refuse to do a graphics update for anything. It&apos;s still on the same engine from years back. But the age is starting to show. Drastically. The only thing that would keep you playing, is if you have any friends who still do. If not, you have to suffer the peanut gallery. Its truly astonishing that people can still be bad at this game at how easy Blizzard as made it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1929630">Expand</a></span>

What they have been able to pull off successfully, and with relatively few bugs compared to what there COULD have been is nothing short of astonishing.<br><br>That having been said, here is my take on Cataclysm summed up in quotes made by myself or various guild members. (I was in beta, so some of the quotes were made based off the beta time.)<br><br>&quot;Wow, the worgen starter zone is sweet! Now if only they would fix the bugs...&quot;<br>&quot;Oh my, the quests in Vash&apos;jir are nuts! The zone is gorgeous and it has so many cool stories!&quot;<br>&quot;Vash&apos;jir is a pain. I can&apos;t handle all the 3D attacks. WoW is a 2D game, they should&apos;ve kept it that way.&quot;<br>&quot;Some of these new quests for starter zones are awesome! The stories really rock!&quot;<br>&quot;Hmmm, so there&apos;s a few plot holes here that don&apos;t mesh with lore...wonder what manufactured or forced lore Blizz will introduce to fix THAT one.&quot;<br>&quot;The water effects rock! Now why did Blizzard not fix how bloody cartoony this game looks...cmon!&quot;<br>&quot;OMG, the dungeons are HARD! Seriously, all these idiot Wrath babies have NO idea how to CC!&quot;<br>&quot;Dungeon finder ruined the game...&quot;<br>&quot;Sweet, the Harrison Jones stuff is a lot of fun! Too bad there&apos;s no rep and it&apos;s a dead end after Brann.&quot;<br>&quot;Blizzard so screwed up, making it so hard and twitchy to handle some heros and most raids.&quot;<br>And my personal favorite.<br>&quot;It&apos;s while doing Archeology that I began to realize how LITTLE there is to do in WoW once you&apos;re max level and don&apos;t need to do heroics. If I wanted to level an alt, I wouldn&apos;t have a main...And I want to raid, but it&apos;s not raid time...so what do I do? Run around watching a blinking light next to a telescope...I&apos;m done.&quot;<br><br>This sums up very well what Cataclysm is. It&apos;s an attempt by Blizzard to suck in more and younger players (and to an extent give old players something new to do) by a more &quot;enjoyable&quot; starting experience from 1-60. After that is the dryness (dungeon grind) of BC, followed by the worn out quests (and dungeon grind) from Wrath until you get to 80 (not 78). After that it&apos;s a continuation of the relative breeze it is in WoW to level compared to most (if not all) other MMORPGs. 80-85 should not take more than 3-4 days if played casually for 3-4 hours maximum per day. The quest content is a continuation of the themes that were started in WOTLK, involving vehicles, seemingly random encounters, cut scenes, and other aspects that are somewhat perfected. However it does not make up for the complete lack of depth in content from level 80-85, and the abysmal existence that becomes 85 endgame. What Blizzard did do was make CC required again. They also made boss encounters more intelligent than those in Wrath of the Lich King. However, these boss encounters are nothing compared to some of the Vanilla/BC encounters where you TRULY had to play intelligently due to lack of taunts and agro wipes. Between this and the over-simplification of the talent system, the things about WoW that actually allowed you to feel like you were roleplaying or building your own character have largely been removed.<br>The over-emphasis on the Dungeon Finder has, as well, weakened many of the more casual guilds, and even some of the stronger ones, at least on my server. Many people have forsaken trying to work together as a guild to reach certain levels and have instead focused on themselves and gearing alts.<br><br>Which brings me to my final point. WoW developers know that they have nearly no end-game content worth a pinch of salt. They know it so much that they, during WoTLK created gear that would be able to be sent to an alt and used to level faster, both by having great stats and XP bonuses. What this did is effectively negate the necessities of LEARNING the classes you play before you hit endgame. They also MOVED many key spells or abilities and put them into places at much higher levels. The logic for this escapes me, as some of these skills are literally game-changing if you don&apos;t have them to learn with. Imagine being a tanking class and trying to learn how to tank, only to find that a particular skill that is absolutely necessary for holding threat on groups of mobs is not available until you are almost in the 85 range. How are you to learn to utilize said skill without first making it a very unpleasant experience for players you group with? Blizzard seems to have forgotten that the game does not begin at the next expansion&apos;s level and they have left many players wanting to actually have the RP in MMORPG experience. In the end, all that WoW:Cataclysm does is the same as Wrath... do all your rep and heroic grinding, then log into an alt and do the same thing...until you can do a raid...and once the raids are done or downed for the week, there&apos;s nothing more to do except alts again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1485324">Expand</a></span>

With all the options of characters and things you can do I cant help but feel I&apos;m being forced to do what Blizzard wants you to do. The free world experience is lost. Everything is too structured now, dumbed down. The rebuilding of Azeroth seemed completely pointless, new content very insignificant. To me it feels like a money grab, an opportunity to bring in more players and increase the player base but at the same time alienating smart people who know better. I was a DAOC veteran, thus have a high expectation in terms of a MMORPG. I like complex items, complex skill system, and true character customization. I feel as if Blizzard is limiting many options and streamlining everything in order to make WoW more mainstream. I enjoy things like Open world PvP. I like the ability to become a lone wolf and scour the land for an opponent like the old days of DAOC, but in wow it is very structured. It feels like the &quot;facebook game&quot; of MMO&apos;s now. I am severely disappointed in the direction they have taken WoW because they have in my experience worsened the experience for smart players not enhanced. WoW is now a game for kids, as an adult I feel it is embarrassing to be associated with it, and more of a liability. Plus the Wow world is getting very old very outdated, there is a reason their making a new MMO....aka &quot;Titan&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1506380">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t even downloaded the 4.1 patch. Why? I&apos;m bored. Cataclysm revamped all the old world zones, redoing most of the quests! Cool, but they also made it absurdly easy to fly through them in a bare minimum of time. Why spend so much effort on giving the leveling process a facelift, only to be done with it so quickly? There is this persistent rush to end-game, and when you get there... there&apos;s very little left to do. Particularly if it&apos;s with the same character you&apos;ve reached end-game on in previous expansions. There are achievements! Got &apos;em on my main, minus a fair bit of the ones requiring a raid. I really have no desire to get them again on another character, just for the sake of having them. Dungeons! Heroics! Have all the gear I can possibly use for an upgrade from them... on 6 or so toons, and their offspecs. PvP! Okay, really. I *know* Blizzard is in a constant struggle to balance PvP, but I just don&apos;t see it ever actually happening. Ever. Happens I have few-month-long moods where I really want to PvP, so I do it anyway, balanced or not. Well, since the massive battlegroup merger, and the faction changing for a fee thing, my beloved Horde *massively* outnumbers the Alliance. This leads to absurdly long queue-times for battlegrounds, and the inevitable sitting in Orgrimmar, waiting, that goes with it. Gets a bit old. Raids! Yes, I enjoy raiding, but you can only raid so many times per week. What&apos;s left? Professions? I have all of the professions maxed on various characters, except for archaeology. Which, as another reviewer quoted, involves staring at a stick with a blinking light, and *massive* amounts of travel time.  /Yawn. So, we&apos;re left with leveling another character... again. Well, I&apos;ve definitely got that covered--I have two accounts with max character limits on one server alone. Leaving me with absurd things like 3 priests, and 2 lvl 85 prot paladins, etc. Why? Well, not counting the fact that it&apos;s about the only thing left to do, I actually *like* leveling. Well, yay, there&apos;s new content for leveling up to 60. I&apos;ve done all the new quests, on Horde and Alliance toons. It goes by too quickly, and I just end up with yet another 85 that I can&apos;t bare to delete, but probably won&apos;t play very often. As for the whole concept of &quot;cata dungeons are hard!&quot;, they were moderately difficult initially, especially in comparison to the ones in Wrath, but, last I was playing they were easy mode again. Really, the dungeon-finder hp/healing/damage bonus is nice, but with 208k hp (with that bonus) and good avoidance and mitigation, I really didn&apos;t need CC any more. Yes, you still have to do appropriate things to compensate for various boss mechanics, for the most part, but it really had gone right back to &quot;tank grabs a group, we all kill it, next!&quot; from Wrath. For a little while, there was a hint of challenge. Now I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re hitting my target or not, I&apos;m not gonna lose threat to you.  That&apos;s just the tanking standpoint. With two accounts full of toons on one server, I *do* do other things, and I&apos;m still bored. The new zones are interesting the first time through. Vashj&apos;ir added in the element of needing to look above and below you, instead of just around you on a plain, but it loses its shiny luster of newness rather quickly. Most people find the zone pretty, but annoying. I only know of two people who don&apos;t hate it. The constant chain of cinematics in Uldum is an interesting twist the first time through, but after that, it&apos;s incredibly annoying to try to skip the cutscene, and find out you don&apos;t get the quest update, and have to go back and actually sit through the whole thing again. Also, an annoying facet of questing in the lvl 80-05 zones is that, with the ability to fly in the old world, the new zones were designed for you to fly in them. That doesn&apos;t sound problematic at first, but it massively affects mob spacing. You kill one mob, and then run just a bit too long to get to the next one, or you have to mount up, hop a short distance in the air on your flying mount, and then kill the next mob. Over all, the content is visually appealing, in the same WoW style, but the &quot;new&quot; parts get old pretty quickly. That&apos;s a gripe I have about the game as a whole, actually. Content gets outdated *fast*. Sure, you can do a Vanilla raid at lvl 60, because you can actually zone into the raid zone, but good luck finding other level appropriate people to do it with. Everyone wants to zoom through them on 85s. For luls, I soloed most of Kara shortly after Cata came out... on a holy priest. Sure, it&apos;s got the amusing &quot;look what I can do&quot; factor, but like everything else, it loses its appeal rapidly. If you don&apos;t mind using WoW as a giant chat room for weeks on end while waiting for major content patches, then you won&apos;t have a problem with Cata. It&apos;s pretty, but it&apos;s nothing truly new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1603685">Expand</a></span>

Be warned, though, that the user base tends to be a bit sociopathic. Just try not to let random players being mean ruin your fun, and you&apos;ll be fine.<br><br>For users that are already into the franchise, views seem to be mixed. I actually found leveling from 80-85 to be much harder than previous tiers, but then again I&apos;m not geared for dealing damage--I&apos;m geared for healing as a paladin. Your mileage may vary here. Leveling from 80-85 didn&apos;t take much time at all. That being said, I hate leveling, so this is a good thing. The new zones are also amazing, using brand-new quest mechanics with great story lines.  One of my favorite zones in the game is one of the new ones--Uldum. Pretty much all of the content I&apos;ve played has been spot-on.<br><br>Here&apos;s where my low score comes in. I found that once I hit 83 and began to do semi-max to max level content, difficulty increased steeply. (Again, because I&apos;m a healer, YMMV. Healing difficulty has certainly sharply increased.) I found that very jarring, personally, because earlier content is very simple to complete. Groups in the 80-85 range must be coordinated if they want to get through heroic dungeons, and to some extent regular dungeons. While this is much less boring than the Wrath model of dungeon running, it takes much more time. Most heroics take groups on my server around 3-4 hours to complete at this point in time. My server (Zangarmarsh) is about average on the side of progression--not good but not bad, either. I can imagine that it would be better or worse, depending on the server.<br><br>Since I&apos;m working, going to college, and raising a (currently) 1-year-old girl with my husband&apos;s help, I simply do not have time for that much gameplay in a week. The Wrath model would have allowed me to keep playing, but sadly, this was not to be. Since the only way for me to get gear to raid would be to run one regular dungeon a day for a very small amount of currency to get gear, my estimate gear up time is going to be several months. I think perhaps I will take a break until I either have more time or the content takes less time to do.<br><br>Pros: Much better leveling experience, great zone redesigns as well as new areas, story lines generally improved, much better gameplay at max level.<br><br>Cons: Time sink at max level. Difficulty curve sharply steepens around 83 or so (at least from a healing perspective.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460637">Expand</a></span>

Some of the PVP content, Tol Barad - the new Wintergrasp- in particular, is very poor. Its a far cry from the days Blizzard delays the burning crusade because they wanted to releases as polished a product as possible. The concept is great and when its good it really is but it just feels far to rushed in places.</span>

Someone would think that at lvl 80-85 we wouldn&apos;t be supposed to gather silly things for a quest, or grind for stuff. I did like though the guilds ranks and achievs system and the fact they added qs on entrances of dungeons. After leveling my druid to 85 I felt I was bored to lvl the rest 7 lvl 80ies. I started doing some qs on my priest then gave up and started using only the dungeons system to gain xp. My overall feeling is that the game has made it&apos;s circle, graphics and gameplay need more than just a make-over for this 6-7 year old game. Really, one thing I hate most is eating the same dinner for a third night!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541455">Expand</a></span>

It has slowly gone downhill since TBC. I&apos;m writing this on July 21 2012 and first of all, the last content patch was November of LAST YEAR. Now, this might be acceptable to the uber casual player, but for the rest of us, this lul is simply unacceptable. Now, Blizzard has said there will be no content patch until 5.0, and who knows when that will come out?
<br>Anyways, I mentioned the uber causal, who is even more casual than the normal casual. This person plays maybe half an hour to a couple of hours a day and may be satisfied with the direction this game has gone. Why? First of all, you can get Valor (the currency used to buy the end of the line epic gear) capped in one night by running three insanely easy and short dungeons.  Secondly, you can clear Dragon Soul (the latest raid dungeon) in roughly two hours, IF that. Thirdly, it takes only 1-2 weeks to get to level cap in extremely linear fashion with almost no challenge posed whatsoever; monsters, aka creeps, post little threat, and if you choose to level up via Dungeon Finder, the dungeons are incredibly short and easy, again posing no challenge. So what happens once you hit 85 in 1-2 weeks? You can buy blue PvP gear from the Auction House to bypass the ilevel requirements of the most relevant three dungeons. Once you do that, you can easily gear up for raiding in a matter of days, and then, like I mentioned earlier, once you actually get to raid it&apos;s only for a couple of hours a night, unlike the previous expansions, where it could take 3-4 nights of raiding. People might say this change is good, but what else is there to do in the game once you valor cap in a night and finish Dragon Soul in the next night? A whole 5 days of nothing until it resets on Tuesday and you rinse and repeat. I guess you could PvP, but PvP is horribly unbalanced. At least back in The Burning Crusade there were balancing hotfixes like every week, now PvP is completely dominated by rogues, death knights, resto shamans and other classes.
<br>Mists of Panderia looks like it&apos;s turning out to be even worse when it comes to catering to the uber casual player base, so I&apos;m going to skip it. I&apos;m stuck in the Annual Pass that I stupidly got last December, but I guess that&apos;s what cancelling a credit card is for, right? There ARE better games out there!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2534921">Expand</a></span>

However, as much as Blizzard sugarcoat it, it still results in a lack of end-game content if you&apos;re not in a huge raiding guild. This alienation of the player base that prefers playing in small groups or solo is unforgivable in a game that promises so much. The new heroic mode provides a few hours of challenge which sadly doesn&apos;t last once you&apos;ve seen them all at least once. Battlegrounds are, as ever, down mainly to pot luck (being in a decent server group) or the gear you have on. Level to 85, check out the areas, talents and instances, but don&apos;t expect anything much different from previous offerings or even anything particularly challenging. What was once an endless grind to the next piece of gear has stayed relatively unchanged.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1566004">Expand</a></span>

Also, the Worgen were awesome but the Goblins sucked. I couldnt stand them. I thought that the destruction aspect was kinda cool but overall it was a waste of money.</span>

<br>
<br>Missed commitments: No path of the titans;. less dungeons than promised; the dual raid structure dropped after the first release. Revamped zones lacked flavour and were streamlined to ridiculous extremes. The expansion ends with the following behaviour: players login and never leave the capital cities; they queue to run serial dungeons (or battlegrounds) until they meet their weekly cap of valour points. There&apos;s no discussion or interaction in dungeon runs, and Blizzard has roled the latin americas into the queue so language is now an issue anyways. 20 man raiding died this expansion. With homogenized gear, guilds focus on 10 man progression. LFR kills off any casual raiding or server pugs, further destroying any social interaction. Mid point of the expansion, Blizzard started to bribe players to maintain their subscriptions by giving away free copies of Diablo 3 via their annual pass. A very poorly executed expansion -- poor lore, bad design decisions, and increasing desperation to maintain their subscription base. Peak WoW is over, a slow inevitable decline has started. WoWs market position is now the result mainly of nostalgia and player inertia versus quality of product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2629869">Expand</a></span>

Up until that point, I hadn&apos;t been that excited about a new expansion since Burning Crusade. The events leading up to Cataclysm were well done and exciting. The new races were additions to the game that I felt were long overdue. Archaeology was a new secondary profession I looked forward to, as well as the concept of guild leveling. The breaking of the world and overhaul/redesign of classic zones was an innovative, ballsy and refreshing move by Blizzard, and I felt it would breathe new life into the game. I was giddy with anticipation at the inclusion of new zones that were an integral part of Warcraft lore such as Hyjal and Vashj&apos;ir. However, Cataclysm is a hard lesson for everyone that shows how an outstanding idea can be implemented in the wrong way. First, the good: The new zones were beautiful and fun to play in, though like in WOTLK, Blizzard decided to force the player to choose between two fantastic zones that robbed the player of the full leveling experience of Cataclysm by making Vashj&apos;ir and Hyjal the same zone level. Having to choose between these zones was a horrible decision to make, because I was keenly interested in both. The quests in these new zones were, at times, broken and lackluster. In addition, the new zones were spread WAY too far apart and didn&apos;t seem to fit together. Next, let&apos;s look at the new races. I hate what they did with the starting areas - why they made these areas &quot;instanced&quot; is beyond me. One can argue that the Cataclysm that drove these races to their respective factions is why you can never return to these zones, but it was exceedingly annoying that your new characters had no access to mailboxes after you left the initial starting zone, and if you got sick of the starting zone, you HAD to finish it before joining the rest of Azeroth. They wrote themselves into a corner and had to do it this way, but surely they could have written the lore differently so that, like other races, they could easily port to a new zone in Azeroth if they grew tired of being forced to go through the same story over and over. I was particularly disappointed with the Worgen, because the fall of Gilneas is STILL broken, and one wrong move during this final battle and you&apos;re ported back to the beginning of the instance and have to start over. Quests in the starting areas had a few fun experiences, but many were tedious. I felt the new quests in the retailored classic zones were redundant, because it was more efficient for players to grind through levels by running dungeons and battlegrounds, while questing in the refurbished zones wasn&apos;t nearly as fast. All of the work done by writers and developers to overhaul the classic zones was wasted, since running dungeons would get a player leveled more quickly. The ethos of WoW seemed to change with Cata, where leveling was no longer a journey to be enjoyed but a grind to be overcome. Perhaps it&apos;s because max level is ridiculously high while Blizzard hasn&apos;t adequately increased experience gained by questing to make players want to bother. In addition, the game has become far too easy. Cata kind of went from one extreme to another - they broke the healing class and made it exceedingly difficult to make it through a dungeon alive, and then they went the other way and made it far too easy. Guild leveling, intended to bring members of a guild closer together, acted instead to make guilds more cliquey - and now, almost 2 years post-Cata, people are only joining level 25 guilds for the benefits and ignoring the lower level guilds, making it almost impossible for new guilds to level, as there&apos;s no incentive to join. I&apos;m not sure why I left two months after Cata&apos;s release - I became aware of Cata&apos;s faults later on, but at the time I couldn&apos;t put my finger on what I didn&apos;t like about it. I just found myself in Stormwind one day with some friends repeatedly jumping off our flying mounts into the water, and realized, &quot;I&apos;m bored and unmotivated...what&apos;s the point of playing this game anymore?&quot; I returned briefly 9 months later, only to have my lowbie slaughtered repeatedly with players decked out in BoA gear in battlegrounds and then slapped in the face with MoP, a further degradation into mediocrity. Cataclysm is when WoW lost its magic for me, and MoP ended up being the nail in the coffin of a once fantastic game. If Blizzard created separate servers for Vanilla WoW or BC (with achievements) or even WOTLK (still good, but not my favourite), I&apos;d pay a monthly fee and play again in a heartbeat, but the direction developers have taken and the decisions they have made with this game since Cata has rendered this game unplayable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2657921">Expand</a></span>

World of Warcraft is mmorpg for newbies to the gaming industry.<br><br>Here are the issues the game has. They removed all of the elements that actually made the game challenging, if you look at vanilla vs cataclysm vanilla always wins the challenge debate. Cataclysm rebuilt wow from the ground up, its not a good thing. Some games are better if you do not make massive changes which turns a game into a kid friendly environment.<br><br>There is another common issue with blizzard, they say they will find a way to prevent twinks or make it so they cant do much but they turn right around and give players more options to do so, I am always getting one shotted unless I&apos;m 60+ so doing any type of pvp before 60 is out of the question. Only chance I have at those levels is to go get my weapons enchanted and of course get a ton of Bind to Account (BoA) gear, no reason the game should have BoA gear anyway.<br><br>Their attempts to balance the game have outright made me laugh beyond anything I have ever seen, the big issue is that they listen to all of the kids who have barely started gaming and not the ones who have been gaming since the 70s or 80s. On top of this they almost directly ripped off League of Legends abilities for abilities so there is little to no ingenuity anymore from blizzard.<br><br>Vanilla WoW was incredible, challenging in every aspect and every casual player could play it and get ahead. Burning crusade comes and a good 20% of the pvp appeal was lost in the patch about a week before it was released (e.g. the beginning rank system which I know they are going to add back but wont be similar or challenging to get ranks.)<br><br>Wrath of the litch king comes out, makes everything extremely simplified and adds in new stats to gear which means that pvp gear is no longer useful for pve and vice versa meaning its an attempt to get players to spend a lot more time in a game that should only have half the longevity.<br><br>Now cataclysm comes out, everything is so simplified even an 8 year old can play it and learn quickly, the learning curve went from average to well below average in terms of how hard it is to learn.<br><br>Real gamers know that we need a challenge to be content with a game, we know that games are worthless if we are not being pushed to get ahead in the game. Cataclysm removes all of these aspects from the game meaning there are more challenging games on the market with better PvP and PvE most of which are free to play.<br><br>There have been studies that showed that the average amount of subscribing world of warcraft accounts that had characters over 10 was roughly 70%. This means that 30% played the game for a few hours and quit because it was just too boring.<br><br>Here are a few examples of games that have better pvp...<br><br>Perfect World International (free to play better pvp at higher levels)<br>Global Agenda (Buy once no monthly charge - even though the game is just as bad as wow)<br>Dungeon Fighter online (free to play)<br>Air Rivals (free to play space craft game)<br>Zero online (diablo 2 but in mecha style form)<br><br>Games that have better PvE:<br>Lunia Online (free to play)<br>Global Agenda (see above)<br>Battle of Immortals<br>Perfect World International<br>Dungeon Fighter online<br>Zero Online<br>Air Rivals<br>Everquest Classic (thats right, old game but still better)<br>Many others I cant actually list here due to character&apos;s remaining issues.<br><br>Games worse than or equal to WoW in all ways:<br>Vanguard - Saga of Heros<br>Everquest II<br>Hellgate London<br>Guild wars (about the same in many ways in terms of longevity)<br><br>Point being go play something worth 55 dollars if you are going to spend 55 dollars, not something that is worth 5 dollars to buy (e.g. cataclysm) and worth no monthly fees since blizzard does a terrible job at maintaining and managing the content for the game.<br>
My advise, wait for Diablo III, Dungeon Siege III, and Rift.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1556141">Expand</a></span>

Now obviously, if we make comparisons, since all reviews are a form of comparison, the closest thing we can compare Cataclysm to is Wrath of the Lich King, which I thought was a tremendous expansion and I gave an 8.  I know WotLK&apos;s content endgame was pretty easy (well, very easy), but that wasn&apos;t why I like it.  WotLK&apos;s endgame dungeons had some very interesting environments, dungeons and lore.  Lore.  That is what is really missing with Cataclysm.  You feel with endgame that you are simply going through the motions.  There&apos;s nothing really unique or significant with design, architecture, or anything else.  The gameplay is almost exactly the same as the previous expansion, with the exception that they put crowd control back in, and has been essentially the same throughout the series, so how do I rate the game on that aspect?  It really is the world-building, the quests, and what you&apos;re hero accomplishes in his adventures against the Lich King, the Old Gods, and the Burning Legion that makes WoW entertaining, and I feel that Cataclysm ultimately failed to deliver the sense that you&apos;re character&apos;s actions have any sort of impact with endgame so far.  There&apos;s just no depth to it.  That said, I would spend all my time with Cata leveling from 1 to 60, because the new quest areas for new characters *were* developed with a sense of impact and interest, and some of the quests you just cannot miss (Badlands).  So there&apos;s my summation.  I don&apos;t know how helpful it will be if at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1766952">Expand</a></span>

In the beginning it was a bit crowded, but good fun anyway. Mount hyjal, deepholm, uldum, twilight highlands, 85! Leveling turned out to be way too quick and way too linear. After 3 days I was 85 already, and now what? Grinding dungeons/heroics for gear and emblems, just like in wrath. Farming mats for professions/flasks/food, just like in wrath. Learning and mastering raid encounters, just like in wrath. Cata is EXACTLY the same game as before, just with other surroundings. I started playing wow when wrath was just released, so this is basically my first expansion. I don&apos;t know if this is what wow expansions should be like, but it is a real disappointment. Yes, they changed all the old zones. So what? A level 85 character has no reason at all to go there, except maybe for the new profession archeology, which must be the most boring thing in the game, even worse than fishing. The new raids are challenging at times, but again more of the same: spread out, stack up, kill adds, don&apos;t stand in this, do stand in that, dispel that, interrupt this, etc. And then there is the failure called Tol Barad and blizzards laughable attempt to &apos;fix&apos; it by rewarding the attacking side 1800 honor for a win. I mean, seriously? Leveling professions is too easy, new talent trees and stats are too simple, phasing is annoying (especially when farming nodes disappear and reappear), dungeons are hardly ever fun (except stonecore, which is pretty good)... So is it all bad then? No, I did really enjoy the goblin starting zone, Stonecore is good, leveling in Uldum was fun. Is it enough to make a good game? No. Most critics must have only played this game for a few days, cause that&apos;s when it still seems like a good game. Earlier this month I canceled my subscription... time to move on to better games...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1486893">Expand</a></span>

Sure the end-game content is supposed to be where the &quot;true game&quot; starts. Well, the end-game content so far isn&apos;t anything to right home about unless you like farming plain looking dungeons with super-sized, color swapped, bosses with inflated hit points/damage to give the illusion of difficulty. --- Oh and speaking of color swap, they really phoned in the armor sets this time. Not only do most classes look horrid, when you finally get to upgrade out of that ugly set &quot;gratz color swap&quot; same ugly set. ----- Class balance issues have seemingly always plagued this game, alright any MMO to be fair, but WoW&apos;s balancing seems to defy common sense. You get to look forward to that in this expansion too, it just gets worse because they added Mastery rating so now they have another stat to screw up. ---- Sad fact is I&apos;m still playing WoW and probably still will be when the next expansion hits because despite what I think I&apos;m basically just another WoW drone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1467123">Expand</a></span>

But this expansion lost some of what I loved about older versions. I do not like the dumbed down talent trees. I do not like the simplicity of play rotations. It&apos;s so obviously laid out that if you play in a creative way then you suffer worse results, no matter what your role is. I don&apos;t like some of the options that have become common place. A built in quest helper guides you to your next objectives. Of course I use it because it&apos;s there, lest I be left behind, but you lose your sense of exploration, isolation, and discovery. You used to be able to search a zone and see something hidden and amazing and wonder how many players took the time to discover what you&apos;ve discovered. Now you all follow the same linear path through the zone. A similar issue exists with changing the appearance of your gear. Yeah I use it, but I hate it. We should have to display the gear we&apos;ve earned and live with it. If you want to break out your Soulforge from your bank and wear it that&apos;s your choice. I don&apos;t like how huge the zones are. They&apos;re pretty good looking and the quality of quests is usually decent but you&apos;re stuck in the same damn zone for hours and you just want to move on. Another issue is fast flying mounts. It trivializes the epic feeling of time and space that you used to get with Wow. Just fly over it and get where you need to go as fast as possible. Don&apos;t take the time to stop and enjoy the scenery or you&apos;ll be left behind. Arenas suck too...mostly because I suck at them and I&apos;m mad. Anyway, I&apos;ll be back for panda time but I&apos;m now a sceptic. Giving no lower than a 7 because Wow overall is the best game ever created :P  P.S.-The old zone makeovers are a GOOD THING!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2532836">Expand</a></span>

The way, Mounts and stuff are patched out of the game or being reduced to a minimum, so everyone playing 10h can get something, you&apos;ve been working weeks for, is just unfair. Also the balance: while some classes get nerved all the time, pretty Paladin gets more and more op stuff. The times, feeling like a hero, having some things nearly alone, are gone. It became more and more a game for 6 year old children. I won&apos;t even describe the horrible quest system or even the achievements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=2607094">Expand</a></span>

I had lost my account at that point, so I needed to start from scratch.<br><br>The game blew me away almost from the get-go. I was absolutely stunned with how much I enjoyed it, especially remembering the agony of leveling before. Almost every zone has a story, some small tale that you affect, brilliantly using the phasing mechanic to make you feel like your actions impact the zone.<br><br>The entire game felt fresh and new, many small things were added to make learning things easier. No more training defense and weapon skills, notifications when you can learn new moves from the trainer, improved interfaces, spell alerts etc. etc.<br><br>I had a perpetual blast from 1-60, but alas that&apos;s when the magic abruptly ends. Being a casual gamer, I played maybe a 2-3 hours a week, and levels 50-60 (which pre-cataclysm used to take ages to complete) now take about 1/2 hour per level un-rested.<br><br>At level 60 this joyride comes to a screeching halt, and outlands and beyond. All of a sudden after having fun, rewarding, half hour level ups it takes about 2-3 hours PER LEVEL. The quests in the outlands starting zones give LESS exp than old world level 55 quests. The quests are also much further spaced out (meaning more travel time) and overall not as fun (kill 10 of x and 20 of y). I am currently level 69, and went to Northrend. That place hasn&apos;t changed much either, and I will not be continuing my &quot;adventures&quot; much longer.<br><br>If I was to give out a recommendation for this game, I&apos;d say that you should just buy the original WoW and play through leveling to 60. The expansion content is only necessary if you want to play goblins/worgen/blood elves/draenei or want to continue beyond level 60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468160">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Please be very aware that Blizzard employees have been caught spamming Metacritic with positive reviews in order to bump up the score (which has worked nicely)
<br>
<br>This expansion has less in it than any other expansion so far. this expansion has more &quot;lolwut&quot; moments in it than any other (Sphynx-Men, racist Arab midgets, a death-star pyramid, dragon rape) and its clear that blizzards primary development team are off doing something else, leaving us with the work experience guys and some retards who came in for a day trip to Blizz HQ. This game gets a score of 1 because it finally cured my World of Warcraft addiction, its just a pity that I replaced it with crystal meth =(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1536261">Expand</a></span>

Blizzard has finally removed any and all challenge from the game. Leveling my pally from 80 to 85 was a joke as it was impossible for me to die.  There wasn&apos;t a single quest that gave me a second of concern.  After getting to 85, I began leveling a worgen warrior and, being unable to heal myself, I did die a few times but only at the lowest levels.  Once I got some half-decent gear, leveling became a dull, dull grind.  My guess is that Blizzard decided that with Cataclysm WoW would no longer be a game for adults.  Their focus must be on 8 to 10 year olds.  I can&apos;t think of any other age group that could find any hint of a challenge in the game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah - lots of new quests and the graphics, while still a bit cartoonish, are very detailed.  The overhaul of Stormwind is pretty amazing.  But Wow isn&apos;t a game.  It&apos;s nothing more than a way to kill time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1455906">Expand</a></span>

<br>I dont want to rewrite what already has been written. So I will keep it short. This game has become something that only is there for taking the last money out of the &quot;blind&quot; people who belive the game is really giving something new. There isn&apos;t anything NEW to the game. Just easier way to endgame and do all the same thing over again. A few new changes. Nothing new to the mechanics or the core of the game.
<br>
<br>Dont get fooled guys. Don not let the high score or other blinded reviews get into you. It&apos;s a waste of time...
<br>
<br>Realize the fact. And think for yourselves...
<br>
<br>Enjoy other great games out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1452805">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s THE borderline of WoW. Your experience with this game will really depend on whatever you played from Vanilla or you jumped on the train not long ago. I wasn&apos;t as excited as I was at previous Expansion Packs because I knew what summarily they bring. The new areas are really good and the stories are good, I&apos;ll sing that. I played Western/Eastern Plaguelands and Westfall which were pretty good and of course the 5 new Cataclysm zone (Yes, only 5 since the maximum level was pushed up with only 5!). I hoped they have made it harder since 3.2.0 but I soon realized how foolish I was  to think this. It became so easy that you barely need to think anymore. The abilities became extremely overpowered (for Warriors at least). And Questing/Leveling was like surfing on small tides, It didn&apos;t have difficulty at all! I thought at level 85 I might find some challange but no. The heroics were again using the same system but with Points (why Points now?) and Battlegrounds used the same system with points too (at least this mostly remained like it did). So what did I do? Try out the new species (Goblin and Worgen). Wait. What are these classes? Tauren Paladin? MAGE DWARF? Orc Mage? I understand now. They killed half of WoW with the Badge system in 3.2.0 and now they killed the other half with messing the whole plot up, but this half was the one that was with Warcraft at its RTS roots too. Why would suddenly Taurens turn to the light? Dwarves are immune to magic in this way (they couldn&apos;t become mages). Even Dragon Age 2 could keep this rule. And Orc Mage.. Who thought that picking random class combinations out of the blue was a good idea? Why did they even do these combinations that completely DENIES THE LORE!? And there are the &quot;merely a setback&quot; characters. In Burning Crusade this was a great idea and it might made you smile in WOTLK, but It&apos;s extremely overused here. Hogger, Ragnaros, Nefarian, Onyxia, Cenarius (Yep, It makes the orcs&apos; victory at Ashenvale completely meaningless). Oh, and Cairne is dead who was the leader of the Tauren since Warcraft 3 and got killed in some quest. Ultra Great,really... And what&apos;s with the constant instance repeating? I mean, Naxxramas was a great idea. But now they use Zul&apos;Gurub, Zul&apos;Aman and old bosses up again? I hope you were happy with your Amani War Bear because soon everyone will be running with that one all around. At least there are some more positives, It makes puts some character into the story which haven&apos;t done anything before : Matthias Shaw of the SI:7, Prince Anduin and It welcomes some new ones. I don&apos;t know what this expansion will bring up later but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll resume playing it during the summer because It&apos;s so nerfed (they made it so easy) that I might play a week if I resumed It and then I would be jumping and talking in a Capital City. So to sum this one up: If you are new on the train, you might like it but if you are a veteran, you&apos;ll want to deny this as being part of Warcraft. For the later one I can only say what i said before, go to Vanilla or any private server that is before the 3.2.0 patch. And if the previous got bored of It or doesn&apos;t like it too, They might wanna check the previous games too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/user-reviews?user_review_id=1549961">Expand</a></span>
