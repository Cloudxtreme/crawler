I played it for around 25 in-game hours.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m one of those people who was heavily disappointed when Bethesda cancelled Prey 2 (2006&apos;s Prey&apos;s sequel, which I played and very much enjoyed). In a way, even if I wasn&apos;t one of them, I totally understood the people who started bashing and boycotting this new Prey game. But was the hate justified?
<br>
<br>The short answer is no. Not at all. Based on my experience so far, I have to say this game is simply amazing in every possible way. The music is phenomenal, thanks to the talented Mick Gordon who also did the soundtrack for 2016&apos;s Doom and for Wolfenstein: The New Order.
<br>
<br>But what is more important though is that the game is full of very smart and intelligent gameplay design ideas. It&apos;s more than obvious that the devs well thought out every little gameplay aspect and tweaked them to achieve perfection. This game has a very high production quality.
<br>
<br>Also, I think I never saw a game before that so well utilized the enviroment such as this. In every single area I spent a very large amount of time to be able to discover everything, and it was a whole lot of fun. Prey mixes verticality and platforming very well with the usual, more horizontal gameplay.
<br>
<br>And if I mentonied exploration: the exploration/discovery is fantastic, the game is very complex and deep in terms of world building and gameplay, in fact it&apos;s more complex in a way than most AAA games out there today. The story and the lore looks promising, and I like the visual design the artists went for.
<br>
<br>The game clearly took inspiration from the best movies in the sci-fi genre (Stanley Kubrick&apos;s 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Ridley Scott&apos;s Alien). Other than that, it reminds me some of the best games I&apos;ve played, such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Bioshock, Dishonored, and of course, it also has a very strong System Shock vibe. In fact, it could be called System Shock 3. It has a Dead Space feeling in a way too.
<br>
<br>The good news won&apos;t end here. This game is perfectly optimized. I have a rig that is around the recommended specs, and I manage to hit 100FPS average at 1080p on the absolute highest settings (EVGA GTX970 FTW, 16GB DDR4 2400Mhz RAM, i5-6500).
<br>
<br>This game is a joy to play. It&apos;s very impressive that it managed to grab me this much under only one hour and never let me go till I finished it. In fact, I&apos;m still not finished (even if I completed the story). I&apos;m starting a second playthrough now and I&apos;ll try to get the remaining achievements.
<br>I definitely recommend checking out this game, it well worth the money!
<br>
<br>If I have to say a con, it&apos;s a minor thing, but normal human-sized enemies will provide unpleasant difficulty spikes every time you face them as long as you don&apos;t get a shotgun. Fighting against them with the Glue Gun, Pistol, or Wrench is not easy, and they kill you in 3 hits on Normal difficulty. The easiest is to avoid them and/or try to throw explosives at them from a distance (red pipes).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7278512">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Can&apos;t change FOV, in-game, but they will be adding a fov slider later on, for now you will have to go and edit the game.cfg file
<br>
<br>Same with motion blur, to turn off go into game.cfg  add this line  r_MotionBlur = 0
<br>
<br>If you change graphics settings in-game after that the file would be rewritten</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7278613">Expand</a></span>

This is a modern carbon copy of System Shock 2, a game I gave a perfect score of 10 and one of my all time favorite games. It also borrows elements from Alien Isolation and the Bioshock games wich of course in turn are heavily influenced by System Shock.
<br>It doesn&apos;t bring alot new to the table but it implements almost all it has borrowed well. The Alien Isolation parts where you have to hide from a giant alien arn&apos;t as well executed as in AI, the fear mechanic seems pretty pointless and I never succumbed to it even though I didn&apos;t use fear dampening items (I played on normal, maybe the hardest difficulty remedy this). And it wasn&apos;t to hard actually killing it instead of hiding or just simply run away to a new area unlike AI where you are guaranteed to be killed if the Alien sees you.
<br>
<br>The skills are interesting and the story is also pretty interesting, the game kept me interested all the way to the end. There are several ways to approach your objectives and enemies, giving you choices on how you want to play, I always appreciate that.
<br>
<br>You also have quite a few choices to make wich will affect the ending and define your character. There is a proper inventory with full mouse management, hotkeys and pc specific controls (there is a radial menu but you don&apos;t have to use it at all). So is this another perfect score then? No, the one thing I was really missing was the sense of dread and isolation System Shock 2 gave me, or even Alien Isolation. The atmosphere wasn&apos;t quite there all the way and there wasn&apos;t a proper main antagonist like Shodan or the actual Alien. I also found the alien design lacking. They are not creepy and not varied enough. Quite frankly the alien design is boring. So one point of for that.
<br>
<br>The performance is pretty solid aswell. I have a 4yo rig with an oc i7 4770K, 16gb ram and a oc Titan Black running the game at 3440X1440p at maxed settings with shadows turned to medium, V-sync off (have a g-sync monitor) and AA at 8x and still got around 55-60 fps avarage with some dips at some points. Pretty good considering the resolution. I did miss a FOV option ingame but you could fix that in the .ini file.
<br>Loading time is a bit heavy for pc at around 30-40 seconds when entering a new area with an annoying two loading screens. Around 10 seconds for a quickload within the same area or respawn if you die. You can&apos;t bind quicksave or quickload to hotkeys though wich is really annoying.
<br>It all worked flawlessly until the end of the game, at around 24h mark my save files got corrupt and I was stuck in an area crashing everytime I try to exit it. Appearantly this is a problem on all platforms. As of writing this review there is no official fix but having the pc version meant I can access and modify my savegames. I got around this problem by deleting the &quot;area&quot;.level file in my savegame for the area i was trying to enter. This resets that area so all the items, keycards you&apos;ve found are all back in place (but you still have the ones you&apos;ve taken in your inventory) and all the doors and safes are locked again. This also means that you can trigger any sidequest again in that area even if you have completed them. Not optimal and a real drag if you have to reset the lobby area. For this reason I subtracted yet another point from my score because it is a gamebreaking bug, sure I personally managed to get around it but if you play on console and get this bug or if this fix doesn&apos;t work for you on pc then the game is broken and can&apos;t be completed. There is no guarantee a patch will fix your saves if they are already corrupted either wich means you might have lost hours upon hours of progress. I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll fix it but still not an okay release</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7288721">Expand</a></span>

We&#x2019;re not in Antartica but in a state of emergency space station named Talos One, located just on the other side of the Moon but still outside the orbit where planet Earth is still visible. It&#x2019;s the year 2032, an alternative future where John F. Kennedy survived to the attempt of murder in Texas (1963) until his presidency became crucial from avoiding the Vietnam conflict to the stable standing, geopolitical relationship between USA and USSR through space conquests. So, Talos One itself represents basically that, in memory of Mr. President JFK. The main character (that can be shaped as male or female) is Morgan Yu, an engineer that lost part of his/her memory and it&#x2019;s in constant needs of recover him/her pieces of lack through the whole story made of different decisions, including your own way to play that will affect the logic of game play approach.
<br>
<br>Prey it&#x2019;s a first person shooter that borrows many elements from the most successful hits of our times such System Shock 2, Half-Life series and Bioshock series through something that many customers tends to underestimate in regards of the developers: pure passion for what they generally do and, in this case, the science fiction matter. This game still proves (in 2017, with DirectX11 and a relative old game engine) that the best experiences are single player only, without online co-op or whatsoever multiplayer useless competition that requires too much efforts and years of development spent on building huge worlds and testing it. The immersion is total especially when you move from an area to another going outside the station with a propulsor pack at zero gravity and, of course, zero atmosphere (very well represented with the sounds from the inside of your own space suit that we suppose to hear not exactly like an underwater situation). The audio segment is enriched with a lot of narrative, Italian in my case, beautifully localized and expressed. The music is perfectly tailored to the whole atmosphere and again,  very Alan Howarth/Carpenter stylized. What about the aliens? Well, they really &#x201C;stole&#x201D; the scenery here...maybe not so original in the highest and most dangerous shapes mixed with usual elemental stuff like electricity, fire or pure psychokinetic capacities but with behaviors that are just what we want to expect inside a nightmare: when you realize that they are completely mimic to objects like mugs, tables, suitcases, so able to hide on plain sight, is definitely enough shocking until you don&#x2019;t get it and learn different approaches in order to become from prey...to predator!
<br>
<br>In conclusion it&apos;s a game maybe not worth at full political price and aimed to pure sci-fi lovers audiences but with a 15%-20% off easy to reach on the net (especially PC versions) it might become a bargain and well balanced overall experience considering the total amount of hours 24H-28H of game play.

Do what you want.  Kill how you want.  And play the story how you want.  And it is all done in the most natural way you can imagine.  This is one of the few games where i have actually wanted to complete more side quests in order to decide whats best to do on the final choice (presumably - im already 26 hours in and not at the end, but fairly certain there is more than 1 ending).  I think thats the mark of a good story.  Im so captivated by the story i want to know more in order to make a more informed decision.  If you like bioshock then just buy it already and enjoy.  You will not be disappointed.  My only gripe is some dodgy frame rate issues and operators are a bit too OP.  But no game is perfect, and this deserves to have as high a score as possible because this is EXACTLY how games should be made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7358348">Expand</a></span>

This is probably the best major studio release I&apos;ve played this year and certainly of the same caliber as the Bioshock series, with which it shares a lineage of exploration-based progression, or what Warren Spector nondescriptively called &quot;interactive sims&quot;, descended from the oft-discussed System Shock. It&apos;s even set on a space station, and its &quot;neo-deco&quot; aesthetic reminds one strongly of the first 2 Bioshocks.
<br>
<br>In the 1950s, Soviet cosmonauts encounter and are killed by a hostile alien lifeform- the Typhon. In a panic, the Soviet government reaches out to the US and they work together to build a space station, the Kletka, openly for peaceful purposes but secretly to contain and study the Typhon, but after an outbreak in the 80s, the station was shut down. Thereafter, its bought up by a corporation called Transtar, with the intent of continuing said research. Fast forward to 2032. You are Morgan Yu, a scientist working on the station, now called Talos 1, and the Typhon have escaped containment once again- but this time, things are much, much worse.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played any of the games I mentioned before, or Deus Ex, or even Dishonored, Arkane&apos;s earlier success, You&apos;ll know what to expect, and you&apos;ll get something arguably better. Especially where Dishonored is concerned. The stealth mechanics of this game are so much improved from Dishonored that you&apos;d scarcely think they were developed by the same studio. As an FPS, Prey handles extremely well. Controls are responsive, most actions are intuitive and the game&apos;s systems are explained very naturally. Load times are fairly speedy as well. You can even lean around corners! The double jumping can get a little wonky at times, though, the booster is very squirreley. From the beginning of the game, you are free to wander much of Talos 1, including wandering about its exterior in zero-g, though it takes some time for the station to open up completely. You begin with a humble pipe wrench with which to to fend off the game&apos;s most basic enemy- the Mimic, a spidery, shadowy creepy-crawler that, as the name suggests, can disguise itself as mundane objects to fool you into coming too close. But very quickly you will begin to encounter larger, more dangerous Typhon types, many with deadly psionic abilities, and your first few battles will introduce you to the fact that while Prey is easy to pick up, it&apos;s not exactly a cakewalk. Enemies are not altogether numerous, but they are very dangerous. Early on, even the Mimics can nip you to death quickly, and they&apos;re hard to pin down- they&apos;ll dodge, they&apos;ll run away and disguise themselves, and generally avoid coming at you head on. The larger enemies, such as the humanoid Phantoms, are more aggressive, and will blast you with their powers as they close the distance. Even in the endgame, if you don&apos;t pay attention to your health and suit durability, you might be looking at a game over screen sooner then you realize.
<br>
<br>Like its predecessors, Prey is not a run-and-gun boomfest but a game of exploration, resource conservation and using creative, or at least cunning and mean, solutions to problems. It&apos;s both a lengthy and dense experience and took me well over thirty hours to complete, and I was intensely interested for the duration, but I do have a few complaints. There are some quest-breaking bugs. I&apos;ve heard about more of them then I encountered, but one of them caused the &quot;Treasure Map&quot; side quest to break completely, meaning I missed out on a particuarly powerful suit chipset. It also has some issues with its sound design and lighting. Certain audio effects and voices can be extremely loud one instant, only for you to turn a corner and have them cut off completely, with no gradation between. Also, more so then even a lot of other first-person survival games, the difference between the light and dark areas in some levels is so stark that I completely missed some items and stumbled across them by accident later. Also, the flashlight is honestly too bright, blotting everything in your vision with its glare. I fiddled with the brightness setting multiple times over the course of my run and never got it where I wanted it. It could be an issue with my monitor, which is a bit dark to begin with, but who knows. Regardless, it hits a lot of notes for me both in its writing and its gameplay, and struck me afterwards as spiritually similar to Metroid Prime. I encourage anyone who enjoys FPS or survival games to try the demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7477899">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is a slow burner and doesn&apos;t take you by the hand, yet rewards you for every step you take, especially when attempting to look further behind the obvious spaces and experimenting with the different game mechanics.
<br>
<br>Superb level-, art- and sound-design, lots of different choices, tactics and possible builds, all topped by a haunting and captivating atmosphere...I could go on and on :)
<br>
<br>What amazes me the most is how Prey actually allows you to choose the depth/speed of your gaming experience.
<br>There is a lot to soak in and discover, but I suppose you could also skip/miss loads of it and still have a fun playthrough.
<br>
<br>In the endgame there were some story bugs / quests I couldn&apos;t finish or didn&apos;t have the patience to, but all in all it stayed amazing.
<br>
<br>Anyways, as stated in the beginning:

<br>
<br>The ending(s) is definitely controversial, but I liked it. Maybe slightly rushed in the very end/ would have been cool to have some more extrapolation but this left room for some pretty cool online speculations, at least. Also, playing on hard I did nearly run out of ammo on certain weapons which necessitated some gamestyle changes, but only because i was MANUFACTURING tons of skill points. How cool is that! :)
<br>
<br>The hacking minigame is not the best or wouldn&apos;t even be necessary but it really didn&apos;t bother me after a while.

<br>Bethesda has really surprised me with this game. I did not expect much of it so the gameplay and the setting really drew me in and I read every piece of info i could find to find out about the backstory of the place. The abilities are also nice.
<br>
<br>This game takes the mechanics from several games - Bioshock the most, Dishonored, Deus Ex, Fallout (was surprised that i could not find a bobble head), Half Life and many others.
<br>
<br>The graphics are good but it might be problematic if you have an old PC (it only slowed down for me in one section when set on max, 1st time ever with this computer)
<br>
<br>There are several bugs, one of them annoying and almost game breaking, but it has been patched. The devs have been going for the Dishonored look of their characters and it backfired - every one of them has really a really ugly malformed face since they are not cartoonish enough. It is not a big problem, but it is worth mentioning.
<br>
<br>SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD
<br>
<br>The reason why I am giving this an 8 and not a 10 is because of all the ripping off (even though it is well implemented, it is still not original) and because of the ending. I do not want to spoil it any more and you might like it more then I did since it is original and bold. It just did not work for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7330617">Expand</a></span>

I started playing 2 weeks ago and for once, this game makes you want to do all of the side missions before progressing forward. Updating attributes really impacts the gameplay and makes you want to explore the story more. I am truly immersed in this game and I am simply blown away. The last time I felt like this was when I beat Metal Gear Solid on the PsOne and I was like 15 when i beat that game. I am 36 now and have 3 kids under 3. I find myself playing this game from 10pm-1am and half of the weekends Im off work. I am just in awe of this game. Next Dishonored 2. Bethesda Simply outdid themselves on this one. I play with a GTX 960 and have the game on very high settings. Its soo silky smooth and beautiful. The game is just fun and its challenging. I am playing on Hard and I am really liking it. Enjoy!!! I highly recommend this game to anyone that loved Doom 2016 and Dishonored and Half Life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7554767">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s sci-fi in alternative Universe that tells awesome story, plays like half-life+dishonored+bioshock and have awesome ending. It&apos;s very long (that&apos;s bad) - about 40 hours of gameplay, but pretty intensive and thrilling. One of the best games in 2017.</span>

                                        <span>This is seriously an underrated game. This is the reason we get **** games with lootboxes and micro-transaction these days. We dont appreciate games like these from awesome studios like Arkane Studios. People nowadays deserve games like star wars battlefront 2 and overwatch. They complain about the micro-transaction and yet get it anyway. Buy this game and appreciate epicness.</span>

<br>+ Awesome and &quot;interesting to explore&quot; setting
<br>+ Mick Gordon&apos;s soundtrack
<br>+ Scary looking design of enemies
<br>+ Pretty well optimized for PC
<br>
<br>- Mediocre shooter gameplay
<br>- Outdated graphics
<br>- Disappointing ending ( personally for me )
<br>
<br>Prey is a great example of very strong and solid game in immersive sim. genre. One of the best games in 2017.</span>

A solid story and the Freedom to decide how to deal with situations. Take Bioshock, put in a little bit Systemshock and Half Life and you get e very good Game. The only problem, it is with about 30 hours playtime (if you do all the quests) a little bit short.</span>

I love Arcane studios because they came up from a very good old-school studio  (whoever remembers) &quot;Looking Glass&quot; and they&apos;ve developed the 2 jewels of franchises Thief (1,2,3) and System Shock (1,2).
<br>This game is revival of the very same System shock (more or less) it is what Bioshock never was and it never be, Bioshock was a total failure of a game, repetitive crap with dull story and boring gameplay. This game goes over all that, it is the most similar thing i&apos;ve ever played to thief and system shock. I just hope that Arcane Studios will continue working on goold old school style games and hopefully maybe one day will make a proper Thief game :)
<br>
<br>Anyway, if you are an old school gamer who enjoyed the games pre 2k (more, less in the 90s) this game is definitely for you
<br>
<br>If you are a kid who does not appreciate good story, good atmosphere, gameply which involves the player to think and gameplay which negates the &quot;autopilot&quot; gaming, and especially if you enjoy light-wave console titles, this game is not for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7376353">Expand</a></span>

Channeling obvious inspiration from classic games like system shock, dead space, half life 1 and 2, and the bioshock series, this game rewards creativity and those enjoy a challenging gameplay. The game does not baby you and many enemies are quite powerful. You feel incredibly rewarded whenever you upgrade your abilities and kit and this translates nicely into a multitude of branching upgrade paths.

<br>TL:DR --&gt; Its like half life, bioshock, and deadspace made a baby. I love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7286559">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s such a breath of fresh air compared to the usual &quot;go to this quest-marker, kill some monsters, collect some items&quot; games.
<br>
<br>I also like the graphics, setting, style and survival horror feeling.

<br>the overall theme is the same, the atmosphere is the same, the story is very (VERY) similar
<br>this game is very difficult if played on hard, but that&apos;s how a game should be
<br>
<br>-- GOOD--
<br>WRENCH: you have the iconic SS2 weapon! enough to sell the game to me :D
<br>STORY: extremely good story telling and writing, good mix of horror and sci-fi
<br>LEVEL DESIGN: feels like a mix between SS2 and Half-Life with a touch of Bioshock, in other words: top-notch level design.
<br>CRAFTING MECHANICS: mechanics borrowed from SS2 and perfected
<br>GRAPHICS: it&apos;s using the CryEngine but fortunately enough they decided for a non-photorealistic rendering, which would have completely ruined the game. Even the graphics is a strong reference to SS2...
<br>
<br>-- BAD --
<br>ENEMIES: they glitch out like crazy...very poor AI overall (almost no AI:, enemies will just run towards you disregarding the environment or avoid you completely. Probably this fits the storyline but makes the game incredibly hard or incredibly easy)
<br>ENEMIES, again: they&apos;re not infinite! this was a huge point in SS2 atmosphere! in Prey once you clear a section, you feel relatively safe. In SS2 you could go all way back to the beginning and get attacked by a screaming enemy! This removes a lot from the atmosphere, it&apos;s not scaring enough. Moreover, after a while you can easily predict where they will appear! In SS2 enemies were completely unpredictable. Here they went for the easy jump scare, which probably suits better modern gamers, who knows..
<br>ENEMIES, again and again!: they&apos;re badly designed with very few variations. I was hoping for some inside-out warped abominations (Dark Souls style) looking at the trailers..all you get is the same four-legged creature rehashed multiple times...might fit the storyline, but then don&apos;t advertise something your game clearly does not have. The mimic effect is cool, but everything else feels pretty cheap and rushed.
<br>UI sometimes is a bit messy but it&apos;s nothing terrible.
<br>
<br>In short: very good overall, but poor AI and enemy design. Does not reach the perfection level of SS2 or Half-Life (the best FPS games ever made) but it&apos;s very, very close. Nothing that a well-done sequel, prequel or whatever cannot fix.
<br>
<br>Overall, given the low quality of modern FPS games (at least most of them), this game is a long awaited gem that every fan of the genre should play.
<br>
<br>Thanks Bethesda and Arkane Studios for bringing back true old-school RPG FPS style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7283754">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay is very similar to BioShock, but with Adam switched from a total to a small number of discrete mods.  All changes to the player character are done via these mods; they are not split into separate types like BioShock&apos;s Plasmids and Tonics.
<br>
<br>Weapon handling is good and combat is tough--very tough.  This is obviously a design choice.  Most monsters are more powerful than you in a fair fight, so the game encourages you to fight dirty.  Different enemies have different weaknesses, and learning how to exploit them is the axis combat revolves around.
<br>
<br>The various powers are interesting, and vary from straight up combat applications like psionic assault and shields to utility powers like slowing time or shrinking to the size of a small object (the better to squeeze through small openings with).  Gameplay often revolves around balancing various resources, including the raw materials that the player&apos;s weapons and ammo are made from.
<br>
<br>My one complaint is that the game doesn&apos;t do a very good job of explaining all of this.  I reloaded an early save about 6 hours in, and discovered that taking the Recycling Expert, Toughness, and Necropsy mods reduced the difficulty from what felt like Very Hard back to Normal, without changing the game&apos;s actual difficulty slider.  The game&apos;s early instructions to &quot;play your way,&quot; misled me on the viability of taking the mods I wanted from the getgo.  The only reason I can see to not take Recycling Expert and Toughness are for the challenge inherent in not taking them; it&apos;s not really &quot;play your way,&quot; if there are certain must-have abilities, but this is ultimately a small nitpick.
<br>
<br>I really enjoyed the story.  Again, I&apos;m reminded of BioShock.  We start right off with a twist that&apos;s a good way to illustrate the side effects of neuromods.  The story clarifies and then obfuscates against several times over a playthrough.  And there is a stinger after the credits that would make Marvel comics jealous.  The setting is also very original.  I likened it to Dead Space, but it has a lot more flair than that, with the player slowly discovering the twists and turns of Prey&apos;s alternate history; a world where the Space Race never really ended.  Also the game is surprisingly progressive, very reminiscent of Star Trek&apos;s vision of the future--I&apos;ve never seen *any* media property that made a chapter revolve around a queer Asian couple, and Prey really makes you like them--they&apos;re nerds, and they&apos;re adorable.  It&apos;s the little touches like that that make this game feel more vibrant than Dead Space.  While Dead Space was a pessimistic vision of the future, Prey is more of a cautionary tale of optimistic arrogance.  All of that does a great job of complimenting the game&apos;s central moral dilemma, which ultimately boils down to whether you&apos;re willing to risk humanity&apos;s present in exchange for a brighter future.
<br>
<br>My first few hours were a bit frustrating, and I see a lot of comments around the internet about how this game is too hard.  It&apos;s not; it&apos;s too poorly explained.  That&apos;s really the worst thing I can say about it.
<br>
<br>Comparisons to BioShock (and their common ancestor, System Shock 2) aside, this is a game I haven&apos;t seen anything like for some time.  I enjoyed my time with Prey, and will likely play through it again to see the other options and tie up some unfinished side quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7445294">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is very interesting and it&apos;s told well, with great voice work from top to bottom, Prey also has multiple endings so replayability is an option if you like to get your monies worth. The general audio is also very good, helping to create a creepy atmosphere. Gameplay wise it&apos;s solid, there are plenty of weapons and gadgets to dispose of the Typhoon and I really liked the recycle and re-purpose mechanic. Visually it was also very good, with some great character models and environments. The one area it wasn&apos;t so great was performance, while definitely not bad at all it wasn&apos;t always smooth, some areas dropped for no apparent reason and there was some hitching at times, but nothing that ruined the overall experience too badly. Overall a solid package.
<br>
<br>One bit of advice is to take it slow, don&apos;t rush through the main story, there are many minor and major side plots to discover and I missed almost all of them on my first run, don&apos;t make the same mistake</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7334068">Expand</a></span>

It feels polished, gameplay is solid. There are different build available for your character (hence multiple playthroughs). The area where the game takes place is very original and looks well designed. I&apos;ve been playing video games for more than 20 years now, I recommend this game.</span>

The play-your-way mechanics, skill based upgrades, weapon wheel, and overall aesthetic design that made the Dishonored series so great makes a nearly perfect transition to Prey, minus the implementation of a crafting system. I personally enjoy when developers add a crafting element into their games, however Arcane has not done a good job of balancing the crafting mechanics with the rest of the gameplay. The issue is that crafting is too critical to gameplay while being very unrewarding.  It forces the player to spend too much time worrying about the minuscule amount of crafting materials found in the world just for the option to craft the small amount of supplies actually created by the crafting process. I understand that the developers were forcing players to manage their supplies, however this forces players into a fairly specific method of tacking objectives and enemies in a game that touts a play-your-way style of gameplay. Yes, the game can be tackled in a stealth-centric style while using the minimal amount of resources, however early in the game this is nearly impossible and it disregards players who do not prefer a head on style of gameplay over stealth. Arcane could rectify this by making crafting materials more abundant, especially for materials dropped by defeated enemies. This way players who prefer stealth can still make their way through the game using little resourcing a minimal crafting, while giving more combat focused players the chance to play the game the way they wish.
<br>
<br>Outside of this, Prey is nearly flawless. Gameplay is fun and engaging, enemies are difficult but not too difficult, the story is good, and the environment is gorgeous. Prey also does a very good job of making the game as non-linear as possible. The main story certainly has a liner plot, however players can chose when they wish to tackle main objectives and are more or less free to roam the game world as they please (assuming those areas are unlocked).
<br>
<br>I completely recommend that anyone who has played and enjoyed the Dishonored series or Dark Messiah to purchase Prey. The familiar Arcane Studios formula does not disappoint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7327677">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons
<br>- No FOV slider (but patch is allegedly in the works and .ini alteration allows FOV changes).
<br>- Loading times can be a bit excessive when moving between different areas but the quality of the gameplay itself far, far outweighs this as a negative.

Why did not the IGM score change by 8 points?</span>

This Sci-fi shooter manages to combine an enthralling story with outstanding game-play mechanics and design. The genius level design in Prey makes simply getting inside a locked room feel more like an sexual endeavor, rather than a tedious janitorial task. The only hint of mediocrity is the somewhat repetitive combat and decent AI. Regarding performance, Prey is beautifully optimized. A decent computer will run this game faster than Jerry the mouse on cocaine. I would assume a decent computer averaging around 55fps. In conclusion, Prey is an all-around excellent game that will have you exploring Talos-1 like a curious space cockroach.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7305671">Expand</a></span>

<br>Whilst I have experienced a crash or 2 on PC, it&apos;s few and far between. The game is pretty stable, especially after the Dishonored 2 disaster (which I still completed twice despite the crashes). The game is also beautiful, stunning environments.

<br>I&apos;d highly reccomend picking it up.

If you pay close attention from the very start (and I mean really close) you can tell something is up the entire time, but if you run through thinking this is a normal shooter you&apos;ll be disappointed. While I do dislike the lack of aim-down-sights it&apos;s not one of those games that needs it (think Bioshock) due to the powers you can unlock right after the intro (provided you don&apos;t go muck about and ignore the story). For best results play up till you find the psychoscope then feel free to explore as it helps unlock your entire arsenal. The only bad thing I can think would be the facial animations and lip-syncing, but I&apos;m not the biggest fan of Arkane&apos;s art direction. Over all this game is an 8 from me, but the ending felt a bit rushed and leaves you with many questions that it only briefly explains.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7321701">Expand</a></span>

<br>Prey is a pretty good adventure and a pretty bad shooter. As the lack of ironsights already suggests, conventional weapons are just one way to disable or kill enemies. It&apos;s as legitimate as the use of vending machines, hacking, nerf guns, enviroment or your old friend the explosive barrel.
<br>
<br>Graphics are mediocre but the atmosphere is spot on. No stylistic minimalism and holographic space magic but good old hard sci-fi with a huge portion of art deco. The comparisons to Bioshock are pretty legit if it comes to the art style.
<br>
<br>What made the game for me was the freedom. Before the main story even took off i explored the place for hours and powered my character up with some items i&apos;m pretty sure where supposed to be not accessible for most of the people until a few more hours in. But you can absolutly get them if you put in the time and effort. It makes for a great feeling of progress and building up your character.
<br>
<br>In the end, if Prey is for you depends mainly on the question if you&apos;re looking for a shooter or an exploration game with strong emphasis on character development (in terms of gameplay). Get it for the latter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7281989">Expand</a></span>

<br>I walk through the game and I feel so paranoid. Great gameplay (weapons etc.), interesting story a nice graphic. It is like Bishock a System Shock had a baby.
<br>
<br>And best in the end? Greatly optimized. FullHD with all on max. And i have stable 60 fps.</span>

I was correct in assuming that.)</span>

Graphics kinda look like past-gen, but the game runs absolutely great on pc, so i guess many players would put performance and gameplay (which is absolutely great here) over shiny graphics.</span>

<br>Everything in Prey is really detailed similar to Crysis 2 but the Characters and Monsters themselves are ugly.
<br>
<br>Game&apos;s content: 3/5
<br>It&apos;s annoying that they made to many transition to move from place to place. And it take much time for loading screens.
<br>The &quot;Finding people&quot; missions seem to be excessive because no one there when I came to right place. The other missions are not interested. The guide icons is like a mesh because they made me lost.
<br>Weapon system is like Half Life, not various and few. Character&apos;s abilities are interested only with Mimic&apos;s Transformation.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Prey 2017 is a Open Room game because all you have to focus is finding key to open the rooms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7314184">Expand</a></span>

The creatures are unique in the way they can mimic stuff around you even though there may at times feel like a lack of enemy types. The space station you are on is also very real feeling and enjoyable to explore. Not really to much I can say that hurts this game, definitely worth a buy on steam, you can always return if you don&apos;t like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7281331">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Great movement controls.
<br>+ Great combat that requires combination of weapons to defeat enemies.
<br>+ UI is nice and sleek.
<br>Design = 9/10
<br>+ Level design has the typical Arkane magic of offering you multiple routes through an area be it sneaking or head on attack.
<br>+ The environment is fun to manipulate as you pull enemies towards flammable pipes or broken electric panels.
<br>+ Returning to levels: I liked that I was encouraged to unlock a skill like hacking or strength before I could access a room.
<br>Story = 9/10
<br>+ While the main story can feel a little lacklustre at times it does a good job of moving you from level to level where smaller unique areas offer more in-depth parts of the world of Prey.
<br>+ I also loved the side stories in this game and are what I remember most now I&#x2019;ve completed it.
<br>Graphics = 9/10
<br>+ I like the art style that Arkane have been going with since Dishonored and hope they stick with it as I feel it is their unique style now.
<br>+ I love the 60&apos;s esque theme they&apos;ve gone with although some seem to find it a jarring mix.
<br>+ Hasn&apos;t been too demanding on my ageing system and ran at a constant 60fps no problem.
<br>Sound = 9/10
<br>+ Prey has a limited yet good soundtrack that captures that horror sci-fi feel.
<br>+ All the voice acting is great and I love that they got Benedict Wong to voice the brother and James Hong the father.
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>- Enemy variety was limited to about 6, but with different element variations of them, which meant that once you knew their move set and weaknesses they became very easy.
<br>- Loading times: in the early to mid-game this isn&apos;t a problem when moving between levels as you want to fully explore them, but in the late game when you have to move through 2-3 levels for an objective quickly it can be annoying waiting 30-60 seconds for a level to load that you would run through in about 20 seconds having already completed 100%.
<br>- The space sections of the game while fun at first became annoying and overstayed its welcome as movement and enemies outside could be frustrating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7292238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I really wish I would have got it right away so I could play more of it over the weekend.  Amazing game.</span>

You wake up in your apartment as Morgan Yu, who can be male or female. The game then lets you (Yu?) mess around in your loft, which allows you to understand some of the basic mechanics like manipulating objects and learning how to operate the in-game computers. You then board a helicopter on your way to see your brother who, like you, works for the Transtar Corporation. Next, you take a couple of tests that teach Yu more mechanics in the game. After all of that is done, things start to get interesting as you soon realize everything is not what it seems.
<br>
<br>After the opening you find out that aliens known as Typhon have escaped onto the Talos I space station, which is where you are currently located. A mysterious stranger then helps you escape your simulation, the game opens up, and you are then introduced to one of the main mechanics of the game: neuromods. Essentially, neuromods are collectible skill points that you can use to upgrade Morgan&#x2019;s abilities. These allow him or her to move faster and quieter, hack machines, and increase your health. You are also get to meet one of the main Typhon enemies: the mimic.
<br>
<br>Mimics are one of the most common aliens you can encounter in the game, and by themselves they do not pose much of a threat. However, they possess the ability to shapeshift into other objects, which allows them to camouflage themselves in plain sight. This creates a building tension as you soon realize that any object in any room on the station could potentially kill you. This tension is also helped by the fact that the mimic&#x2019;s AI is programmed so that most mimics will randomly choose an object to copy. This means that enemy locations and the items they copy will be different for every playthrough, which I thought was really cool!
<br>
<br>The other aliens are varied and creative as well. The phantoms, the next most common enemy, were numerous and came in many different flavors. Other enemies like mind controlled humans and robots also felt unique and unexpected. While not as terrifying as necromorphs, the Typhon are certainly creeping and dangerous.
<br>
<br>A mechanic worth mentioning at this point is the crafting and recycling. Morgan can collect various trash objects to destroy and get crafting materials in return (think of it as Fallout 4&#x2019;s base building system). You can then obtain fabrication plans to create various objects from guns and ammo to more neuromods. This allows the player to determine what resources are the most important to invest into, and I simply adored this aspect. It just feels so immersive and unique, allowing players to play their own way!
<br>
<br>Moving on, the game also has great weapons. The wrench is a fine starting weapon, and hitting enemies with it always felt satisfying. The pistol, shotgun, and stun gun were standard fare, but good weapons. These guns, like the wrench, always felt satisfying to shoot and handle. The more unique weapons however allowed for more complex and creative gameplay. Recycler charges allow the players to destroy everything in a short radius and return crafting materials, while other throwable weapons prevented alien abilities from activating or disabled electronics. The GLOO gun allows players to freeze enemies in place temporarily and create platforms for traversing the station. The Q-BEAM on the other hand fired a beam that would eventually cause Typhon to explode, which left me with a smile (and Typhon remains) on my face.
<br>
<br>Now, there are alien powers that Morgan can acquire around a quarter into the game. By researching certain Typhon, you can gain skills that are obtained and upgraded by neuromods. These include kinetic blasts to mimicry, which all seemed very fun and unique. The catch with these powers is that the automated security on the station will attack you (Yu?) on sight because you contain alien material in your system now. Personally, I chose to keep my humanity and obtained none of the powers. Even without the awesome powers, the game still felt complete and fun. I can guarantee though that on my next playthrough I will be using the alien powers to their full potential.
<br>
<br>The enemies normally felt fair and balanced, and I never felt like I died and did not deserve it. I did however notice that some enemies felt like they took more damage than I felt was necessary. It was occasionally annoying, but not a big deal at all.
<br>
<br>Another flaw I have with the game is using a controller. I tried the demo on my PS4 and I struggled to use the controller properly. I can confirm though that the mouse and keyboard works fabulously. I just can&#x2019;t recommend the use of a controller.
<br>
<br>My final gripe is that the resources felt unbalanced. In the beginning, I felt like I had plenty of ammo for all of my guns but I figured that would change quickly. However, during the course of the game my thoughts on ammo never really changed even though I was playing on the hardest difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7286922">Expand</a></span>

Although it doesn&apos;t quite match games like the original bioshock story wise, it more than makes up for it with slick visuals and engaging gameplay. Its like alien isolation had a baby with system shock 2. Definitely glad I picked it up.</span>

This is all while the apparent bottleneck from my tiny (2017 razer blade stealth with Kaby lake, 16Mb ram) laptop is causing a drop in FPS from what i would normally get with a 1080 in a desktop. Those numbers remained stable for the most part for the three + hours that i had a chance to run though last night.
<br>I have to say that i am very impressed with this game, without spoiling much I think any FPS fan of games like HL, FEAR, or even the newer Deus Ex&apos;s will find a lot to like in this game. The perks are really reminiscent of the of the latter but the sound, one of my favorite aspects of this game, really reminds me of the former. For what its worth, the variations in the perk system alone are enough to have me thinking that the Deus Ex Mankind divided team could have learned something from these guys. I was never a huge fan of Dishonored 2&apos;s art style but am happy to say that the Cry engine really pulls though here and give off an entirely different feel. That being said, this is not recognizable sequel to the previous Prey installations. The first two hours throw some very heavy, mind bending/reality checking things at you that may require another run to fully appreciate. Much like the first Prey, the emphasis is on forcing you to feel from the perspective of the character straight from the opening cinematic, which will give you varying feeling of daja vu depending on how far into the first hour your are. While the intro had me worried we were going down a very familiar path, the immediate left and right turns you make after fully erased any of those feelings. There are little chunks of great FPS games from the half-life-like sound of the test area malfunctioning, to the FEAR like weightiness of the preorder shotgun you get in your office; it all feels very well put together and best of all well balanced. Weapons (at least the GOO and shotty) have some fantastic animations and, so far, it seems as though the weapons are a bit on the lighter side when in relation to your enemy&apos;s. Speaking of the enemys, prepare to start doubting every damn item your looking to pick up. The name Mimic goes very far here. I wont go too far into this short review but long story short, using the GLOO gun and THEN the wrench makes it a much more effective combo since your effectively dealing with black GACK. I&apos;m going to end this review here (unless someone requests that i continue) since i need to continue playing before i give it a final score. Up until this moment which is around the three hour mark, i will have to give this a 8.5/10 just for the fantastic game play. Any one doubting whether to get this game or not, please do yourself a favor and GET IT!

The creatures are unique in the way they can mimic stuff around you even though there may at times feel like a lack of enemy types. The space station you are on is also very real feeling and enjoyable to explore. Not really to much I can say that hurts this game, definitely worth a buy on steam, you can always return if you don&apos;t like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7280627">Expand</a></span>

A nice mix of shootem, puzzle solving a la Zelda, nice story, powers to unlock, weapons to upgrade, stuff to rycicle in order to craft other stuff... Lot of exploration, and so many nice touches.
<br>One of the best game of this year.</span>

<br>Graphically... well, the game lookes like x360 tittle with bumped up resolution - i play at 1440p. It wouldn&apos;t be a problem, if the game had superb gameplay. I liked the sound though, as it creates good atmosphere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7308352">Expand</a></span>

<br>Do yourself a favor and play this game. In this day an age when, with few exceptions, most games are an online mediocre affair, games like this are a rarity. And game developing studios like Arkane Studios are a rarity.
<br>I&apos;m not going too much into the details. It would spoil the fun. But all the elements that are essential are there. Game level design, atmosphere, immersion, attention to detail, etc, they are all there in droves.
<br>At the end of the day, this game reminds us of a simple fact. If you want something great, hire people who love doing what they are doing and stop being obsessed by the bottom line. Greatness it&apos;s elusive anyway. Has always been. So stop worrying about it.
<br>Hats off to Bethesda. And Arkane Studios.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7306944">Expand</a></span>

Too much time is wasted finding keycards and passcodes. I&apos;m not even going to comment on the hacking minigames. The story and ending are a bit weak too and predicable.

<br>++ Music - she&apos;s amazing, never boring, always in theme;
<br>++ Crafting - very nicely done, and the processing resources;
<br>++ Skills - they are all useful, useless as such without;
<br>++ Dynamic battles, even if 1 on 1 with a small enemy;
<br>++ The possibility of passing in the same place in completely different ways;
<br>++ Some game moments that make you wince, for example, enemy jumps sharply, in addition, this is accompanied by loud sound));
<br>++ Respect for Arkane Studios! Yeah, it&apos;s my personal factor.
<br>Cons:
<br>-- Interface, 90% of the game Dishonored 2 interface;
<br>-- The monotony of locations;
<br>-- lots of enemies, here he is almost 1, well a maximum of 3 sometimes... But hence the advantages no need to learn a lot of tactics, almost no damage to finish fights;
<br>-- Shotgun for pre-order is so poor, that a wrench is better... Yes, he is able to knockdown enemies, but it&apos;s damage is terrible.
<br>
<br>Well, I suggest the game to all, especially fans of the genre, here has something interesting to occupy the time)

<br>From Fun and Scary to Slow and Boring
<br>Prey is a first person survival horror game that seems to be heavily inspired by deus ex&#x2026;
<br>you start the game by choosing your male or female character&#x2026;
<br>You&#x2019;re an experiment... and then things go wrong... the space station you&#x2019;re living in has been overrun by aliens and guess who they&#x2019;re after?
<br>You of course&#x2026;
<br>The game starts out pretty interesting and terrifying...
<br>There are mimics around&#x2026;
<br>this is all you know
<br>and at first all you have to fend for yourself is a wrench...
<br>And these mimics... they can be anywhere&#x2026;
<br>as they take the shape of random items in the world&#x2026;
<br>Randomly running into them was terrifying and made for many great jump scare moments&#x2026;
<br>honestly a wrench and mimics is all this game needed it&#x2026; but it didn&#x2019;t stop there&#x2026;
<br>it tried to do too much and they game becomes a boring drag because of it..
<br>This game reminded me a bit of deus ex and bioshock&#x2026;
<br>mostly on the deus ex side though&#x2026;
<br>There are neuromods around the world that you can pick up to unlock new skills
<br>these skills include the basics like being able to lift large objects, increase your health, or be able to hack locked doors&#x2026;
<br>and you have to choose carefully because these skills are expensive and neuromods practically hardly exist compared to the prices&#x2026;
<br>made even more ridiculous when you unlock even more mimic type skills from scanning enemies later on in the game.. it&#x2019;s just too much for how little the game pays out&#x2026;
<br>Speaking of too little to go around&#x2026;
<br>health, and pretty much everything else&#x2026;
<br>It doesn&#x2019;t matter which difficulty you play this game on.. It&#x2019;s going to be brutal&#x2026;
<br>enemies are sponges even against fully upgraded guns... they do insane damage&#x2026;
<br>And the food you find around only gives about 5 health... which is nothing... med kits are extremely rare&#x2026;. And your health only regenerates to around 30&#x2026;
<br>so you&#x2019;re gonna die a lot&#x2026;
<br>you can recycle trash at machines for materials or use recycle bombs for materials and then use these materials to craft medkits and ammo.. But still... these items aren&#x2019;t all over the place and doesn&#x2019;t necessarily make med kits or ammo extremely accessible... they&#x2019;re still rare even with this crafting machine
<br>No worries you can just stealth around enemies&#x2026;
<br>sort of&#x2026;
<br>because they have magnets in their head&#x2026;
<br>the game tricks you into believing they&#x2019;re attracted to noise because of certain lure bombs you can use
<br>but this is a lie&#x2026; I know this is a lie because there&#x2019;s one mission in particular where you have to collect voice samples&#x2026; one part of this mission challenges you to stay alive while a song plays.. After hiding in the room and failed I thought okay, clearly these enemies are attracted to the noise... ill click play and run down the hall and hide away from the room&#x2026;
<br>I did this and guess which room the enemies came to?
<br>Not the one with the song playing... the one I was in just sitting there waiting for me to enter their line of sight to they could attack me&#x2026;
<br>and this waiting happens a lot... they won&#x2019;t move, they will sit and wait until they can see you
<br>it&#x2019;s annoying and emersion breaking
<br>This game has its moments&#x2026;
<br>its surprisingly varied considering you&#x2019;re stuck in a space station&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s fun and thrilling at times running from enemies while you try to find key cards and information to progress&#x2026;
<br>But it&#x2019;s also just as annoying since the game is inconsistent with telling you where to go to progress&#x2026;
<br>sometimes your location is marked on the map.. sometimes you have to just feel your way around and search everything while dealing with monsters&#x2026;
<br>The game also have a few progression bugs that will cause you to back in and out of a save..
<br>Which isn&#x2019;t too bad since you can save at anytime youd like&#x2026;
<br>As well as performance issues if you play too long..
<br>the inventory and weapon wheels start to lag&#x2026;
<br>Bugs aside, Prey ultimately suffers from imbalance&#x2026;
<br>There are far too few materials, health, or ammo for how spongy and excessive enemies are in this game..
<br>they become a nuisance instead of a scare&#x2026;
<br>I could easily see this being a game of uncertainty with only a flashlight, a wrench, and some mimics&#x2026;
<br>But instead Prey sets out to frustrate you for 16 hours&#x2026;
its becomes die and try again to get just a little luckier this time while dealing with over powered monsters&#x2026;
While I definitely did enjoy moments of prey&#x2026;
I didn&#x2019;t enjoy most of the moments of prey&#x2026;
I give Prey
a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7284384">Expand</a></span>

Prey is a bad fu**ing game. its boring, frustrating and very confusing at the same time. There are two sides of Bethesda Softworks in my eyes. There&apos;s the side I love, which will keep me playing for months or even years such as doom and fallout, and than there the disappointing side of Bethesda that I will play for a few hours and be done such as with Elder Scrolls Online. This game is neither of these. It is worst. I expected this game to be full of fun and complex puzzles like breath of the wild, and some of those breathtaking and satisfying kill streaks from doom, but all it is, is another pile of garbage. The only good thing about this game are the weapon customisation, which deserve some credit. But it gets old pretty fast and its not as good as fallout customisation. That&apos;s what I also expected from this game, but no way. it is also feels like another one of these COD disappointments with too much futuristic designs and settings. LEAVE THAT TO HALO. AND LEAVE THIS GAME ALONE!! And don&apos;t even get me started with all the bugs and crashes I and you will most likely face on the PC version, at least on console it is &apos;decently polished&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7305384">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ the visuals and music are on par with the rest
<br>+ voice acting is good
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t see any negatives yet. I am forcingmyself to go to bed now and not spend another 10 hrs exploring the station.
