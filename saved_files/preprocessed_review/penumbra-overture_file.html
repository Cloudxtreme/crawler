I&apos;m not scared by anything unless it&apos;s a real-life situation threatening the life of either me or one or more of my loved ones, and even if it were me, I&apos;d probably still act pretty smug. Penumbra: Overture, however, is the first game to ever scare me, and shitless at that. What the developers did and did correctly is that amazing sense of vulnerability, that, with the help of controls that allow you to lean around corners, makes you not want to lean around corners to see what evil awaits. The greatest thing is that there aren&apos;t any technological modifications to the game to make the player feel vulnerable, such as Dead Space&apos;s sluggish controls and camera angle. There is a deficiency in the ability to use weapons, which had many FPS-crazies with their nuts in a knot, but this, however, was justified by the developers by the fact that you&apos;re a skinny English professor and probably can&apos;t wield a pickaxe for shit. The weapons in the game were designed to be used as a last resort and the player&apos;s main defense should be to hide in the shadows. I will not lie that it can be very buggy for some people, but for a group of four people, their tech support is amazingly reliable at their forums. Buy the whole package on Steam or something. It&apos;s amazingly cheap and while a bit short, it is an experience you will not soon forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=735089">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a special horror in this game, not at all as in F.E.A.R where you feel safe in that armor of yours. This horror gets in your brain and scares you in a psychological way which is freaky.

<br>I wasn&apos;t really a big fan of the monsters, at least the dogs which looked like some kind of halloween pinata and the spiders which looked equally as comical, but it could have been worse. I didn&apos;t mind the combat as much as most people, but I understand that what they were trying to do with it ultimately failed.
<br>The goal, obviously, was to make the combat cumbersome and difficult to make encounters all the more frightening, but unfortunately it just came off as frustrating and tedious. Luckily the developers took this on board and removed it completely from the next title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115483">Expand</a></span>

<br>All in all...I played 3/4 to 7/8 of this game and didn&apos;t want to bother finishing. I used walkthroughs to get to the end, and it wasn&apos;t satisfying at all (would have been more frustrating without walkthroughs).
<br>
<br>I do plan to play the later editions in the series though. It was compelling and interesting if outdated and flawed.

It has a very interesting setting, and it does a fairly good job of establishing a feeling of extreme isolation in a long-abandoned facility, buried beneath a frozen and remote corner of the earth. I also really want to like the game for its eerie use of the glowstick/flashlight mechanics, ensuring that you are always just blind enough to be slightly creeped out by the dark. HOWEVER. All of that being said, I did not find this game &quot;scary&quot; in the least. It certainly makes you nervous, but not due to any well-established feeling of horror or the unknown. All of the stress in the game comes from hearing a &quot;monster&quot; (i.e., an ordinary wolf) prowling in the caves and knowing that the combat mechanic is so god awful that if you get spotted you might actually have to use the retarded thing. (Seriously. It&apos;s pretty bad.) The game is a bit more scary at first, when you&apos;re sneaking through the dark, unsure of what might be hiding there. But once you play for a while and realize that it&apos;s nothing but wolf, wolf, another wolf, and a wolf again, the fear of the unknown is gone and all you&apos;re left with is a series of very clunky memorize-the-patrol-pattern situations. Despite the fact that I did not find the stealth nor the combat fun, and despite the fact that the game did not feel scary to me, I continued to play it, because I enjoyed unlocking the mystery of the setting, and I enjoyed solving the puzzles. But the longer I played, the less intuitive the game became, putting me in situations where I would die repeatedly for failing to identify and solve problems at a frenetic pace. The game is also peppered with bugs and clipping problems. Eventually, tonight, after playing the game for an hour, a hallway inexplicably dropped me through the floor. I didn&apos;t/couldn&apos;t die, which would have restarted me at the last checkpoint or the door of the current room. All I could do was reload the last manual save at an artefact, which lost all of my progress. I would say give the game a try if you can get it for CHEAP. This game is definitely going to be enjoyable for the right kind of person, looking for a particular atmospheric experience, willing to overlook the game&apos;s almost constant imperfections---if not outright brokenness. I am just not one of those people. I can see how it could be fun to someone, but I just did not have fun playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=1772105">Expand</a></span>

First, the positives. It&apos;s very atmospheric; the environments are creepy &amp; unnerving and the first encounter with an enemy is unforgettable. Certain plot elements are well done and the character of Red is memorable. The physics system is just as clever as ever, perhaps even more so than Amnesia thanks to the more grounded setting and difficulty in using doors. Negatives: combat. The problem with the combat isn&apos;t that it&apos;s sticky or useless, it&apos;s because it&apos;s there! Something that&apos;s scary loses its sting when you can kill it, and fighting in this game you will inevitably find the exploit to easily deal with any enemy you encounter. The plot also relies too much on written notes and your character pointing out the obvious. I wish FG would decide if they want Phillip to be a silent protagonist or not: he goes through a long monologue at the beginning and then seems to lose his voice once the game begins, even when a particular character tries to contact him he still says nothing. Overall though, I liked Overture, and if you&apos;re looking for a good spook then I definitely recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=2486554">Expand</a></span>

The protagonist is, for example, only ever capable of doing one thing at a time. Say you want to pick up a chair or similar debris to barricade a door. Doing so reduces your movement speed to a crawl, and makes you unable to jump. The same applies to virtually ever object bigger than about 15 cube inches. I&apos;m pretty sure that in real life, I could lift a rock the size of an ostrich egg without having to drag it behind me at snail&apos;s pace. None of this is helped by the awkward interface or the broken physics engine. To interact with something, you click on it and move the mouse, so, for instance, to open a desk draw, you&apos;d click on it and pull the mouse back to pull it open. It&apos;s pretty cool when it works, but it doesn&apos;t always, because obviously the game is 3D and the mouse plane isn&apos;t, so having the same control for &apos;move down&apos; and &apos;move back&apos; can be frustrating at times. As well as thinking everything it 4 times heavier than it should be, the physics engine clearly uses a lot of shortcuts: take the example near the start where the game tells you to barricade a door: regardless of whether you haphazardly left a single chair in front of it or spent a couple of minutes stacking up barrels, the door and everything in front of it just explodes after a certain amount of time. The whole thing leaves you wondering why the game bothered to tell you to barricade the door when just running away has largely the same result. This brings me to the other option: combat. Say you have a pickaxe. To use it like a weapon, you have to interact with it in the same way as any other item; i.e. click, then move the mouse forward to raise it, pull it back to bring it down. I&apos;m trying not to stray into hyperbole here, but this is seriously retarded. I know the point of survival horror games is that you&apos;re not supposed to have an easy time in combat, but not being able to look around is beyond frustrating, especially when you&apos;re fighting zombie wolves (the first enemies of the game) which have a habit of jumping through you when they attack. Since you die in only three hits, if you miss then by the time you&apos;ve turned around and readied for another swing of your weapon, you&apos;re already dead. Of course, you can usually avoid combat. What you can&apos;t avoid, however, are the asinine &apos;puzzles&apos; the game throws at you. At one point, you need a 4-digit keycode to get to the next area. The code can be heard in morse code at a radio set. You&apos;d think there might be a leaflet or a poster lying around somewhere in the game area explaining how to decipher morse code, but no. Frictional apparently expected players to just know morse code off the top of their heads. Since I didn&apos;t work on a boat in the 1920s, this just leads to an unsatisfying check of the nearest walkthrough. There&apos;s another part close to that where you need to get through a door which is barred with a plank of wood. The door is made from iron bars, so quite why exactly you can&apos;t just reach through the bars and lift the bar up, I don&apos;t know. Also, this is a point in the game where you have the aforementioned pickaxe, which you&apos;d think could just smash this tiny plank. Nope. In fact, it&apos;s even immune to sticks of dynamite. So what you have to do is find the one rusty hacksaw in this enormous basement, which begs the question: why not just make so I had to find a key, rather than looking stupid with invincible planks of wood? Then, to get to the next part after that, you have to jump onto a ladder. Somehow, even this becomes a chore when this imbecile you&apos;re playing as won&apos;t grab on and is for some reason damaged by the 2-and-a-half foot drop when he misses. The next area is where I just gave up on the game: you&apos;re crawling around these cramped tunnels that are full of spider eggs, which can apparently sense when someone walks past 15 feet away and instantly hatch. Much like the wolves, they have a tendency to jump through you and kill you in three hits, but this time they&apos;re far too numerous, small and fast to try hitting them with a weapon, so you have to shine your torch on them. The problem is, they&apos;re a bit slow off the mark, so if one of them is too close when you do that, it&apos;ll jump through you, and then there is nothing you can do to avoid dying. You&apos;re supposed to block off sections of the tunnel using conveniently shaped rocks, but trying to move boulders around slows you down even more than usual when you&apos;re crouched in a tunnel, so you more often than not end up being eaten while dragging them around. Eventually I just gave up in exasperation at this dissappointing, broken game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=2396884">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s nothing I like better than a good horror/survival game, even though this one has the ever-present Lovecraft references and familiar, hackneyed plot. 1-sided textures in a game and my flashlight not illuminating the crawlspace I am in almost lowered my SAN score immediately... I&apos;ll cross my fingers, do a little Voorish sign, and hope I can find the good things other posters have mentioned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=732627">Expand</a></span>

The first time I saw a wolf, I panicked and thought to myself  &quot;WTF IS THAT THING?!&quot; But after a while I noticed the plotline made no sense. Firstoff, after playing the later games the plot seemed to deviate more and more from the direction it originally headed: Finding your missing dad. Tons of the plot was left unexplained and I was really confused. Firstoff, the origins of these Foobar wolves was never explained. I guess they&apos;re like, turngait daemons or something... Secondly, making the player able to kill the enemies was, honestly, a bad idea. The wolves just aren&apos;t as scary when I can stand on a catwalk and toss propane tanks and rocks at them and they die. Another thing that I ran into that really annoyed me was that when I was searching for a cure for Clarence, I just found a bunch of items and tossed them into the machine. Later I came across the women who tells you how to make the cure, and now I had no way to make the cure. I literally had to start the game from my last save behind that, almost 3 hours ago. I know I&apos;m judging the game by it&apos;s sequel, but I don&apos;t really care. Buy the first one for a thrill, and stop there. Wiki the plotline and go back to your life. Black Plague and Requiem aren&apos;t worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=2110937">Expand</a></span>

Cons: The &quot;combat&quot; interface is terrible (though I suspect it may be on purpose to encourage running rather than fighting) and a few of the puzzles are more repetitive than necessary.

You feel a real sense of isolation, and the ambient sound is excellent. What little music there is reminds me of Silent Hill&apos;s selections. The physics and lighting are wonderful, and, in fact, without those things, the visuals would be 1997-era. The monster animations are not good at all, and are best left unseen. The good news is, you shouldn&apos;t be spending much time staring at the creatures. The overall darkness of the game hides its sins well, and, in fact, the brighter certain sections of the game are, the less interesting it becomes. The combat system has been mentioned before- it&apos;s effectively worthless, don&apos;t fight anything. On one level, I see this as an intentional design choice, but on the other, it seems like the game was altogether too tailored to the use of a Novint Falcon (but I wonder how much use even that would be!) It is so terrible that honestly I wish that the player had been left with no option to fight- it would have been far better for the game. Again, if you&apos;re doing it right, you shouldn&apos;t be fighting (I solved most fighting related situations by throwing things and running.) Even despite all of that, I haven&apos;t had so much fun with an adventure game since Zork Nemesis! It is strange to say that a game with so many problems is worthwhile, but if you really like adventure games, you will be able to look past them. If the adventure game mindset does not appeal to you, this game is not even worth 5 dollars on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=732718">Expand</a></span>

For the longest time, I was convinced that nothing could ever scare me again unless it was real life or death situations. Then I played Penumbra. I&apos;m not even halfway through the game yet and I have to say it is purely terrifying, thought provoking and a challenging-but-not-impossible puzzle adventure game. Straight up the game only has two things going against it; the step-backwards graphics and the terribly clumsy combat system. The good heavily outweighs the bad, however. The game is practically in perpetual darkness the whole time so often the low-grade graphics are hidden well, and ironically the lighting in the game is incredible. As a puzzle/adventure game, it is certainly well done. It will challenge you to think, but it won&apos;t leave you going to an online walkthrough every five minutes. The clearest advantage this game has in the puzzle department is it&apos;s excellent physics engine, the HPL. Coincidence that those are the initials of H.P Lovecraft? I think not. But let&apos;s face it, what is the real reason we all got this game? To scare ourselves silly, and that&apos;s where this game really earns it&apos;s stars and stripes. This game had me spooked from the get-go. I was already feeling somewhat reluctant leaving the boat knowing the darkness that surely awaited me and man, was I right. This game is the first to ever have me scream &quot;HOLY SHIT&quot; at the top of my lungs. I play this game in small doses, so for me I&apos;m not worried by the apparent shortness of the game. Really I don&apos;t know how you could play the game through one sitting and not be a jibbering wreck by the end of it. My advice to you on Penumbra? If you&apos;re a fan of horror or even just someone looking for a game that&apos;s more an experience then it is an action-thrill-fest, then get these games. Especially with the sales that mean you can bag them both for a mere 5 or ten dollars each. At that price even if somehow you don&apos;t like it, you will have not dug yourself a financial grave.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=734395">Expand</a></span>

The physics engine is okay, with some flaws here and there, but nothing worth seriously complaining about. The moving of objects and melee actions can take getting used to, but once you&apos;re comfortable with the physics engine, it works okay, although far from perfectly. The game flows through the story smoothly without any frustration or senseless puzzles/problems to be solved. Everything is logical and upfront, requiring a realistic approach and a reasonable amount of thinking to proceed. The save system is unfriendly. It seems to save your progress when you update your personal notes, or when you interact with a certain object within the game world, which the player has little control over when this occurs. This means that you will often have to do certain portions of the game over and over until you get it right. The voice acting is superb. The accent and tone are outstanding and adds to the storyline greatly. All of the texts you will encounter in the game are well written, interesting, and adds plenty to the plot. The controls can be awkward at times in order to accomplish some actions the game requires. Penumbra: Overture is not a scary horror game. Most of its interesting emotional influences on the player comes from the theme of being almost completely solitary in an unknown place that is far from civilization and darkness. There are some instances in the game that requires the rapid change of items in conjunction to platforming and running, which I had to do many times to get it right. There is also a surprising amount of platforming as a whole for a primarily adventure game. Some parts of Penumbra: Overture are really cool, there is no denying that, but it does have a feel of an unpolished low budget title. With that said, this is probably one of the best adventure games I have ever played. It is logical and tense at all the right moments. I am not entirely sure for how long the main character is inside the mine, but the glow stick lasts for the entire duration of the game. You are not forced nor expected to use the flashlight nor the flares, which have finite longevity. I found melee fighting to be clunky and awkward, but this did not detract from the overall gaming experience. The ending is very creepy and will keep you glued to the plot, even though there is much left without explanations. The only major downside is the game&apos;s length. It is somewhat short and leaves you with a feeling of unfinished business with a cliffhanger. It took me about 8 hours to complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=2081693">Expand</a></span>

To horror is mainly due to physical threats but the story unfolds mysteries as well and thus adds a new layer to the experience. Short but good game.</span>

<br>
<br>Penumbra: Overture is not properly a game as we are used to play, is more like an immersion into deep abyss of horror and mystery.
<br>
<br>This is to say you are not buying this game for his gameplay, his longevity or his action.
<br>If you played Amnesia, Soma or the other Penumbra you know what I&apos;m meaning. If you don&apos;t, well think twice before buying it even if the price is low.
<br>Those kind of game are not much appreciated by the average gamer who looks for a couple or more hour of FUN.
<br>When you buy Penumbra you want to live a different experience, a journey into mistery and creepy stuff.
<br>It&apos;s quite short, graphic are still ok in my opinion if you don&apos;t mind too much (you don&apos;t really have to if you are wishing to play this graphic are the least thing to mind)
<br>
<br>When you finish it you feel that feeling of satisfaction as you survived a 7hrs trip into this game.
<br>It&apos;s something games like Fallout,Skyrim or whatever call of duty or battlefield could never give to you. Even if they might be good games, they are nothing in terms of deepness and peculiarity.
<br>
<br>TL DR:
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>-Atmosphere, deepness, peculiarity, horror. You really are yourself as a normal human being would, trying to escape from a mine, you don&apos;t fight unless if really you have to (and you will die trying), you don&apos;t have superpower. Only your mind and your notes. That&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>-Only English language, it&apos;s not a problem if you are reading this but there is a lot of stuff to read if you want to understand more the story, and even some dialogue with the only human (?) you &quot;meet&quot; are quite hard to follow because it&apos;s not a simple english. I really had some problems too as is not my mother tongue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=6432961">Expand</a></span>

Add to it the danger of monsters and an inventory system that entices you to explore every dark corner and you&apos;ve got a solid game.  I enjoyed Penumbra: Overture and would recommend it!</span>

<br>The game has clever puzzles, interesting characters, and a great story. It may not be that scary, but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere is pretty good for a survival horror game, and area in which you can explore is pretty big. Overall, this game is pretty good, but what about the bad parts? Well, the game is short, the notes you collect through out the game can sometimes be a bit confusing, and the graphics aren&apos;t amazing. Although, for its time, the graphics aren&apos;t to bad. It&apos;s enough to live with, but not so bad that you&apos;ll quit playing the game instantly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=4002328">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anyway, the game is cool enough. First of all, keep in mind that this is a Chapter. The game has no end, it is a cliffhanger ending so if you are one of those (like me) that hate unfinished things, keep in mind that even if you don&apos;t like the game so much, you will have to play all three chapters (overture, black plague, requiem) to see the end of the story.
<br>
<br>This chapter is quite short (6 hours are enough). Puzzles are nice, physics serve well that purpose. Graphically it is pleasant. Sounds is also still good enough for today&apos;s standards and controls are interesting.

<br>So of course a lot like anyone else who knows about Frictional Games, the first one I came to now about was Amnesia: The Dark Decent. Not from pewdiepie, the obvious place to have heard about it from. I found out a bit later that they had an already other established series titled Penumbra. I bought Penumbra: Overtue a long while before I ever had the bravery to go near Amnesia, and so with it came my first ever REAL adventure into survival horror.
<br>
<br>The game spooked the ever loving **** out of me, but the good thing about it was, that I was actually eased into the settings of Fritcionals games by it. It was really scary yes, however, I was able to push forward almost always and never got to the point where I simply couldn&apos;t move forward from my fear. The game looks really good for what is technically a indie title, and the sound design is PERFECT for the setting, mechanical, yet some how creepy and off putting. The story is also a strong part of Overture, intentionally confusing and not completely filled in, yet enough information if given for there to be a real deep understanding of what you want to know over what is going on, and why the place you are in is in the state that it is. The game does a great job of making you feel isolated. And because of this, you really end up liking the character of Red, the only survivor down in the tunnels with you. Overall, Overture is an under appreciated game that deserves all the under rated credit that it gets. I absolutely loved it, and it only goes up from here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-overture/user-reviews?user_review_id=5168440">Expand</a></span>

Es un juego que te hace pasar miedo de verdad porque no llevas armas para defenderte, s&#xF3;lo un pico. Adem&#xE1;s tiene una historia que te intriga cada vez m&#xE1;s. Recomendado si est&#xE1;s cansado de juegos de terror con munici&#xF3;n de sobra y quieres pasar angustia.</span>
