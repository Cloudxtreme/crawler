The biggest flaws aside from graphics is the Mission Design and the Game Controls. The 3rd person game-play barely functions, and vehicles feel like bumper cars on ice. I purchased the game and would like to finish it but am finding the game generally unplayable.</span>

The missions make absolutely no sense at all and the gameplay, although fresh and interesting, really gets stale when they repeat the same mission types over and over again just with increasing difficulty. The graphics are decent but performance suffers on PC.</span>

<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>&#x2022; Randomly generated elements - This I only noticed when I died. So here&apos;s the breakdown. I get on a motorbike, ride over to a building, look around for a camera and start the hacking process. I eventually scan the entire mission area, picking up all of the enemies on my HUD. The man at the gate has explosives on him, so I hack that, he blows up, I move onto the next one. At some point, I am spotted, I get shot, and I die.
<br>
<br>So I reload. Suddenly, I&apos;m in a completely different place. I turn around, and I&apos;m stood next to a van. What happened to my bike?!?! Ok, so I hack into the camera, and... darn... I need to scout the area again, as they&apos;ve all come off of my HUD. Doing this twice gets boring... let alone if you die a lot. So I have everyone in my HUD, hack into the guy by the gate again without paying much attention, only to find out that he no longer carries grenades, but is now distracted by a text message. So yeah, the game randomly chooses these characters. This means that you can&apos;t learn by your mistakes, and each mission isn&apos;t unique. You&apos;re just fighting a random array each time.
<br>
<br>I should point out that this also is the same for some boss fights. The boss will suddenly spawn behind you and kill you, so you reload and take cover somewhere else. Finally, after the boss has finished saying his long LONG monologue for the 5th time, he spawns in again, somewhere random, and all your planning is to waste. Rinse and repeat. DULL!!!
<br>
<br>&#x2022; Controls - I&apos;m using a gamepad on my PC, so this might be different for others. For me, run is Right Trigger. The thing is, shoot is also right trigger... this starts getting confusing. Also, your character cannot jump on command. He can climb over small obstacles, but that&apos;s about it. If you press A, your character will take cover by a wall. Now, this may be my fault, but I&apos;m used to using A to run. So when I&apos;m attacked, I instinctively press A, and my character sticks to a wall, gets shot, dies... and see the point above for what happens next.
<br>
<br>&#x2022; Next Gen - This is NOT a next gen game. Nothing new is here. It looks worse than GTA5, in my opinion (which I also didn&apos;t care much for, I should add). I&apos;m playing on Ultra settings on my PC, and I&apos;m underwhelmed. When cars smash into things, whether they deform appears to be entirely random. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don&apos;t. You can&apos;t buy cars, as far as I can tell.
<br>
<br>I just feel as though this game is a poor man&apos;s GTA.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve just had to shelve it for a while, because I&apos;m fed up with it. My current mission is to chase down a van... however, when I start the mission, it spawns in a random location. I should point out that this is a main campaign mission. I&apos;m confused, because having a randomizing mission is more difficult to program than a pre-set mission. I can&apos;t see why on Earth they would do this intentionally. It means that I can&apos;t learn from my mistakes, and I can&apos;t plan a strategy. I just have to hope for the best each time.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve put quite a few hours into this... but I&apos;m not going to waste my time for much longer. I only wish I bought it on a console rather than digitally, as I can&apos;t sell it anymore... and oh, how I wish to be rid of it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4241975">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In other words, the low score is because the game brings nothing new to the table. Walk/run/drive around, shoot people, do random/disconnected side-missions, press a button whenever you&apos;re in the vicinity of a bridge, door, phone, grate, vent, sign (etc) to &quot;hack&quot; it. Oh, and the vehicle physics is horrible and makes you feel like Bambi on ice.
<br>
<br>It feels like someone tried to make a game, but couldn&apos;t quite decide if they wanted it to be GTA, Infamous or Assassins Creed. Then they realized they needed to make it unique, so they added &quot;hacking&quot;. True, not all hacking is as simple as clicking a single button. For some of it you actually have to play a mini-game where you, by clicking a single button, rotate breaker switches to lead electricity from A to B.
<br>
<br>Gimmicky, boring, and after haven given it three serious attempts (which have taken me about 5-6 hours into the game) I find absolutely nothing that makes me want to boot it up again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4248745">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m going to play the crap out of the campaign in this game, but once that&apos;s over it will have nothing to offer me and I will move on.
<br>
<br>I borrowed the game from a friend and that&apos;s how I&apos;m able to write this review. Otherwise, I will not be paying the $60 they are asking for it. I give it 6 months to be in the wally world $18 bin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4259643">Expand</a></span>

I mean, grab some AC free run and some GTA hijacking cars and there you go you have Watch Dog&apos;s game-play. The story: A hacker with martial arts, gun and free running training becomes a vigilante after a family member is killed. Whoa this must be the worst character creation I have ever seen, even worse the story, come on people, I have seen this story thousands of times, in comics, movies and games (Max Payne, Batman and The Punisher three examples with the exact same story). Pfff i could have used my 50 euros to light up a cigarette and still it would be more well used than buying this game....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4242954">Expand</a></span>

<br>This overhyped title promised us an unforgettable experience; instead we got a bugged game with a storyline full of fillers and clich&#xE9;s and boring side missions.
<br>Although this game has some very few redeeming moments (some story missions, cop chases), but their number is very little compared to the whole picture.</span>

<br>This game is complete crap. I will be upfront and honest because Ubisoft sold this game as the &quot;biggest next-gen title&quot; ever. They basically created a sandbox city and threw in redundent quests here and there. A lot of people have already mentioned sh** physics and and disappointing graphics so I will mention a few things a lot of people haven&apos;t said...
<br>
<br>There are so many inconsistencies with the story and the main character I don&apos;t know where to even begin. Clearly the game designers intended to create a &quot;good guy&quot;, yet in many missions he&apos;s on a terrorist rampage. The side missions will drive you absolutely NUTS. You gather money and spend time acquiring guns, yet in many missions, you will fail unless you specifically just &quot;knock out&quot; the bad guy. Are you kidding me?
<br>In one mission, you can hide from the cops by simply ducking in your car, yet in the rest of the game the cops magically know your position when they&apos;re looking for you. Even though you appear completely anonymous by the CTOS system.
<br>The city itself feels like a clockwork machine rather than a real life city. The pedestrians are generic, the UI drivers are probably the worse coded drivers ever who don&apos;t react to anything. Oh an explosion? No problem, I&apos;ll just calmly driver around it.
<br>I could actually go on a lot more, but unfortunately I&apos;ve wasted my time enough on this game. NOT RECOMMENDED.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4311491">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1 - YOU NEED UPLAY
<br>2 - IT DOES NOT WORK WITH AMD CARDS OR PROCESSORS.

<br>
<br>1) Shoot a civilian in the toe? DEAD. Run over his legs with a car? DEAD. Even their reactions to situations are always the same, always generic and disappointing.
<br>
<br>2) Anyone can shoot at you from vehicles. Police, criminals, they all shoot at you and can kill you from cars and even helicopters. And can you do the same? NO. You have to sit in your car and take it or drive away. Was it so hard to add this feature as well you lazy and boring developers?
<br>
<br>3) No using melee on anyone either. Only specific take downs, only on certain enemies. Why would you not add this simple feature when you have an awesome weapon, a BATON? Again, lazy development cannot be explained by the style of the game when it takes away fundamental freedoms a player should have.
<br>
<br>4) All the guns, available all the time, no need to buy ammo ever either. You can basically walk around carrying more than 20 guns plus all types of other equipment. Where is the realism? Why was there no reason to make this game the least bit challenging?
<br>
<br>5) Worst story line ever. reminded me of the old House of Dead arcade games. The dialogue was written by someone who has never seen real humans interact before, and the voice actors read it like a cheesy Hollywood movie which bombed the box office 50 years ago. Even the radio interviews of main antagonists are so cringe worthy and fake, can&apos;t help but think this was on purpose to let people laugh at the game and say &quot;wow this is really bad&quot;
<br>
<br>6) BORING AND REPETITIVE GAME PLAY. And in a world where you can potentially hack the city? Absolutely. All the main plot missions are basically the same, infiltrate by hacking, stealthily kill people the exact same ways over and over again, then listen to **** dialogue that will kill you from the cringe if you listen to it. All those side missions? The same action every time in their respective categories of either shooting up a bunch of people in their cars on their way to somewhere or some other non-original objectives to choose from.
<br>
<br>The list is never ending, just type in Watch Dogs Bugs into Youtube and ask yourself why anyone would release such a malfunctioning, poorly developed game, and have the decency to use a console port for PC like everything else was so perfect. DO NOT BUY this game, clearly just created to make money for unimaginative and lazy people. If a developer is reading this, you ruined a perfectly good idea into a pile of **** great job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4256332">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The long version, 20 things I hate about this overrated, overhyped piece of crap:
<br>
<br>-Horrible port
<br>-Stupid handling of cars, barely controllable with keyboard
<br>-Never even think about touching a mouse while driving. The camera gets **** up so fast
<br>-The story gets from dumb to stupid to i don&apos;t care so fast
<br>-The AI is so stupid
<br>- Pedestrians try to look clever with scripted stand there/talk/talk on the phone... but the reactions to any action you take are so stupid. I tried to play as a Protector but killing them was a bigger pleasure. Such stupid AI doesn&apos;t deserve to live
<br>-Not to mention how bad drivers they are
<br>-The AI characters/cars spawn and despawn like 10 meters from you. It&apos;s the **** that GTA 3 did, that cars behind you despawn instantly, and a few meters ahead also. Same goes for any AI that is not story driven. Shame.
<br>-The combat is unfair. The tips say that when you move, the AI will lose track of you. Ok, but when they know where you are, they see you and shoot at you through anything you are hiding behind. Succesfully
<br>-The 1 button to hack is mediocre at best. Not many things at all you can do with it, and it gets boring. You can get rich by spending 5 minutes at a highly populated square and then you just don&apos;t care
<br>-Side missions are repetitive as **** and appear way too often. I don&apos;t even bother anymore, stopped doing them after 2 hours of gameplay
<br>-The mini games ,,, well good to have them, but they are not &quot;that&quot; great. Slot machines, poker, trips, AR game... boring.
<br>-No matter what I do I cannot find anything to do while I&apos;m not in a mood of going through another painful and stupid part of the main story. I just end up killing everything that moves or ramming a truck full speed into incoming traffic, watching the bad physics handle the crash
<br>-Yeah, physics aren&apos;t that great either. Gravity works, sometimes, but that&apos;s probably it...
<br>-If it ain&apos;t a sniper rifle, you won&apos;t hit anyone that is further than 5-10m from you. No chance. Well, a bit but not in a combat situation while covering.
<br>-Yeah the cover system. I expected and still expect &quot;Press C to cover, C to exit cover&quot;, but no, you have to walk away from the surface you are covering behind to &quot;uncover&quot;. And it takes a few seconds of holding the right directional key for it to really work and unstick you from the wall.
<br>-Weapon wheel is bad. I get killed so many times while switching weapons, just because after each load of game it puts a sniper rifle as my selected weapon. I really don&apos;t know why.
<br>-Who thought of putting character progression into an open-world action game. And levels. And skillpoints. Why ? Why ???? Just teach me how to do what in the process. Gain &quot;skills&quot; by going through the story, completing objectives, not by spending ****ing skillpoints and leveling up.
<br>-The mouse. Oh the mouse. That&apos;s the first thing that **** me up. It acts just silly, it starts as if you are moving through maple syrup, then it starts responding lightning fast. Really great in combat.
<br>-The damage to the cars is stupid, except for blown tires which are awesome, i mean look awesome, the physics are broken on that one more than anything else.
<br>
<br>The short version:
<br>Don&apos;t you dare buy it. Don&apos;t support Ubisoft for developing and releasing a game that had so much potential, yet still managing to **** it up so bad. If you want to play it, just pirate it. Please. Don&apos;t give them a single cent for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4257583">Expand</a></span>

I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED! I couldn&apos;t log into uplay for 3 hours+ when I tried it said some stupid error code and lagged. When I finally got to play the first story mission, it crashed about 10 times in 2 hours, and I have a very good pc. I was so disappointed with the driving physics too the drift is way too far and its so hard to control. Also stupid NPC&apos;s one guy was smashing into a wall for 20 minuets and I had to restart the mission and continue all over again to be greeted with another crash. Once I wanted to free roam and explore the city, I saw that it was so small, there is nothing to do in the city. To much hype for this game. I see it as Crash Bugs not Watch Dogs.

<br>extremely long boring cutscenes and videos cannot be skipped. wanna restart the game to change mouse sensitivity? watch 8 minutes of boring cutscenes again!
<br>
<br>playing this game feels like a bad dream. you feel paralysed and unable to control your character. its like playing soccer with your legs tied togther. ITS NOT FUN! ITS A NIGHTMARE!

<br>
<br>-Story is dumb
<br>-Side missions have 0 creativity and are all the same
<br>-Gameplay is boring

On top of which, it was recently discovered that the graphics for PC were limited on purpose - this is completely unacceptable, and I will not support a company that abuses its fan base so readily.</span>

<br>That&apos;s why people stop buying things...that&apos;s why people pirate things, because of the lack of the respect for the consumer. Sorry but this is what i&apos;m seeing through all of this..This is my opinion, Ubisoft doesn&apos;t care about us, they already got their money...they will do the fix whenever they want.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4264624">Expand</a></span>

<br>Once you get past that, you&apos;ll find a very, very average sandbox game with the novelty mechanic of &apos;hacking&apos;.
<br>
<br>The main character is as bland as they come. He&apos;s the usual brooding, violent and morally empty anti-hero with the personality of a turnip that Ubisoft love creating. The hacking is laughable, simply press &apos;X&apos; and you&apos;re a l33t h4ck3r. And don&apos;t get me started on the driving, it&apos;s like trying to control a watermelon while juggling fine china and having rats nibbling at your genitals while going at 100 km/h.
<br>That and the stutter makes it impossible.
<br>
<br>No. The game is a technical mess, the story and motivation of the main character are childish and considering it was released by Ubisoft, you know it will never get fixed.

That doesn&apos;t mean the UI is good - far from it. Bad camera angles, responses, controls, atrocious driving.  Worst of all, it&apos;s BORING. Terrible terrible writing and game design.  It really makes me wonder how many game review sites get paid off by AAA companies.</span>

And you can do this all the time in any mission just repeating the pattern all the time. There is not much to do, well yes the city is huge but the misions are all the same. And the graphic is realy nice i must say but i dont think there is much diference in Low settings and on Ultra plus it does realy not matter because the frame drop is the same. It happens all the time and is anoying as hell.  The story is boring as hell. The ending sucked.

<br>OK - the single player campaign. Had loads of moments where I though to myself, what the F am I doing right now, and why? The all over story is a bad parody of only god know what high school play. Copied contend from famous tv-series. A total lag of originality.
<br>
<br>Why a score of 2? The hacking part is new! Well semi new! And its cool!
<br>
<br>All over! This game is a VERY bad attempt to make GTA clone.

The state of the PC version is a joke. The lighting is hideously flat and a filthy monochrome in most scenes, as opposed to what we saw at E3 two years ago. It has hideously outdated particle effects and shadows. Yes, the water looks great, but that doesn&apos;t count when there is no setting in the entire game that makes it run at at least 60fps on my high-end PC. In some places I felt like I was playing GTA IV. The pop-in in the open world is so terrible that it interferes with gameplay, especially when driving at high speeds. Weeks after its release there&apos;s still no patch out.
<br>
<br>Now for the gameplay, the hacking is has turned out to be a gimmick that becomes tired in the first few hours you actually get to play with it. There are some interesting things you can do with it but those become boring after you&apos;ve seen them a few times and most things you do with it are executed by just holding down a button for a second. Other than that, there are serviceable driving mechanics in place, but there&apos;s very little to do with it, as everything in the gameworld just has nothing interesting to offer you, not to mention that the graphics are so bad that it doesn&apos;t even have the entertainment value of just looking at the scenery, like you could do if it was just a boring game with great visuals.
<br>Also it has semi-cover-based shooting mechanics, but there&apos;s just no punch to it and it&apos;s usually just frustrating to &quot;play&quot;, especially when the framerate runs like a turtle.
<br>
<br>The story is clich&#xE9;d and the main &quot;character&quot; is not even just unrelatable, he&apos;s boring and hasn&apos;t got a single sign of a personality or character trait, but it&apos;s not presented in any way in which we could roleplay as our own. The game clearly thinks it&apos;s got an interesting character loaded with personality and a heavy emotional story, but it just falls flat on its face, because there is no character or actual strong emotional development to any of it.
<br>
<br>This game would have been a huge dissapointment, if I would have been invested in the hype, so at least it didn&apos;t hurt me there, but what we have is still a hugely boring and noticeably overhyped &quot;Triple-A&quot; game, with a terrible PC version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4311794">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&apos;t play on my own PC and had to use my wifes since she has Nvidia on board. You have been warned!
<br>
<br>And now to the game itself.
<br>
<br>1. Graphics is nowhere close to what we saw on trailers shown to us at gaming events around the world. Not only is it just medicore, but the game doesn&apos;t even try to hide that most of the stuff is just copy paste - watch some gameplay videos and focus on random NPC animations. Clone sense tingling!
<br>
<br>2. Main story is just boring and predictable.
<br>
<br>3. Side missions are just a laugh - after 5-10 of them you will most probably skip this aspect of the game.
<br>
<br>4. Earning money is a laugh.
<br>
<br>5. Game physics is a misunderstanding if you realize that we&apos;re in 2014, not in 2004. Cars drive like a brick falling of from a bridge, vehicle damage is almost irrelevant, everything seems to be glued to the ground...
<br>
<br>6. Multiplayer? Go play whatever you&apos;re playing online these days as the lags, loss of connection and downtimes will just piss you off.
<br>
<br>Since it&apos; s a Ubisoft game and they are well known for making promises that are never 100% fulfiled, I wasn&apos;t expecting all of the stuff that they were showing off. But the end product looks like an early alpha of what we were being shown so far. 3/10 from me, and that&apos;s only for the fact that the story has some nice support characters although even they are utilized in a predictable and unsatisfying way.
<br>
<br>P.S. This game runs (as always) via Uplay so expect a bumpy road when trying to actually launch the product. Server downs, missing files, 3+ file repairs in a row, you name it. So that doesn&apos;t help the overall impression at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4237639">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Add bad DRM (UPlay)
<br>-Don&apos;t optimize it at all (I can&apos;t even play this game properly)

<br>-Trains can stop on a dime
<br>-Make the key gimmick to the came completely unnecessary (I could do all of the missions more successfully by not hacking)

<br>
<br>I appreciated the unix nods in the intro and stuff like that but ultimately the game has absolutely nothing to do with network security or &quot;hacking&quot;. It may as well be magic.
<br>
<br>The story is garbage, complete and utter trite.
<br>
<br>The only redeeming feature of this game is the engines ability. There seems to be amazing A.I in the game, and bullet/particle/physics effects are all very cool. They slapped a very ****ty game onto a very cool engine by the looks of it.

Ubisoft made this game with hacking to test the players skills , skills with what ?   The skill to keep pressing the damn  &quot;Q&quot; button? Even the missions seem overused in other games totally unoriginal . More disappointing than Virtual boy, probably the most hyped game of ubisoft, story totally overused , I mean you know a guy whose a vigilante the gets the most important people in his life messed with, then one dies then he seeks out for revenge. I think that story line is very overused totally unoriginal .  They even force you to go to next gen computers to fully enjoy the game, its like they want us to go straight to the hi-tech stuff and upgrade our pcs and if you dont have the next best pc your gonna have a crappy experience.Ubisoft better redeem themselves wit h and not repeat this again in Assassins Creed : Unity {also this is my 4th time to submit this  cause everytime i try to submit the net crashes}</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4244825">Expand</a></span>

The vehicles try to mimic the Grand Theft Auto Series but fails miserably. They only have about 5 unique cars and 1 type of motorcycle. This game is almost like Infamous and GTA tried to have an abortion but instead just birthed the thing and threw it in the garbage. The only redeeming qualities of this game is the multiplayer. Hacking into each players data and trying to hide is fun and overall, it&apos;s almost seamless when transitioning into each other&apos;s game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4291068">Expand</a></span>

<br>Really disappointed with Ubisoft on this one. I was excited to hear when they were pushing back the release date because it would mean a more polished game at launch right?
<br>
<br>Ubisoft made this game for Nvidia rigs only. If you have ANY AMD components, you&apos;ll likely suffer the same fate as me, crashes gallore (this isn&apos;t AMD&apos;s fault - more on this later). I have a Nvidia GTX 770 but an AMD FX 8350 processor. I thought I would be fine with a Nvidia card.
<br>
<br>I thought wrong. After doing some googling it turns out that Ubisoft gave AMD the back of its hand and worked exclusively with Nvidia in the creation of this game. Essentially, Nivida was allowed to place as much input as it wanted into the development of Watchdogs, but AMD wasn&apos;t allowed to even say hello. The result?
<br>
<br>Terrible performance (and crashes) with AMD rigs until AMD scrambles to put up a driver patch just because Ubisoft played favorites. Don&apos;t count on Ubisoft riding in to fix the problem for AMD users- Nvidia paid them off to make sure nothing like that&apos;s gonna happen. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this isn&apos;t a bash on Nvidia, I&apos;ve been a long time fan of their cards, but Ubisoft needs to work openly with both manufacturers and not play favorites or the whole pc gaming community will end up suffering as a result.
<br>
<br>Jason Evanelho from Forbes wrote a great article on this madness entitled &quot;Why Watch Dogs is Bad News for AMD Users-- and Potentially the Entire PC Gaming Ecosystem&quot; - well worth the read</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4254088">Expand</a></span>

<br>I dont care if Ubisoft makes the most amazing game in the word if I cant even play it after paying my hard earned money for it.
<br>
<br>This is what happened:
<br>DAY 1 - Cant Login or after login the PLAY button does not work.
<br>DAY 3 - Still cant play without waiting A LOT, decide to get the Crack and play the game at least.
<br>DAY 6 -  After 3 days of smooth gameplay I decide that Uplay issues may be fixed, so I reinstall a clean copy from the disc; then; UPLAY for some inexplicable reason DELETES ALL MY SAVEGAMES (Checked everywhere); I decide to play from the Start; 10 min into the game, there is a power failure and when I boot the system back up, UPLAY insists that WATCH_DOGS is NOT INSTALLED AT ALL!! When all the files are on my drive and are not corrupt at all!!! Now I should spent another 45 min reinstalling the game after playing for just 10 min??????????
<br>
<br>I AM NEVER BUYING A UBISOFT GAME AGAIN; I will pirate them if I feel like playing them; the same thing happened to me in FAR CRY 3 and BLACK FLAG; I ended up playing pirated versions of both of them despite buying the game.
<br>
<br>WHY SHOULD I BUY UBISOFT GAMES IF I HAVE TO PLAY THE PIRATED VERSION ANYWAY????</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4252391">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s it!  No minigame or anything creative like that - there isn&apos;t even any real challenge to the hacking, just hold a key and you&apos;re done most of the time.  Considering that this is one of the main selling points of the game, that is a huge let down.
<br>The AI seems quite stupid for a modern game, and it gets stale very fast.
<br>It is clear from both the massive number of bugs/performance issues as well as the simplified gameplay that this is yet another terrible console port.
<br>Also forces you to use uPlay, which automatically deducts points in my opinion!
<br>
<br>All in all, don&apos;t waste your money unless it&apos;s in a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296235">Expand</a></span>

<br>Firstly, game is an absolute let-down. DO NOT BUY. All the hype were for nothing at all: Graphics are mediocre, gameplay is flawed (shooting something was quite hard, but DRIVING WAS HELL), scenario offers nothing, open world is not attractive and actually too unnatural (residents jumps and runs around just hearing me start the engine of a car). Hacking dynamics were too simplified, hardcore gamers would like something more complex and thrilling. Sadly, with all these combined: Game is unplayable and beyond help: A bunch of DLCs won&apos;t fix that.
<br>
<br>Secondly: Ubisoft may have published a mediocre game, no problem. I would give it a score of 5, it is still not nightmare. Some would still like and play it. But Ubisoft preferred to spend money on marketing than to invest in game itself, so I subtract 2 points. A 2 more goes for DUBLICATING POSITIVE USER COMMENTS. Cheating in post-publish reviews is not cool Ubisoft, not cool at all. I guess more than a half of the positive comments are either fixed beforehand or dublicated via web-tools.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247199">Expand</a></span>

<br>&lt; half of the content i payed for wasnt deliverd
<br>&lt; i could play till 85%, then my savegame got corrupted and everything is resettet.
<br>&lt; only ONE savegame possible, so if broken -&gt; new game
<br>
<br>uplay = **** ... servers suck like hell, online playing impossible, etc etc etc.

Everything is about hunting for mcguffins from the beginning to the end. A lot of bugs and Watch Dogs is sooo booooring.
<br>
<br>Do not buy. You will waste your money for this piece of crap. This game should never be released in this state!</span>

They have been making this game for over 4+ years, having several massive delays to &quot;bring it up to quality standards&quot; while boasting some of the most intrusive and annoying DRM (with outages at release like SimCity) there is just to have pirates crack the game a whopping week before release? I mean, holy f*ck Ubisoft, you screwed up big time with this one.
<br>
<br>As this game is a colossal failure beyond my abilties to write in the form of sentences, I&apos;m simply going to list all the problems in this &quot;Sandbox&quot; game:
<br>
<br>Watch_Dogs automatically tries to force you into the &quot;Good Karma&quot; route as doing literally any actual &quot;random&quot; event on the world map is just &quot;DURRR, EYM A CRIME SOLVUR, I LISTEN IN ON YUR PHOON N DEN GO 2 SUM PLEYC 2 WITNES SHET LOL&quot;. Playing as a bad guy? Well, you&apos;ll have no opportunity to say, take advantage of a situation but the worst crime here is the system itself. You need to stay close enough before &amp; when the crime is being commited and If you step in just a little when the game deems it to be 99% close to a crime being commited (as symbolized by the PROBABILITY OF BEING A VICTIM TO A CRIME PERCENTAGE METER above a person&apos;s head), both parties (the robber and the one getting robbed, for example) will both fitz into a seizure, ignore eachother and start to casually powerwalk away from the location, and the game saying &quot;HAHA, YOU FAILED TO PREVENT A CRIME, THE CRIMINAL SAW YOU THROUGH THE EYE IN HIS NECK AND NOW HE WILL GO AND COMMIT A CRIME ANOTHER DAY XD&quot;. It&apos;s just development stupidity beyond my imagination. What did I do subsequently? I shot the criminal in the back of his head and went away smiling. But shame that I got no reward stopping a future crime, nor did I get the opportunity to loot his corpse as the only thing I gained was a &quot;MURDERER!!!!&quot; popup at the top right of my screen.
<br>
<br>The police in this game has to be some of the worst I&apos;ve seen in a while. They are either ignorant, deaf and dumb clutz when you are sneaking around, taking them out loudly with a baton or they&apos;re all super-cops, unloading a 100% accuracy barrage of bullets from all directions after rushing to a scene at 160 km/h because they got a report that someone got bumped by a car. I even had the audacity to try and lose them by driving in reversed traffic at full speed in a sports-car. Nope nope nope, said Ubisoft, they have cybernetic implants along with a 600% boost to their handling and breaking capabilities when chasing you, Ubisoft states while jerking off. Don&apos;t ask why, our game is perfect and completely justifiles a 60&#x20AC; pricetag that will drop faster than my libido after orgasm once people start reading reviews for our rubbish. Another police problem would be that patrol cars don&apos;t react to traffic laws being broken whatsoever. Drive in opposite lane? No problem. Bump and scratch into people? No problem. Be inches away from driving over a dozen pedestrians? No problem.
<br>
<br>Another huge immersive problem would be the people themselves in the city. Apart from a few heavily scripted instances, the personality and overall consistency of the inhabitants are completely off. I&apos;ve seen dozens of hobos playing virtual reality videogames on their high-end phones while listening in on people that &quot;recently had a panic attack&quot; talk in very deep, collective and calm voices about casually commiting illegal activity. And when that Isn&apos;t blatantly obvious, there&apos;s also the fact that ALL pedestrians are capable of literally pouncing away from your car If you approach them at even miniscule speeds. This includes eldery people and while seeing an old lady in her 80-90&apos;s spasm 4 feet away from my car&apos;s hood within the blink of an eye, It&apos;s not very realistic while also concreting in the &quot;Good Karma&quot; ideals that the developers have in mind, not letting you do mass murders so easily or realize the absurdly bad car physics to hitting a human body. The cutscenes also look abyssmal with every single NPC set of teeth resembling the detail with that of carved bricks of limestone.
<br>
<br>Cars and every aspect of the driving element in this game is copypasted from Sleeping Dogs. While functional, It&apos;s FAR from what people expect in this kind of game and more importantly, it&apos;s way different from what was advertised as the only &quot;dynamic&quot; thing about cars in this game is that a few plastic covers will fall off after enough damage. The fact that some cars will THROW themselves on the horn 0.0000001 seconds if you slightly bump their rear end is also another example of horrid game design when combined with the constantly occuring scenario where I&apos;d be driving through an intersection, have a truck drive past, I speed up, and the truck suddenly slams on his breaks as he&apos;s 85% done crossing the intersection, causing me to crash into his backside because the turd AI in this game told him &quot;SCARY SCARY SITUATION, HE CLOSE, U SLAM BREAKS NOW OK?&quot; It&apos;s cheap, It&apos;s false advertising and It&apos;s Watch Dogs. Stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4253023">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I think the biggest disappointment is multiplayer (hacking and following). If you get some basic ideas how the game works there is no way for someone to successfully complete one of these successfully. Although the reward system is constructed the way you will always level up over time.
<br>
<br>In my humble opinion you can get more fun out of &#xA3;7 indie games than this so unless the price is dropped to around &#xA3;20, don&apos;t buy it.
<br>
<br>PS: don&apos;t get into this internet hype about this game... you will be disappointed if you expect too much.
<br>
<br>PS: the trailer of this game is VERY misleading. Watch some &quot;gameplay&quot; videos first !!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4254929">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, this is a new game so its obviously going to look better, but only by a few degrees, I would actually say Sleeping Dogs in some way looks better.
<br>
<br>Things to do, well the main point of Watch Dogs is your phones ability to hack stuff.
<br>
<br>Like phone junctions boxes outside peoples houses, for which you then can spy on them earning some XP while watching some cute cut scene, this was relatively amusing,but very basic. Some had a little puzzle to complete, similar to them pipe puzzle where you need to get water from one end to the other by moving the pipes, but this was electricity.
<br>
<br>you can also hack -
<br>
<br>CCTV camera: This makes sense, these are used to move around inside buildings and getting up to higher places.
<br>
<br>Traffic lights: This is somewhat amusing the first few times watching cars smash into each other- Dumb idiots. OK this makes sense, and its used to stop people chasing you, police and bad guys.
<br>
<br>Bollards: Which comes up blocking roads, also to stop cars, this also made sense.
<br>
<br>Drains:? or Gas Mains or 15 Pounds of C4 buried in the road? Not too sure about this one, its nice to trigger, but makes no sense seemed like a lacking in things to hack imo.
<br>
<br>Bridges, phuck it why not.
<br>
<br>Forklifts &amp; Cheery Pickers? what? just getting stupid now desperately adding things to hack, Oh and apparently you can only make them hackable to move up and down?
<br>
<br>And some explosive floor bombs, wall circuit boxes and &amp; other pointless stuff.
<br>
<br>ALSO, you can hack the pointless &amp; moronic citizens of Chicago, listen in to their text and phone conversions, which is amusing but after 200+ its gets pretty dull, furthermore you can steal their bank account details and take some of their saving, but after reaching about 300k you can pretty much buy everything that can be bought, so money is useless, this is just a gimmick and a game filler, I can see people doing this for ages like it did, then release it was all for nothing.
<br>
<br>The Campaign or main story is OK nothing great, and the protagonist is a total arse. Most unlikable character in any genre, be it movie, books or games, his reasons &amp; action are so poorly written, it feels so cobbled and rushed together.
<br>
<br>Game play: Comparing this to the other open world GTA style games, this is by far the worst, the City is open straight away which leads little to no discovery, buildings and just closed lifeless boxes, apart from the odd news stand, caf&#xE9; or bar where you can buy a drink/snacks that fills your bullet time thing, which I never used.
<br>
<br>The main Campaign is 90% chase that guy or follow this guy, and escape the bad guys or police, these type of mission were the worst parts of the other games, I hated them and GTA only used them to add filler to the their games, and Sleeping Dogs never used them at all. But Watch Dogs is mainly these, and these are awful- Reason! the driving is nasty.
<br>Well part from those terrible missions, the other few consist of get in/out without being seen, tad like Metal Gear solid style, they see you and bam, start again time, these mission were even worst then the driving ones, and finally a very basic but and probably the best part of the game, cover shooting which worked fine, but pretty easy if you took your time.
<br>
<br>Side mission, were basic and dull, the gang hide out is basically a cover shooter, where you attack some goons then hit their boss with a stick, you kill him its start again time, but you can kill his goons np, this one one was ok the other 2 pretty Crappy..
<br>
<br>NOW THE WORST PART OF THE GAME: Wow the driving, omg, For example the boats actually handle better than the cars, absolutely awful &amp; just embarrassingly bad.
<br>
<br>So Watch Dogs? An awful, cheap and hurried game, that actually takes the genre back to 2004.  From the lies about the visuals in the 2012 E3 Trailer and the nasty PC optimization, and the fact that the last 2 bosses are basically QTE, or the fact that you character can&apos;t do anything in the city, apart from bump into the citizen steal pointless money, or play dull chess. or even the terribly coded Hulk mentality  of the police-POLICE SMASH -. wow they literally have one line of code those guys.
<br>
<br>But that fact they have Released DLC for $5 without fixing Uplay or stabilizing the game for people that have paid upwards of $70</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247605">Expand</a></span>

They are getting ready for E3 and are trying to hide the smoke. A game breaking but which is ignored for so long - &quot;polished masterpiece&quot;. Do not buy this game nor any other future Ubisoft games! The hype is fake and the media sites are in their pockets!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4264151">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Horribly optimized for PC
<br>- Even at max settings, it&apos;s rather underwhelming for a PC release
<br>- Generic sandbox gameplay that doesn&apos;t go beyond what GTA V did
<br>- Poor story
<br>- Poor AI
<br>- Poor physics
<br>- Did not live up to the hype and not worth the way
<br>
<br>You&apos;re better off waiting until GTA V is released on PC, which has finally been announced.</span>

<br>Let&apos;s list the problems:

<br>2. 70+ Million dollar budget and at least 4 years of development (including a 7 month delay!)
<br>3. Lackluster story, clich&#xE9; scenes and &quot;meh&quot; voice acting.
<br>4. Terrible and incredibly boring protagonist, I could not connect with him at all.
<br>5. Stupid logic in missions, i.e. you are a &quot;mass murdering vigilante&quot;. How f*cked up is that?
<br>6. Terrible optimisation on PC, runs like ass and plays like it too.
<br>7. Speaking of gameplay; no melee combat, terrible physics engine, I&apos;ve seen better driving / handling in &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; and &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;.
<br>8. Ubisoft seemed to spend 90% on the marketing machine to hype up this poor excuse of a game, and 10% on actual development.
<br>9. Tonnes of bugs, errors and stupid bullsh*t that is game-breaking.
<br>10. Escaping from the cops is as easy as 1, 2, 3. Just hop into a f*cking boat!
<br>11. Stupid, senseless combat.
<br>12. You can smell the sequels as soon as you spend 6 hours installing with UPLAY!
<br>13. Uplay!
<br>14. Uplay!
<br>15. The missions are so repetitive, it just makes a grown man cry.
<br>16. Udon&apos;tplay.
<br>
<br>Good stuff:
<br>1. Some-what original idea.
<br>2. Spider-tank trip.
<br>... that&apos;s about it.
<br>
<br>TL;DR - Don&apos;t buy this garbage! Torrent it if you need to. If you want to &quot;experience the next gen&quot; play GTA V because GTA V is much more next-gen then this lazy piece of work. Shame on you Ubisoft. Can&apos;t wait for you to f*ck up The Division.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs/user-reviews?user_review_id=4261293">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft holds a press conference on E3 2012 and announces the game Watch_Dogs by showing a glimpse which stuns gaming enthusiasts with its graphics and features.
<br>//
<br>It is the 26th of June 2014. Ubisoft is not able to prevent people from playing before release. As a consequence of that Ubisoft servers are constantly down, what slows down the ability to play the game on release day. A lot of gamers have problems with uPlay, Ubisoft&apos;s own client. All in all: Release day was a mess. On my side, however, I was able to download it one day before release day, but were not capable of playing because the game crashed when being on main menu. One day later, it worked with redownloading it.
<br>I was able to play Watch_Dogs two days long until a loading screen bug hit me on 28th May. I enjoyed playing Watch_Dogs since it was fun to explore the whole world, main and side missions. Indeed, the game has been dramatically changed since E3 2012. These two years changed everything so that you can see E3 2012&apos;s glimpse as a betrayal regarding the gameplay we actually got. Of course changes have to be made during development, but these were so radical.
<br>The reason why I give Watch_Dogs two points is simply that I wait for an official announcement of a patch for two weeks now. This is unacceptable when considering that so many people are affected. Ubisoft missed to care about their customers, Ubisoft missed to patch the game early, Ubisoft missed to get rid of a Beta bug. There is no excuse for this mess.
<br>Watch_Dogs release is even worse than DICE+EA&apos;s Battlefield 4. And that, ladies and gentlemean, says a lot.
