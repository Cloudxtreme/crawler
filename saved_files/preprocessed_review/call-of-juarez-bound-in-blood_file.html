<br>I was skeptical about the quality of the story at first, but by the end of the game I had felt like it was a great performance overall.
<br>I was never amazed by any feature or aspect of this game, but never at any time was I disappointed or bored either. Though this game fails to deliver an epic experience, it is by no means an unworthy one.
<br>In the end, Bound in Blood is an extremely solid title sitting at a base price of only $9.99. Any gamer should be able to enjoy this game at its price, but this is a must-buy if your a western fan. Do to the amount of content, taking only 6 hours to beat the campaign, I cannot rate this game higher than a 7/10, but for its price it is a worthy title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192331">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Bottom line: this game is fun! The graphics and sound are awesome, and the western atmosphere is as authentic as possible! Everything you would expect from a western is in here: horses, indians, bandits etc On the flip side, its a bit too easy at times, and the end battle isn&apos;t as good as I felt it could be..Anyway, I played this wearing a cowboy hat...great!</span>

What I got was a great western experience with all the scenes that a famous western movie would feature. The game&apos;s storyline is very well-written, and the dialogues are remarkably well-acted, and after seeing the cutscenes, I thought I&apos;m not even playing but watching. The gameplay itself is keeping up the excitement with ingame plot development and action-packed scenes, like chases, while not being frustratingly hard, and the showdowns are just adding a great deal to experience. The game is easily controllable, and has nice looks, not just because of the great graphics, but the environment is simply well-done. Despite not being an all-time classic, this game is surely worth a play or two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=83359">Expand</a></span>

Where to start? Graphics are quite good, level design pretty successful (pay attention on the different towns, their structure and the materials they are made of) and not monotone (towns and wilderness mixed-up), sounds like those from the old movies by Sergio Leone... The story will keep you interested in getting further all way long and the narration style fits well the overall timeline (setting). The most important fact is that the gameplay is really something to enjoy. Maybe a few bothering moments and SPOILER - unrealistically tough enemies with miniguns (?) near the end of the game - SPOILER END are the main reason I&apos;m giving this game 8... Pardon me, 9. Recommended, especially if you find it in a bargain bin somewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=737917">Expand</a></span>

Everything from the dialogue, to the voice acting, to the awesome gun-slinging gameplay is very polished. I have played both the PC and PS3 versions, and it is much better on the PC.

And to add to all its glory is pitch-perfect voice acting, great sound, (the guns really make a satisfying boom) and incredible attention to enviornmental detail. Although, the game is not perfect. The single player is over all too quickly and, to my surprise, is not as epic as it tries to be, regardless of what other critics said. It just did not have the frantic pacing of COD4 or the feeling of &quot;overwhelming odds&quot; Thats pretty much it for the cons and i must say, multiplayer was surprisingly interesting and fun. What I liked most about multiplayer was the maps. They are quite convoluted, and much to my surprise, almost every building you see is fully interactive and enter-able, so instead of feeling scripted and linear &quot;you must go through here to reach the enemy base&quot;, COD4 type maps, they were surprisingly non-linear and added to the multiplayer experience. Overall, though it is short, its a must buy (and worth the $50 price tag) due to the relatively high replay value (there is unlockable content) and interesting multiplayer which serves as a great diversion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=83285">Expand</a></span>

<br>-it feels like a console port, autoaim, very easy (you seem to take alot of damage without dying), AI are terrible, cutscenes galore
<br>-concentration mode replaces what used to be a good game mechanic (needing to fire as soon as the cursor moves over a enemy) now essentially boils down to move mouse randomly over the screen and they automatically get targeted. Lame.
<br>-Story is rather plain, the brother aspect is more of a excuse to create conflict.

Old western or cowboy fans might appreciate the beauty of the towns and the surrounding canyons, as also the classic long-rifles and various revolvers. For others, there&apos;s little reason to play this game. Linearity aside, this game has a nice story about brothers and family, and also got quite a touchy ending. The horse-riding missions are quite fun too, at least a little different than in Assassin&apos;s Creed. As for the brothers, each have their own speciality, ranging from movement abilities, combat tactics to weapon selections. This helps to add a little spice of variety into the gameplay, but it&apos;s done little to increase the value of replayability of the single-player levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602304">Expand</a></span>

I can forgive that, since many western movies have the same flaw.  However, some of the action sequences are just not that great.  The duels at the end of every level grow tiresome.  Not to mention, the controls for them seem somewhat vague (was handled much better in Red Dead Redemption).  It&apos;s a decent game.  If you like westerns and get it for a good price, give it a go.  Also, the hardware requirements didn&apos;t seem too steep at all.  I have a several year old machine (Phenom II X2, 6 GB RAM, Geforce 8800GT), and it ran the game on mostly high settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2151343">Expand</a></span>

Voice acting - boring. Game play - boring. Everything about this game was boring. If you&apos;re looking for a good western FPS, check out GUN. It&apos;s a few years old but blows this thing out of the water in every aspect (including graphics) - the only downside to that game was not multiplayer. CoJ:BB does have multi, but I&apos;m not even slightly interested in trying it out. Waste of money, wait for the bargain bin if you just have to play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=738783">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is repetitive and boring, and the showdowns that conclude every level feel exactly same, each as broken and tedious as the last. The only thing that makes the game even remotely interesting is the choice to play as one of the two brothers in the game: Thomas is good with a bow and arrow, Ray can use dynamite, and each has their own version of a slowed down focus mode. Unfortunately it&apos;s not enough to make Bound in Blood worth playing. Skip this garbage and just pick up or replay Red Dead Redemption.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2530222">Expand</a></span>

This game was a fantastic surprise. First off, the variety of gameplay in this game was great, from showdowns, to stage coach chases, this game had a great blend of gameplay that complimented each other. Also the choice between playing as either brother, also let each person choose how they would want to play the game. The graphics were surprisingly good and really captured the atmosphere of the old west.. I really enjoyed the small side missions that you complete to earn money, it had a &quot;mini-open-world&quot;, feel to it. I loved the gunplay, everything from the reloading, to the pulling back of the hammer before every shot. The music in this game was satisfactory, and it did capture the atmosphere of the game, but it was nothing to be remembered. The story alone was a 7/10, this game was carried mostly by its outstanding gameplay and environment. The story didn&apos;t really have me thinking what will happen next, instead it had me thinking, &quot;Oh who are we going to shoot up now?&quot; or &quot;What new environment will we run around in next?&quot;. The voice acting was superb, except for William and Ray&apos;s voice. Both of these characters sounded like they were slightly out of place. So it wasn&apos;t really the voice acting itself, it was the casting of the voice I found off a bit. Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood will remain my favorite shooter of all time because of its great lend of variety in gameplay, environment and its great story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=4005704">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;re cliche&apos;s and the game itself is a workable western (well, except for the fact that your guys have bullet time superpowers) and, well, really it&apos;s a near miss. A bit more care on the characters and plot and it might have been there.</span>

<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>-Decent story with good voice acting.
<br>-The gameplay mechanics are solid, and not too repetitive.
<br>-Graphics: While many things look average, some of the environments are truly beautiful (at times on par with Crysis 1).
<br>-This game does not shy away from christian themes, which fit well with the story. And it does so without seeming unpleasantly pro or anti christian.
<br>-A good manual save system (no annoying checkpoint reloads).
<br>-No Ubisoft Uplay account required!
<br>
<br>The Bad (mostly minor):
<br>-A very low Field-of-View (not fixable) due to being optimized for console TV screens.
<br>-The first level (tutorial) has clumsy scripting and mediocre graphics, but it gets better with later levels.
<br>-Bodies disappear the moment you look away, due to silly Xbox360/PS3 RAM limits.
<br>-AI is mediocre (not a big problem since most things are scripted)
<br>-screen vibration effects severely overdone during scripted explosions.
<br>-Enemies move like ants (no movement inertia), making aiming a pain sometimes.
<br>
<br>The Ugly:
<br>-No COOP mode! With the two protagonists working together, this game would have been perfect for co-op, and yet there is no co-op mode! What a missed opportunity!
<br>
<br>Overall, I can easily recommend this game, especially in a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/user-reviews?user_review_id=5367385">Expand</a></span>
