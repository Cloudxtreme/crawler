It is a snowball game, yet most of the games are quite close. Do you invest in gangs, master thief, or the economy? - The campaign is quite short and should be looked at as only the tutorial, the real game is in the multiplayer. Matchmaking sometimes lasts only a SECOND! although it can go to about 2 minutes as well. - TLDR: Amazing core gameplay, that will only get better with patches!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/antihero/user-reviews?user_review_id=7412606">Expand</a></span>
