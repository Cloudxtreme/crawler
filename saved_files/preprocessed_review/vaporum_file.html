I prefer the control scheme of Might &amp; Magic and be able to turn with the mouse pointer. Using the middle roulette is kind of counter intuitive. One thing I did like a lot was the story, told by the main character, but also in audio recording and written notes. The combat was fun but even at Easy setting you will eventually miss repair kits. So I played half at easy, half casual. The tech power are very unequal in terms of powers...some are very useful like poison, fire, restore...others are just a waste of time like better aiming, protection, force field, they do a poor job at it. You can equip new items and tech power. You get a lot of puzzles like switch, keys, teleport, combination, traps. They go from simple to hard. There are 3-4 of them who were too hard because they rely on guessing more then deduction or hints. They were really annoying. I found the level without weapon refreshing, and you had to think how to kill the enemy. I would have prefer another section like that then a bad teleport puzzle. So, Vaporum could have use some small hints here and there for some of the puzzles and direction. Nothing major but useful. Otherwise I liked it, more then Grimrock but less then Might and Magic X. I give it a 75%, and it should be play if you like puzzles and old RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vaporum/user-reviews?user_review_id=7570314">Expand</a></span>

Excellent sound, graphics and level design.</span>
