This game feels more like a cat fest at an all girls boarding school. There is no suspense, the puzzles are dull and I found the eventual outcome very disappointing.</span>

Another minor thing that bothered me is generally the unskippable minigames, and having to grind at the snack shop. The shop was interesting *once*, but having to do it over and over again quickly kills any entertainment in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nancy-drew-warnings-at-waverly-academy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4574623">Expand</a></span>
