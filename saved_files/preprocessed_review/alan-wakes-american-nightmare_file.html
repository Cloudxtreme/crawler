This game introduces us further to Mr. Scratch, doppelganger of Alan Wake (whom we saw in AW). Game is more action oriented, and it fits this episode really well. You should approach this one with no expectations - take a coke, take a whole (hot) day for this one, and enjoy.</span>

<br>
<br>I am an optimistic fool. This is a rehash of the engine, with a few tweaks added to facilitate the experience, such as a map with mission waypoints, a faster charging flashlight and a handful of new weapons for you to enjoy. The story is disposable and is actually an insult to its predecessor in every way.

<br>This add-on, call it what you will, is Remedy&apos;s lazy way to monetize on the engine by offering you a survival mode that has you pitted against waves of enemies, a weak plotline and some of the most cringe-worthy live action scenes performed by Ilkka Villi who acted as Alan Wake.
<br>
<br>The only thing this game does better than the first is the enhanced combat which now comes with 90% less cheap deaths at the hands of off screen enemies.
<br>
<br>If you are a die-hard fan of the original game, nothing I say will convince you not to play this. However, if you are merely as intrigued as I was, do yourself a favor and skip this, even on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3392315">Expand</a></span>

I LOVED the original Alan Wake, not even a horror fan but the game rung so many bells for me that I was left deafened by the overall performance. But, a few hours into this &quot;sequel&quot; and I&apos;m already enjoying myself less, plodding through this game like so many others, and that&apos;s precisely how it SHOULDN&apos;T feel. The original Alan Wake (even the special episodes) had a sense of danger, of the hostile environment all around, but with American Nightmare it&apos;s as though they&apos;ve taken all the teeth out of the enemy. There&apos;s too much ammo, killing enemies is too easy, and the story and immersion suffer as a consequence of that. Also: American Nightmare breaks its own rules set out at the very start of the original with Alan&apos;s opening Monologue: &apos;Keep the audience in the dark, don&apos;t give too much away, make them wonder, don&apos;t rely on logic, don&apos;t make sense, do the unexpected, challenge the audience&apos;s expectations and especially their hope.&apos; The opening few minutes of the game give us all of these things, and it is too much. It kills the dark magic, OVERkills it with a flare-gun to the face. The beauty of the storytelling in the original lay in its uncertainty, until the big reveal in chapter four we were never entirely sure if Wake was sane, and even after, the ending felt like a theft but also RIGHT. But in American Nightmare the cat&apos;s out of the bag the first time we see a TV. We know the who, what, when, and where, and from there, the WHY is obvious. All of this could have been fixed with the villain NOT taunting wake, simply teasing him SILENTLY, or even giving him Amnesia again.  Granted that would be clich&#xE9;d by now, but still not as bad as the alternative. And it goes without saying the opening sequence DEFINITELY could have done without the TV show (HINT, HINT). Because of this we know the result even without spoilers because in every way possible the horror in this story has absolutely no teeth. I don&apos;t think one can blame the Narrative failings of this game on the scale of the production when the original was so tight. What American Nightmare needed was a second draft, with a stronger focus on keeping us guessing, keeping us confused and scared and looking for movement in the shadows until the very end. It&apos;s a worthwhile game if strictly run of the mill, and also if you want to follow the franchise, but we&apos;ve seen much better work from Remedy in this regard, so I hope they lift their game on the sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2856670">Expand</a></span>

<br>I did not unlocked all guns, but even first few guns (which you will unlock at beginning) are much more powerful than anything that you can get in Alan Wake.

<br>To sum up, I found this game quite boring and didn&apos;t bother to play it through. Maybe some day, if I have nothing better to do, I&apos;ll look it again.

<br>
<br>How lazy were they? Here&apos;s a list of their laziness:
<br>1. It&apos;s 3 maps 3 times over (doing the same exact things 3 times)... how much more boring can it get and how much more lazy can the game makers get?
<br>2. Not even a dozen types of &quot;Taken&quot; are introduced, and there are no bosses.
<br>3. Guns were supplied in boxes and you could find these guns from ACT I (but you can&apos;t open the boxes because of the lack of manuscripts). It shows that the game makers were LAZY once again. They didn&apos;t want to introduce these guns in some interesting or progressive  fashion. They just put them into boxes and left it.
<br>4. Did I mention you do the same thing over and over and over again?
<br>5.  Maps are small
<br>6. No driving? One of the best parts of the first game was the driving...
<br>7. Same radios and TVs in the same spot  SOOO LAZY
<br>8. Same items and weapons in the same spot... SOOO LAZY
<br>9. Soo many &quot;locked&quot; doors; game makers were too lazy to make more than a dozen rooms in the game.
<br>10.  Same plant life that you can walk through over and over again. You can even walk through cacti and it won&apos;t hurt you; it flops around like an elastic band instead.
<br>11. weakest story/plot line ever
<br>12. shortest game ever
<br>13. Where&apos;s the music and atmosphere? There is none...
<br>14. Where are the awesome cutscenes and awesome endings to each ACT? They threw away the good bits from the first game...
<br>
<br>Other bad aspects of the game:
<br>1. No challenge after acquiring certain guns. As soon as you get the magnum (during 2nd run) the taken pose absolutely no threat; I believe the magnum was the most versatile and BEST gun in the game.
<br>2. Bullets were scattered randomly and everywhere and I only had to rush back to ammo/battery supply to fill up.
<br>I NEVER used any of my batteries; recovery speed was soo fast (just as fast as putting a battery in)
<br>3. Birds/crows were basically nerfed. They went form being annoying and potentially hazardous in the first game into becoming an easy to shoot  target. They transform from their crow form into a human form. The crow form is untargetable, but after they combine into a human form, it&apos;s too easy to kill.
<br>4. What were the point of spiders? It brings nothing to the story and game.
<br>5. Save feature is complete crap. There is only one slot to save in, so you have to play that one slot all the way through (or else you&apos;ll lose all of it). Don&apos;t stop and go back to the previous level to grab a manuscript (like I did); your save file will be over written or worse, you will be in the same Act/save point, but will only be holding your default handgun.
<br>6. Manuscripts were poorly written and boring; there&apos;s actually very little significance to the story.
<br>7. No team play like the 1st game. One of the best parts was the team fights with Barry and the Sheriff.
<br>
<br>The end was a complete disgrace and was the final/key factor for me in writing this review. Cheesiest acting ever; I don&apos;t blame the actors (the actor playing Alan wake did VERY well). The direction of the game was horrible and I bet the actors felt awkward and disappointed with the end.
<br>
<br>THIS SHOULDN&apos;T BE CALLED AN ALAN WAKE GAME... it has NOTHING to do with the first game. You can replace all the character&apos;s names with something else and there wouldn&apos;t be a difference.
<br>
<br>Good things about the game (there were some)
<br>1. Alan has more stamina; he can practically run forever
<br>2. Alan can actually jump or climb over small obstacles now
<br>3. I really liked the video and the acting in the videos (for the T.V.s)
<br>4. It&apos;s nice to see a new assortment of guns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3410941">Expand</a></span>

Which I imagine isn&apos;t what you were hoping to hear. However, if you&apos;re a huge fan of the &apos;Alan Wake&apos; series, much like myself, then &apos;American Nightmare&apos; is definitely worth picking up during it&apos;s next sale. Why wait until it&apos;s next sale you might ask? Well, because this game really doesn&apos;t offer anything that the original didn&apos;t. The story-line is nothing special and the game is told through narrations that feel a little too close to old episodes of &apos;Twilight Zone&apos; mixed in with what appear to be live action cut-scenes. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.
<br>
<br>From what I could gather, you are fighting an evil version of yourself, or something. Like I said, the story isn&apos;t anything special. In fact, the best thing this game offers is one more chance to step into Alan Wake&apos;s world. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that. I mean, hey, if you like shining flashlights at spooky demons and then blasting them with shotguns and other weapons, then this game is without a doubt for you. And if you don&apos;t, then maybe you should go play something less frightening. And don&apos;t forget your flashlight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920845">Expand</a></span>

I was ready to see his struggle, and I saw it. He&apos;s a writer, so his best weapon is his mind and typewriting machine.
<br>I think that the action that we&apos;ve seen in AWAN is only his first attempt to run away from darkness, I&apos;d even say - we&apos;ve seen a draft of his new novel &quot;Return&quot;.
<br>Advice - find all the pages to clearly understand all the things that happened in the story. AWAN is not a regular arcade game, it&apos;s the game which can easily distract from main things with all the shooting, but the seeking one will find all the answers and new food for thought here.
<br>So be patient, be attentive. Nothing happens out of blue in the game, and the game is simply splendid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535701">Expand</a></span>

Its extremely tedious and they LITERALLY make you replay the same 3 objectives over and over while giving a half-assed answer as to why. Its obvious they are trying to stretch out the game as much as possible without actually having more content. By the time I was nearing the end, I just wanted it to be over and it was boring. The plot itself really doesnt make very much sense at all, and you are just thrown in there. As for the gameplay, they introduce a new mechanic where gathering manuscript pages rewards you by being able to unlock new guns after a certain amount. However, I felt this was actually quite a downside - within the first 15 minutes you already have 3-4 automatic weapons. I think that they took away the iconic revolver that alan had, and instead they turned it into more of a run n gun with tons of weapons rather then having you feel somewhat vulnerable with your revolver. Also, with the automatic weapons you cant reload faster by tapping the reload key like you could in the first, which makes it less suspenseful. The enemies themselves have no voice acting, unlike the first which had their creepy morphed voices which added atmosphere and creepiness to it. The little televisions which show mini videos to you are kind of cheesy and the voice acting isnt great. Its a bad attempt at being scary. The flashlight seems to run out at least doubly as fast as the original game which is extremely frustrating. It recharges much faster, but all this accomplishes is more interruptions in the fighting. I didnt like the change. They also made some changes to the UI, which I think looked worse then before. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with how this turned out. Some of the best parts was listening to the soundtrack, but there were only 3 songs or so. some only playing for 30 seconds while you fight. I finished the game in about 4-5 hours, however due to them making you replay everything, theres probably only 1-2 hours of real original content. If you are a big alan wake fan, its still decently fun, but certainly doesnt hold up to the plot, gameplay, or style of the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2428883">Expand</a></span>

Keep you busy for many many hours.  Definitely worth the 10 bucks.<br><br>SP Campaign:  Ungh.  I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the Alan Wake story.  It was absurd and hokey, but the presentation and the characters made it work and kept me engaged throughout the games run time.  Ironically, the biggest failing of Alan Wake for me was the WRITING in the manuscript pages.  The prose was abysmal.  The monologues, cringe inducing.  I thought this was an intentional jab at King and Koontz&apos;s increasingly sloppy prose...but as I progressed through the game, I don&apos;t think this was the intention.  Fast forward to the tacked on American Nightmare SP campaign.  All pretense in a plot is completely abandoned.  Wake&apos;s invented characters not only break the 4th wall from Wake&apos;s perspective...but then Wake and his characters break the 4th wall from OUR perspective.  It&apos;s not clever.  Characters even say things like, &quot;I don&apos;t really get why this is happening either, all I do know is it IS happening, and I can fix it.&quot;  I don&apos;t mind linear games, but I would like there to be some sort of actual meat to the story telling.  The plot in the SP campaign is strictly a pantomime of absurd unexplained contrivance upon contrivance.  The time loop was an interesting idea.  I thought perhaps there was some game mechanic in there for the player to take advantage as to influence what happens in subsequent loops.  Nope.  You just play the same three levels, three times, slightly more abbreviated with every iteration.<br><br>Buy this game for the survival mode, which really feels much more developed than the poor SP campaign.  If the survival mode does not interest you, I would recommend giving this game a pass as the SP is pretty dull, the story is beyond stupid, and the writing nauseating.<br><br>Survival Mode: 8<br>SP: 5</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2454508">Expand</a></span>

It seemed to have a very low budget, the producers tried too hard to have better combat  and the story was terrible and didn&apos;t make any sense. This was an absolute disappointment.</span>

A petty arsenal is what left room for all those other goodies in the original Alan Wake and left you always on edge. Shame on you Remedy. Sell the title to Rockstar so they can do it service like they did with Max Payne 3. I rated a 3 for the art and &quot;survival mode&quot; concept, although I wouldn&apos;t pay fifty cents for this joke.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3401833">Expand</a></span>

First one had a potentially rich story. This one has nothing for it. It really feels it&apos;s just a botched game, surfing on the Alan Wake franchise potential hype in attempt to make easy money by creating a coupe of levels you just do and redo again. Such a shame from Remedy, killing their reputation like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816343">Expand</a></span>

<br>Something that really loved about this was the Real time cut-scenes, god i hope they do the same with Alan Wake 2, and please i want more of The Old Gods Of Asgard.

Personally, I dont like these shortened low price games so having bought this one I wouldnt buy another follow up like this but nor does it put me off buying another full Alan Wake game either. I like the first very much indeed.  Slightly disappointing even for the low price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2446413">Expand</a></span>

Plus, there are boxes with ammuntion that auto-refills, thus loosing the pressure of  trying to get out the shooting as much as you can. Alan Wake turned badass is a bad idea.
<br>
<br>Second, the game features only 3 maps, with the same characters and the same puzzles that you will play to death thanks to a time loop. Yep. The first time when you go back at your starting point, you ask yourself what you did wrong. Then the second time, you feel the game is just playing with you nerves and just want to finish it as soon as possible and forget it.
<br>
<br>Really, Alan Wake&apos;s American Nightmare should be played only to see how an otherwise great licence can crash and burn due to unwise design choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5921737">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So, naturally, I had to buy American Nightmare when it was on sale, and I have to say: had I played this first, I wouldn&apos;t have felt the same way.
<br>
<br>The great combat system is still there, and Arcade Mode utilizes it very well. However, story mode is severely lacking. It&apos;s boringly easy (ammo is everywhere) and intentionally repetitive. Literally, the same three locations and the exact objectives are copied and pasted three times to lengthen the game.
<br>
<br>And don&apos;t expect the same enthralling story, either. American Nightmare brings nothing to the table that the original game didn&apos;t already do. Unlike in the original, I just didn&apos;t care for the characters or the situation they were in. There was nothing particularly memorable that got me hooked.
<br>
<br>I love Alan Wake, and American Nightmare&apos;s Arcade Mode is nice, but I can&apos;t help but think this expansion is a blatant cash-in. If you&apos;re an Alan Wake fan, just watch a Let&apos;s Play of this game and wait for the real sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=6009684">Expand</a></span>

The presentation is amazing, the action is great, the soundtrack is great and the narrative is splendid. The game is more action oriented than the original but i do think it works pretty well. That is partly since the enemy and weapon variety is a lot better than in the original. The game do however have the same problem as the original, it gets repetitive. At the beginning of the game i thought that the developers had managed to fix it by adding a more varied combat but they do manage to ruin that later in the game by certain plot twists that shall remain a secret.  The game is still great though and if you have an interest in the genre you should definitely pick it up since its gameplay, style and narrative is really something out of the ordinary. Oh and the game should take you around 5-10 hours to complete depending on how you play the game but because of its low price point i don&apos;t think that is a problem. And there is also an arcade survival mode in the game that should entertain you for a couple of hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2623719">Expand</a></span>

Following the story were two episodes of DLC and &quot;Alan Wake&apos;s American Nightmare&quot;. These were not as good as was expected by many. Both DLC added Alan&apos;s travelling in his nightmares, that basically did not add anything to the original story. So if you missed them, you would still know everything from the main storyline. But both DLC and &quot;American Nightmare&quot; added much of action moments, that could keep you enjoying the world of Alan. Regarding the plot of &quot;Alan Wake&apos;s American Nightmare&quot; there is not much to say. The game itself is a horror action. If you enjoyed action sequence in original &quot;Alan Wake&quot; then you should probably try &quot;Nightmare&quot;.  I was one of those who enjoyed action but was bored of storyline in &quot;Nightmare&quot;. It seems that it was supposed to be three times shorter (if you played through, you know what I mean).
<br>You should not think that &quot;American Nightmare&quot; is an original game, think of it as of a big piece of DLC.
<br>Anyway, I would recommend it to fans and to those who liked Alan&apos;s gameplay, because not only new weapons might be used, but also a new horde mode can be played. It requires staying alive for specific time on a map (till dawn to be exact), meanwhile you are attack by enemies. Horde mode is not an original thing nowadays, but in &quot;Alan Wake&apos;s American Nightmare&quot; it was better than in many other games you know.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960864">Expand</a></span>

In this chapter Alan is trying to escape from the Dark Place by writing a script of a twisted TV show, where he can alter reality and defeat his doppelganger, Mr. Scratch as he tries to take over Alan&apos;s life in the &apos;real world&apos;.
<br>
<br>The game brings some fixes of its prequel. The horrible and non-reactive controls are  fortunately  things of the past. It&apos;s a much more combat focused game, which is proven by a wast array of weapons you can find, from UZI to combat shotgun. The game introduces some  though not many  new elements and mechanics. There are new enemies like the Splitter, who splits into two when your flashlight is pointed at him. The area map and HUD are reworked, where scripts and points of interest are indicated. It&apos;s a nice addition since on the contrary of the first game, here you are encouraged to find those &quot;damn&quot; sheets of papers. You can get better weapons and it is fun, too.
<br>
<br>While Alan Wake&apos;s story was controversial but well written, the same can&apos;t be said about this chapter. It sometimes feels rushed and underdeveloped. At least the ending is much more clearer now. The part where the game disappoints the most is the level design. There three only three levels non of which are large to say the least. In addition to this, each of the levels are reused 3 times. In the frame of the story it is understandable but still disappointing. To make it clear, it is not a full fledged game, but neither is a rip off DLC. It&apos;s something between, a full game with arcade length.
<br>
<br>Alan&apos;s newest script shouldn&apos;t take longer than 4 hours to finish (6 with all the collectibles). Be aware though that normal in this game is easy compared to the prequel, so if you are up to it, try Nightmare difficulty. This can be explained by the combat focused nature of the game. You&apos;ll never have to roam trying to find ammunition and your flashlight recharges a lot faster than in the first game. There is a new game mode called Arcade Challenge. It&apos;s a simple addition where you have to survive until dawn and score as many points as you can with limited ammunition. You can squeeze a couple of extra hours out of this game mode, but don&apos;t expect dozens of hours of fun. On one side this game mode should have been in the first game, but with those horrid controls nobody would&apos;ve played it.
<br>
<br>Alan Wake&apos;s American Nightmare is not a propel sequel to Alan Wake but it&apos;s a nice side story which every fan will enjoy. The game falls short in some places to the prequel (story, level design) but bests it in other areas (controls, combat).

The time loop idea is nice, but they should have added more new things for each time loop. It&apos;s a good thing that they added some new weapons and a new story, so it&apos;s not too bad at all. Not as good as the original but you should get it if you like the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449333">Expand</a></span>

<br>Worst it&apos;s three small levels which you just play through three times EACH and they barely change from visit to visit.
<br>The new wepaons are not just overpowerful but you get an absolute surfeit of ammo so never come close to running low on rounds or batteries.
<br>
<br>If you do play it I recomment using the Nightmare difficulty because Normal is actually insultingly easy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3970569">Expand</a></span>

<br>I enjoyed Alan Wake, although I had some pretty serious gripes about the gameplay. Thankfully all the things that annoyed me about the original game (control being temporarily wrenched away from the player every time enemies approached was the worst) have gone from this follow-up. As a result this short episode is a much more satisfying, if brief, experience (there are only about 6 hours of main story gameplay here, although there is an arcade game tagged on, which is basically a survival mode where you&#x2019;re pitted against waves of enemies). The story has an unusual, Groundhog Day structure which entails the player repeating tasks several times in an effort to defeat the main enemy, Mr Scratch. This sounds dull but it isn&#x2019;t because the atmosphere and combat are enjoyable enough to remain fresh through the few hours it takes to complete. I also liked the use of FMV cutscenes, which, sadly, are a rare thing these days (it took me back to 90s -- the heyday for FMV games). Overall AWAN is an improvement on the original game. I do feel, however, that Remedy will have to come up with a stronger storyline to keep the player&#x2019;s interest for a full-length campaign in AW2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4196592">Expand</a></span>

On one hand, combat is vastly improved over the original game, opting for a more action oriented experience rather than a survival romp through the darkness. It becomes immensely fun wielding a flashlight on one hand and blasting away Taken with an assault rifle on the other. This in addition with a scored and ranked arcade mode encourages the already fun combat without the need to spill blood (or darkness in this case). But pertaining to this game&apos;s sins, the story continues the mysterious and quirky Twin Peaks vibe  that the original nailed. However the differences are night and day, the antagonist this time around, your evil twin, fails to really spark an incentive to do much around the semi open world of Night Springs. Also what really checks off as a smack to the face is SPOILER ALERT: the use of time loops to repeat the same game THREE TIMES. I&apos;m not even kidding. They had the opportunity to really utilize the already creative gameplay of American Nightmare by using its semi open world for extra doo dads, but instead opts to send you to do the same task three times, albeit with different enemies. The selling point of this game would be its fun factor and vibe, and even then the fun only got me three hours out of this downloadable content, and I had to repeat the game three times mind you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5365437">Expand</a></span>

Its main purpose is to expand upon original game&apos;s ending and it does it fairly decent. Alan having an evil doppelganger which he must face is cool idea. Too bad game itself is strongly repetative, whole storyline takes place over 1 chapter which you need to replay 2 more times where Alan carries what he learned forward to the next one to accomplish his goal. Thankfully you dont need to do everything 3 times, some of it is done  for you while you go thru storyline to save you frustration. Horde mode is fun, but not for long. Graphicly its less impressive than original which makes it easier to run thankfully. Gameplay also feels bit improved over the original.
<br>
<br>Overall solid expansion, if you loved Alan Wake you should consider getting this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=6783116">Expand</a></span>

Too big for a DLC but not quite a sequel, its more of an expansion. Nightmare features what feels like quadruple the available weapons, faster flashlight energy regeneration, more responsive controls and more action-oriented encounters. There are some who decry Nightmare as of inferior quality to the base game, and while it does offer an explanation for why its the same three levels repeated three times with differences only in dialogue and enemy placement, that&apos;s still obvious repetition. Regardless of this, it really does play a lot better mechanically. It includes the obligatory wave survival mode for those inclined. It also offers an incentive for tracking down the manuscript pages beyond backstory, as they are required to access lockboxes containing new weapons- however, I found the most useful weapon to be the crossbow, accessible on the third level and found simply hanging on a tree, no manuscript pages necessary. A harder cap is placed on your flares and flashbangs, but ammunition is much more plentiful to account for the more frequent enemies encountered, as well as newer, tougher enemies.
<br>
<br>We find a slightly older Alan, now in plaid work shirt and jeans instead of his stuffy tweed jacket, and much more experienced in facing the shadows that haunt him. Trapped in a Twilight Zone version of a Arizona highway-side town, Alan faces a cruel doppleganger called Mr. Scratch who claims to be everything he was too weak to be, but is really just a huge **** the manifestations of Alan&apos;s feelings of inadequacy as a writer and a husband. He has the opportunity to help a few people on the way.
<br>
<br>American Nightmare is a good play, but it will make little sense to anyone who has not played the first game from a story standpoint. If you have the opportunity to play the first game I strongly recommend doing so before playing American Nightmare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=7315617">Expand</a></span>

From the plot there are only scraps: it&apos;s been 2 years since the first game, Alan Wake has transferred itself to the TV and tries to kill his evil twin. This is the whole story! No surprises and plot twists. The game and looks very cheap. Staging is lame, the graphics are too bright for a &quot;dark&quot; game.
<br>
<br>The game has 3 locations. They are not interesting. On lacazia there is one female character. These female characters are boring and flat. The dialogue was dull verbiage. In the original game was an exciting plot, interesting dialogues and characters. In AMERICAN NIGHTMARE all gone! But the developers have much improved combat system. Gameplay is now more alert, and the opponents become more diverse. For example, we have razvivayuscikhsya enemies, enemies that turn into crows, and spiders. Gameplay became more cheerful, which is good, and shoot enemies is not boring. The whole game is shooting enemies.
<br>
<br>You can still collect the pages that are still fun to read. The radio is interesting to listen to, since there we learn the fate of our familiar characters. TVs remained the same, only this time we see our evil twin, who creates different mess. It&apos;s funny, but pointless.
<br>
<br>The whole game was amusing, but pointless. It&apos;s not Alan Wake! In Alan Wake the main story, not mindless shooting. The game is boring, except sterby there&apos;s nothing here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/user-reviews?user_review_id=7407140">Expand</a></span>

<br>Three locations, three girls with the models from 2006, the time loop, wandering according to the same three locations, the same three times in a row and that&apos;s it. Added new weapons, new hud, now Alan can run more than five meters without shortness of breath and recharge time can Shine into enemies. The start was not bad, but to run and perform the same task in three maps tires, if removed one phase (and made two of three), it would be much better, but so disappointed. DLC can be done in 2-3 hours, as is arcade mode. Not worth the money.
