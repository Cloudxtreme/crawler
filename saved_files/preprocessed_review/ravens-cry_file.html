Ok, nevermind, I&apos;ll just go free sail like in Black Flag at least. NOPE. There is no free sailing. You go from predetermined point A to point B ONLY, and things might happen on the way. The facepalms almost went right through my skull. Is it worth it? Well, after 2+ years of patching and at a 90% sale, it might be. At least when nothing is moving it looks kinda nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravens-cry/user-reviews?user_review_id=4941189">Expand</a></span>

<br>The constant delays of the title, the minute release of information regarding it . . . it all served just to push that want of the title to see the light of day. At the same time, those also served as warning signs of a faulty development cycle &#x2013; and this holds true. While there is a spark of life to be found here, almost everything from the art assets, to performance, to the under developed mechanics, and even the obviously cut content. Everything about this title screams &#x201C;I&apos;m not a finished product&#x201D;, though we see it for digital download all the same, and at full retail price at that. Long story short, this game is not fit for purchase.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t consider this a review . . . this is a PSA.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy Raven&apos;s Cry.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t support these sort of decisions.

It is outright fraud and I hope this studio goes bankrupt and the owners go to jail for fraud. GAME SUCKS.</span>

<br>Raven&apos;s Cry has to be one of the worst games i&apos;ve played in recent years; it did nothing right.  The game is completely broken, even worse than Sonic Boom&apos;s standards.  The worst part about it is that it sometimes erases your game entirely!  The game itself is trash; the combat is just mashing a button until you win, the frame rate is choppy, and the dialogue is stupid.  But do you want to know what the worst part about this game is?  It&apos;s packed to the brim with homophobia, racism, and sexism.  It&apos;s not like South Park: The Stick of Truth where they just mention it and move on, it&apos;s practically EVERYWHERE.  Did they not see that it was offensive?  This game is absolute disaster, it&apos;s so bad, it&apos;s painful.  If you bought this game thinking it was a good game... I am so sorry.
<br>
<br>Raven&apos;s Cry gets a 1/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravens-cry/user-reviews?user_review_id=5868545">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s so much wrong with Raven&apos;s Cry. When I looked it up at GameSpot in its review, I thought this reminds me how bad  Ride To Hell: Retribution really is and now you have the opposite of sucking so hard. All I&apos;m saying is, the script is lame, weak mechanics, incohesive level design, shoddy voice acting (Take notes, OG Resident Evil), and surprise. Millions upon millions of cringeworthy bugs galore. I hope just like they removed Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma, wait till I&apos;m laughing at this game while Steam should do the right thing as well.
<br>
<br>As a matter of fact, I should make my own Change.org petition and send a message to whoever made this crap. Just make a disappearing act and go away for good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravens-cry/user-reviews?user_review_id=5883505">Expand</a></span>

It feels like a game in its alpha stage. The mechanics, ideas are there, but the way they did everything is extremely bad.
<br>
<br>The game feels sluggish, movement is somewhat responsive, but it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re moving a person, more like a box with a pair of legs. Combat is absolutely horrible, it&apos;s binary and is basically one button mashing until the red bar on the top of your screen disappears, no skill needed. Not to mention the forced stealth sections that were put in the game for absolutely no reason at all. Tutorials on anything are absolutely horrible, it&apos;s like they&apos;ve been done for the sake of being done, not to teach the player how to play the game.
<br>There are quite a few cutscenes in the game and they all are awful. Voice actors don&apos;t even seem like they are trying, lip syncing is either very bad, non existent or the mouth literally does not move. Sometimes there is no voice at all only the mouth movement, or neither of the two. The characters barely move during cutscenes - the entire face is stone cold 90% of the time, no facial expressions regardless weather the character is shouting, scared, angry, etc.
<br>
<br>There is one good thing - the ship fighting, it&apos;s pretty interesting, has nice mechanics, is somewhat well made.
<br>
<br>There is no way this game is worth 49.49&#x20AC;, not until they finish it. At best it&apos;s a 10&#x20AC; project in it&apos;s alpha state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravens-cry/user-reviews?user_review_id=4943672">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is no free sailing on the seas to attack ships or around the islands, the towns have little to offer in the way of interaction, its a far cry from the elder scrolls where you may loot even the forks off the tables, explore anywhere, interact with any npcs you see fit, you get the picture.

<br>Yet that game gets 9-10 points because it is pretty and have studio with hundred employee and huge publisher backing them so they can spent budged of Reality Pump only on voice actors, not to mention huge marketing campaign

<br>
<br>If you are waiting for a game as &quot; assassins creed black flag&quot; forget. But if you are waiting for a different game but similar to AC BF maybe this game is not a bad idea.
This game is a different game but in many ways resemble the &quot; asssassins creed BF&quot;

<br>If you are waiting for a game as &quot; assassins creed black flag&quot; forget. But if you are waiting for a different game but similar to AC BF maybe this game is not a bad idea.
<br>This game is a different game but in many ways resemble the &quot; asssassins creed BF&quot;
<br>
<br>Despite my expectations are such a good game or better than &quot; Assassins creed black flag&quot;
<br>The truth is that the legends are not manufactured every year , but rather appear from time to time . It is unfair to be demanding a computer game as good or better than the &quot; Assassins creed BF&quot;.
<br>
<br>Let see:
<br>
<br>- Naval battles:
<br>
<br>Yes, it&apos;s identical to AC BF, but the commands are more complicated and the guns are not so accurate.
<br>We have various types of ammunition and unlike AC BF board the ship is not very easy.
<br>In this game we can buy other boats and make upgrades in them as in AC BF
<br>The line of fire is equal to the AC however has only one direction and is controlled only up and down. Has more realism to be this way, is not as arcade style.
<br>The death in the crew is the same as AC. Depending we being targeted the crew dies.
<br>
<br>- Trade and earn money
<br>
<br>Yes, we can buy and sell goods where it is most profitable.
<br>We won more board a ship instead of destroying it
<br>
<br>- Fights
<br>
<br>The commands are more complicated and not so spontaneous.
<br>We have various kinds of items to equip, swords, pistols, etc. and we can buy a wide range of options.
<br>Defend sword attack is much more hard than the AC BF, and sometimes it makes little sense.  If we are not facing enemy no need to defend because we are always hurted.... The animation when the enemy is hit is not as good as AC BF.
<br>Ammunition for the pistol are very expensive. One bullet costs 100 (One shot only). change the ship&apos;s sails for example are 150 ..
<br>We can kill the enemy without him repair, but always on the ground as opposed to AC.
<br>Sometimes the movements are stopped, but it&apos;s nothing special.
<br>Only some weapons we can get from the dead bodies, but we can loot something else
<br>
<br>- Graphics, dialogs and history.
<br>
<br>The dialogues have a bug, sometimes the actors lose the voice and put subtitles to replace the sound.
<br>The graphics are good and the atmosphere is pleasant and realistic.
<br>We have the main story and many other quests over playing time.
<br>The graphics from time to time have bugs but nothing serious.
<br>Sometimes the player gets stuck in the scenario.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravens-cry/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944115">Expand</a></span>

TopWare makes the calls, and RP does everything in their power to make the best game they can with the resources they have, so also, give these RP guys a damn break. Granted, they&apos;re still charging AAA prices and that ultimately is hurting them, but again, that&apos;s the publisher&apos;s call, not the dev studio. With all that said the story is legit, and the graphics definitely have some redeeming factors. But let&apos;s all agree that this game is nothing like it could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ravens-cry/user-reviews?user_review_id=4951975">Expand</a></span>
