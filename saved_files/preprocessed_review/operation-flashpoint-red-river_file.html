(PC version). It&apos;s got elements that make other games rethink their approach and it&apos;s got elements that are totally wrong. Cm claim open world, squad based coop play, also this is available on all platforms unlike other games that are not cross platform.<br><br>Over complex? NO in fact it&apos;s too simple, the game modes are restricted to coop only NO PvP, the control is good but the AI are average on both your side &amp; the enemies. Cm focused on authenticity &amp; look (as claimed by themselves in YT videos), but this is flawed because the mechanics of the game has problems, primarily due to the game engine itself restricting key elements that are needed for this type of game (tether free &amp; long draw distances). The players are still locked into a prehistoric distance tether which means your squad are limited to the distance they can move from each other (game engine restriction). The look is good and scores well but games are not all about looks, Cm seem to think they are but they forget, games are about function, the ability to do what they claim and RR falls down on many occasions with this problem.<br><br>Overall I rated RR 6/10 simply because it was entertaining/ fun, it looked good and it does function well most of the time, but it is also frustrating with average/poor AI (no replacement for real players), bugs in some basic controls and restrictive play (funnelled) although Cm claim open world by their definition.<br><br>OFP 3 RR is worth a buy when it hits bargain bucket but not at full price.<br><br>They need to focus on throwing out the restrictive play and make the game feel more open. Cm don&apos;t listen to their community much as they have been saying for along time, make it open world, make it tether free, make it PvP, Cm did the exact opposite, still on console there is nothing close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600571">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps I should be posting this in the PS3 page for the game, but since there is 0 difference across the versions apart from a video options menu in the PC version, it doesn&apos;t make much of a difference.<br><br>I&apos;ll preface by saying I&apos;m a major fan of the creators of Operation Flashpoint, Bohemia Interactive, and I&apos;ve played all of their games up until now with the most recent release being the DLC for Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead entitled Private Military Company. I will also say that I played Codemasters&apos; previous OFP title, Dragon Rising, and while I really disliked it, I did not dislike it anywhere near the level that I dislike this game.<br><br>First off, the game isn&apos;t realistic by any medium outside of bullets having the potential to kill you in one hit. You have a magical healing bag that was indeed in DR before this, but you had a limit as to how many times you could use it back then. Essentially it&apos;s just regenerating health seen in many FPS games nowadays without being automatic. The command radial is significantly simplified from DR, allowing for only very basic and fewer commands to be given to your AI squad mates. CM called this game a tactical shooter, and that would be true if you&apos;re someone who considers a game like Call of Duty to be a tactical shooter, but a tactical shooter in my eyes is something along the lines of the original Ghost Recons and Rainbow Sixes.<br><br>The gameplay itself is nothing short of average. You can sprint (what&apos;s funny here is that it&apos;s still largely unlimited, like DR. You&apos;ll never have to sprint for as long as is needed to have the game force you to stop), you can quickly vault small fences, you have the aforementioned magical healing bag and simplified squad command system. There is little to no weapon sway and recoil, but a huge amount of dispersion from incoming fire, likely because the infamous &quot;dispersion shield&quot; programmed into DR remains in RR to make things easier. Your shots, however, are almost dead-on all the time. There is still no lean ability, no matter what platform you play it on.<br><br>I won&apos;t go much into the campaign or the drivel that they&apos;ve called a &quot;story&quot;, because it&apos;s not worth doing so. In short, you&apos;re a badass Marine sent to badass Tajikistan under badass Sergeant McRacist, as PC Gamer aptly coined him, killing some horrible anti-freedom **** until there ain&apos;t none of them left. The writing in the game is so appauling that it gets to the point that you just can&apos;t help but laugh at it (and apparently the game&apos;s &quot;Creative Director&quot;, Sion Lenton, who was the head-honcho for DR&apos;s development, wrote the script. So really, I&apos;m not surprised here). Yeah, the campaign sucks and is ridiculously cliched.<br><br>The AI are terrible, and this is coming from a guy well-experienced with difficult AI as a result of playing BIS&apos; games. They do not follow your orders, they cannot hit anything, and they disregard all danger to come and sit immobilized to revive you if you go down. Playing the game in coop, a feature CM greatly pushed with this game, even with the &quot;hardcore&quot; mode on, is laughable if you have 3 other experienced players taking on these moronic AI opponents. The constant and repeating messages from headquarters will give you a headache, as will you and your allies shouting &quot;Dead!&quot; and &quot;In the ground!&quot; almost every time you kill an opponent. Finally, given how you have a waypoint every few feet when you&apos;re on a vehicle on a road, I&apos;m going to take a wild guess and say that the AI still can&apos;t recognize roads, just like they couldn&apos;t in DR.<br><br>Also, the PC version has no mission editor and no mod support whatsoever this time around, even after the lacking-but-at-least-included presence of both in DR.<br><br>In short, if you like wasting money average, nothing-special first person shooters that have so flooded today&apos;s market, then go ahead and buy Red River. Otherwise, don&apos;t waste your money. Taking out of the equation that CM are continuing to rape the OFP name and all it stands for, the game is even less decent than Dragon Rising before it, and that is certainly an accomplishment in my eyes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600180">Expand</a></span>

Though I was offered the game for free, the price does not justify the lost time it takes to see this games details spread over an obnoxiously long time. Clearly, there will be no sequel.</span>

If they added a cover system the firefights would actually be fun. Your character gets caught on the smallest possible rocks and cant move and that gets annoying, The animations are a bit choppy and overall its just so low on content its all the same. You go in, shoot guys, try to get to extraction, helo cant land because too many bad guys, your fireteam gets raped. and then you win. All this in 5-10 minutes. Campaign is boring. You fight for 3 minutes then get back to a in-game cutscene. Overall i feel like the game was a prototype for arma 3. Almost as if it was testing the new engine with the graphics and physics. So basically in a summary. The game isnt worth $50, its worth $20 at the most and its just another kill, kill, kill, respawn, repeat.  And if you read anywhere that this is a tactical shooter. Get your facts straight, just because you can give orders to a mediocre AI doesnt make the game a tactical shooter. A game that relies on skill, teamwork, and communication is a tactical shooter. A beginner could take on this game as a lone wolf on the hardest difficulty and still make it through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1656437">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game has no PVP at all so what you are left with is very poor enemy AI who always spawn in the same places, you you attempt to move slight off the corridor where you need to fighting you die, invisible walls of death spring to mind.
<br>
<br>Codemasters said they wanted to open the game up and make it more accessable, to do that they took away the ability to use APC/Tanks and Helicopters, reduced the tether limit, deleted the mission editor (Massive Mistake) and gave everyone an aimbot!
<br>
<br>All in all the game doesn&apos;t live up to the previous version, and you would really have to question the longevity of a game that has so few options.
<br>
<br>Lets all not forget Codemasters dropped support for Dragon Rising after 1 month!  with DLC Red River will become boring fast and it doesn&apos;t bring anything fresh to the Market place.
<br>
<br>My advice await for BF3 and if you really need to get a copy of this game, get it for the PS3/Xbox360 in the bargin bin in about 2/3 months.
<br>
<br>Not happy Jan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600045">Expand</a></span>

Bullet impacts aren&apos;t realistic though and ballistics are just a mess.  This game is arcade through and through and corridor to the core.  It is so corridor that most of the time you are riding in the back of a vehicle listening to useless banter by a character that just was boring.  The AI walks out into the open and crosses firing lanes randomly, there is no cover system and objects that are shot simply explode into nothing instead of breaking apart.  I shot a wagon object once and it just popped out of existence.<br><br>So all in all this game was obviously rushed with no sense of imagination or invention.  NOTHING is original other than its ability to quite possibly be the worst game I have every played in its genre.  It is the first game i have ever bothered to take back for a refund and I will be very very cautious to ever purchase any other future titles.<br><br>Once you make one amazing title and it sticks for years, why make Red River?  Why not stick to what worked for you and continue building onto it?  Save your money and time and buy pong or something because this title took a nose dive before the first package was opened.<br><br>Jazzif<br>Just some random gamer!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1677739">Expand</a></span>

<br>Operation Flashpoint: Red River removes everything that is associated with a flashpoint game; Realism, tactical combat, , non-linear levels, multiplayer, freedom, community and modding. This is by far the worst game I have ever played, and as a sequel, its utterly disgusting. I hope people give me an apologize for not to writing anything more; this game barely deserves a review. If you have doubts, read other reviews, but most of all, play the game.

It is improved but not all-round, which is a pity, the game plays well and AI are decent for the most part, a patch from the developer should sort out some minor problems in certain situations.<br><br>The atmosphere is good and the game is not riddled with over complexity to make you think you need a degree course in command and control like some other games in this field.  It looks very good too with only minor visual artifacts like the muzzle flash lighting up the ground for a couple of meters (as if you were starting a bonfire).<br><br>I enjoyed the game and have replayed the missions with friends and it does vary the second/ third time around which is nice. The only real problem is there is not enough content and most vehicles are none drivable, so get use to walking. In general GOOD FUN, GOOD VISUALS, GOOD CONTROL. OFP RR is a step forward from DR but not that big. A big plus is this game can be enjoyed on my X360 too when on holiday, while the weather is bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600607">Expand</a></span>

All I can say is that its a pretty solid squad based game which is highly playable in SP with 3AI squad mates but as with most games there are some very minor AI path glitches you just repeat the command again or move slightly or wait for the AI to sort itself out (which is does at all times). Its designed more around 3 Co-OP squad mates than SP anyway &amp; all the MP is Co-Op based you just start a match &amp; invite friends or let randoms join you decide how &amp; can select plenty of other MP options to kick/host private matches etc etc.
<br>
<br>As a game this plays like a cross between: Ghost Recon &amp; Rainbow Six Vegas but set in the Afghanistan hills/villages. No QTE&apos;s whatsoever in this game anywhere for once you the player get to chose what you do gameplay wise but there are set objectives for each mission &amp; some need doing within a reasonable time limit (the ingame pace is slow/careful most of the time anyway). If you stray too far away from the mission area you get warned by text &amp; the screen starts to distort giving you enough time to return otherwise you fail the mission. In each of the 10 Campaign missions you get a bunch of sub goals to achieve before it will be complete. Some missions take well over an hour to complete as well its all about squad tactics &amp; the right weapon at the right time if you go in all guns blazing thats not always the best way to do this so unlike most recent games you actually have to use your brain a lot!!
<br>
<br>I would say it has at least twice the gameplay of Crysis2+CODBlack Ops combined!!! (not hard I know!! LOL).
<br>
<br>Ignore most mainstream reviews as well they were not paying attention especially all the BS about controls not working at all or units not responding duh that&apos;s because in some missions you cannot just call in air/ground support strikes from copters/planes/tanks/AA guns until you get the radio messages to say so its not like you have unlimited strike calls only in some missions &amp; only when the time is right like you knocked out the ground AA so the jets can launch missiles etc etc. This is a game you have to pay attention in to hear the audio messages as it does not guide you on rails or hold your hand much (although it does generate ingame markers to the next objective).
<br>
<br>The gfx are reasonable. It uses the EGO engine again and is DX9 only. Plenty of graphical options to adjust (2 pages worth) but its very well made so runs a constant 60FPS @ 1920x1200 with max everything including x8MSAA. For some reason it only supports Trilinear x8AF &amp; as with most recent PC games there are several low res console textures but they are not that noticeable &amp; no worse than other recent games. The big thing about the gfx are the size of the battle field its absolutely massive (not quite Fallout3 but bigger than any other PC FPS I can think of) &amp; there is zero ingame loading (even the between missions loading is minimal anyway).
<br>
<br>Audio is passable &amp; the ingame troop banter is full of swear words especially Sgt Knox (played by the actor Al Matthews who played the squad sgt in the movie Aliens in 1986!!! he is also quite funny &amp; well OTT. The tone of the game is Team America vs Insurgents!
<br>
<br>Controls are pretty flawless. Keyboard + Mouse are fully configurable it also supports both the wired/wireless X360 controller. There was a day 1 patch (takes less than 2 mins to update/download) which fixes some very minor issues.
<br>
<br>There are several menus for customising your character class &amp; other game aspects like ingame menus/positions etc etc. If you play it on hardcore you get no ingame onscreen menus at all so need a good memory for all the commands but will struggle to survive unless you have 3 decent human Co-Op players. It obviously uses GFWL for LIVE achievements/Co-Op but thats pretty seamless nowadays just make sure your using an online profile &amp; your good to go for Co-Op.
<br>
<br>Not the best game ever made by far but also not the worse &amp; pretty solid &amp; bugs/glitches are very very low &amp; unusually for a 2011 PC game you have to think for yourself &amp; not just hit a single button to progress! I would give it 7.5/10 overall if it had ultra high res textures then perhaps a little more but you do not notice the low res ones that much anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600704">Expand</a></span>

Get this if you want a hiking simulator, because all you will be doing is running many miles along a road, killing waves of stupid AI enemies. Sure glad I didn&apos;t buy this.

It is plagued by three things a game like this cannot allow itself  lack of any actual realism, idiotic AI and bad, unresponsive controls. Headbobbing while sprinting is as far as realism goes. The player can heal himself infinite number of times and keep on going like nothing happened, guns sound like toys and there&apos;s no real recoil etc. The friendly AI will constantly stand out in open space, right next to a very convenient cover, numerous times they will casually walk into your line of fire. Enemy AI is no better, as it just keeps randomly running around in the open while it&apos;s constantly fired upon and often displaying godlike perception and precision. The controls are horrible  the mouse keeps flying around even with sensitivity at minimum, some actions cannot be interrupted or multiple things done simultaneously(like crouching while reloading), the prone stance keeps throwing your aim into the sky so it&apos;s utterly useless unless you plan going prone a meter from an enemy. It is accompanied by mediocre graphics and bland, uninspired voiceovers that are either your typical marine chatter or your sergeant swearing at you for the 5th time because you can&apos;t snipe a target 200 meters away using an M16. It gets a 1, just for managing to give an illusion of realism and actual infantry warfare for a brief time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=2879960">Expand</a></span>

I even reinstalled DR just to be sure.  I DO miss the editor, but even that was not great in DR compared to ARMA 2.  The movement and control of your people is much more accurate and just feels better then in DR where I feel like I&apos;m walking around in mud.  The re-playability is terrific and makes you want to try the different soldier classes just to be able to unlock more weapon options.  The tracer ricochet effects are well done as are the echo effects of the guns firing. There are some annoyances however such as: you can&apos;t skip the long ingress or egress of the missions where you have to listen to Knox rambling about his 10 rules to live by while riding in the back of your transport, be it a chopper or truck.  You CAN skip the campaign intro movies however.  Another issue and perhaps the biggest in the game (yes even after the latest patch) is the trouble of your AI constantly walking in front of you while you are engaging the enemy.  I wish the dev&apos;s would/could make it so that if you are aiming, the squad AI wouldn&apos;t move in front of you.  They HAVE fixed the issue with your squad AI not taking cover when being attacked.  At least it&apos;s significantly better then before the patch!  I find the best option when playing with AI controlled squad-mates is to just tell them to hold position at a nearby wall or structure.  That seems to keep them safe&apos;ish and out of your way!  The scenic vistas are well done as is the heat effect coming from the ground.  Really makes it feel more believable.  I even like the banter between the different company&apos;s: Alpha, Bravo (you), and Charlie.  The real focus of the game is the multiplayer, in which case you don&apos;t have to worry about the issues I mentioned regarding the AI.  If you want to take a break from the fairly lengthy campaign missions there are a number of Fire Team Engagements for you to test your skills in both single and multiplayer.  Sometimes it&apos;s a nice change, and the missions for the most part are much shorter, but you can still level up you character!  Almost every time I play the game I see something new that impresses me.  You&apos;ll see enemies come to the aid of others who are down but not dead, and you&apos;re own squad mates will actually USE a grenade launcher if so equipped to take out a vehicle or whatnot.  It&apos;s really quite impressive when you see them switch to their secondary weapon to clear a building if it&apos;s more appropriate.  There are still some issues that need to be addressed, but for someone who likes an FPS with a modern combat focus this is a great option.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1665903">Expand</a></span>

When I saw Red RIver and its feature set (I also know its heritage and don&apos;t care for the BIS vs. CM partisan attitudes) I thought this might be the title I was looking for i.e the expansive game areas and tactical gameplay of Arma 2, combined with the fluid movement/animations of COD/BF type titles, all wrapped up in co-op multiplayer that I can enjoy with mates. Red River delivers this and is squarley aimed at co-op multiplayer, to the point where single player is good (but not great) and PvP is absent altogether....a brave move really and one that suits me just fine. It also concentrates on the infantry and doesn&apos;t spread itself too thin by trying to make every entity player controllable with the inevitable loss of fidelity that squeezing you into a helicopter one minute and tank the next brings with it....this is a godo thing in my book, as I have other titles that fulfill those other needs.
<br>
<br>So from and infantry perspective, the weapons are well modelled with tactical and open bolt reloads and there&apos;s a player progression, which opens up attachments and expanded primary and secondary choices.....this is also a good thing as it gives some objectives to aim for a extends replayability.
<br>
<br>AI is as passable as most other titles out there (there are a few annoyances), but as mentioned before co-op multi-play is where this title&apos;s at and to appreciate Red River properly you really need some online buddies to go into action with to get the best experience.
<br>
<br>Graphically things look pretty good, with some good effects (heat haze is one of them) - not as good as say Frostbite2 or CryEngine3, but better than most engines out there currently.
<br>
<br>There are a few downsides, which are by no means showstoppers, but do affect enjoyment or replayability and they are: 1. Despite the vistas you see promising vast expanses such as those seen in Arma2, the actual gameplay areas are limited, so what you see is not quite what you can explore (or use for flanking). They&apos;re not tiny, but they are not as arge as the view suggests.
<br>
<br>2. The campaign is a little short and there are not enough FTE missions &quot;out of the box&quot; i.e. it needs more content.
<br>
<br>3. The dialogue could do a with a bit of toning down and maybe switching &quot;transmit mode&quot; off on Sgt Knox once in a while and inject a bit of humour to go along with the bombast.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: a worthwhile and pretty unique title amongst FPSs, which could carve itself a niche in the market, provided the baseline product keeps its current focus, gets new content and refines what it has in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=1672955">Expand</a></span>

OMG its another MS LIVE game. If I had noticed it I wouldnt have bothered with the download free or not.   I buy a lot of games and rarely have an issue but for some reason, my every engagement with MS LIVE service is extremely poor.... But guess what!?........<br><br>No, just kidding, this was terrible too.  Firstly wont connect properly to live. Then gives me message about registration and will not register the CD key.  Then wants me to open my security and change my router etc etc.  Erm... No.   Everything else I actually wanted works fine and I dont expect to make this much effort for one  game.  But I figure I better check out how awesome this game must be to justify lifting my skirts for MS LIVE to pry into my life.  I guess I am not missing anything I tried to play this for a short while but it feels very old indeed.   Boring tired take on a genre with many many better choices.  Burden something like this with MS LIVE and you cant even give it away.&gt; Seriously, I deleted it already.

I am genuinely angry at how underrated this game is.
<br>To understand what makes this such a fantastic game first we have to look at what is wrong with FPS games today. Due to limited space I shall focus on the market leader Call of Duty. Cod 4 was unarguably a masterpiece but every Cod since has simply been a re-branded multiplayer,  new maps, new weapons and prettier. And an ever weaker campaign; lots of explosions, ships sinking, buildings collapsing; dynamic events which should spice up game play, but in practice force you to follow a much more linear path through the battlefield. These melodramatic, poorly written, repetitive scenes suck time and money from more important things like game play. Granted call of duty have had a few good game ideas like zombies and spec ops aswell as tank missions but these just compete for space. Why not make some slightly original games out of these. The last good tank game I played was from the 90s.
<br>If only there was a game like the much more understated (yes I admit a nuclear bomb goes off in your face at one point,) Cod 4. A shooter that is fun because you enjoy shooting things and being the SAS not because you sink a fleet, crash a train, watch chemical weapons used on kids, visit just about every capital city you&apos;d ever want to, blow up a castle and whatever. It&apos;s too much!
<br>Red River gives you 10 missions each lasting a good hour to get to know your character and environment, a small war where you can understand whats going on and feel like you&apos;re making a difference. Crucially unlike Cod you actually feel threatened by your enemy, not because you really believe they just gassed most of Europe and have a lot of ships for you to blow up. But because getting shot is actually sorta serious. One shot can and does kill, even if it doesn&apos;t you can&apos;t just hide behind a wall you have to take time to heal yourself, and while your doing that the enemy is closing in, fast. And when they get close they are really dangerous. So much so that you find yourself avoiding close combat except when you have no choice. You slowly, carefully inch round corners not daring to breathe and when eventually you come to a corner with an enemy behind. That fraction of a second in which you must take them down is infinitely more satisfying or more frustrating even than the multiplayer on Cod 4, yes it wasn&apos;t another player but it took you 10 minutes to get here not 10 seconds after your 10th respawn this match.
<br>And dying really does matter not just because of fewer checkpoints or limited lives in some game modes but because it counts! Just to tell you how s*** you are! The shame when I reached 200 deaths, the statistic floating across the loading screen infront of my friends and family.
<br>The other complaints I have about the Cod campaigns now are length and linearity. Linearity means all playthroughs are the same diminishing replay value meaning you get less time enjoying the game.
<br>While not a true sandbox Flashpoint has huge open maps. Which allow you to plan, flank, snipe, and use your team how you want. In other words you engage your brain rather than just pointing shooting and following.
<br>Moving swiftly on; playtime; it took me around 50 hours to fully level up my classes,  I now have well over 100 hours play time. Point is I still haven&apos;t got bored. Now if you only play through it once how long will it take. A sensible time to complete the campaign and side missions would be no less than 15 hours. Additionally if you want to get gold medals on everything it will take you at least the better part of 50 hours.
<br>So why are there so many bad reviews? There are five reasons for this.
<br>Firstly as an FPS a lot of players who try it enjoy Cod or the ridiculous dragon rising and their expectation is for the game to be like those so they are naturally disappointed.
<br>Secondly the difficulty. You cannot throw yourself around you have to learn a new play style and it is quite easy to come off Cod and find it hard at first.
<br>Thirdly something that annoys me; un skippable and rather lengthy briefs obviously intended to build tension but they get boring.
<br>Fourth vehicular game play; there are several rather annoying issues with the transport vehicles in the game however these only make up a small fraction of game play and are rarely mission essential.
<br>Finally glitches. There are quite a few; mostly AI getting stuck. However the reason this is annoying is unlike in other games where they might show you the way or open a door the AI in flash point are useful in a firefight.
<br>Other than the issues mentioned previously I feel the game would benefit from more intelligent enemies and yet more maps and missions.
<br>Despite my criticisms this is the most fun game I own and that is all a game is for, that is why it is so far ahead of the overly self important Cod, and it is steadily gaining a cult following.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-red-river/user-reviews?user_review_id=4242011">Expand</a></span>
