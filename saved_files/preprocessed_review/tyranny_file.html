<br>First the bad stuff.  The game has some rough spots, many of them technical.  However, if you&apos;ve played an Obsidian (or Troika.  Or Interplay) RPG before, you know to expect this.  The ending is very sudden--you prepare to go into battle and the credits roll instead.  The voice acting is very sparse.  Few characters have any voice acting, and I don&apos;t recall any character who is 100% voiced.  This gets most jarring when speaking with a party member who weaves in and out of being voiced as you change subjects.  This creates kind of a spoiler effect, as you&apos;ll quickly learn that any character who is voiced upon initial contact is either a recruitable party member or Archon (in one case, both).  Also, this game in involves *a lot* of reading.  I wasn&apos;t bothered by this, but I see other user reviews that were.  Lastly, some of the boss fights feel kind of cheap, either through unjustified immunities (&quot;He&apos;s immune to stuns because you fight him alone and could just stunlock him&quot; is unsatisfying for a game with such deep lore) or unintuitive recovery mechanics (I had to wiki what makes the Havoc suddenly revert to full health).
<br>
<br>Now the good stuff.  This game feels like a reconstruction of the isometric RPG games that fell out of favor in the early 2000s.  Combat is satisfying and the writing is excellent.  This game handles moral choices in a way that seems much more realistic than usual.  For example, in BioShock, you can harvest the Little Sister for a big reward now, or you can spare her for a small reward now and a much bigger one later.  In Tyranny, doing good is hard, much like in the real world.  You can burn the village as you were ordered to and receive the promised payment from the Archon, or you can spare it and earn the Archon&apos;s wrath for disobeying his direct order.  Choices are more meaningful because you have to weigh your conscience against your rewards, as well as whether you have the resources necessary to start a fight over what you&apos;re doing with a powerful potential enemy.  All the major factions are nuanced and have things to like and dislike about them--the Disfavored are disciplined but closed-minded and wasteful, the Scarlet Chorus are accepting but brutish, and the Tiersmen are idealistic but untrustworthy.
<br>
<br>Combat is much improved over Pillars of Eternity. Drastically fewer abilities are &quot;once per rest.&quot;  I often felt like Pillars wanted me to use per-encounter abilities and basic attacks primarily, only falling back on my class&apos;s actual specialization when necessary.  In contrast, most abilities in Tyranny can be used at will once their cooldown is over.  This makes it feel like builds actually matter, since you&apos;re actually deploying your handful of abilities in every fight.  The modular spell system is also really flexible and probably my single favorite mechanic.
<br>
<br>I have heard complaints about the game&apos;s length.  This game has so many branches that it should be pretty clear it&apos;s meant to be played more than once.  Also, don&apos;t be surprised if it takes you 45 minutes to create your first character, given the &quot;Conquest&quot; prologue.
<br>
<br>Overall, I was satisfied with this game.  It plays with the concept of good and evil and your choices mattering in ways that a lot of AAA games aren&apos;t willing to.  Some choices are admittedly less impactful than others, but a great many of them make meaningful changes to the world of Terratus.  The game is cerebral, but if you weren&apos;t expecting that from an isometric RPG, that&apos;s kind of on you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=7403069">Expand</a></span>

While for me personally it has slowly become one of my top ten games, there are some flaws that would be dishonest for me to ignore.  So first off, let&apos;s cover what works in this game and the features that the average player will enjoy.
<br>
<br>The setting: Many have commented on the uniqueness of the setting, as it has a very late bronze age feel to it.  Eschewing the atypical late middle ages trappings of most modern RPGs, the geography of the tiers and its corresponding civilizations does add a lot to the game.
<br>
<br>Music: I personally loved the soundtrack. The music exponentially adds to the emotional tone of the game and find myself listening to it frequently. Very well composed and congruent with atmosphere the developers are trying to create.
<br>
<br>Story: You&apos;ll notice that this aspect will also be in the flaws section. While it may seem contradictory, just know for now that the story at its core is excellent.  From the first act where you choose the flow of the overall war, to recruiting a myriad of companions who (Kills-in-Shadows not withstanding) are all excellently crafted and fleshed out. From the fearless and blood lusting Verse, to the forever iron bound Barik, or the young but devastatingly powerful Siren, the majority of the companions you find are exceptionally constructed characters. The loyalty of the characters can be lost or gained but the reasons for each one are consistent in the sense of staying loyal to the writing. The majority of people you encounter and the choices you are presented with, do seem to carry weight.  The premise of being a villain protagonist is fascinating and really drives your play style. Whether you choose Machiavellian fascist you wishes to impose order at all costs or become a monster reminiscent of Ramsay Bolton, you&apos;ll find a dark but unique journey into the realm of villainy.
<br>
<br>Now for the flaws:
<br>
<br>Text vs voice overs: Having grown up right at the time when RPGs were moving from walls of texts to fully voiced characters, I personally do not mind the amount of text in this game. That said, if Planescape Torment or the original Fallout games turned you off with the amount of reading necessary to get through even basic NPC encounters, this wont be your cup of tea.
<br>
<br>Combat: Personally I had no problems with the combat While it is a bit more streamlined and the difficulty has been toned down, I spent the majority of both playthroughs enjoying myself immensely. However, there is a definitely a balance issue. The game seems to favor being a brawler as magic or archer builds take substantially longer to reach a point where combat feels fun instead of being a chore.
<br>
<br>Finally the story is the biggest flaw. Not the premise or the characters but the presentation. The opening act is superb and the rest of the game is very solid. The various factions are unique though all of them often venture into the eye-rolling territory of lawful stupid or chaotic stupid.  For the most part though, the lesser parts of the narrative are at least passable. The choices you make also seem to carry impact at first, with some of them being downright discomforting on a personal level. Then, without giving anything away, you are streamlined into one path. The majority of your choices cease to matter and the final act of the game is so short and unsatisfying, that it is hard to believe any explanation other than they launched the a great deal of unfinished content.
<br>
<br>Verdict/ TLDR: A fun rpg that is definitely worth at least 1 playthrough,  but given the story flaws, seemingly missing ending,  and lack of balance with combat, it is not worth buying at full price. If you have money to spare then by all means pick up a copy. But if like many of us you are on a budget and have to choose games carefully, wait until the almost $50.00 price tag is permanently cut in half or there is a substantial sale on the game. 8/10: fun but flawed</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=7340301">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was also much more engaged in the story and actually cared about other party members more than in PoE. While you are in the world where the evil side had won, don&#x2019;t let that fool you. Even though you can pick one of the more or less evil main factions in the game, there is also an option to revolt and side with the rebels, and you can do much good even in this troubled world.
<br>
<br>What really stands out though is the replay value. Depending on which side you choose and what choices you make, you get to explore different areas and the story unfolds differently. This really makes want to experience the game again with a different faction.
<br>
<br>There is a LOT of text in this game, and the total play time will highly depend on whether you want to read everything or not. Personally, I found most of the text very interesting I was glad to learn more about the world, so my first play through took almost 40 hours. This really depends on the difficulty you set, the amount of text you want to read and whether you want to complete only the main story without side-quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=7066760">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great characters and companions but if I had one complaint it is that Obsidian seems squeamish when it comes to deep characterization/relationships - one of the reasons BG 2 is superior. The companions end up a little flat.

<br>-Spell creation system is fantastic.
<br>-Choices you make till the end of the game matter. (but still no replayability...)

<br>The only thing that for me is kind of upsetting is that I cannot enter all areas in one play if I take particular choices. But apart from that, amazing combat and lore (really great job in storytelling and creating brand new universe). Obsidian bases heavily on their PoE engine and mechanics, I can see a lot of content being reused which is great - no point in reinventing the wheel. One minor drawback is that of the game being kind of too short (what I mean is that we can clearly see where the game could have been easily continued if Obsidian spent more money on the game). Anyway great game, and worth money and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6927335">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I like how the game plot is concentrated, it almost feel rushed, like for example movie adaptations of books, but the difference being that this &quot;adaptation&quot; is actually 40 hours long (my play time).
<br>
<br>The addition of the Conquest at the beginning of the game is by far the best new thing in the concept of retro RPGs. It&apos;s something that should have been implemented many years ago, in times of Baldur&apos;s Gates and first Fallouts. The choices aren&apos;t exactly game-changers but it&apos;s an easy way of introducing player to the game world and showing his role in it.
<br>
<br>The &quot;hyperlinks&quot; are another great thing added into the game. From the first moments in the game, characters speak using in-world proverbs and refer to the events that the player may not be aware of, if so, the only thing you need to do is to hover over the sentence and the game gives you a brief description of what it is about and to what it is a reference.
<br>
<br>I like how the game shows big game of politics, diplomacy and law enforcement instead of a typical for RPGs adventure type character.
<br>
<br>The 4 paths that player can choose to follow are also good, but it&apos;s sad that they don&apos;t really affect the final act which always is the same.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t shake the feeling that the developers had different idea for the whole concept of the game during the development of it as first Act works as a prologue, that is very detailed, that shows you just one small area of the game, the second Act forces you to go from one area to the other, not even tries to tell a detailed story of any of the areas, where in third and last Act there are no side quests, no lore dialogues, but just final boss fights (if you can call them that way), making the final Act look like some action game with really poor plot. I would definitely prefer all acts to work as the first one, which I consider the best of them all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6872593">Expand</a></span>

- Masterful world building
- Steady drip of lore
- Conquest mode as the prologue is genius.  Really gets you into the game without doing much.

- Combat is awful.  Actively unfun to play.  Your attacks rarely seem to have weight behind them and it always feel like a mess.

<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think I would have needed the spires and their upgrades. Although nice things can be created or upgraded there, I had so many artifacts to choose from, that I had difficulties deciding what to keep and I had tons of iron, but nothing to use it on. Game has the same unity engine then Pillars, with lengthy loading times.
<br>
<br>I played as caster, which get&apos;s very powerful. Difficulty got totally lost on highest difficulty setting with 2 casters (cloth) and 2 unorthodox (light and heavy) tanks. To properly use all the heaps of heavy armor taking a tank character would have probably been the better choice. Ending was ok (I got a quite good ending), but this story is clearly built for a series of games. No romance, and no uber epic story line so it&apos;s not baldur&apos;s gate, but it is a nice little offspring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6874684">Expand</a></span>

<br>For a game that sells itself based on choice &amp; consequence, it could have done more. The Prologue and Act I are brilliant. Then Act II simply acts out choices you took in act I. Act III forms a conclusion where you have some choice, but not as many as I would have liked. After picking my alliances I got a few options to betray them at key moments in the game, but at certain other key moments I didn&apos;t anymore. This felt a bit restraining. Further, your main alliance will define how other factions will be looking to you and this didn&apos;t feel natural. Even after I help a faction with everything I can, they fight me because of whom I&apos;m allied with.
<br>
<br>In style and feeling it&apos;s a bit closer to planescape torment than Pillars of Eternity was. From all the old classics it feels closest to that one. Which is a good thing although it doesn&apos;t manage to reach Torment&apos;s level.
<br>
<br>Very interesting spellsystem with a lot of customization. Combat is ok but not great. The good thing about it is it doesn&apos;t distract too much from the story.
<br>
<br>Character building was not that interesting since &quot;lore&quot; was by far more interesting than other options in that it provides more options during dialogues. Lore is in Torment what  wisdom was in Planescape Torment: the go to stat.
<br>
<br>Good game, I enjoyed it a lot, but not good enough to be replaying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6923295">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game has the usual isometric and slightly outdated graphics. The settings remind of the Age of Bronze era.

Forget about dragons and elves.. but still pretty captivating as it&apos;s not a common atmosphere in RPG games.
<br>
<br>The choices you make through the game totally change the outcome of your playthrough, making it very personalized. I must say the factions reputations system works very good: you are always aware of the effects of your choices and you can keep track of your reputations against any group or companion in the game.
<br>I believe the story is very good and it&apos;s not true you are the &quot;evil&quot; character, as you can take very &quot;good person&quot; choices to mould your story. It&apos;s just that you are in a war, therefore there won&apos;t be easy situations to solve..
<br>
<br>The combat is fun, they added combos with your party members, but it has less skills compared to PoE. Also keeping only 4 people in the party can be a bit limiting in terms of strategy. Overall I would say PoE combat was better.
<br>
<br>What dragged me down a bit was the companions: the dialogues with them are very limited because you basically have the same round of questions for each of them, with no real personalization. Also no side quests for companions...
<br>
<br>As I said, the game is very solid and, despite the abrupt ending, I must say it&apos;s one of the top games released in 2016</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871055">Expand</a></span>

A lack of overall polishing is also obvious.There are many dissapponting (near game-breaking) moments, which are worth mentioning:
<br>
<br>- Completely unbalanced combat.
<br>a)Mages and archers are really useless throughout the game, since they nearly always get rushed by enemy fighters. With 100 points in bows, I felt easier to use a two-handed weapoin in combat (starting with only 30 points in two-handed), and each time it was more effective than bows. The mage I was travelling with, Lantry, managed to learn some &apos;cool&apos; sigils only he could learn, but he still didn&apos;t contribute to the combat as much as simple fighters;
<br>b) Some archons (e.g., Bleden Mark, Tunon) are easily killed in &apos;auto-pilot&apos; mode. Some mobs easily blow your party out. Absolutely no logic.
<br>
<br>- Sometimes, the enemies or your party members will run in circles to catch each other. Sometimes, you can employ absolutely stupid strategies to win a battle, For instance, with only 2 characters (one with ranged weapon) you can defeat the archon of war by simply having one of them run in circles, while the other will fire arrows at the enemy. The AI is very poor.
<br>
<br>- Stupid, boring dialogues. NPCs keep repeating same things over and over again. And when you think you&apos;ve heard them saying the 5th time about some petty issue, which you don&apos;t care about, they will mention it again.
<br>
<br>- The Favour/Wrath, Loyalty/Fear system. The concept is interesting, but you will soon find that following strategies to win favour or loyalty from NPC will prove useless, since sometimes there is no logic about how these stats are adjusted.
<br>
<br>- The second half of the game had a worse story than the first one. It&apos;s almost like someone felt tired and not in the mood to write somethin decent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6868889">Expand</a></span>

It has some shortcomings which have kept me from finishing the game even though I tried to play it 3 or 4 times. This is PoE lite. Shorter game, fewer character options, less gear, less companions, less story, less character development per companion, less everything. Is it a bad game? No but it is a step back from PoE and still has all the nuances of PoE as well such as terrible AI, atrocious camera, boring character classes and this one ads terrible targeting feedback. I dont know how many time I target something and although the target is highlighted, the skill does not trigger. It turns out that you have to target a specific spot to get skills to trigger and if you get close to the screen you can see that the icon has a line through it but if you play far enough away it is hard to discern. Further, depending on the fight, the background colors blend into the icon colors making even harder to tell the difference. You adjust to this after a while but early on I didn&apos;t understand why skills were not working and it took a few deaths to realize that I was targeting wrong. So anyway, if PoE is a 6 (by my scale), then this has to be at least 1 or 2 points less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6812399">Expand</a></span>

<br>The setting is very interesting, but the combat, systems design and gameplay in this game are just atrocious. Gameplay in Pillars of Eternity was only mediocre, but somehow Obsidian learned nothing from making that game and made Tyranny even worse. Combat is so sluggish, boring and not tactical - all you really do is spam abilities and wait for them to cool down. The systems design is probably the worst and most uneven I have ever seen in an RPG... have the people who designed this ever even played a CRPG or PnP RPG before!?

<br>
<br>Tyranny plays and feels pretty much like Pillars of Eternity, this is, like a modern unity engine game. The graphics are ok and slightly cartoonish which works well with the overall intention of the gameplay and the story to create a more straight-to-the-point, action-driven adventure. Artistic direction is a bit disappointing even though the setting tries to be original running from middle-ages to a more iron-age, but environments are still pretty standard, sometimes repetitive, usually pretty small and lower in number unlike in others cRPGs.
<br>
<br>The music I believe is more noticeable and overall better played than the environment graphical design.
<br>As I said, gameplay is more action-oriented than Pillars, which imo is great. Everything is more flashy, dynamic, and innovative. For example there&#x2019;s a spell crafting system, classes have skill trees, characters train skills by using them and not only by assigning points when leveling up, main character has unique combined skills with party members, etc. All these additions make the overly used and predictable cRPG combat style be fresh again.
<br>
<br>Another very good aspect of gameplay is how conversations are handled. In every conversation you will have many choices that have short, middle and long term effects. A lot of these choices vary depending on your skill level, your background, your actions during the game, etc. This kind of choices which make the game and story so fun to play, are very abundant, certainly many many magnitudes over Pillars of Eternity.
<br>
<br>So now the story. I&#x2019;ll start saying the world of Terratus is indeed very interesting and you will quickly notice once the character creatior lets you shape (and play through) the backstory of your character. Lore is innovative and original, very entertaining and addictive to discover. I was conquered in the first couple of hours by this world at war and the mysterious Overlord Kyros that rules it. Being the fatebinder is, in all honesty, awesome, and my interest in the story never went down during the whole playthrough. Main quest is constantly there through important events, cut scenes, interesting conversations, etc. In so many other games you have this feeling of &#x201C;I&#x2019;m tired, I will save progress here&#x201D;, which reveal main story just got a little too tedious. Never had this feeling with Tyranny.
<br>
<br>Party members are charismatic enough, they are entertaining to speak with and their stories are generally interesting. I really liked them all in a way, but sadly the game never lets you go deep enough with them. They clearly have less dialogue than in previous Obsidian games like Pillars, and they lack the typical side quests that reveal more about them. A pity that they are made so interesting in the surface, just for you to realize there&#x2019;s not much under them.
<br>
<br>The ending was OK, but could have been better indeed. It was a bit rushed, predictable, not particularly epic, and very important points were left out of it. I was particularly annoyed by the fact that the mysteries surrounding the main character (you) never get to fully unravel. But the most important issue regarding the ending (in the negative aspect) is the lack of choice. In a game filled with choices, it is particularly ironic that the important closing event doesn&#x2019;t offer any real variability, which also makes the &quot;replay value&quot; go down hill.
<br>
<br>Overall, Tyranny will be a very entertaining RPG experience, but one can not help but notice the spoiled opportunity to make this game the iconic cRPG it could have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6818420">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>but at the same time its just look incomplete
<br>i dont mind lack of cutscenes, voice acting, and other &apos;nowadays&apos; stuff
<br>but the game gives you an opportunity to play your role yet the execution is poor most of the time
<br>
<br>SPOILER-FREE EXAMPLES (made-up but with the sense of actual gameplay):
<br>lets say that a farmer asks you to find his cattle, you go and find it, yet because of reasons you decide to kill his wife on a way back, once you go back to the farmer he talks hostile mouring his wife, but as soon as you mention saved cattle he becomes happy, starts cheering and celebrating and forgets about the bad things
<br>or
<br>youre told to take part in huge battle between good guys and bad guys, HUUUUUGE battle - you get there and theres 5-6 ppl on both sides, you kill all the baddies (normal weak troops), epic win, bards start creating songs about you, etc
<br>
<br>its still very playable, ive sunk into the world and lore
<br>but at the same time it is so fresh and it might have been perfect, if didnt lack polishing and sometimes common sense
<br>hope PoE II will learn from tyranny&apos;s mistakes</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6813448">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is fresh, fascinating and engaging. I love the world of Terratus, the amount of effort and dedication that went into the worldbuilding for this game is just breathtaking.
<br>
<br>I love playing as the bad guy, because in Tyranny, I get to choose what kind of bad guy I am. Bloodthirsty and ruthless? Cold and practical? Reluctant? Unwilling to be a bad guy at all? All valid choices.
<br>
<br>Choice stands at the heart of what Tyranny is. The choices you make in this game will quite literally shape your entire playthrough. There is content you will not see during your first playthrough. Whole quest-lines, important NPCs, even areas of the map, that you will just not get to experience because of the choices you make.
<br>And thats fine. In fact, it&apos;s excellent! Because Tyranny is made to be replayed.
<br>
<br>Tyranny gets a lot of flak for not being long enough, or not having enough exploration, not being an open world, not having an endless dungeon like PIllars of Eternity had and other things. It gets compared to Pillars of Eternity, which is fair since Pillars was built on the same engine by the same people.
<br>But Tyranny is a very different game.
<br>
<br>The thing about Tyranny is that it is an intensely focused experience.
<br>Pillars of Eternity is a grand, sweeping story. It plays out over a long time frame (I spent 114 hours completing my first playthrough), and it takes a long time to build tension and drama.
<br>Tyranny, by contrast, is much more narrow in scope. Tyranny is built with a pin-prick focus, it is the scalpel to Pillars of Eternitys hammer. The thing that defines Tyranny is your choices. The choices you make dictate what quests you get, what options will be available to you in the ongoing story and ultimately how the game ends. In Pillars, no matter how you play the game you will always end up following the same path. Tyranny has multiple paths, many of which exclude one another, and it all depends on player choice, You have immense agency in Tyranny, because your choices literally shape your playthrough.
<br>
<br>Is it a traditional western CRPG? No. It has most of the trappings, but it&apos;s substance is entirely different.
<br>Tyranny is a game about choices. It is masterfully designed and built, and offers hours of rich gameplay spread out over multiple vastly different playthroughs.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not flawless, but it is brilliant. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810637">Expand</a></span>

My biggest nitpick is the combat can feel a little tedious at times, and there are almost too many specials/powers.  If everything is special, nothing is :)

Also the concept sounded somewhat original and I was interested in how the choice making would progress throughout the game.  I bought it on the release date and I&apos;ve now had three play-throughs.  Needless to say I really enjoyed it although it is not perfect.
<br>
<br>The combat is fun but not as varied or as tactical as pillars.  There are not as many classes.  The story is gripping and your choices matter a lot.  There are essentially three factions you can align yourself with and missions will differ depending on which side you choose.  The graphics are original but not fantastic - I was expecting slightly better.  The loot is good with a number of powerful relics to collect and and upgrade system to improve weapons and armour.  There are also some fun puzzles to solve but they are not overly complex and easily solvable if you search for the clues well.
<br>
<br>This biggest disappointment for me was the shortness of the campaign - I think it took me around 20 hours or less and I did as many side quests as I could find.  I hope that any future expansions add at least the same playing time again.  I&apos;m giving this an eight score.  It would have been a ten if they had added another ten hours gameplay to the game and another couple of classes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873849">Expand</a></span>

That said, do not buy this game seeking an Obsidian experience - this is in many ways a Bioware game. Yes, there will be some Obsidian-quality writing, but most of the writing team are young devs who joined Obsidian for the development of South Park: The Stick of Truth and they have different sensibilities when it comes to writing. It feels like Obsidian made a Bioware-game, BUT with an original twist that doesn&apos;t involve saving the world - in that regard it&apos;s still an Obsidian title. So buy this if you enjoyed the gameplay and the writing quality of Dragon Age: Origins, but wished the plot was more interesting than saving a kingdom from evil monsters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6818735">Expand</a></span>

The spells are crafted by you, a false good idea as ultimately it&apos;s tedious and unnecessary. There are no amazing spells like conjure a demon from hell like there were in BG2 just fire, ice, etc.
<br>
<br>The map is gorgeous and the background and characters are well rendered and animated. The story unfortunately cuts of at what should be the end of Act 1. The second half of the game is missing and covered by a &quot;video scene&quot; explaining what happens with slides.
<br>
<br>Choice has some impact on who&apos;s alive and who&apos;s dead but beyond that it&apos;s a long corridor and what you do doesn&apos;t impact the narrative, just what town is left standing, what character is dead or serving you.
<br>
<br>A solid game and hours of fun, I recommend buying it. Not a masterpiece tho.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=7203794">Expand</a></span>

It definitely has a different feel to pillars of eternity which i really enjoyed, although different it is still a very good game albeit not good enough to be a great game. Everything is of a decent quality although i felt some of the maps were too small, it needed more voice acting outside of the main characters, music was good but not varied enough. I&apos;d give it an 8 out of 10 as i played it through which meant i was captured enough and enjoyed the story. POE played out as a much bigger game in my opinion and the story was the more conventional hero thing, but i guess that&apos;s what they wanted with Tyranny. I&apos;d definitely pay &#xA3;20 for it but no more. I&apos;m now waiting for Torment to come out in February to see how that compares.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6926436">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Above avarage characters.    -Can be boring for action rpg players.
<br>+Very good story telling.
<br>Conclusion: If u like Planescape: Torment etc. its a great game for you. If you dont , do not buy this game.
<br>Enjoy.</span>

The world is interesting. But the choises arent always that deep... or have enough options. Its a must play for crpg fans, but dont expect a baldurs gate or Planescape.</span>

<br>
<br>The branching story idea is nice, but I don&apos;t think it is executed well. I understand the goal of creating cumulative events that eventually have various consequences. It&apos;s supposed to be more organic and whatever, but most decisions just feels meaningless.
<br>Do I kill Dumbdedumb NPC or not. Do I side with Old man I know nothing about, or Old man I know even less about, or neither. How can I begin to care...
<br>
<br>Wrath/Fear vs Favor/Loyalty
<br>These make no sense. Especially the skills you get from them and how you could have both. It is just beyond pointless. At least leave the skills out.
<br>
<br>Mechanics
<br>So this suffers from the same problems Pillars did in certain versions. The AI is RABID to get at your low survivability characters. Disengage incentive is not strong enough for it. One stupid way I have been winning every battle on PotD is to run Quill man around while 1, 2, sometimes 3 melees just chase him. It&apos;s beyond idiotic to watch, but it works, when they stop chasing, you turn around and reengage their interest.
<br>I know Pillars went through several iterations of tanks and chokepoint management, I expected an improvement.
<br>
<br>Combos are very clunky as is the rest of combat due to characters not doing anything during cooldown. They don&apos;t even try to get in position, you will need to manually move them.
<br>Combos are especially so, since now you have one character not doing anything even when cooldown is off.
<br>If the target leaves your melee range for melee combos, the combo is canceled.
<br>
<br>Can we just be like every other game and make auto-attacks much shorter cd or their separate cd... It works very very well...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810543">Expand</a></span>

First of all the presentation of the stats is so confusing. I couldn&apos;t tell, for example, whether my first companion &quot;Verse&quot; was a damage dealer, a tanker or something else. Also the stats on weapons makes it hard to tell whether it&apos;s an improvement or not. Then, there&apos;s the lack of sound. This game is quiet, instead it offers you walls of text. It never ends, and breaks the immersion. After reading so much text, I lost situational awareness, as in, not knowing what the heck I just read. After ages of total silence and more text I gave up n this game.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s an example without spoilers: a group of enemies rush at you, you&apos;re ready to fight and mentally prepare, but then the game halts abruptly... you first need to read tons of text. By the time you&apos;re done reading and possible have taken the wrong decisions during the conversation because your mind is set to battle already, you forgot you were in a battle and need to re-adjust.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get carried away by the high user score. These are fanatics talking (bless them). I consider myself a hardcore RPG person, but this is a little bit too much.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the summary:
<br>
<br>+ For Die-Hard Isometric Game RPG fans only
<br>- Endless Walls of Text
<br>- No Sounds (almost no voice acting, no atmospheric sounds either)
<br>- Confusing (or messy) Statistics
<br>- Weird, Bad, Fighting Mechanism
<br>- Overall Boredom and Immersion-Breaking
<br>
<br>Conclusion: for the die-hard isometric RPG fan only. Other RPG fans have no business looking for this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6829086">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, it was impossible. It was neither the tons of dialogue reading that destroyed it for me, nor the boring characters, I really don&apos;t care about these things. I only care about gameplay and that&apos;s where this game really comes short. After breezing through the initial, excruciatingely linear campaign, I found myself finally given a couple of options. Go for the library, or to some other place, I didn&apos;t care much for. The library seemed interesting, killed everyone easily, until the last floor, which the enemies summarily wiped with my remains, time and time again. Gave it up, thought it was a silly mistake by the devs, who hadn&apos;t learnt anything from the Bethesda series, so I went another way, to a town with a single way to wherever I was supposed to be going. Low and behold, another unbeatable party, kicking my arse. I don&apos;t know what this is supposed to be and I don&apos;t really care. I always play at a normal difficulty first, to get a feel for the game. This one sucked and it didnt really make me want to try again. Fighting a battle three times is enough for me, unless I play a rogue-like game, which this definitely isn&apos;t supposed to be. Other than the weird, unexpected difficulty, there really wasn&apos;t much to keep me interested here. Weird power ups with timers, spells that take ages to cast, some kind of base building crap that is supposed to give you advantages, they mean nothing, unless you&apos;re having fun kicking arse, in an RPG. I never had any fun with this, so 10-20 hours of my time is all it was worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6831986">Expand</a></span>

Ultimately, I felt that it was a very enjoyable trip into a thought provoking world. The first and second acts felt flushed out and complete, the third act was essentially removed from development making the end feel entirely too quick and to a certain degree left you with an expansion-pack cliffhanger that was rather unsatisfying because it pertained to the primary story arc.
<br>
<br>Some bullet point thoughts
<br>- Good story, thought provoking world
<br>- Decisions and factions were meaningfully influenced
<br>- The game that follows the primary story arc in a linear manner, making decisions at point A dispositive for decisions in point B.
<br>- Wrath/Loyalty bars are determined separately, decreasing the kind of hard choices the game seems to want to force.
<br>- Lots of gear, but very few real decisions related to it
<br>- Great spell creation system
<br>
<br>Overall: Definitely worth playing, particularly if you like classic RPGs. Hopefully an expansion will flush out the ending, which as it stands is too short. Would have liked it to be more open-ended and non-linear, in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6823371">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion, it is a well-written, engaging, flexible and branching story with carefully-designed characters and poignant moments where you&#x2019;ll be reminded of the gravity of your character&#x2019;s choices as part of a brutally efficient, villainous campaign. If you&#x2019;re an RPG player that focuses heavily on the consequences of your actions, as well as substantial character and story development, I highly recommend adding Tyranny to your library. The game is text-heavy, but has meaningful characters, art, and choices.
<br>
<br>Like a few games before it, Tyranny is a story-driven role-playing game makes you consider not only what large-scale decisions you make, but the means and attitudes by which you make said decisions.
<br>This is made apparent as early as character creation, where you make the decisions as to how, exactly, your character (an emissary of a seemingly all-powerful Kyros the Overlord) surmounts the last bastion against the uncompromising tyrant &#x2013; it&#x2019;s referred to as the &#x201C;Conquest&#x201D; portion of character creation.
<br>
<br>In one instance of character creation, you can choose to finish your conquest of a resilient city by forcing a peaceful surrender, or goading their queen into single combat and slaying her. Either way, you subjugate the city, but the people in the surrounding farmland remember you differently in the game&#x2019;s introduction: as a merciful &#x201C;Peacebinder,&#x201D; or a ruthless and cold-blooded killer. Alternatively, you may choose to avoid this scenario entirely, and the people of this city bemoan the unpitying acts of one of the other Overlord&#x2019;s agents.
<br>
<br>In-game, the core combat and dialogue systems are very similar to Pillars of Eternity, with a few new bells and whistles. In combat, actions like attacking with weapons and casting spells are taken based on recovery time &#x2013; heavy armor and hefty weapons negatively affect how quickly your character acts in combat. There are defenses which prevent you from taking damage, and damage types allow you to be effective against different kinds of enemies. Using a weapon will increase the corresponding skill (this is the mechanism for combat and non-combat skills). You and your party members can work together and perform powerful combo skills &#x2013; either received from the outset or gained from earning their loyalty and/or terror-induced respect.
<br>
<br>The concept behind much of the combat is excellent &#x2013; in practice, there are hiccups in party member AI (if you always let them do their own thing), and for some players the delay between actions can be frustrating. In-battle skill choices and out-of-battle character levelling are intuitive, if a bit streamlined. For those with ample (maybe too much?) patience, it is a careful game of strategy on higher difficulties &#x2013; and you might find yourself pausing combat frequently to re-assess the situation if a battle&#x2019;s getting out of hand. I&#x2019;m somewhere in between: some early combats felt a bit sluggish, while I enjoyed battles about a third of the way through the game.
<br>
<br>Dialogue is what makes this game divisive, but for me gives the game much of its charm. There is quite a bit of text in this game, and voice acting to go with a fair bit of it. But you&#x2019;re no goody two-shoes or morally-conflicted antihero, as in most other RPGs: you&#x2019;re a cold, ruthless enforcer, a calculating and diplomatic conqueror, smooth-talking bandit, or anything in between. For your character, the dialogue you have available to you is dependent on your character&#x2019;s upbringing, their skills, the Conquest, what factions you&#x2019;ve buttered up, and many other decisions you make throughout the game. If your character was an experienced Hunter before joining the Overseer, for example, you might be able to elicit information about local wildlife or make a couple of unique insights on survival in the wilderness. However, you forfeit the negotiating ability of a Diplomat, which *really* would&#x2019;ve come in handy when the leaders of those two gangs decided to start stabbing each other.
<br>
<br>Dialogue makes or breaks the game: for me, the constant references to my history and proficiencies helped immerse me. Being able to right-click and view an entry on an old character or event I might not perfectly remember, and having party members interject in a conversation (or send it in a different direction entirely!) were both extreme positives for me. How you conduct yourself among even low-ranking members of major factions can have an impact on how the faction as a whole (or its leader) views you, and by extent can affect what areas and options you have available to you.
<br>
<br>In short, Tyranny&#x2019;s compelling story puts you in the shoes of a central representative of Kyros the Overlord, with all of the boons your position of power brings you. There are plenty of battles to be fought, but more importantly, decisions to be made &#x2013; and many of the actions you take, words you say, and people you influence aren&#x2019;t simply lost to history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6805560">Expand</a></span>

There is a complicated spell crafting system and item upgrade system, but by the time I started to use these, the game was already almost over. It just feels like the initial part of the game has a lot of work to it while the mid and endgame is completely rushed. There are nice dungeons in the early part of the game, but for the last part, you can just walk into the areas you want to conquer and there&apos;s no dungeon at all, just walk in and get what you want. There are very few sidequests so you&apos;re bored very quickly with nothing to do. There aren&apos;t even any random encounters to test your new items/abilities on besides the few scripted groups that you are meant to encounter on the road.
<br>
<br>The combat is sluggies and unresponsive, skills have very weird ways to activate them, which often make you think your character is going to perform an a skill you want, only to wait for 10 seconds to see them do nothing because the order wasn&apos;t processed because you didn&apos;t click the icons and targets in the way you&apos;re supposed to do (it doesn&apos;t inform you that you did it wrong either). In the early/mid game all items suck, and in the end game you get many artifacts and other cool stuff, however there&apos;s noone left to fight to actually put these cool items to any use.
<br>
<br>All in all I finished the game in less than 8 hours and don&apos;t feel the need to replay it, making it poor value for money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6854546">Expand</a></span>

Solid RPG spirit, lots of choices and consequences, interesting characters with a deep lore. Tyranny does not feel like a Pillars of Eternity spin-off; instead it is a fantastic stand-alone game that will hopefully spawn its own series.</span>

<br>
<br>I really, really wish I could give it an 8 or 9, but there are a few things holding it back.  It feels unfinished, overall.
<br>
<br>First: Maximum group size is 4, not 6. I strongly dislike this.  It feels more like Dragon Age than Pillars of Eternity. For another, 4 doesn&apos;t really feel like a group to me. Also, you cannot make your own companions.
<br>
<br>Second: You&apos;re forced to make &quot;important&quot; decisions immediately without any knowledge that will help guide those decisions.
<br>
<br>Third: Combat is &quot;simplified&quot; over Pillars of Eternity. This means it&apos;s more boring, unfortuantely. And the AI is bad. Companions with spells/abilities and the perfect opportunity to use those spells/abilities will simply auto attack even though it&apos;s a massive decrease in damage.
<br>
<br>Fourth: Why is &quot;Fast Mode&quot; so hidden?  It&apos;s painfully slow sneaking without it.  Also, sneak has built in cooldown, so I can&apos;t just pop in and out of sneak to be sure I&apos;m detecting hidden items.
<br>
<br>Fifth: LACK OF INFORMATION.  Perfect example is &quot;Magefire.&quot;  Nowhere can I find information on how much damage it does, what increases that damage, how often it ticks, how partial ticks are handled, etc.  The in-game encyclopedia just says &quot;burn damage over time.&quot;  Not helpful.  This is just one example of many.
<br>
<br>Spell creation and the skill system are the game&apos;s best features.  However, spell creation gets really tedious really fast.  Every time my Lore skill goes up by 5-10 points, I have to remake ALL my spells to take advantage of the increased Lore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6803968">Expand</a></span>

<br>- replayabilty

<br>- spell crafting (but see below 3)
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- (1) the ending is lacking (story- and gameplay-wise). and act 3 seems rushed. if not: its too short. but this maybe cured by a good DLC
<br>- (1) also: some things are not very clearly explained, i.e. sometimes i had to guess whats going on. but overall the story was told quite well
<br>- (2) locked talent trees and therefore locked talents. i hate it, when my PC cannot learn talents, i love (like teleport (eb has it)). i see the point that locked talent trees make companions special, but id rather have a REALLY open classless system
<br>- some talents are not really usable (e.g.: ebs teleport is a lvl 13 talent. my game ended around lvl 13 so i used this talent twice or so at most)
<br>- (3) spell crafting: spells are &quot;combat focused&quot; only. where are invisibilty, open locks, shape change etc.? (there is an invis potion, but its not the same IMO)
<br>- talents/spells play no role in quests/riddles (like: use an invis spell or shape change (which do not exist) or teleport to solve a quest/riddle)
<br>- combat is messy (sometimes i could not click where i wanted.) - but that is not a big issue to me, b/c i always play on story mode, so i win anyways ;-)
<br>- some talents are useless IMO (not really an issue though. better to much than not enough)
<br>
<br>The ugly:
<br>- no exploration: areas are way to small and there are not too many of them either! that makes the world seem and feel very small. focused game play is ok, but those few small areas are too small and too few
<br>- loading times: are you f***ing kidding me? the first 3 times i started the game, i thought it crashed (win10 actually told me the game might have crashed). of my 30ish hours playthrough time around 5 hours were loading times. Sometimes I really did not want to go into houses or change areas b/c another 5 minutes or so of loading times. WTF?
<br>
<br>Overall: what a gem of a game! I love it
<br>&quot;The bad&quot;-items are no deal breaker by any means.
<br>&quot;The ugly&quot;-items on the other hand weigh a little heavier, esp. the size of the world/areas. and loading times are beyond of being beyond.

<br>
<br>From the moment you start the game you get the chance to create your character, but also shape the main villain&apos;s conquest! Did he take city A or city B? And how did he take it? Did your character play a major part in it? Or were you more sympathetic to the conquered?
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a very interesting balance of Good and Evil, though you can be either. You are basically playing a wandering judge, you have the power to settle disputes in His name, or defy him by breaking the law (which will have severe repercussions). Thing is, you are ultimately serving the evil overlord, so you will have to make some really tough choices if you want to be a &apos;goody two-shoes&apos;. The bad guy won, so what are you going to do about it? If you&apos;re someone who is trying to make the best of things then you&apos;ll have the most interesting experience, because it&apos;s impossible to satisfy everyone. If you serve your master well by remaining true to the law, you will piss off the Overlord&apos;s servants who only care about their own interests and glory.
<br>
<br>The combat system is where the game slightly suffers. Party AI isn&apos;t very smart, and attempting to control each party member individually by turning off said flawed AI, is too much of a chore and unintuitive. They&apos;ll often get stuck, and some party members simply don&apos;t know what to do with certain weapons. Thankfully, this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that *your* character, the one you always control yourself, can and will be much more powerful than your party members, so you don&apos;t have to rely on their AI too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6808853">Expand</a></span>

In fact it is basically a sequel to that game. The combat is the same, a new version of the Stronghold is present, the same system for organizing your groups is there, the inventory is the same, etc, etc. But in my opinion it is much, much better. I completely lost interest in PoE during my first playthrough for a variety of reasons, and never returned to it. But I am having no problems sticking with Tyranny. The premise is more interesting and original, and the problems are less prevalent than in the first game. There are still excessive loading times, but not as many tiny two-story houses to explore. The gear is still somewhat uninteresting for the most part, but you can craft some nice stuff to make you forget about that. The combat is improved from when I played PoE, because lo and behold it actually has AI scripts; a baffling exclusion from PoE on release.
<br>And above all the &quot;Stronghold&quot; is not a pointless time waster like it was in PoE. If you haven&apos;t played either I would recommend you skip PoE and get Tyranny instead. if you for some reason liked PoE then you will love Tyranny because it is just far better.
<br>Unlike the disappointing first effort from Obsidian at reviving isometric party RPGs, Tyranny is a real contender to unseat Original Sin as the leading game available in the genre. At least until Original Sin 2 comes out. Meanwhile, Tyranny really is great in almost every way; only dropping down from a perfect score because of the ridiculous loading times and other minor issues. Personally at least I could live with them this time around. The only significant negative is the decision to go with four man groups in a game like this. It is just too few. Other than that, buy this game if you like RPGs.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Good reputation system.
<br>-Atmospheric graphics and sound. Original visual style.
<br>-Plenty of content, although some of it seems a bit optional.
<br>-AI scripting. Only mentioned because Obsidian previously didn&apos;t know that you need this in a party isometric RPG.
<br>-Improved and a lot more interesting Stronghold function.
<br>-Great characters and interesting story.
<br>-LOTS of text.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Meh leveling. Minuscule stat upgrade each time, one weird and usually situational talent chosen and off you go! Doesn&apos;t matter which three buttons you click when leveling. Just click three and keep playing.
<br>-Meh spell system. Create-your-own-spell gone bad, and more likely to inspire people to play exclusively with melee characters than anything else.
<br>-Long and frequent loading screens. Back to the C64 days with Obsidian!
<br>-Extremely meh gear. Endless trash recycled through your PoE-weird inventory. 20 hours in I had found one interesting item, and that was a bow. I didn&apos;t even use bows.
<br>-Fiddly combat system, pathfinding problems and some persistent need to babysit characters. Not near as bad as PoE was obviously, just because of the AI scripting.
<br>-Plenty of trial and error with rune-based puzzles not requiring logical deduction of any kind. Just click everything in sight and hope you get things done somehow.
<br>-Four man party. For a game of this type this really is a big negative. Your ability to tank things is already severely limited, as it was in PoE. In a four man group any casters will be instantly open to attacks on every pull, and you will spend a lot of time running around in circles with them while waiting for your other characters to finish other enemies off so they can come save you. It is bad. The game needs either five or six man groups or lots of summoning spells.

<br>I am unsure of its replayability, but I&apos;ve enjoyed the first playthrough completely, although the normal difficulty wasn&apos;t challenging at all. All of this being said 45$ is a bit too much, 30$ or less would be ok, so I&apos;d recommend waiting for patches and a drop in price.

<br>Companions are good, they always react to every player&apos;s decision and are interesting persons to talk with. Every companion has its own opinion about the war, factions and other things.
<br>
<br>Choice also plays a huge role. especially in the first Act. And almost every character reacts to things, that you have done. I made something in the first 20 minutes of the game, and after 10 hours of playing someone mentioned it.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t really like the combat system. I prefer a fully step by step combat like in Fallout 1 and 2.
<br>
<br>And in my opinion there are not so many side quests. Maybe because this game is more story-focused, but i feel like Tyranny should have more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6825155">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a perfect balance of dialogs and combat, there are plenty of very nice innovations and changes, I loved the skill system, various reputations with factions and people in the world that unlocked additional skills. The Spire system was great. The combo abilities is a very nice touch.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not as complex in terms of side quests and side activities as other similar rpgs, but that might have been for good this time, it&apos;s much more direct and focused on the main story which is really good and the entire journey is much more compact and to the point. A little short for an RPG and maybe a little too linear, but quality is always more important than quantity. Captivating story, interesting characters, nice unusual locations, smooth UI, it&apos;s all there.
<br>
<br>My only complaints aside from a weaker start, is the loot, which for a long time felt like tons of useless junk, especially in the first half and even later when you started to find some legendary items, they are often actually worse than that random junk that you found earlier. Another problem, that&apos;s starting to annoy me more and more in time is the lack of voice acting. Especially when some parts are voice acted and it works so well and suddenly a sentence later it&apos;s silent again. I know it&apos;s always been like this with these games, I know it&apos;s a question of budget, but come on, it&apos;s 2016 it&apos;s time to progress in this department. Also - no co-op multiplayer again :(
<br>
<br>On the other hand I was very pleasantly surprised, these rpgs tend to be very buggy and considering I started playing on release I was worried, but the game was updated with just 1 additional patch in the meantime and I haven&apos;t encountered any bugs whatsoever this time. I can&apos;t stress enough how important this is for your smooth gaming experience, not having to deal with bugs and I&apos;m glad Obsidian took their time to polish and clean things up before release.
<br>
<br>Overall, excellent, unusual RPG that can easily rank among the best in recent years, not the top5, not legendary, but really really good. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6843588">Expand</a></span>

<br>-innovations in this one, makes my acctual scoring to go higher. i mean quality of life innovations, they are so good. i can list them but honsetly there are too many of them to list and it will just make a wall of text. trust me on this, they have really great innovation here and there.
<br>
<br>-spellcrafting is best i ve ever seen, its so fun, so creative and so progressive in gameplay feel.
<br>
<br>graphics look really nice, animations look really great.
<br>
<br>-story and dialogue depth is super good and well written to hook you up hours and hours. i found myself drinking coffe and reading texts non-stop for 2 hours.
<br>
<br>-leveling and skilling system is not confusing yet still deep enough to satisfy. you dont struggle to get what does what like in pillars of eternity. diving in, understanding in, is easy, confy yet beatiful.
<br>
<br>-acctual gameplay is not short if you are like me, a guy who is exploring and diving in story. 3 full days of playing still didnt finished it... and i can totally see playing it for 2nd time after seeing so many possible choices... i mean i just realised i killed a compainon.
<br>
<br>cons:
<br>-area of affect spell or abilites, doesnt have any kind of friendly fire. this was a important part of RPGs.
<br>
<br>-group size is 4, which felt few to me. 6 is much better for diversity, comboes.. for like.. everything, 6 is better then 4.
<br>
<br>-it doesnt make sense to start the game as a level 1 player with no coins. our character is taking part in 3 years conquest before starting game.
<br>
<br>conclusion: this game is a must try for people who like RPG genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6819107">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also to add I am spoiled gamer and it is hard to keep my attention. Tyranny managed that. Some people claim to run through the game in 11 hours. I cannot imagine it. I had to talk to everybody, read everything and run back to places I visit to unlock other options. I fell in love with the game and its captivating storytelling. There are still some things to improve but Obsidian definitely moved the right direction from PoE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6805537">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First and foremost is the story.  While it does rely on some old tropes and doesn&apos;t reinvent the wheel, it does take an approach to the rpg story that we don&apos;t often get; the evil side.  You work for &quot;evil&quot; from the start and have to carve your path from there.
<br>Having said that, the game does a very good job of making you wonder if what you&apos;re doing is truely bad or if it&apos;s good; there really isn&apos;t a true &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; action in the game.  A lot of the characters have their own justifications for their actions that seem perfectly reasonable given the circumstances in which they are embroiled.  Even still, it can be difficult to make some decisions that are either terrible or you have your own idea and you wish you could implement it (but you said the wrong word two dialogue options ago).
<br>The problem with the story (and problably, but just in case, spoiler warning) is that it just kind of...ends.  It is very clear that there either is or should be more to it.  You can tell that it&apos;s coming, but you hold onto the hope that surely it doesn&apos;t.  We certainly want our resolution of the story.  That being said, a proper resolution feels like it would take another full game.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played Pillars of Eternity, then you already know the score with the combat.  Now, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s possible but I never figured out how to change the hotkeys for combat... Either way, this takes a lot of pausing, issuing commands, starting for a second, issuing some more commands, etc. ad nauseam.  If you want go go go combat, then it is not for you.  However, if you like to stategize and coordinate or if you&apos;re impartial then it IS for you.
<br>
<br>Long story short, I really like this game.  I&apos;ve played it through once and I intend to play it through at least one more time, possibly more.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Dark but engaging story with fleshed out lore
<br>-Choices have a lasting impact and may haunt/aid you down the road
<br>-Strategic combat
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Story abrubtly ends in what kind of feels like the middle
<br>-While companions have their own stories, they just kind of follow blindly as long as you say the right thing once or twice</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6809475">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m only 5 or so hours into it, yet the writing alone of Tyranny makes up for whatever other flaw i could find (if any).

<br>
<br>The gameplay is satisfyingly complex, without being annoyingly micro, and the characters along for the ride are both well thought out and &apos;realistic&apos;, in that they will seldom sway out of character regardless of how you try to convince them.
<br>
<br>The story starts off interestingly, with choices making a solid, tangible difference and they continue throughout. Some things start to feel out of your hands towards the end, but they aren&apos;t too out of sync with the rest of your decisions.

This is a game where you really have to make important choices, you can&apos;t do everything at the same time at all.I also like very much the fact that the game is classless (which does not mean that you don&apos;t have to specialize your characters), the relationship system with the companions and the factions, and the magic crafting system. Really a hit for me. And it&apos;s really replayable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6811967">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>My expectations for this game were really high because of devs Obsidian and Paradox. As usual, they deliver yet another solid RPG. Similar to Pillars of Eternity, but looks and plays even better. Also, an awesome setting and concept with &quot;evil won&quot;.

<br>This isn&apos;t an RPG, more like choose your adventure book. The starting and the end points are pre-defined and your choices and actions midway eventually mean almost nothing. I can&apos;t get away from the notion that this is a technical demo of PoE2.</span>

It manages to fix some of PoE flaws, while developing a bunch of its own. Just another average RPG, seemingly suggesting that the era of AAA isometric role-playing games is slowly coming to an end. Very minor spoilers ahead.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Story - some say it&apos;s rushed at the end (maybe a little), but I liked it. The lenght is ok (around 30-35 hours), but I&apos;m guessing Obsidian left something for upcoming DLCs or possibly a next installment (depending on sales).
<br>+ Main character development - I like the fact that you can get quite powerful, and it feels. In PoE you were a character of legend, yet everybody kicked your butt at every turn. Here, you can get powerful enough to smother every opposition, even though fight still seem challenging at times (difficulty level Hard and above).
<br>+ Being bad - it is the centerpiece of this whole game. In other games being good or bad means that you have to act like a boy-scout or a complete douchebag. You never get to be truly malicious, unless you take high-school standards and consider bullying others an act of evil and not misguided duchebagery. In Tyranny being evil means what it should, like you&apos;re doing your job for a steel-fisted tyrant. That is good.
<br>+ Spell-system - Very cool. You combine runes to create your own versions of spells. Playing as a mage, I really had fun with this.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Only 4 character party - Why?! Apart from the fact that there are only 6 NPC playable character in the game, I see no reason to make the party so small. BG had six, PoE had six, and here we have four. What&apos;s worse, neraly all characters are pretty bland. I remember Planescape: Torment had only 6 NPC characters, but they were so brilliantly written that it didn&apos;t matter in the least.
<br>- No freeroaming - That ticked me off. You can only get to new places by receiving a quest. You cannot just wander around the map, because... we, f*** you, that&apos;s why. Also, during one gameplay you won&apos;t be able to visit all the places at once. For example, I played with a mage and there was this Burning Library, a place where a lot of arcane knowledge is stored. I though, allright! I&apos;m gonna leave that for dessert. Then the game cut me off, and I couldn&apos;t go to the Burning Library no more. I mean, WTF?! It&apos;s not like it burned down completely. Even the neding said it still burned. Damn.
<br>- Skill dihharea - There are just TOO. MANY. SKILLS. You have 5-6 skills from leveling up. 3-6 skills from your companions. 6-10 skills from fractions. Even more skills from your artifacts, and then there are, of course, spells. All in all you have a s**tload of skills, and you won&apos;t be using more than 20% of them (excluding spells, because those you craft yourself to you liking).
<br>- Boooooring item system - What is this - Diablo 3? You find so much useless junk I just can&apos;t believe it. The loot system is just slightly better than in PoE, but it is still pretty bad. And don&apos;t get me started on those artifacts. They are often worse than regular stuff. What the hell?! I remember finding a +2 sword in the first Baldur&apos;s Gate - genuine excitement. Here, after I find an artifact, I ask myself why do I even bother looking at its stats for the hundreth time.
<br>
<br>I originaly gave PoE a 7/10, and I thought about giving this game an 8, which would place it in the green zone, but even though it&apos;s slightly better than PoE I just can&apos;t force myself to do it. Seven it is. You might like it, you might not, but it&apos;s certainly worth a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6844143">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Mechanics-wise, don&apos;t expect a miracle as this is reusing the hopeless PoE engine. There is an improvement on the skills side, while a few bad concepts are added. Combat is still a boring grind, a tactical wasteland and a repetitive filler. At least the pain is attenuated a little, as the team is smaller and the AI competent (when not screwed by the buggy path-finding.)
<br>
<br>Story-wise, it starts with a boring conquest phase where I make random decisions on a map, but the expected payoff is worth it, as choices I will forget (due to minimal involvement at this stage) will inject some life in my future interactions. Then the play begins, and the fun. The world is palpable in the first act, along my discovery of people&apos;s motivations and personalities. This culminates in excellent three-way conversations with two Archons. And I continue choosing who lives and dies as I explore, like a partial and magical Judge Dredd.
<br>
<br>The writing style is also similar to PoE, slightly irritating in its affected pomp (maybe we are are dealing with a would-be Gongora here,) a bit too artificial, but palatable. My issue is that they still haven&apos;t figured out how to distillate the lore visually and organically instead of dumping it in rebarbative blocks. With the exception of the coloured links, which are pretty neat.
<br>
<br>Then I move to Act II and freedom of play disappears along with common sense. My interest dwindles fast. The first time I stumble on fake dialogues leading to a slaughter-only resolution, I delay my approach, look for other entry points with that mercenary faction. There are none. The second time, with the Unfavored, I resent it. The third time, I start positively with the Sages due to past choices, and yet there is no possible arguing, only another blood bath, and I&apos;m proven 100% how poor the storytelling truly is. I&apos;m not a judge that people try to use anymore, I&apos;m your regular hack n&apos; slasher from a 1992 RPG.
<br>
<br>As I said, it&apos;s not only my freedom which has disappeared, it&apos;s any trace of intelligence. While I thought I made an alliance, I have in fact changed my master, abandoned my role and forfeited my prerogatives. I am offered to betray that alliance a couple of times, but with not one speck of a valid reason and absolutely no benefit, tactical or otherwise, at such moments. In fact, I can only betray by telling my ally face to face. Who does that ? And which moron writes such drivel ? When I am willing to betray, or not even betray but show my independence while talking with a 3rd party, no option available, nada zip naff all, only more boring combat. Writers drop the ball once again and the result is lame. Not to mention the game tries hard to make you deviate from a subjugated path that makes sense (the opportunity is rare, hence the appeal of the game) into the banal anachronistic teenage fantasy of super-heroic independence. The expected subtlety is not here.
<br>
<br>You know enough to decide. What follows is a quick list of annoying points, but none of them had me quit: the story did.
<br>
<br>- When it comes to the common rule of defecating on the heads of stealth players, Tyranny is exceptionally guilty. Loads and loads of scripted events unhide you and make you run to a bad spot to listen to a nobody you only hunt to kill. Mechanics-story mismatch at its best. Plus, you can&apos;t sneak after a fight has started.
<br>
<br>- The loot is even worse than in PoE. Long lists of useless numbers to compare (who cares about 1 point in Parry when you already have 150 ? ) Objects usable by 1 named character only (no reason given because there can be none.) The inventory is poor, terrible when it comes to merchants. The spells suffer from the same inanity, but at least they became useful since PoE. Spellcraft is dreary (itemised to a ridiculous fault) but spells are good indeed.
<br>
<br>- Tons of junk, such as consumables, forged artifacts inferior to regular equipment, upgrades only valuable for 1 character&apos;s armor, pointless combos and minute effects, useless camping equipment not treated as regular inventory (there&apos;s no need to ever rest.) puzzle-spell parts, and so on. On this subject, pen &amp; paper RPGs have always intended to sell extra compendiums of things, hence the design of Feats and such annoyances. Video game don&apos;t have this excuse to replace creativity with random combinations of smoke and mirrors.
<br>
<br>- Fake replay value should be blamed mostly on players, since many beg for it. The fad won&apos;t last. Still, this particular implementation is unsatisfying, as a lot of content seems closed to each character. That might work for a short game, but not here. Instead, only a minority of side quests should be restricted. Pretty much all maps and NPCs should be accessible to everyone, with only the objectives, means and dialogue options being different. In Tyranny&apos;s act 2, I constantly feel I&apos;m being cheated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6952570">Expand</a></span>

When you first see it, it&apos;s really surprising and different but as soon as you peel away the exterior it is just another god damned sweater.
<br>-
<br>It&apos;s not a bad game.  It&apos;s not a great game.  It&apos;s worth playing once.  But a huge opportunity was missed here.  Tyranny is everything stereotypical about every isometric RPG you&apos;ve ever played only it let&apos;s you pretend your a bad guy... for a while anyway.
<br>-
<br>-1.) Evil is skin deep. Stereotypical RPG &quot;morality&quot; decisions repainted with quasi-evil text boxes.  You just get to choose some flavor text.  Occasionally there are some clever options but mostly its exactly the same thing you&apos;ve seen a thousand times.  Expect every predictable this or that, one or the other, forced game-logic decision you&apos;ve ever been pigeonholed into.  Tyranny is nothing if not plebeian in it&apos;s RPG cliche predictability.
<br>.
<br>-2.) Evil is magical.  Combat is incredibly unbalanced.  Magic dominates due to the core game design.  You have the amazing options of choosing between a party of four mages or three mages and a tank.  You CAN play differently if you really want to.  You can also cut off your head to prevent a headache.  There is too much combat in this game and mages make it all far too easy.
<br>.
<br>-3.) Evil is just another word for good.  The game was sold as something completely different than it is. You are NOT the minion of an evil overlord and you have no choice in the matter.   There are four &quot;endings.&quot;  Having played through three of them, they all appear to be the same ending, only with slightly different flavor.  It isn&apos;t even as deep as Fallout 1&apos;s different endings.  Now, the paths to get there do offer some different options and missions, so it isn&apos;t a loss.  But ultimately every path leads to the same destination, not just the same ending.  Your choices are chaotic evil good guy, lawful evil good guy or paladin-esque good guy.
<br>-
<br>VERDICT: Tyranny is not a bad game, but it will pigeonhole you into gamy decisions which lead to predictable uninspired &quot;consequences.&quot; Tyranny is everything good, bad and cliche about isometric RPGs... wrapped in skulls.  I&apos;d recommend it to old-school isometric RPG fans and absolutely nobody else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=7559270">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First thing you&apos;re gonna notice is the, may as well just say it, the LOW BUDGET. Honestly, there are no cut scenes, just some illustrations like from a book while a voiceover speaks on top of them, as well as other fluff content is missing. Gonna compare here with Divinity: Original Sin - no exactly some masterpiece from a wealthy company, but having A LOT more fluff content than Tyranny.
<br>
<br>Another thing I did not like is the complete disconnection from the game world. First of all your character is a douchebag, you can polish his douchebaggery in some situations but ultimately, you&apos;re evil as f... Also your followers are evil douchebags as well, well not all. All this makes it really hard to attach yourself not only to your character but to your followers as well, considering you&apos;re forced to be evil because the game offers little choice in the matter, and every choice can be separated between evil and lesser evil but still evil.
<br>Obviously if you have no issues with playing an evil character, then this won&apos;t matter to you. I&apos;ll just say this: the evil is not the kind of lighthearted evil you saw in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, it&apos;s pretty serious and gritty.
<br>
<br>The combat is just as boring as in their previous game: Pillars of Eternity.
<br>
<br>Oh and one more thing. There is an actual metric ton of reading. Every conversation, no matter how trivial the NPC is, is gonna have the span of a novel, and most of it is just...garbage, pointless, yielding little interesting information, filler, it&apos;s like Diablo 3&apos;s pointless dialogue but very very very long.
<br>
<br>Did I mention the low budget? Yeah, that&apos;s a doozy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6805260">Expand</a></span>

<br>To be clear, I play Villains.  My Fable toon had a halo of flies.  My KOTOR dark lady force persuaded a wookie to mad claw a twilek to the delight of a homicidal droid..  My True Neutral Baldur&apos;s Gate sorcerer treated power as a moral imperative.  Sometimes, the results of evil choices in games would cause a physical twinge from pangs of real conscience, for which immediate compensation was delivered in the form of uproarious laughter.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll find none of that here.

The only problem was that I was too quick to review this game and here are the glaring reasons:
<br>
<br>- Combat is good at first but as you play through the ai involved in it is even dumber than classic rpgs such as nwn, bg etc. You can exploit the stupidy of ai to a point that it feels cheesy and disconnecting you from the world. One example would be the aggro ranges. Which is mostly individual. You can have two other enemies still having conversations while the other half of the group attacks you just because you are in range. Don&apos;t even get me started on the sorry and disfunctional &quot;stealth&quot; system.
<br>
<br>- Story is up to a point amazing. All of a sudden everything takes an abrubt and absurd turn where all of the unique mechanics introduced in this game feel unnecessary and novel. Some of the mechanics are not even implemented at all and just there for the sake of being there. The story takes a riddiculous turn as if the whole story is finished by a 10 yr old who does not know how to create relatable connections or general consistency. If your read the bleach manga then you probably understand this. I don&apos;t want to spoil the story but you can only understand this if you finish the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810449">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s simply an issue of using a terrible old engine being used in 2016 to make a game, this feels like Baulder&apos;s Gate, in a bad way, in the dated way. It does not even look like the anti-aliasing works, and 1440p looks like 1080.. Obsidian should have bitten the bullet and upgraded to a new engine, IMO opinion this game is ruined by it&apos;s engine and I feel sorry for the developers who were stuck with it.
<br>
<br>Otherwise, if you can handle that, the RPG mechanics of it are as solid as any game. I&apos;d also like to add the &apos;pause combat&apos; is far less favoured overall by gamers than &apos;turn based combat&apos; (if that&apos;s the choice of two), look at the success of the XCOMs or Divinity OS for example.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6805493">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Most of the dialogues doesn&apos;t have voice overs (Pillars of Eternity had by far more voice overs) either which forces you to read all this damn text or you wont have a clue as to what&apos;s going on. What&apos;s more annoying is that many conversations have mixes of dialogues with and without voice overs which is super annoying. Same with the &quot;painted&quot; cut-scenes. It&apos;s like they had to leave out voiceovers because of a very limited budget.
<br>
<br>About five hours into the game it is all completely linear without any choice or side quests whatsoever (hopefully that will change).

<br>+ Very interesting worldbuilding -- culture, locations, set pieces, and rules to magic all have compelling elements that excite and drive the player forwards.
<br>+ The branching storytelling feels good on a first run-through (though my other concerns push me away from any subsequent playthroughs).
<br>? The gameplay is basic and serviceable. The exploration doesn&apos;t at all try to build on the genre, in fact feels tacked on after the fact. The combat is alright.
<br>- Regardless of how interesting the world is, it&apos;s all delivered in mostly bland exposition. It seems the writers at Obsidian are more interested in building out all the extra details and far less concerned with delivering those details in a meaningful way to the player -- a style of writing that isn&apos;t even defensible in novels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959589">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The combat/character mechanics are similar but somewhat different from Pillars of Eternity. I would say they are ok. The main problem I have with the mechanics is imo, mages and leather armor are overpowered. This makes replays less enjoyable if you are playing on higher difficulties.
<br>
<br>Overall I would recommend it. I think most rpg fans will enjoy at least the first playthrough which takes around 12-16 hours. It just feels a bit disappointing because this had the potential to be so much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6853382">Expand</a></span>

The story is great and the UI is terrific...really enjoying the rich atmosphere of the world. The opening sequence really captured my attention. So often I buy games and stop playing them quickly...this one pulled me in and hasnt let go...about 12 hours in so far.</span>

<br>
<br>Personally for me, the combat was one of the redeeming factors of this game, as it can be really brutal(i played on path of the damned difficulty), having to micromanage your party and try to get right characters to do the right things, tanks to taunt enemies away from your casters, casters to use heals and CC the heavy hitting enemies, and damage dealers to well... kill the correct enemies or focus fire. Theres plenty of customization as all characters gain &quot;talent&quot; points after each level, allowing you to build them as you see fit, and a correct build for each character goes a long way if you are having trouble with combat.
<br>
<br>The same goes for spells, each and every spell can be customized to your liking, adding bouncing effects to CC spells, increasing radius of effects or such. Want to make your fireball spell cast two balls or even add frost effect to them? You can do that, and plenty more. And all characters can use spells, except the most advanced ones ofc, as they require a really high lore skill that is primarily found on mages.
<br>
<br>Later though, the game became really easy and i was surprised that even on PoTD difficulty, i was just mowing down huge groups of enemies and barely even getting wounds or damaged. So either it was me equipping my party correctly and using correct combo abilities or spells, or there could be a balancing problem, where the game is really difficult early, but gets super easy later. Even the bosses became pushovers(and btw, there aint many epic bosses just so you know). This happened at around level 13 mark, which is pretty far into the game.
<br>Sirin is OP btw... just sayin &gt;.&gt;
<br>
<br>For me though, the major problem was the story and the games length, and lets just be frank here. This game is NOT on par with PoE in terms of story, writing and quality. The main story is pretty much this: you are a puppet of a major **** theres 2 **** factions and they are both big ****s to everyone and each other. You can either side with one of the ****s and stay loyal to the major **** or kill all of them and try to throw the major **** off his/her throne. Theres a lot of politics involved and warfare. Sadly, when you feel like you are midway through the game and its starting to get interesting, the game just abruptly ends, suggesting that either this game was initially thought to be much longer, and they just didnt have the time to finish it, OR the ending is just a plain sequel bait. There is never any reveal of the major **** here, as he/she doesnt exist in this game, even tho he/she is referenced through out the entire game. The main antagonist is not even in the game... really?
<br>
<br>Theres not even side character stories that initially were hinted at. Many of your party members have troubled pasts that could potentially be fixed or explored. Like Bariks armor as an example, theres even dialogue that suggests that at some point you could maybe be able to help him remove it, but no such thing ever happens and its just kinda forgotten after a few pieces of dialogue. They just get a small mention at the epilogue, &quot;Barik lived with his issues&quot; mkaayy then game... missed opportunity.
<br>
<br>This game is approximately 20-30h long compared to PoEs 60h+, but one thing to say tho, is that the game CAN be replayed to possibly change some of the outcomes. But i cant say much about it, because i didnt bother to replay, as many choices are superficial at best. And yes, i save scummed to test. Id rather spend 100h to complete the full game and everything in it, than complete a 50h game and do most of the same things again that i did before. Personal preference i guess...
<br>
<br>Theres also some technical issues still present, that havent been fixed after PoE. Such as long loading times, pathing problems, AI not registering ability uses, and theres also some bugs that may not allow you to finish some quests etc.
<br>
<br>Also, i just couldnt help but roll my eyes like a hundred times during some of the dialogues, as the game constantly wants to remind you, that this games world is ruled by matriarchy social system. Most of the important characters are also female. And just to be clear, i have no problems with this setup or lore, but the writing was just so poor and it made me feel as if the writer wanted to inject his/her own political beliefs into the game. Thats not good, especially when it comes out forced. It immediately takes the player out of the experience when you are confronted by real life agendas in a game, that many use to escape from reality for a brief time.
<br>
<br>In the end, the game is ok, but it just doesnt live up to the standards that PoE set. It improves on combat and AI, but fails in other departments, such as telling a compelling, complete story and keeping you invested in it.
<br>
<br>So if you want a good dose of CRPG where you get your moneys worth, get Pillars of Eternity or better yet, wait for Divinity: Original Sin 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=6989820">Expand</a></span>

Everything has a rich history and it seems important to know this for a full game experience. The fact that it&#x2019;s story-rich is nice, but I felt completely lost in an incomprehensible story. As a result the countless blocks of text that have more references than an average Wikipedia page do become annoying and hard to get into.
<br>
<br>Another problem I have with this game is the combat system, which is real-time, but I felt like it would be way better to make it turn-based as it is not clear what will happen when. The auto-pause option does not provide an equal experience to that.
<br>
<br>As a final note I&apos;d like to say something positive about the game and that is that I did appreciate the rich and worked out possibilities for character developing. And as a whole the game seemed a lot better than its &#x201C;precedent&#x201D; &#x2018;Pillars of Eternity&#x2019;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tyranny/user-reviews?user_review_id=7712329">Expand</a></span>
