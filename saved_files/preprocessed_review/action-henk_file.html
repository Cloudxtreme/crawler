Fear not,   gamers, for Action Henk is one of the best games I&apos;ve played yet. It&apos;s perfect for the perfectionists who will not stop until they get the best time they possibly can, and makes a wonderful party game to play with friends. The controls of this game can be summed up as a run button, a jump button, a slide button, and a &quot;hook&quot; button for certain levels. As simple as these controls may be, they play smoothly and enjoyably, and are fine-tuned in such a way that even a millisecond delay in pressing a button can greatly impact your run. I will warn you, however, that this game is a challenge; sure, you could easily pass most of the levels, but achieving all the medals takes 100% of your concentration. And if going for the gold isn&apos;t enough for you, you can reach for the rainbow medals. which can only be obtained by the community&apos;s most elite. The graphics are the perfect blend of quality and aesthetics, and the game almost always performs at a lovely 60 FPS. The art style reminds me a lot of Toy Story (though some of the figurines look absolutely horrifying), and the environments welcome players (or frighten them, as the game gets more difficult). Even if a difficult speedrunner isn&apos;t the game for you, you should still consider buying the soundtrack. The music is high-speed and energetic, and is always a pleasure to. Overall, Action Henk is one of those gems that might not be that popular, but are still worth the buy. I am absolutely certain that Ragesquid has a future in the gaming industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/action-henk/user-reviews?user_review_id=5270012">Expand</a></span>

Admittedly, I was put off by the low level of difficulty for the first several worlds and a lack of player mechanics. My experience in endless runner games could contribute to that, but the difficulty curve accelerates sharply in the last couple worlds--maybe a bit too much. Honestly the curve could have been a bit more steady but I&apos;ve considered the fact that the developers may have done this intentionally to get players more invested in finishing the game.
<br>
<br>The level creator is really nice but for those playing it well past launch, they might find the online multiplayer feature useless since I have checked multiple times and never seen anyone queued. The local co-op is still a lot of fun and there&apos;s definite replay value if you decide to start cracking through the ranks. Every fraction of a second counts and can increase your standing several hundred spots.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/action-henk/user-reviews?user_review_id=5248508">Expand</a></span>

<br>In short this is a 3D side platform race runner. Your aim is to get from start to finish in the shortest time available. To do that you&apos;ve got to navigate the course and use various slides, jumps, boosts and a grappling hook to your advantage. Gameplay wise it reminds a sonic game. It&apos;s fast, it&apos;s not easy but really rewarding.
<br>
<br>The environments are pretty detailed and colourful. At times I found them a bit too distracting but it&apos;s not a game breaking problem. The controls are tight, very responsive and make sense for the most part. Some slope jumps are not intuitive but you can learn them by watching the AI ghost runs. Sound design seems appropriate with the game&apos;s theme - bold, loud and cartoony.
<br>
<br>The race length is long enough too enjoy and short enough to quickly restart when you fail. Getting a gold medal on the run at certain races is really challenging. Global score sheets are really nice addition as well.
<br>
<br>This seems like a perfect fit for multiplayer although I&apos;ve not tried it.
<br>
<br>Overall enjoyed the game very much. And was happy to go trough all of the tracts. Can easily recommend to any sonic fans or people liking runners with tight controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/action-henk/user-reviews?user_review_id=7097626">Expand</a></span>
