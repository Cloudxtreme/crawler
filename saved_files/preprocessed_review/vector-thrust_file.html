<br>
<br>The keyboard control is horrible, it feels like you are flying a tug boat in the air. You can&apos;t change the mouse sensitivity (it&apos;s really slow in the menu screen). If you pause the game in-game, you can&apos;t view your options nor look at the controls. If you change graphic settings, the whole game needs to be rebooted in order for it to take in effect. The in-game music doesn&apos;t put you in that fighter mood/style, and the jet fighters look like they are made out of cardboard.
<br>
<br>Sadly because of the horrible keyboard control, I couldn&apos;t even get past the prologue because the combat was clunky. I was trying to put out my flares so I won&apos;t get hit by a missile but I pressed every letter on the keyboard to find out it&apos;s not there. It would have been nice to pause the game to look at the controls, but that&apos;s not an option.
<br>
<br>I think the only decent thing about this game is that it&apos;s Steam Workshop availability in which you can use custom jet fighter skins. But so far, that workshop section is not very popular.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vector-thrust/user-reviews?user_review_id=6554645">Expand</a></span>
