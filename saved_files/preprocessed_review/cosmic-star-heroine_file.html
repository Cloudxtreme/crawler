I&apos;m going to counter some of the blatantly abusive and out-on-some-vendetta &quot;reviews&quot; from these other users, since it&apos;s not fair really, and they don&apos;t seem to care if they damage a small two-man teams reputation or not, as long as they can swing their angry stick around for a bit.
<br>
<br>The game has bugs, and glitches, yes, it&apos;s also not polished, least not as much as it should be. That said, it&apos;s not a cash-in, it&apos;s a heartfelt, and well thought out game, that harks back to an era that makes my nostalgic muscles twitch to no end. Phantasy Star, Lunar, Chrono Trigger, Suikoden. I could keep listing, if you&apos;ve been around for long enough, or haven&apos;t but still loved these games, this game is for you, no question about it. The battle system is excellent; interesting to work with, at Heroine difficulty (the 3rd of the 4, which I recommend playing it on) - it really pushes you to think a few moves ahead with each character, and as a whole team, to ultimately get extremely satisfying results once you figure out that tactic for each fight. It&apos;s not just the boss fights that are interesting, every fight is, and as you progress, level up, get more gear and get wiser, you enjoy it more, you&apos;re rewarded for being a good player and a tactician in the field of battle. I love it.
<br>
<br>The characters are charming, with a zany sense of humor that is reminiscent of that in the Lunar series. Zeboyd know how to handle subtle references, and they know how to handle humor, so there are a few good times I&apos;ve both smiled and laughed out loud. There&apos;s a wealth of NPCs with funny tidbits here and there to share, as well as being useful for tips on battle, items, techniques, and quest clues. It&apos;s all in the world around you, you just need to look.
<br>
<br>The resolution at 1920x1080 is NOT blurry - i&apos;m playing on a 43&quot; TV at 1080 and it looks terrific, so I can wholeheartedly say that&apos;s not true at all. I&apos;ve not had any stages where my game save has become corrupt, nearly 16 hours in now and I&apos;ve not encountered any bugs, actually. That said, they&apos;re there, I&apos;ve spoken to others, and I&apos;ve seen them. However the developers have patched since these other rancid reviews were posted, and are working to another patch extremely soon. Rather than slate the developers in to the ground, these users could have reported the bugs, yes stil be annoyed because a buggy game is an annoying game, but at the very least communicate that frustration to the developers. They&apos;re not trying to get away with anything, they&apos;re 4 years in on a labor of love and they could have used more time, yes, but they didn&apos;t have it, so whatever small bugs are being encountered, and big ones, they&apos;ve tackled most of them already and are weeding out the remainders.
<br>
<br>The story is good, characters are charming, the artwork is fantastic and the overall aesthetic will pull you in if you&apos;ve a nostalgic bone in your body. At an estimated 15-20 hours gameplay, for the price of $14.99 (currently $11.99 for another 24 hours I think) you cannot ask for better value for money. People raging on this game at the loud minority, and I only wish people who have played and enjoyed the game thoroughly would speak up for their experiences, both good and bad, but at some way to support the vision of CSH and the development team, tiny a team as it is.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re not sure, watch some playthrough of it on youtube, but if you are liking it, stop watching, and go grab it, to avoid spoilers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cosmic-star-heroine/user-reviews?user_review_id=7231551">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game screams &quot;Our bank account is running low, release the game now!&quot; Blatant bugs, missing features, constant crashes and an overall terrible user experience. I mean, the game &apos;closes&apos; when you change the display resolution. Apparently that is intended behaviour, but the developer could not be bothered to even give you a confirmation screen asking for confirmation and informing the player of what is going on.
<br>
<br>Further, after playing four hours, my save file became corrupted and failed to load. And since I&apos;m past the two hour refund window on Steam, that&apos;s cold hard cash burnt in the firepit. I don&apos;t want to replay the buggy mess again, despite the gameplay being favourable and fun.
<br>
<br>Zeboyd Games should have delayed this release and dealt with these blatant issues. This mediocrity should not be tolerated from an established developer, regardless if they have a handful of staff or a full team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cosmic-star-heroine/user-reviews?user_review_id=7228251">Expand</a></span>
