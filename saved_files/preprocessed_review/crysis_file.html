And I&apos;ve played a lot, starting with Wolfenstien 3D, and even before that Dungeons of Daggorath if you want to consider a really old first person game. I can only play this game on medium detail, I have a low profile case, and as such I don&apos;t have the greatest GFX card in the world. I use a ATI Radeon HD 4650. I will say however, on medium, this game looks great compared to most of the titles I have on the XBOX 360, and compared to most of the titles I have on the PC. It plays smooth, and I&apos;m pleased with performance. It only helps to know that when I upgrade my computer a few months from now the game will scale up to it, unlike most of my titles. As far as game play, I don&apos;t understand what people really are talking about. This is what keeps me playing this game over 2 years after I have bought it. I love the fact that having a suit with only 4 options gives me so many ways to approach a situation. The enemy AI seems to act appropriately for most of my actions, but there are a few times I have to scratch my head. The plot was fine with me. Off the wall, yes... But gave the game a creepy feel to it, and kind of made the game two separate experiences with the same multitude of options to solve each. Overall, I just found this game fun. I&apos;ve become kind of immune to the FPS craze, and while I&apos;ve played games like Modern Warfare 2, and all the Halo games, Crysis is still the pinnacle of fun to me. Giving me the option to run and gun, or stand in the middle of a Korean Base fully cloaked. My one complaint, and it is a complaint in most games, the vehicles drive like cardboard boxes. In fact, the only fun I had was with the tank level, only because it was the only vehicle in the game that drove like it should. I definitely recommend this game. Just don&apos;t expect to get the highest settings out of it, but know that the game is fun and very playable at lower settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=746863">Expand</a></span>

The indoor sections are just as impressive, and various different mods and maps have proven that it&apos;s a very capable engine. Away from the graphics. (They&apos;re undeniably the best in any game so far, despite being released a year ago.) The gameplay is very good. The alien bit a the end was poor in comparison. I didn&apos;t enjoy the alien combat but when the first 75% of the game is so damn good, I don&apos;t mind that much. I&apos;m sure that people would be complaining that the game was the same through out if it hadn&apos;t been included. The suit is very useful and innovative. I got used to it quickly and it makes other games feel very basic in comparison. The AI is passable (ie, being able to do everything they should be able to do whilst still allowing you to run up to them, grab them by the neck and toss them otno the nearest land-mine). Awww... okay. Back to the graphics. After half Life 2 I didn&apos;t think I would be impressed by graphics again. I was wrong. It ADDS to the game. There are some areas which have real personality. I swear that I&apos;ve been to that industrial ruin place (just before the alien bit starts) and the entire game really has a sense of &apos;place&apos;. You never feel that you&apos;re in a level. It covers up the linearity well and brings games on to the next level. Ignore the naysayers. They&apos;re probably comparing this game to real life or something, as there is no other game to compare it to yet. (Graphics-wise. The gameplay is always a matter of personal opinion but I feel they did a very good job. I just wish enemies took fewer hits to die- I guess it&apos;s the bad side of having so many different choices and strategies to approach them.).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=420735">Expand</a></span>

And the finish of the game is really bad... It&apos;s like someone started to create something and had to do the work in 1 hour in stead of 2 months. So i had not much fun with this game..</span>

First of all, this is THE proof that will silence those fanboy gamers that cannot understand the difference between a real computer and a limited one (a.k.a., a console), because it will take another gen or two before consoles will be able to handle any graphics even close to this. Second, everyone rating it down here are just haters, gamers that are pissed off because it doesn&apos;t run well on their computer. I&apos;ve read stuff about people buying a computer for 1500 and not even being able to run it on high? I&apos;ve also read stuff about &quot;Crytek, it&apos;s the 21st century so make it run better?&quot; - that&apos;s the thing, it&apos;s the 21st century, get a decent PC instead of whining is what you should do. Such people just fail at knowing what PC to buy, mine for 1200 runs it perfectly so there you already have an example. The gameplay is just fantastic, way better than those fake games like Call of Duty 4. If you are actually a real gamer, you don&apos;t want to miss out on this game. Once more, only pissed of people don&apos;t like this game, for it is really one of the best games ever made and worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=421574">Expand</a></span>

The customization of the weapon accessories was great. The addition of tanks and the VTOL was cool. The single player story isn&apos;t the most complex but it does a good job of driving you forward.

Crytek have struck a winner, and I feel as though every aspect of each level was finely polished. Perfect.</span>

The suit abilities are excellent and give the player a nice variety of abilities to attack the enemy. Great stuff! The second half turns into an alien battle and the downhill slide begins, ending in a been-there, done-that-before, kill the giant boss, sci-fi ending. Crap. Tragic ending to an absolutely fantastic beginning. Technically, the game performance degrades in direct correlation to the length of the game. Performance was quite smooth on my e8400/ati4850, DX10, graphics all very high, for the first 2/3 of the game. The last 1/3 of the game involved multiple crashes and finally a lowering of all the settings just to be able to finish the game. One gets the feeling that they didn&apos;t get enough time to polish the second half / alien part of the game. Overall, the game looked fantastic, the sound was excellent and the gameplay quite engaging. Too bad the cliche ending and technical issues took their toll.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=422158">Expand</a></span>

<br>However if you look at the main game itself, there&apos;s not a whole lot to it other than the graphics. The story is very bland, gun play is kind of weak and the second half of the game is really boring because it takes away the sandbox elements more and more.
<br>However, I just had so much fun with the first half that I just can&apos;t give this game anything below a 6.

Still, that didn&apos;t stop me from beating the game like 3 or 4 times. (I found it challenging and enjoyable to complete the game using mostly only fists  nothing like seeing the scared face of a Korean soldier when grabbing his neck and same applies to the aliens  where else can you punch a freaking squid alien to death?) To sum up  superb game and it&apos;s a shame that the sequel went in an entirely different direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2936722">Expand</a></span>

<br>Starting with bug No 1. There is a nasty, very nasty audio bug that completely ruins the sound. Crackling and reverb banging away until you can hardly work out what is going on. The only way I found to stop it was run the game in DX9, and that meant I could only get high graphics settings. Unless you are prepared to do a little mod to your installation, you need to run in DX10 to have very high settings.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t like the no-gravity stuff much. I got quite a few bugs in there and couldn&apos;t get out. After reloading game I saw that a door was meant to open.
<br>
<br>The maze in the ship meant I got lost a few times. I mean it was not too bad, but when you had to get the Tac-cannon I got lost. Searching and searching.
<br>
<br>Then we get to the final boss. I died and died and died and died and died and died and died. On top of that, Crysis let one if its ultimate bugs out on you. You fall through the deck of the destroyer. Re-load, same thing, re-load, same thing. Start the game again, OK, died and died and died and died, and falling through the deck, and falling through the deck, and falling through the deck. I just gave up, with the boss left alive to write this review for the benefit of others. Maybe I will try finish it again, but for now, I am fed up.
<br>
<br>Basically I would say this game isn&apos;t complete and EA have a lot of apologising to do. (I&apos;d say quite poorly optimised as well.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4003817">Expand</a></span>

The engine is awesome and the graphics have aged extremely well (while the AI has not). The story and ending could have been a little more conclusive, but it that may be a matter of taste. The successors to this game might have achieved better scores if they had stuck with the open-world style used in the first installment of the series. Some sections can get a bit tedious (travelling long distances without getting spotted can take time) and a few things are poorly designed. For example when the game script wants you to do a particular thing, like battle a helicopter or stay in a particular area to finish a task, the script will give super-human abilities to your enemy who will then spot you through walls, trees and mountains (Halflife 2 does this as well so it may just be a way game designers force the player to stay on track). But at the and of the day it is a pleasent game, and one I have enjoyed completing more than once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=3442057">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics and general production values are top notch. But the gameplay is also very good and satisfying. It is no Deus Ex, but offers some freedom in how you tackle each situation, has good gunplay, and satisfying enemies.
<br>
<br>The story is the usual FPS story fare, but it works.
<br>
<br>Many people call this a tech demo. Those people are morons. Just because a game has impressive graphics, doesn&apos;t mean it was only a tech demo. This is a good game.
<br>
<br>Minus thing, is the AI, which is kind of braindead.
<br>
<br>Still, when 5 and a half year after its release, Bioshock infinite managed a 94 metacritic score while having worse graphics and gameplay, makes me shake my head...
<br>
<br>You can get it cheap now, and any modern gaming pc can max it out. So give it a shot, if you haven&apos;t already. 9/10, giving it a 10 to counter the fools with no taste in games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=6690154">Expand</a></span>

It was one game that when it came out my computer had no hope of running it so I never played it. Now my computer is better and it&apos;s a 4 year old game...so it goes. The interesting thing about that is, this game STILL looks simply stunning 4 years later. I have played other games released in the last year that don&apos;t even come close to the beauty that Crysis displays. The environment is a character itself in this one. The plants move when you walk by, the water makes ripples when you step in it, there are grouse that run in little packs and move out of your way. The sun rises and sets sending rays of light and growing shadows, it FEELS cold when there is frost. It&apos;s that good. Visually stunning, still. And that is saying a lot in the world of four year old graphics. It has been a long time since a shooter grabbed my attention and made me not want to stop playing. A LOOONG TIME, like say HALO. Shooters too often are the same game with a different title (pick any war simulation on the market today, doesn&apos;t matter who makes it, same game). This one felt different. Because the environment mattered so much it changed the whole game. Plants make cover, walk too far forward and you are seen, too far back and you can&apos;t see. Shadows, lighting all affect the AI. These AI enemies actually act with and react to the environment. Need to get past a pack of bad guys but low on ammo? Toss a stick and they&apos;ll go see what it was. Crash a truck and they&apos;ll check it out and when they don&apos;t find you, they will act nervously, searching the area. It is some of the best AI in a shooter, even now four years later. Now, I&apos;m not saying these guys are gonna win any intelligence awards, they&apos;re dumb AI. But some of the best dumb AI out there. Weapons are all unique and have their perks. Used properly all weapons are appropriately lethal. In the end this game was the whole package. Good story, great action, jaw dropping graphics, a shooter that actually rewards strategy and an environment that makes formulating one satisfying and fun. If you haven&apos;t played Crysis and want a good shooter, get this one. The game played bug free but did display a few graphical glitches that did not affect game play, just looked odd occasionally.    EDIT : Game will not play completely on DX10, which it sets by default if your system is capable.  It is necessary to force the game to play in DX9 in order to finish the game.  2 points removed from rating for this bug.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1608042">Expand</a></span>

However, I am going to complete this review without any reference to Halo. The most notable detail, one that you&apos;ll see as soon as you begin playing, is the scenery. The aesthetically pleasing environment of this FPS puts all others to shame. However, while the levels seem quite open and non-linear at a glance, they feel limited. Also the story lacks much originality as does most aspects of the game. Don&apos;t get me wrong though, it is a very enjoyable shooter that I recommend for all you have the PC requirements to play it. It may not be remembered for as long as the popular console games, but it is one of the best on PC and should definitely be on your shopping list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440427">Expand</a></span>

It is an amazing game even I played it after it being released 4 years. The environment is very well created, especially the plants are almost real, the map is sandbox, in which I play run back and fourth without getting boring. The story and the atmosphere is breath-taking that I can feel the wild survival mood and get addicted to it to play it 4 or 5 hours a day. The nanosuit enables the plays to have many alternative ways to complete the mission, if you don&apos;t want to have a fight, just switch to cloak mode to sneak, or if you are tired of repetitive shooting, just switch to power mode to beat enemies with your bare hands. If I have to name the cons, it is not optimized well that no PC can run it on maximum settings when the game is released, and my laptop which was bought in 2011 can&apos;t do it either. But anyway, it is an amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2814774">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion one of three contenders for Game of the Year along with Bioshock and Orange Box. I thought this was just going to be another graphics showcase like a lot of new games are, but I was surprised to find substantial story elements and fantastically fun gameplay. Granted, the story isn&apos;t Half-Life 2 but it actually develops throughout the game and easily exceeds the likes of the ever-popular Halo series. The graphics are without a doubt the best ever made, and provided you don&apos;t run it with antialiasing on (which doesn&apos;t make a big difference in this game anyways) the game runs pretty smooth. Don&apos;t expect to be able to run it in all very high DX10 without the latest and greatest cuz there&apos;s no denying that it was built for next-gen hardware. I run it on a Pentium 4 2.4 ghz, 768 mb ram, and 256 mb Radeon 9600xt which are all under minimum requirements and I get an average fps of around 20, so it seems like people are overbitching. The AI contrary to what many people say, I found quite good. If you snipe an enemy with a silencer, other enemies won&apos;t react until they see the corpse. They&apos;ll try to flank you, take cover, and what&apos;s really interesting is if you shoot with a silencer at an object behind an enemy, that enemy will react to the sound, caused by the impact of the bullet, and look back to see if someone is out there. It&apos;s not the greatest game ever, but it&apos;s damn close. The multiplayer is fun but it&apos;s not anything revolutionary, although i found the vehicle-based gameplay more fast-paced and fun in the long run than the battlefield series. Far Cry was good, this is a masterpiece!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=405968">Expand</a></span>

NOT EVEN TREES! With the dx10 that I have, it&apos;s a whole much better experience. The story...the part that many people also said they hated. Well, I can&apos;t blame you for that, if your not interested in aliens and nonosuits. Personally, I liked it, and the aliens weren&apos;t that bad either.The plot unveils in a great way too, and can leave you wanting to replay it constantly. It&apos;s a great game, and you should buy it.

The graphics are impressive to say the least, but run smoothly on my 2x GeForce GTX460 cards in SLI.  Overall, I enjoyed the game.  The storyline was reasonably good, but its strong suit is the action set pieces.  These were tremendous.  And the game is very atmospheric too.  When paired with the superb graphics, it feels like I really am in a jungle or on board a massive spacecraft.  I deduct points for shabby storytelling and an almost total lack of multiplayer servers available.  With a stronger multiplayer component, this game would rate an 8 or a 9, but as it stands, it is single player only.  So I can award no more than a 7.  Still worth playing however, and has aged very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2886861">Expand</a></span>

All at the same time.

It&apos;s not only with guns, the main character haves a Nanosuit, where he can be invisible, where he can have an electric armor, where he can be stronger and where he can be incredibly fast. Well, gameplay is really unique, is like 50% sandbox! You feel like a bad-ass while playing Crysis. The story is decent, and It haves intense moments. But, If you want to play this game with the highest settings, then you need a powerful PC to play it. Crysis is amazing, and you should buy it! 97 out of 100</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2615441">Expand</a></span>

The dialog would have been better if they had never said anything at all. The game has your standard assortment of weapons but once I got my hands on an AK with a scope It was pretty much the only weapon I used.  Although there was this problem I had where when I went to pick up a pistol for its ammo I ended up with two pistols and I was no longer able to sight down the barrel for precise shots which really sucked. Also for some reason the sun was rising in the south west in the game which made absolutely no sense to me.<br><br>The time spent in vehicles(tanks, helicopter) was largely frustrating and I was pretty happy when they were over.

This game is la creme de la FPS - do not miss this digital tour de force.  Overall score 9.9 -  I played this in March  2012 about four years after the release. DRM Steam only - Origin/EA not required.<br><br>[Story] Play as a super soldier marine on a search and rescue mission somewhere in the Pacific. Fight against the Koreans and then fight against the Aliens. I love pretending to be a marine - respect. [Challenges] The game play is a series of missions - stealth mixed in with run and gun. Mastering the special abilities provided by your nanosuit is required and will deepen your appreciation of each mission. I looked forward to completing each and every mission - so much fun. Gun choices are limited but there is always a right one for the job. Driving is abysmal and the weakest part of the game so just avoid it whenever possible. Tank sequences conveyed the chaos of war a little too well. Flying sequences with the VTOL were confusing at first because they are time limited adventures and the game crashes your mission when you get out of sync - just reload and enjoy. I especially liked the zero gravity exploration and combat sequences. Variety made this game great ! Playing this game on Normal was straight forward with 90% of the game played without a reload. I am gonna play this again in six months. [Children] This is an adult only title. [My PC] i7-2600K 3.4GHz / ASUS Z68 ProGen3 / 8Gig RAM / Radeon 6870 / 1920x1200 / W7 PRO SP1 [Graphics score 10] Wow may be a simple word but I was stunned at how lush this game world looked. This game needs a beast of a PC to play this on high settings - in fact my last PC could not cut it so I waited 2 years after purchase to play the game - until I built a new PC ! Even with my new rig I had problems but only in the last boss battles - I had to turn down the graphics to medium to survive without a crash - I am not kidding (and I was not the only one). [Controls score 9] I always play with a Logitech keyboard and a Kensington trackball. Remapping the keys in game was easy, but with minor annoyances like some keys that are common to all transportation - we really should be able to remap all keys for each transport mode. [Sound score 10] I always play with headphones. Voice acting great. 3D sound perfect. SFX awsome. I must say that in multi-person combat sequences sounds are so plentiful that it was hard to pay attention to command orders - incredible!

Completely void of any depth, fun, polish or characters. Crytek are the Michael Bay of the gaming industry. Throw in a couple of guns, explosions and tanks and a basic  poorly thought out plot and call it a game, then hype it up by talking about the graphics.<br><br>Never mind the strange bugs that completely ruin immersion (AI floating, spinning around and running into each other - which in itself is quite funny, penetrating walls, disappearing geometry, enemies surviving direct rocket hits and falling from towers unscathed. Not to mention I think the whole entire 1.2 million soldiers from the North Korean army actually seem to be on this island. Countless waves of them appear and are obviously spawned at random without any thought). The story is stock standard, most game elements are taken from from Far Cry and disappointing all of the bad things from Far Cry as well. Onto the gameplay thus far - raiding countless base after base, while your teammates for some reason always hang back and make you go in alone - what is this Crytek? 1995? Perhaps they spent all their time and budget modelling foliage? More bugs I remember, Helicopters that have xray vision through scrub-lands making the environment utterly pointless, enemies who always know where you are but pretend not to.<br><br>Luckily I only got this for $7 off steam. Not even worth the download, but then again coming from these developers I knew I&apos;d be in for a graphics tech demo - not a game.

The game starts out as a Korean killing simulator with generic-as-hell weapons such as the &quot;precision rifle&quot; and the &quot;shotgun&quot;. Some weapons have different firing modes and you can swap attachments for guns (e.g. scopes, silencers) after you take them off guns you find. Fortunately, the game spices things up with a &quot;nano suit&quot;, which is a very poorly-designed super-duper-ninja suit in that it only has enough battery to power one &apos;ability&apos; at a time, and only for a very short duration. Luckily, it charges quickly as well, so the skilled player must switch modes and find cover frequently to survive. The game at first looks like a non-linear exploration type game like Far Cry (even has a huge Jungle map to boot) but it becomes clear that you get very few optional objectives, and they&apos;re almost always along the way to your primary objective. The driving mechanics are a bit odd and vehicles generally have fewer hit points than I expected from playing the Battlefield series. On a number of occasions, hitting a small obstacle at low speed made my jeeps and trucks explode like a nuclear bomb on wheels. The choice of vehicles is limited and generic but they all have nitro boosters for some reason. They are not nearly as fun to drive like in other FPS games like Arma or, of course, Battlefield because they&apos;re just not flexible enough. The worst part of this entire game, though, is the fact that every scene absolutely-positively-and-with-no-argument MUST be completed in the precise way the level designers made it. For example, new paths open only after going to specific dead ends or killing a certain number of enemies. There are certain parts of the game in which you have absolutely no indication of where to go, making the latter even worse. If you have any intuition as a gamer, scrap it. The things a gamer expects to work to get to the next passage never do, and often cause you to die. And if you die after the direction is revealed, after loading you STILL have to go back to those dead ends and wait for the same scripted events to happen for the path to be open. The worst was when you knew which parts of the final boss to target and destroyed them before the scripted dialogue -- only to have them regenerate for you to destroy again when the scripted event is over. In short, this game is overly scripted and you get virtually no choice. During &quot;team combat&quot; scenes, it&apos;s clear that only some enemies are supposed to be killed by you, and the rest by the AI. In other cases, enemies spawn infinitely, making most of the game an exercise in running past enemies or cloaking while they&apos;re shooting at you (which hilariously confuses them.) The graphics are pretty nice (especially later on) but the engine is horrendously inefficient, and you will lose frames massively despite this game being 4 years old already, even on medium settings. After spending most of the time dying for FOOLISHLY playing as though you had any freedom, and not did exactly what the level designers want, the game is actually pretty short. It&apos;s a shame, too, since they obviously worked very hard on designing the graphics for the later stages. There&apos;s absolutely no incentive to explore, except to get a bit of ammo -- and in many missions you lose the previous guns you had worked so hard to find only to start with a pistol. Overall, I&apos;d give this game a 3/5 because it&apos;s obviously more creative and interesting than the same crappy recycled Call of Honor campaigns we&apos;ve suffered through for half a decade, but at the same time, you have to do a lot of boring and frustrating experimentation to see how particular parts are SUPPOSED to be finished, not how they COULD HAVE been finished had the level designers not been so narrow-minded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2928325">Expand</a></span>

The combat is fun and fast paced, and even for a six year-old game, the graphics are still quite pretty. That said, I&apos;m pretty disappointed in it. For starters, the enemy AI is brick-sucking retarded, swinging wildly between playing fetch with your bullets and pulling off some incredibly cheap kills. The voice acting is robotic at best, weapon sounds are generic, bugs and glitches leak out of every proverbial nook and cranny, and the whole game reeks of a total lack of Quality Control. Sure it&apos;s all very pretty, but why is my several-ton tank getting stuck on the tiniest rocks and ledges? I can&apos;t count the number of times I was forced to abandon vehicles simply because they got permanently wedged somewhere that a children&apos;s push car would have no trouble navigating. Worse, the game would crash to desktop every time I so much as blinked at the graphics settings, and eventually degraded into crashing any time I tried to load a save game. I was about halfway through the game when this happened. Rather than slog through hours of bugs, glitches, crashes, and cheap deaths all over again, I simply uninstalled the game and moved on to something else. The Crysis Warhead mission fixes a *few* of the crash bugs that I had, but the moronic enemies and horrible driving mechanics were still firmly in place. All-in-all, Crysis is fun, but it&apos;s far too flawed and broken for me to enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=3305147">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1. You&apos;re just thrown into the plot without ANY explanation from where they got the suits. You just watch the games trailer.
<br>2. AK-47 and Heavy Machine Guns shoot 100 bullets per minute and are as precise as sniper riffles, capable of taking you dawn from across the map. Also, they can kill you in 10 hits [counting armor] while you have to feed them 30 bullets and quit often they still stand and fire at you.
<br>3. AI meanders from stupid to ninja-level of **** either walking into the wall, or shooting you from across the map. They can see you when you&apos;re in stealth and just wait until you run out of it to shoot you in the face. They do not need to reload or wait for cooldown.
<br>4. Ammo is to precious to use, since your enemy, that can take forever to kill and shoots 100 bullets in minute, carries only 30 bullets and they come in the squads of 10, often leaving you without ammo and killing you, so basically rush your opponents and punch them whenever you can.
<br>5. Suit is useless, because you do not have time to switch modes [enemy fires at you] and you will be stuck in the situation, where you&apos;re better off with extra armour anyway.
<br>6. Did I mention that I played for 2 hours and still, didn&apos;t get past 1 mission? Yeah, when enemies hit every time from across the map, leave you without ammo after a minute of fight and still are alive after feeding them 200 bullets [on normal difficulty nonetheless] and you have MANUALLY pick up ammo I just gave up on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871728">Expand</a></span>

Aside from the graphics, which are amazing, I&apos;m finding this game tedious. There are way too many outright mistakes, which are a distraction. The AI stinks. I just spent 5 minutes running through a forest in the dark with a helicopter trailing me and shooting at me, even under a canopy of trees, even when cloaked. It could even see me through mountains - it would start shooting at me before it crossed ridgelines. Shoot a chicken, then walk over it, and it still clucks. The tires of vehicles squeal in gravel, sand, and grass. Occasionally wierd things happen with the physics like a soldier stuck through the center of the wall of a destroyed shack, tumbling in place.

I lost all interest after the Core level because from there on its nothing but alien crap. The end boss was extremely cheesy and seemed like it was added at the last minute just to have a boss.</span>

It may have set a graphics milestone at it&apos;s time, but that doesn&apos;t compensate for the boring gameplay. Not to mention the ridiculous amount of bullets needed to kill an un-armored enemy.</span>

The most enjoyable thing to do is to use strength to bounce around, jumping on enemies and punching them through houses, then picking up the bits of building and throwing them at other baddies.. Additionally, the suit stats are very easy to tweak in a config file - otherwise running and cloak only last a few seconds. Surely strength should make for faster running?.. Stunning, but a dull premise. Presumably this game will suffer as Doom 3 did, when it was released before mainstream PC&apos;s could handle it properly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=408378">Expand</a></span>

I have a brand new high-end PC, so it&apos;s not the hardware that makes me rate this game so low. It&apos;s just that you can buy other FPS games that use your system&apos;s ressources to much better effect, like BF2 or COD4. Make sure you download the demo before buying the game and see for yourself if your system can run the game decently and to find out if the cheesy sci-fi theme is really your cup of tea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=408431">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it has some amazing visuals, but everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) else is just wrong with this game. Don&apos;t waste the 50 bucks people. This thing is bargain bin material as control is horrible and not sharp, game AI can&apos;t even compete with the likes of Far Cry or FEAR or even the first HalfLife. The engine is riddled with bugs and anomalies, and the game is coded horribly where even the highest end PC will choke and sputter in areas where they just cut short development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=405895">Expand</a></span>

This game plays exactly like Far Cry which is great... for four years ago. The &quot;New and Innovative&quot; Nano-suit doesnt bring anything new to the table. Some might say the abilty to cloak and the different enhancements are innovative, but they arent. while the enviroments, like i said before, look amazing, they are not used to their full potential like they were in Far Cry... they are mainly just there for eye candy. AI wise, this game is lacking, the biggest problem about the Nano-suit that i mentioned before is that the enemies hav no way of counteracting it. (especially the cloaking ability, that enemies can never detect, which you will fall back on so much as to the point it turns into a crutch). Some will also say the AI is great because they will attack you en mass use cover and turrets and once and a while lob a grenade. Except thats not great AI, thats average AI, and its nothing i havnt experienced before, especially since i play F.E.A.R. Half-Life and Halo. Considering how technically impressive this game is i expected so much more in the AI department. Lastly, while the physics were usually solid, there were to many glitches and &quot;WTF&quot; moments that just took away from the whole experience and stole you away from an otherwise mezmorizing enviroment (which was mainly the incredible graphics). To wrap everything up, this game is stuck in the past. Everything, other then the graphics, is something you&apos;ve seen and done before and none of it is done all that well. Other then the graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=406821">Expand</a></span>

Great features for variety in play using nanosuit. Regardless of which boost you choose, it doesn&apos;t truly help the boring gameplay. Far Cry actually had very good fps mechanics and you could &apos;feel&apos; your own involvement throughout the cheesy story. In Far Cry 2.0 (or, Crysis) you&apos;ve got a super nano suit which makes you look cool but you&apos;ve got zero aim, even though you clearly are aiming at enemies&apos; body and head. It just seems to pass through them MOST of the time. Who wants to labour through this sort of tedious inaccuracy in gameplay? story is straight out of patriotic US blockbuster cheese. Who cares about anything when everything is so predictable and shallow and contrived. Where is the creativity? Oh the graphics are great apparently but only 10% of us gamers will understand or know why. To the rest its low specs to get frame rates running ok. Wow anyone who enjoyed Far Cry is going to be disappointed at the giant leap BACK that this game somehow has managed to achieve. Its just a boring, frustrating experience and I cant believe such anticipation is shattered after a few hours of crushing disappointment - the experience becoming a reality not just holding my breath thinking &quot;I&apos;ll grow into the game&quot;. Send Crytek the right message - gameplay first and above all! More than just a disappointment!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=406881">Expand</a></span>

There is nothing new or innovative whatsover in it, aside from the pretty graphics. If you enjoy pumping the dumb ai with a full clip of ammo only to watch them standing there laughing at you, invincible....then this game is for you... Otherwise, go out RIGHT NOW and buy a masterpiece like COD 4...you see, crytek, infinity ward has one up on you...they know how to deliver a game that keeps on delivering...not just delivering hype.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=407730">Expand</a></span>

Choppers that can follow you even when you are in stealth mode, but they don&apos;t shoot at you until you lose stealth. Horrible squad AI, teams standing in wide open, with cover on both sides of them, letting you shoot them without moving. Bad final boss that seems to have been just slapped there for the purpose of having a final fight.<br>The biggest problem with this game is that it gets compared to Half Life 2 and as such it fails on so many levels, no matter how pretty the graphics are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2252362">Expand</a></span>

Is it pretty?, yes Is the multiplayer good?, sparlingly Is the single player good? Makes Halo 3 look lie a shakespearean soliloquy, and Halo 3 is meh at best, maybe a 5. All in all if you have to get a game to justify the 500-2000 dollars you spend on high end graphics card(s) and the other 1000-2000 dollars for a system I guess I would be giving it a 10 so I could still live the lie. Unfortunately for crysis, valve decided to release the best gaming value in modern recorded history and 1 match of TF2 makes the the 60 bucks I spent on Crysis look like a it would have been better spent on buying the orange box for one of my friends or a nice logitech headset.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=405833">Expand</a></span>

AI is generally retarded, best part about the game would be the physics engine, and it gets old real fast. Most amount of fun you can have with this game is throwing barrels at a tin house to watch it fall down, because the gun fights aren&apos;t even mentionable. Just a sub-standard FPS with sci fi inputs, with a cool graphics engine.</span>

I don&apos;t know what game reviewers were thinking when they said all of this. Best looking game ever? The graphics were sub par. Facial features were horribly cartoonish and they do not come near the likes of Call of Duty 4. The graphics aren&apos;t HORRIBLE but, its what I expect to come out around the Half-life 2 era, not now. The gameplay is fun, the powers are cool, however...with objects disappearing at a certain range then reappearing when you&apos;re close (even enemies) it&apos;s impossible to scope out a place and find the safest route because as you run for an area suddenly an enemy &quot;appears&quot; in what looked to be clear area beforehand. How unrealistic is that? Next, even if I do find an enemy at a safe distance and go for a shot, the guns you use are horribly inaccurate at a range of more than point blank. I remember doing single shots at maybe 200 meters from the enemy and have about half a clip unloaded before he died. This leads me to another thing..a guy gets shot, he looks around searching for you, runs around aimlessly, does not look to take cover. horrible AI anyone? I think EA MUST have paid these guys to give this game good reviews because this is not NEAR any of the recent FPS&apos;s that have come out and are not even in the same category. Please, someone, show me how all my points are incorrect. But thus far, me and 3 friends who have played the game found the EXACT same problems. Its not only me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=405729">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m going to start with, what I am calling the, &quot;fists of fury&quot; inaccuracy.
<br>In the game, your suit allows you to temporarily, Very temporarily, increase body functions, armour or become invisible.
<br>So during the later parts of the game, In one of the alien missions, you encounter these VERY Matrix&apos;s &quot;Sentinel&quot; looking creatures, they even spread their tentacles to walk along the ground and attack you. I was being swarmed by about 3 of them, firing my weapon madly at them, throwing grenades and everything, Sparks were flying off them, but they still wouldn&apos;t die. But as one crawled closer to me, the &quot;grab enemy&quot; icon come up, So I grabbed this squirming robotic alien creature, And began punching it (because your weapon will automatically switch to fists when grabbing something large) and found if you increase your strength, and continue punching it, you&apos;ll actually deal A LOT more damage, than with your bolt action, precision sniper rifle, or your under-slung grenade launcher.
<br>
<br>And the characters for the Game were such stereotypical action movie characters. Even though you&apos;re a Special forces squad, and I know for a fact you ALWAYS work in, or very close to your squad, in real life, for some reason, your higher ranking, and more experienced team leader, orders you to Leave the squad and attack a villiage of hostiles on YOUR OWN! It&apos;s stupid! I know the US army is dumb, But their Special forces aren&apos;t THAT dumb!
<br>I&apos;m about to talk about the story, so stop reading if you, strangely, want to play this game.
<br>Towards the end of the game, you find yourself in the most obvious Hollywood scene ever. You&apos;ve been saved by your best buddy, who you saw being dragged off and wounded by a large robot, but somehow lived; it never explained it.
<br>You&apos;re then taken to a nearby aircraft carrier. where You&apos;re told to go to go to the bridge where you hear a general ordering a nuclear attack on the island, But an intelligent, and hot, researcher/scientist&apos;s daughter, is pleading him not to attack, because attacking them will only make them stronger. Anyway, the dumb American general talks about saving his &quot;planet&quot;, Not his country, But his whole planet, and then disregarding ALL scientific evidence, research and suggestion, by nuking the whole island, and making them stronger and angrier... WOW! Big surprise, like that&apos;s not the over-used type of American character. That would never happen, it&apos;d make too many other countries angry, including the Koreans who were also on the Island.
<br>But then, after he admits he might have been wrong, nothing happens to him! You don&apos;t know if he lives or dies, because he orders you to go out on the deck, and fight the aliens that he just pissed off! When you come back, all the crew are gone! Some how they escaped while you were fighting the aliens.
<br>
<br>And the Plot is just Stupidly and boringly close to Farcry&apos;s plot! It was exactly the same, except replace the mutated creatures with aliens... BAM! Same game, better graphics. That&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>In Conclusion; The Graphics were amazing, and beautiful. The suit was modeled and animated beautifully, I often found myself stopping in combat, just to check out the suits. And the faces during the cinematics are so beautiful and realistic, You can actually see the emotions, It&apos;s an amazing feat.
<br>And the special effects, were a great addition into helping to immerse me in the feel and atmosphere of the area.
<br>The suits&apos; abilities, the jungle areas and fooling the AI by running into a bush, cloaking then running out the other side were also very enjoyable.
<br>So to the coders and the Artists, Well done! You guys deserve an award, or a medal. Especially the Artists, for all their amazing work. Well done.
<br>
<br>But to the writers and game designers... Go write some low-budget horror films or action films in Hollywood, you&apos;d fit right in with all the other senseless crappy plots. Don&apos;t write for games! The story is the same as Farcry&apos;s, the progression was WAY too fast, the change from Koreans to Aliens was dumb! Fighting the Koreans was the only fun part. Which is like the first level, so if you want to play the only good part of the game, get the demo... Seriously.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=68501">Expand</a></span>

Using suit powers is just a frustrating joke, since doing so means stopping mid combat, and in this game you are easily hurt. What also makes it frustrating is that ammo is far too precious. When you have to pick up all the ammo you come across on normal difficulty, you know there is something wrong. In addition, when I did get ammo, you had to pick it up manually, as if you would deny yourself of ammo? Often this caused me the trouble of pick up a weapon I did not want and dropping the old one with all the ammo I had saved up.<br><br>Whoever made this game&apos;s driving system needs to die. Never have I seen a car drive so poorly. Not only are you forced into 1st person driving, the steering is also rubbish. The steering is unresponsive and sluggish. I commend anyone who can get through anywhere at a decent speed without crashing.<br><br>What really ended it, was the way they made the controls work. The way I see it, they could have combined several key strokes in a few places to save the player. In fact, some essential controls, weren&apos;t even mapped on the keyboard for default! In the end what ruins the game is the feeling that you are fighting your own body, more than the enemy. This game would be great if EA knew that crouch and crawl don&apos;t have to be 2 different buttons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1706867">Expand</a></span>

Who cares about overblown graphcs that can&apos;t run with nice FPS fastest PC&apos;s. The physics seem nice at first glance, but later you can clearly see that you can only do thing programmers predicted. Some objects can&apos;t be destroyed, no matter how big is your gun - pathetic. The AI is really terrible, enemies get fooled easily, often do absurd things...plus AI cheats in a visible way. Get used to being cased by 30+ soldiers, a tank, 2 hellicopters. Maybe it only seems strange to me when a hellicopter wastes over 20 rockets to kill me - one damn American supersoldier. The stroy seems stupid as well - enemies in nanosuites, aliens... like we haven&apos;t seen that before. And the stupid idea of making the player something like 80&apos;s action-movie hero that does everything solo. You&apos;re like John Rambo, you kill the whole army. With time you get bored with constant &apos;sneak - headshot - run - sneak - headshot&apos; routine and avoid enemies unless &apos;the mission&apos; forces you to face them. It&apos;s really more of an advanced benchmark with ambitions rather than a real game...just like FarCry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=407924">Expand</a></span>

However just coming out in 2007 already feels dated. I&apos;m not sure why everyone is raving about the graphics they are just whatever in my opinion. The game is full of glitches including suicidal enimes (saw enemy jeep crash for no reason and saw a enemy solider walk off a bridge to scream in horror). The game doesn&apos;t seem that well thought out either you have a choice to pick up almost anything thing and use it as a weapon, but why? Wen you have many type of guns. Also I&apos;m not sure why every enemy solider has to be shot so many times before they die. I understand I&apos;m wearing a supersuit and you will fight others in them as well but the regular wimpy koreans? This game is a bit of a sandbox which is nice so there isn&apos;t only one way to take care of a problem so it does make you feel like you are in control however overall I do regret buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=743261">Expand</a></span>

Its nearly impossible to play this game with an older system, the story is a bit boring, it is a standard story, nothing really new. The physic in this game is cool but unprecise, I often see corpses which rotating on their weapons and roofs standing on one balk and the corpses fall down like stones, its just unrealistic.</span>

Wonder who paid the reviewers to write favourable reviews about this &apos;i can draw tropical islands only&apos; engine with poor attempts to have a gameplay. If you want shiny graphics, latest 3D mark should be on the list as well, with 100 points.</span>

In Crysis, you&apos;re better off unloading the whole clip into their body, because, as an expert Marine marksman, headshots just aren&apos;t doing it for me no matter what weapon I use... The other part that boggles my mind is the system requirements needed to play. Granted, the graphics are far superior to games like Battlefield 2. However, the gameplay makes one feel like they wasted their hard-earned money to upgrade their system for a flawed game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=411289">Expand</a></span>

These new &quot;photorealilisitc&quot; games like Crysis and Bioshock are proof that graphics really are not a substitute for good gameplay.</span>

Multiplayer wise love it. but wish they kept the gore level in that we saw in Alpha. IE corpse chunks from MOAR</span>

It&apos;s not good level design to fill up arenas with too much stuff. This game is thwarted at every turn by trying to be graphically impressive to the point where the gameplay is either ruined or forgotten. The shrubbery at the start of the island is a perfect example of this. The engine itself has an awful time dealing with this because you can&apos;t find a patch of uncovered ground that doesn&apos;t have a destructable tree, or some stupid bush. It gets old really quickly and there aren&apos;t any memorable aspects of level design that show the designers had any idea how to make the game immersive. The kicker with the abundance of items in the environment is that to keep a decent fps I need to play on all low settings, yet I have a quad processor at 3 GHz, 6 Gb of RAM and a 512 Mb video card. This game isn&apos;t a technological or graphical marvel, it&apos;s just a long series of lazy attempts at coding, and a long forgotten purpose. This just doesn&apos;t compare to what CoD4 has, or Half Life 2 - when Valve made a physics engine they incorporated it directly into the gameplay and it ran great on existing hardware or it could look great on a top of the line new rig. When the Crytek team made this they didn&apos;t factor in gameplay at all, and were so busy patting themselves on the back from overworking the hardware that they completely forgot about the experience for players. I really wanted to like this game - but it&apos;s just misdirected. It reminds me most of Quake 4 - a poor game made on a buggy engine. The reviews of this game listed above on Metacritic are very misleading. Some even give Crysis 4 out of 5 (or 80% as Metacritic shows it), yet the quotes chosen don&apos;t tally with this. You don&apos;t miss out on anything from not buying or playing this game, there are loads of other shooters that would be better purchases.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/crysis/user-reviews?user_review_id=410149">Expand</a></span>
