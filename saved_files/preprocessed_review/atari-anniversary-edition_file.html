It has a very good arcade feel to it. I don&apos;t have any real control issues as were mentioned by some of the reviewers. I have it set up with my HotRod Joystick and it does a very good job of providing the arcade feel to it. A couple of the games, Missle Command and Centipede, work better with my Logitech Marble Mouse. It does very well for these two. The arcade machine art is very good for each machine. You can fully install the game so you will not have to stick the cd in each time you play (which I hate). The interface is very easy. The price is very reasonable. If you like the older arcade games this is as good as I&apos;ve seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/atari-anniversary-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=367819">Expand</a></span>
