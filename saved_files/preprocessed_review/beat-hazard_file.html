If you have a music collection you enjoy and aren&apos;t bothered too much by ALOT of flashing lights, this is a solid title.  It&apos;s challenging and it plays all your favorite music.  It&apos;s hardly something you can play everyday, but if you feel like some tunes but don&apos;t wanna just stare at the wall, this thing is great.</span>

The lights are not a problem for me. I just can&apos;t really bare with the lights on a full 200%... Hahaha. You guys should try the demo out before you buy because I don&apos;t think this game is for everyone.</span>

It would be easy to believe. However, what you get is a game of Asteroid with sensory overload, and only the absolute minimum of music influence on the gameplay itself. Never once did I feel like the gameplay matched the flow of the music, and the entire music aspect of the game could be perfectly replicated by making a plain old asteroid clone, muting the music, and opening Winamp before playing. The price tag is far to high for this. If you want to play a pretty version of Asteroid, then consider this when it comes down in price. There&apos;s no real criticism for actual gameplay, but there&apos;s no real compliments either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=747636">Expand</a></span>

I would compare it with Audiosurf - that&apos;s logical, but  those games have very less in common. Of course, your mp3&apos;s create levels in both games, but Beat Hazard is a classical space-shooter, like Asteroids.  It&apos;s rapid, flashy and punishes you for every mistake... and yes, visuals are very intense. That&apos;s why it&apos;s perfect for 15 minutes break - your eyes won&apos;t get tired.  Unfortunately, developers could really spice up some features.. and they did not. Your music has very questionable influence on your game - sometimes it kinda catch up, other times it fails totally. When you use more advanced perks (you unlock them when clearing songs) and turn the difficulty up, it seems to match the music in a better way... but still, it&apos;s not so precise as Audiosurf. In conclusion - pretty nice game, for all arcade shooter fans. Grab it when there&apos;s a discount and be sure to buy the &quot;ultra&quot; edition, with many more perks to unlock and new enemies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085303">Expand</a></span>

I like this kind of 2d-space-shooter thing and I love music, so I thought I would like this a lot more.  But it ends up feeling like AudioSurf&apos;s rambunctious little brother.<br><br>The biggest problem is that it&apos;s too damn bright and flashy. As in, it actually hurts my eyes to play this thing for more than a few minutes.  Everything seems to have bright white sparkles and bursts.  It&apos;s ridiculous.  Even with the brightness settings turned all the way down, it&apos;s annoying.  I shouldn&apos;t need sunglasses to play a video game.<br><br>Once you get past that, it&apos;s just not that great at mapping the gameplay to the music.  Audiosurf does a good job of making fast songs fast and crowded while slow songs are more leisurely. Beat Hazard just doesn&apos;t seem to differentiate the songs as much. Maybe it depends on what sort of music you put into it, but it wasn&apos;t working for me.<br><br>On a positive note, the &quot;earn points to unlock things&quot; is kind of neat and one way to make players want to come back for more.<br><br>Long story short, if you can get past the obnoxious flashing of the screen and really, really want to shoot some spaceships and asteroids while listening to your music, it might be worth the $5 or so it costs when it&apos;s on sale.  I personally don&apos;t recommend it, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=1718825">Expand</a></span>

Beat Hazard provides a unique gameplay experience with every new track since various musical elements change the way the game reacts; tempo controls your rate of fire, the number of foes, and the way enemies attack. Slow songs don&apos;t have as many baddies, but you can&apos;t shoot as many projectiles from your ship. Meanwhile, up-tempo/club-mix tracks will have you on the edge of your seat as the screen explodes with enemies, but lends you a dazzling array of attacks to deal with the horde. If you want to play this on PC, Highly recommend using/getting an XB360 gamepad, it is a shooter, and the keyboard/mouse doesn&apos;t do it justice. Beat Hazard is available for both XBox 360 and PC. Go to the XB Live Marketplace to get it for 400pts, or head to Steam; ~$10. This game is a must-have for anyone who loves Audiosurf (another music driven game), craves a unique/addictive game experience, or needs yet another reason to pump up the volume.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=2807764">Expand</a></span>

Beat Hazard is clearly my favorite out of all the music based games I&apos;ve played. The new DLC for it makes it multiplayer, which is insanely fun (as long as they have some of the same songs as you), and the perks system is nice.</span>

The game was so bright and flashy that I literally could not see it, even after turning down the brightness. Even on slower songs (which really differ very little from their upbeat counterparts) the game spawned massive amounts of enemies which felt like they really had no place there. The effects were cool when I could see them, and the game felt very modern Asteroids-esque, and listening to my music whilst playing was fun, but I might as well turn on iTunes for that eh?

It does a good job with it, with big flashy explosions, gunfire, enemies and more during high points of the music, contrasted by slow enemies (after the balance patch) and weak gunfire during the lulls.  Featuring generic space-based enemies, Beat Hazard does leave a lot to be desired graphically and atmospherically.  The overly flashy effects (literally FLASHY) is an annoyance to some gamers, but I enjoyed it and thought it added tension; there is order to the chaos on the screen - it just takes some experience to recognize it.<br>The gameplay is a straight-forward bullet-hell shoot-em-up, featuring a single level-clearing powerup and smaller cumulative weapon strength powerups.  Beat Hazard is by no means easy, but eases the difficulty with a simple level-up system, which takes dozens of hours to max out.  The enemies are easy to understand, from path-following suicide ships, to crumbling asteroids, to player-seeking armed ships and to the behemoth dividable boss ships.  If there&apos;s one thing Beat Hazard lacks in gameplay, it&apos;s not the fast paced adrenaline-filled action, but the lack of diversity in weaponry, enemies and powerups.<br>Overall, Beat Hazard is a great attempt at an action-music game, with a huge advantage in being able to use your own music library.  Highly recommended to fans of indie games or anyone who craves a throwback to arcade games of the 80&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=2293831">Expand</a></span>

I love shmups, and Beat Hazard uses the classic Asteroids-style level set up of you spawning in the middle and enemies attacking from all sides. For me, good music is a huge part of how I feel about a game, but in Beat Hazard, YOU make the soundtrack. To quote Aerosmith, music is the weapon. The gameplay is massively addictive, and paced brilliantly- the intensity of the visual effects and your enemies&apos; assaults, is dependent on the pace of the music- as is your own ship&apos;s weapons. As you grow in power, so do your foes. And when the music reaches a crescendo, it&apos;s time for a boss fight. The &quot;Ultra&quot; addon massively enhances the game, adding loads of new enemy types, special weapons and perks for your ship, and new bosses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507933">Expand</a></span>

Which makes this game very flexible for those who are looking for a distraction, or a light flickering challenge. With the option of playing with a friend or stranger online, this game constantly offers unique challenges when playing alone or with a friend and is definitely worth the $10 dollars.</span>

However if you splurged a little extra on the &apos;Ultra&apos; DLC, it becomes an awesome game.  There are a couple modes, all of them fun in their own way (as long as you&apos;re not an epileptic), and the game itself is incredibly intoxicating.</span>

<br>Very interesting is the achievement part of the game and the RSS feed. You get noticed live if you climb the world ladders or if there is somebody willing to play online, you just have to press F1 and you can duel or coop with him.
<br>
<br>The bad part is that there are not so much enemy unit types, and the interaction between what happens on screen and your music could&apos;ve done better.

<br>I found Beat Hazard in the current Humble Bundle, I paid 1  for this and other 3 games, so I actually really recommend you to get this bundle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=3014387">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed Beat Hazard, but the reason I did was purely because of my childhood. As a kid when I listened to music it was on a desktop PC with the visualizer on. I loved those screens and their fun transitions and colors.

<br>
<br>So that brings us to this game. Beat Hazard. It&apos;s a visualizer with spaceships and lasers and such. You control a space ship, and play a game very similar to Asteroids, you can move your ship, and you shoot at others.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m finding words hard to think of.
<br>How about this: There is a warning at the beginning that says if you&apos;re sensitive to intense bright and flashing lights you best beware of the game, no refunds. But that&apos;s prompted... somewhere in the steam store page I think.
<br>
<br>Before you start a song (which you can use songs from your library) you will be given options to change the difficulty, visual intensity, and your set perks. The perks system is a bit ham-handed and forced in (or at least it feels like it) basically just changing the pickups or certain multipliers you get at the start of a session.
<br>Speaking of, the level up system is just for score purpose, so it doesn&apos;t really feel needed, since there&apos;s other ways to measure your score.
<br>
<br>There are no true pickups besides bombs, so fans of contra-style pickups will be disappointed for certain.
<br>
<br>But for all of the cons for the game, I keep coming back for more, so I&apos;m not really sure what to do here. If you&apos;re on the fence, I suggest you wait for a sale, you aren&apos;t missing much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446612">Expand</a></span>

Like &apos;Asteroids, Geometry Wars, Darius Twin, Giga Wing, 1943, LifeForce, Gradius, Raiden, Super Stardust, etc. You get the point, there are a lot of spaceship shooty games on the market.
<br>
<br>Sad to say however, &apos;Beat Hazard&apos; adds nothing new to this already saturated genre other than allowing us to play along to our favorite songs. But we could already do that by listening to our favorite songs while playing better versions of this game with the sound off. It was a nice attempt but &apos;Beat Hazard&apos; falls really flat, no pun intended. There is just too much going on visually, even when turning the effects down half-way, and sometimes it&apos;s much too difficult to distinguish from what will and will not hurt you as debris flies all about. Not to mention the graphics look very cheap, especially the spaceship, and with a game with so many visual effects, it seriously hinders the experience, at least for me.
<br>
<br>Overall there is still some fun to be had here, but pick &apos;Beat Hazard&apos; up on sale, because ten bucks is just too much to pay for this generic pile of visual poppycock. The &apos;Survival Mode&apos; is the one aspect that may keep you coming back, but other than that, avoid this game for something better like one of the titles mentioned above, because honestly, the one thing this game promises to do; power itself with your music, it doesn&apos;t even do very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beat-hazard/user-reviews?user_review_id=5030922">Expand</a></span>
