Usually there&apos;s something there: a nice environment in which to wander, at least one nice gameplay aspect, some fun character work. Not so with Wayward Manor. I suppose you could say that Neil Gaiman&apos;s writing style provides a few decent turns of phrase, but they can&apos;t allay such a relentlessly repetitious clanger as this. The game is about 2.5 hours long, and you&apos;ll wish it was shorter. It is the opposite of fun.
<br>
<br>I helped to crowdfund this game, so I have every reason to tell myself it&apos;s good in order to feel like less of a mug, but it&apos;s really not. Originally, this game asked for funding in July 2013 and promised a Fall 2013 release. It sailed through further release targets, and told the community right up until release day that it hadn&apos;t been able to supply gameplay videos because the team was focussed on &quot;making the game awesome&quot;. Review copies didn&apos;t go out until a few hours before the keys went public, with good reason given the sub-50% reviews it&apos;s now receiving. That&apos;s not a nice way to treat investors or new customers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wayward-manor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4366382">Expand</a></span>

The story is engrossing, with a similar tone to Coraline and The Graveyard Book&#x2014; perfectly fit for the inquisitive (and slightly macabre) teen. The gameplay offers simplistic, yet subtly challenging puzzles. There&apos;s a sense of mystery left at the end, one that makes me yearn for more. A pure gaming experience.</span>
