<br>
<br>All the game does is take the (free) Tutu engine modification, slap it on, add a couple of new characters and quests, and triple the price of the game. They also managed to introduce a load of new bugs into the game that community patches had mostly fixed with the old versions. Of course, those community patches now don&apos;t work properly with this version, so it&apos;s technically inferior as well.
<br>
<br>Here in the UK, this game costs &#xA3;14.99 on Steam. Alternatively, you can buy the entire Baldur&apos;s Gate series from GOG.com collectively for &#xA3;13.26 ($19.98), and apply the free Tutu mod (or BG Trilogy mod if you prefer, which does a similar thing) to get about three times the content for a lower cost. Do that instead of buying this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3002304">Expand</a></span>

The enhanced edition adds a few extra characters and quests here and there, but it is largely the same as the original. There have been a number of issues with bugs in the steam edition, but these are fixable and hopefully updates are on the way now that contractual issues have been resolved. Worth a positive score simply because the original game was that good, but this port has not enhanced the game in any particular way. Definitely worth playing if you enjoy RPG&apos;s, it&apos;s the most in depth game of it&apos;s time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3515759">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the good side: the new characters are fantastic, though their balance is questionable. All three have such good voice acting and character development that they honestly feel as if they were there from the beginning. As to the balance I mentioned, Dorn is a killing machine that puts Minsc to shame. Neera is a wild mage... which... well you know about wild mages. Rasaad is a meat popsickle. I liked his character, so I played with him the entire game. He was terrible, simply because low level monks are worthless in this edition of the D&amp;D ruleset. Ironically they scale incredibly well, so by the end of BG2 Rasaad is going to be a rampaging god of death. But he is simply dead weight in BG1.
<br>
<br>On the bad side: they say they added over 400 improvements? Well they broke just as many things. The game is riddled with bugs, and considering how many hours I&apos;ve put into the original BG1 and BG2, I feel rather sure that a lot of these bugs weren&apos;t around before. Nothing is game breaking (except for one big one I&apos;ll mention in a second), but its a lot of very pervasive minor stuff. Characters will audibly confirm a movement order, then not move until you click a second time. Characters won&apos;t autoattack when they should. It was enough that halfway through, I was feeling pretty disillusioned. I could have bought the gog non-enhanced version for half the price, and except for the new characters been perfectly happy. The nail in the coffin for me did not come until the very end however.
<br>
<br>I beat Sarevok in the final showdown, the game pauses and gives the message &apos;congratulations on beating Sarevok! Your game will now be saved for export to BG2!&apos;. And then it crashed to desktop. A quick google search showed that this is a bug that was well known before the beta, quite a few people have experienced it, and they released the game with it still there. I didn&apos;t get to see the ending cinematic. I don&apos;t really care. I just feel ripped off that on top of all the small bugs, this huge bug made it through to production. It ended the experience on a giant, wet and floppy sour note.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t be buying BG2:EE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2950393">Expand</a></span>

<br>I feel like they should have just went ahead and used a different engine for the game (like the neverwinter nights 2 one, or something similar and more stable).

The music is good, the combat is ok (so many misses early game) characters are cool, but rarely bother to talk aside from those annoying movement lines. Story is mediocre. Oh and the intel graphics problems are so easily fixed, you actually don&apos;t deserve the game if you think they are a problem. Fixed it in 10 minutes.

I&apos;d personally recommend getting the originals off of GoG and then adding mods to bring it up to your tastes, since the fan mods aren&apos;t bound by the same restrictions Beamdog was and have put forth a much more enjoyable game.
<br>
<br>Well it was a project doomed to failure before it even began. They&apos;re under contract to not change ANY of the original story plots or character quests, which means anyone hoping to see BG and BG2 in the way they were MEANT to be played, without the time constraints that forced so many quests and characters to be dropped...you&apos;re out of luck. Even among the modding community only a handful of the unfinished quests and plots have been implemented. And those terms are very likely to carry forth to BG2:EE as well. Meaning several character&apos;s questlines and plot points will remain tragically cut short, and ToB will still be a gutted, contradictory mess of what was supposed to have been an epic third full game (not an expansion) finale to the series.
<br>
<br>And rather then correcting oversights in the BG2 engine that EE uses, they&apos;ve broken it even further. Not to mention the new kits that are utterly broken (either they don&apos;t work at all, or are stupidly overpowered). But I don&apos;t 100% blame the developers for that. BG2&apos;s hasty release resulted in several official kits being grossly more powerful then intended and Beamdog simply based their new kits on those already in the game, since they&apos;re contract bound to not re-balance the kits. The new NPCs are somewhat of a mixed bag. Dorn is an overpowered monster that doesn&apos;t need a party at all, while Neera and Rashad are closer to proper NPCs (Rashad being grossly underestimated due to the fact that a low level monk plays MUCH differently then a high level one, rather then playing the same way throughout as in 3rd edition). The 4th hidden character, despite having ridiculous stats (they don&apos;t really do anything worth while to warrant griping about, unlike Dorn), isn&apos;t a gamebreaker any more then any other npc part-caster can be, and has a reasonably well written personality. With exception to Dorn, who needs some heavy tweaking, the NPCs weren&apos;t too bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168987">Expand</a></span>

I give this game an earnest 7/10 because for the most part, it is still a solid game as it once was, and the writing for both the companions and the Black Pits seem decent.  Where this game lost marks on, however, is the seemingly lack of content.  15 years later, this game really hasn&apos;t changed much, and much of the improvements can be found through modding the original game at absolutely no charge.  There seems more readily apparent bugs than what was fixed, and the new content simply do not seem all that extensive.  The companion dialogues and adventures are all rather short, and the Black Pits consists but only two areas.  Furthermore, the original cinematic cutscenes were cut out in favor of 2d artistic renditions, which, while looks decent, seems diminutive compared to the original movies.  All-in-all, it is still a decent game.  After six patches, the original version of Baldur&apos;s Gate with a mod or two still seems the better version compared to this &quot;Enhanced Edition.&quot;  However, there is currently people who are active in modding this Enhanced Edition, and if the momentum in this department continues forth, this version may potentially exceed the original yet.  There is also supposed to be a matchmaking service for multiplayer looming on the horizon, so again, it might be something to look forward to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2910186">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Baldur&apos;s Gate 1 is a great game, but this product isn&apos;t disappointing by itself; it&apos;s disappointing because it is establishing a low bar which will undoubtedly be reproduced in the &quot;EE&quot; versions of BG2 and potentially Planescape: Torment.  The only people I could recommend play this are those with strong nostalgia for the original.  It&apos;s unfortunate that the original studios no longer exist to retain control of their license.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3762754">Expand</a></span>

I also think it is expensive for what you actually get, especially considering that most of the work had been done beforehand by avid fans for free.  I think the dev&apos;s recognised this, so tacked on the black pits adventure, which sits entirely separate from the main quest, and throw in a few extra characters.  The adventure is good, but not really necessary, and the extra characters are also good, aside from Neera&apos;s awful voice acting.  They would have done better to license a suitable, modern engine and re do the game in that IMO.  A bit like how half life was re done in source.  One crucial difference there though, black mesa was free, this isnt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2883838">Expand</a></span>

The writing in this game seems so lazily written and the characters no longer have the feeling this once gave me. DO NOT BUY. I am telling you will be disappointed.</span>

The game is a timeless classic, one of my all-time favourites and about as good as roleplaying for the PC ever was. Nothing about that has changed. So I AM going to review the &quot;enhancements&quot;, the things that they charged me 20 additional bucks for.
<br>The technical part of the enhancement is a bit of a letdown actually. Almost everything good is simply a continuation of fan made mods that have been there, done that, years before. Everyone who (like me) has played BG 1 in the BG 2 engine by BGtutu, downloaded the Weidu mods or numerous fan fixes will not really notice anything groundbreakingly new. The zoom-in option is nice, at least one step above the already availbale high-res mods. Nothing really special here.
<br>None of my personal pet peeves and actual technical shortcomings have been addressed, though. The pathfinding AI is still abysmally bad (Firewine dungeon is still the same old unnerving headless chicken dance, when all that would be required is to change the scripts to allow player characters to pass through each other). The pRNG (pseudo random number generator) is still broken - things with a probability of 1/20 keep happening 3 times in a row (probability of 1 in 8000) way too often to be random whenever the pRNG gets stuck on a bad seed. All in all, underwhelming on the technical aspects.
<br>What about the additional content?
<br>Well, I would rate that way higher, if the two new NPCs I&apos;m currently running with were not built either on full purpose to annoy the player or with such an amount of ineptitude it hurts.
<br>Neera the wild mage is a character, completely unable to do her only job. At level 1, with 4 hitpoints, she better NOT cast any spells (her only use), as there&apos;s a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap that might (and very often WILL) kill her outright. Countless reload saved games later you recruit Rasaad the monk, who, as a front line melee fighter (the only thing a monk is really there for...) also has way too bad stats and few hit points for his intended role. Combined with the inability to protect himself from critical hits (aka wear a helmet) he just keeps dying time and again so FAST, not even auto-pause and a ton of potions will help. Really, the constant accidents and reloads are so frustrating and annoying, I almost overlooked their admittedly excellent voice work and decent background stories...
<br>All in all, it&apos;s ok, but for an ease-of-use package that basically saves me 3 hours of downloading mods , installation and tweaking when wanting to Play BG on my new computer, the price is a bit steep.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2809536">Expand</a></span>

The game is EXTREMELY challenging by today&apos;s standards, even on the normal difficulty.  But you can raise the difficulty to the max setting for a truly challenging experience that few modern games can rival.  And you will get engrossed in the world of Faerun!!!
<br>
<br>I think the review scores for this game are much lower than they should be due to the admittedly very buggy release.

The bugs are overstated. They mostly pertain to intel integrated graphics and multiplayer lobbies. All issues have been acknowledged and diligently worked on since the game was launched (4 patches out within the span of two weeks), and the dev team shows great humility and dedication judging from their statements on the official forum. Just the fact that they maintain a direct line of communication with the fans speaks volumes about their attitude -- and let&apos;s face it, in the long run, nothing is more important than that. I think a lot of people don&apos;t even realize how small the EE team is at the moment (only 12 people), and that they have to deal with things that large companies with big budgets simply don&apos;t have to worry about.
<br>
<br>Buying this game was a no-brainer for me, if only for the continued support (in the form of patches and DLCs) and prospects of BG2EE (and other infinity engine titles, both old and brand new). All the important mods are already being ported over, and very soon BGEE will be the definitive way to play the Baldur&apos;s Gate saga, with all of the advantages and none of the flaws of the (brilliant, but outdated and stagnant) original release.
<br>
<br>I couldn&apos;t be happier with the purchase, and I must say that my personal experience has been 100% bug-free. Even if it wasn&apos;t, I wholeheartedly support anyone who dedicates their time to producing Infinity Engine content in 2012, regardless of any potential oversights (which, as we&apos;ve already seen, are being corrected in real time with great dedication).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818028">Expand</a></span>

Sadly this &quot;enchanced&quot; edition has some irritating bugs. Sometimes when you steal and you&apos;re caught, it won&apos;t announce it above your character. If you kill a person in a town, sometimes their scream for help will repeat in town throughout the rest of the game even when you were in a building. In a certain town, some NPCs scream and run for help upon you doing battle with enemies even if they are not close to you, the NPCs ordinary dialogue still triggers. There are a lot of containers (specifically shelves) which trigger the stealing module when you look at the contents which makes no sense. Neither does stealing something and then walking into a persons vision without stealth. Stealing is more effort than it&apos;s worth, money is plentiful in this game. The sounds and gfx are far from special. Sadly the game has issues with balance of some classes, party characters, exp and quest rewards. The quest log/journal is good once you get used to the chapter thing but far from perfect, many quests are left in after passing and sometimes it&apos;s not updated properly or repeats a characters quest in a new chapter. Baldur&apos;s gate is a mess, there is a wall splitting the map in many of the nine areas and finding NPCs by entering a building map or area map is not possible. Overall I wasn&apos;t particularly overwhelmed by the game, the difficulty was okay although fairly easy after the early levels. I also noticed in the one case where I thought &quot;Know Alignment might be useful here...&quot; my character pointed out that the guy telling the truth sounded like he was telling the truth, this was incredibly insulting as it literally solved the dilemma for me without apparently requiring anything like a ****king stat check.

<br>The game is NOT EASY! Thank God! A game presents me with a challenge, who would have thought? Character can DIE...*ghasp* indeed they are expendable. If you want to play hard core you can.  You pick your friends and foes. In some ways this game gives you more freedom than Skyrim, and your allies have WAY more depth.... Hell, at one point I went too long without honoring a ally&apos;s agreement to join my quest and he turned on me!

There is a mod out for Neverwinter Nights 2 that recreates Baldur&apos;s gate, and so I recommend people play that. I was ripped off twenty bucks simply because I couldn&apos;t believe they would charge that amount for a game that wasn&apos;t of certain quality.  I was wrong.</span>

The new cut scenes are worse than the old ones. But big plus: 80 Arrows in 1 item Slot! Also classes from BG II built in. The remake of the game is troublesome at the beginning, but the game itself is that great, so i don&apos;t care ^^</span>

Almost all graphical new additions are downgrades (except the higher resolutions and the zoom function). The new UI is uglier due to weird artwork and coloring (blue is some really awkward color choice) making the game breathe less quality. They would have been much better off if they just copied the Baldur&apos;s Gate 2-UI. The other new artwork (for example the new portraits that look very much like the art seen in Icewind Dale and some of the cutscenes look more like something you&apos;d see in Torchlight than in Baldur&apos;s Gate) does not suit the old artwork, removing immersion and the classical &quot;Baldur&apos;s Gate&quot;-feeling; even though the art is not bad, some of it does not suit the game. Also, the option in Baldur&apos;s Gate 2 where you could increase the game clock, making the movement seem more fluid and the animations look better is non-existent, why? So what is good about the new release other than the obvious higher resolutions? The new voice acting is brilliant and some of the smaller cutscenes look splendid; I also like all the features taken from Baldur&apos;s Gate 2. I will update this review as I play on. Had some minor bugs and issues with compatibility this far but the issues were quite easy to solve with Google as help (if the game wont start due to &quot;missing openal.dll&quot; try googling &quot;creativelabs openal.dll&quot;).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2798787">Expand</a></span>

Only buggier.  In just under two hours of gameplay i&apos;ve had no less than five crashes,  something that would be quite unheard of if I were playing the non &quot;enhanced&quot; BG.   On the plus side, there are some new elements added to the mix including a handful of original NPCs which are very well written and voiced, as well as a new musical score by Sam Hulick.   The gameplay that made Baldur&apos;s Gate so amazing remains intact, and has been enhanced in several places.   In others, it has actually become worse.   The UI for example, is a serious step backward.   My overall feeling is that you could have just as good an experience playing the original Baldur&apos;s Gate as buying this so called &quot;Enhanced edition&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2799506">Expand</a></span>

Beginning of the story jumps straigh to a dialogue hard to pick up (needs to be corrected by devs). - Unit animation is well done, with fluid moves . - Day and night provide different atmosphere. - A great game to create a DOTA style of play map. - Few games of nowadays that actually kept lan mode to play at home with friends. - Unit animation when hit by enemies. - Not for COD &amp; Battlefield players: you can&apos;t have a game with those graphics in a RTS game, so don&apos;t wine about it. It&apos;s better than most mmo&apos;s around anyway (I&apos;ve seen the graphics argument on youtube and it&apos;s ridiculous, pure gratuitous bashing). - Allows to be played on older pcs since its graphical detail can be easely modified. - You can choose either to be nasty and devious or kind hearted and righteous in the outcomes of small quests (lie, help for example) - Unique sets to equip characters with bonuses found throughout the game. All in all it&apos;s a fundamental &quot;must have&quot; on rts based games ownership. There isn&apos;t much of this kind of quality games anymore and if you&apos;re a fan already of the series, it can be easily purchased on steam for example. Look for gameplay videos on youtube and check the site out and decide for yourself if it&apos;s worth or not, at least it&apos;s not a hyped game and from big corps advertising it everywhere and promising what they don&apos;t deliver. This is just my recommendation.

<br>
<br>Seriously, even their day one dlc characters that constitute for sole new content are so broken they even damage quest lines not related to their own. I will just point out that one of those thrilling quests is &quot;completed&quot; with you teleported to a cave and stuck behind a indestructible door..
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t know how to use the console? Bad luck man, enjoy your cave. Just dust your own copy or perhaps wait for the complete edition to come out on steam and get it cheap during a sale, and if you&apos;re that desperate for playing in higher resolution there are mods available for years now that do the same thing, do it better and do it for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2804658">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It adds nearly nothing except a little more barely playable content.
<br>
<br>The number of bugs is astonishing, playing a multiplayer game, which is actually what most of the people buying it would have probably wanted to do is nearly impossible due to the fact that almost everything get bugged, it&apos;s seriously almost impossible to play, i can&apos;t believe how somebody can release something like that and how anybody in the world who calls himself a critic can review a steaming piece of work like this one in a positive way, it&apos;s just a money ripoff for a thing that plainly doesn&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>The price also isn&apos;t cheap at all for a game that have been released a lot of time ago and most of people have already bought once.
<br>
<br>This game is very old and still feels very old, nostalgic player should stick to the old version and younger player who want to play a living piece of gaming history should search for a cheaper, older version, possibly modded and fixed from the community (better than this one, and for free)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3297701">Expand</a></span>

I picked it up for $5 while it was a &quot;midweek madness&quot; deal on Steam.
<br>
<br>I loved the changes to the game that the Enhanced Edition brought, things that, when absent, make the original game almost unbearable to play. Ammunition stacks to 80 (yay!), potions stack to 15, containers, and all of the improvements that Shadows of Amn made to the game.
<br>
<br>I had a ton of fun replaying Baldur&apos;s Gate and thought that the Enhanced Edition was a steal for $5. Even if I had bought it for $20, I still wouldn&apos;t feel cheated  I currently have 41 hours of playtime on it, and haven&apos;t even beaten it yet (although I think I am in the last stage of the game).
<br>
<br>Overall I would say, lots of fun as is to be expected from Baldur&apos;s Gate, great improvements to the game, great nostalgia trip  but if you&apos;re not willing to shell out $20 for it, wait for it to go on sale in Steam and then pick it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3377096">Expand</a></span>

THIS game however does little to improve on that. In fact, it does worse. There is nothing offered here that one cannot already find by means of mods for the originals. No hi-def resolution. No graphics settings of any kind. SLOW loading and stuttering gameplay put a blemish on the original. I cannot see this as anything but a cash grab by the developers. Shame on them for that. This is the equivalent of giving the Mona Lisa a facelift using spraypaint. I&apos;m all for supporting indie developers, but this isn&apos;t a charity. I will NOT be buying the subsequent releases. I will be returning this game via credit card chargeback.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2808447">Expand</a></span>

Even if we are kind and ignore the plague of technical issues that this game shipped with (I only experienced the mouse issue and enabling vsync fixed it for me) this is still a terrible game. The graphics are simply dire: no shadows, no reflections, muddy textures and extremely low detail all throughout - it loks like a DX4 game. Running this at max details I get a very high frame rate (though it constantly bombs up and down for no reason) and it looks like a game from more then 20 years ago. It is a flat, boring, featureless world. The controls are vague and fairly unresponsive and generally you never really feel as though you are in control of the (utterly hateful and idiotic) protagonist. He is happy to bomb around, doing as he pleases, attacking what he wants, jumping where he fancies and generally ignoring the hell out of you while you miss target after target, normally as arbitrary and pointless countdowns expire meaning you fail the quest. The one thing I could have noted as a good point for this game is the ability to save whenever you like, rather than the usual auto-save nonsense, but even that is broken. Saving produces a pointless replica of the previous save, utterly ignoring anything you did since. Even if all the technical issues are fixed, the graphics will remain far below par (even for an overhauled game), the port will remain horrible and utterly bereft of care and attention and the story line will be pallid and uninteresting. Do yourself a favour and install the first game - you&apos;ll be a lot happier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2812626">Expand</a></span>

I was expecting more than what the mods already made available since the release of this 1998 classic. 3 npcs and The Black Pits, are nice additions, but ultimately, the game remains the same.  You won&apos;t notice most of the enhancements made except for the zoom function, which wasn&apos;t needed in the first place, since the outdated graphics weren&apos;t improved and zooming out isn&apos;t required much.  I can&apos;t give this game more than a 4/10, sadly, for it&apos;s a useless release and simply a way for the team behind it to make some money.  Hopefully they have, and will release something signifantly better for BG2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2818072">Expand</a></span>

Depending on compatibility, this version might appeal to some people because of that. &quot;Squeaky wheel gets the kick&quot;
<br>
<br>To newcomers, this game has some voice acting but be prepared to read a lot of dialog.  Also note that this game uses the 2nd edition AD&amp;D rules which may overwhelm to some degree people that never experienced it directly.  The Enhanced Edition does include a tutorial that will help.  Lastly, expect some annoying control issues like no dual wielding and no easy way to toggle between ranged weapons and melee.  Don&apos;t let this stuff discourage you though because walking away from this game if you can handle these issues would be a mistake.  The story is great, Minsc is awesome and deserves a personal mention and the combat is a lot of fun.  The combat is tactical pause and resume style gameplay much like KOTOR or dragon age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901189">Expand</a></span>

However i remember getting the BGI ToTSC 6 CD edition and was more than happy to be playing a BG game again. The enhanced edition fixes many issues with the original: few bugs, adds lots of enhancement and restores some stuff missing from the original that was added in previously with tweak packs etc. Im greatful that beamdog has taken the time to put together the best version of this game without having to add mods - of course mods can still be used, but for me i am happy not having to download and figure out what mod to install in what order.

There may be broken quests in terms of moddable material that hasn&apos;t been rendered. There may also be overpowered kits. I find such complaints to be pretty foolish since any reviewer who cared that much about these issues should be able to mod the game the way they like it or bump up the difficulty as a work-around for their personal issues. Graphically this version is SWEET. The added sound files are nice. The add ons are all good. Only TRUE problem is the price. $20 is too much. $10 is perfect.  Apparently there are some issues with Atari which mean the enhanced version of BG2 has been delayed. This may not be a bad thing. The GOG version of BG2 is already near-perfect, so Beam Dog will probably have to work a bit harder to create any new value with an enhanced version.  Good things take time. This game is a MUST BUY when its on sale at around $5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2844546">Expand</a></span>

I was immediately smacked in the face with reality upon loading this game for the first time. First, the opening cinematics wouldn&apos;t display and the PC would just hang a black screen. This turned out to be because the game couldn&apos;t handle 1900x1200 graphics, so I had to edit the config file to disable the cinematics just to get the game to load. Upon starting the game for the first time, I was filled with nostalgia as the games graphics and feel reminded me of the original BG1 game from the late 90&apos;s. The graphics aren&apos;t much more up to date than that. Ignoring the look of it though, I pressed on through a bit of the campaign hoping that the game play would reflect something more meaningful. Unfortunately, it did not. The &quot;political intrigue&quot; that was promised is nothing more than an annoying game of cat and mouse between your Fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Assassin characters. The entire political/underhanded sub plot to the game isn&apos;t anything new or exciting, it&apos;s just a tedious boredom. The &quot;armies&quot; are made up of generic looking units who follow the typical rock paper scissors approach to combat, and the combat itself doesn&apos;t feel very satisfying. Even after a massive battle between multiple units I was left feeling disappointed. Games such as Warcraft were able to capture the frenetic pace and feel of a large scale fight, while BGEE was barely able to capture my attention to them. My love for the book and the game series drove me to continue playing, in hopes of finding a bright spot in the game. In the end though, I realized I had simply wasted $40 and a whole lot of time on a game that should have been relegated to the top shelves of Wal-Mart alongside the old $10 games. Don&apos;t waste your money or your time on this. The game is an injustice to the world that Bioware built, and a sadly outdated addition to the RPG world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2813637">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are new bugs and flaws:
<br>
<br>a) the new monk says the same thing over and over again.
<br>b) the zoom feature is just too blurry
<br>c) the new UI was mad and very poor resolution
<br>d) the game crashes often</span>

P.S :People who are giving negative reviews are doing it on nostalgia because they liked the original more (when its the same thing with worst graphics and bugs) and bugs, as I said I never came across a bug in about 20 hours of gameplay and as I said im playing after many patches in January 2013.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901259">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At this point - several major patches have arrived making the rather unpolished initial release quite impressive.
<br>
<br>Simply a must for any fan or newcomer of strategy rpg.

<br>Oh yea almost forgot, ad&amp;d 2nd edition is just spot on.</span>

The core game is largely untouched and the only things changed are the interface, better high res support, bug fixes (get to this one in a minute), and a much better, gutted code base.</span>

Stop drop and roll, to avoid the essence of mediocrity? Double check! Welcome to Overhaul Games second attempt at catching lightning in the bottle. It failed on BGEE to capture that video game magic found in BG 1 &amp; 2. Sadly, Beamdog dropped the ball on game mechanics, storyline and variety. The game is a technical gem to behold, I&apos;ll give the development team at Overhaul Games credit for that (its hard to make a game this buggy when starting from a complete game that lacked any/all present bugs). Such an achievement should be the &quot;norm&quot;, in today&apos;s technology driven society. I&apos;m a realist Overhaul Games are an buisness, they need to make money. Lowering your standards for gameplay for a broad spectrum of &apos;gamers&apos; is today&apos;s &apos;money grab&apos; for software publishers like Overhaul Games. The game mechanics are horrid, the flow of combat, becomes a simple roll, charge one direction, swing weapon, roll and maybe fire off your three different versions of the same spell. Oh, I forgot you can use a bow and arrow to shoot monsters, it&apos;s a kiting riot! The game has hardly any active skills, most are passive. The weapon charge system is a dated concept. Multi hit is dated concept, it&apos;s a hack n slash principle. There is no riposte system, there is no flank system, stealth is a joke, you can&apos;t sneak up and back stab. There is no back stepping, unless you&apos;re using a bow and arrow. Running backwards makes your nameless avatar run with his back to the monster. Overall the game mechanics are sub par. The saving grace of this game, is the stunning atmosphere, but beyond that avoid this title until it drops in price. The game does offer good frame rates, on most top end video cards. The load times are quick.

<br>Overhaul did what they wanted and that is to bring this great game to new generations and pll who dont bother spending hours with installing dozens of mods before actually playing this great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2904243">Expand</a></span>

The graphical interface (updates) were the first positive aspect that I noticed in juxtaposition to the original version. I played through the first part of this game with a tinge of speed, satisfaction and immersion that just wasn&apos;t possible the first time around (in the original). Steam really compliments this release, a full install, no shifting back and forth between six CD ROM. The new resolutions, textures, zoom out feature, etc all assist in a level of enjoyment not possible with the original.  In compliment, there&apos;s a few extra characters to expand the roaming level of augmented possibility (especially for when BG2:EE is released). On a downside, the new &quot;Cut-scenes&quot; are hit and miss; they lack the original talent of the talented collaborators Baldur&apos;s Gate development team (first release PS Interplay I miss you so much). Also the new portraits are clumsy in contrast to the old. Overall? Who doesn&apos;t want to play automated and updated Dungeons and Dragons from the original success story, rendered with a constructive revision?
<br>
<br>Obviously, this is a revamp of an old classic. I still consider Baldur&apos;s Gate essentially unparallelled in immersion and depth within the RPG genre; but let&apos;s call a spade a spade. This game is great, but not built from the ground up. Imagine what could be possible with the dynamics of this game in a new body?

<br>9.2/10

<br>The new characters and content are interesting enough, and even though I had some doubts about the Black Pits at first, I found it fun as well, with good gameplay and characters. The best thing about BG:EE is that it will get continued support with new patches and content as we go along... and to me it&apos;s also important as a necessary step towards BG2:EE, an enhanced version of what I view as the best RPG of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3600355">Expand</a></span>

They are very easy to find if you google them. I&apos;d give it an 8.5/10. Its better than Tutu or BGT, in that it addresses some of the more serious problems that they never could (due to hardcoding). Also it contains all fixes contained in any of the fixpacks released for Tutu/BG2 and modders like Camdawg have been working with the development team to improve the game.  So astralphoenix77&apos;s statement that BGEE is &quot;obsolete&quot; because of other community patches is actually far from the truth. The game actually uses an updated version of the ToB engine, better than the version being used by Tutu/BGT.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say this is worth spending the extra money on. The new kits they added are interesting, there are no game-breaking bugs (unlike a lot of the older NPC mods for BG2 that haven&apos;t been updated in years like Saerileth), and you&apos;ll get plenty of hours out of it regardless of how much you pay. Plus you&apos;ll be able to use the new kits when BG2EE comes out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3456397">Expand</a></span>

No messy mods to fix graphical issues, a vast array of bug fixes, new quests and new characters with more dialogue go a long way in adding value.  If I wanted a junked-up game I had to add third-party fan-made mods to, I would just go to GoG and buy an original copy (or find my six installation CDs from the 90&apos;s).  The enhanced edition brings me the game I remember with less of the bugs and some truly optimal new features (use of the BG2 engine, spells and class kits, constant patches for continued upgrades, etc.).  I am glad to own this game, and I have already logged over 300 hours playing on BG:EE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438330">Expand</a></span>

Some people say u can have this graphics with the widescreen or BGT mod but it is nice to not have to go through the downloading and installing all this mods. On top of that Enhanced Edition brings more like super fast loading times and new stylish and smooth fonts, which can be sized for the personal preferences. Also no problems with Win8 and new machine specs anymore, so yeah, the edition is well worth its name. Only thing i dislike is a writings as they entirely doesn&apos;t fit into the BG (and d&amp;d) setting. New Npcs are rather flat, miserably but pretending to be funny, its like they want to be cool or something instead to be true self. Neera for example was so annoying and her speech is way to modern, detached from the story and the medieval fantasy type of world. The rest NPCs and their quests was no better, i tried them once and never come back for them. Not for the first time Bioware proved that they are the best at what they do ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5374942">Expand</a></span>

The game released quite clearly unfinished and the developers admitted so and were committed to continuing the bug hunt and perfecting this game and they did just that.
<br>
<br>This version of Baldur&apos;s Gate and it&apos;s equal are the definitive versions. Bugs old and new have been destroyed, works perfectly on new computers (as someone who used to have to install multiple mods to  run my disc based version that if one failed the process would have to be repeated from game install, and that&apos;s before windscreen mods - This has saved me endless hair tearing and screaming in my household.)
<br>
<br>The new content is absolutely perfect, the extra equipment a godsend (club proficiency pays of now!) and I personally have to fight which of the new characters accompany me. The three of them are among the best characters in the game, character and proficiency wise and certainly make up for the other characters silence with the BG II level of dialogue.
<br>
<br>IF you are a BG fan and can&apos;t be bothered getting those old disc out or sick of headbutting the wall after playing 20 hours to find a mod has messed up a crucial element and you have to reinstall the entire game then do yourself a favour and pick up this copy.
<br>
<br>Anybody new to BG, this is most definitely the copy for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438355">Expand</a></span>

I see people complaining about the level of changes not being worth the price. I can&apos;t agree with that. I remember how buggy and clunky the original game was. Now all the bugs are fixed, resolution finally playable, visible and easy to read font size, i recon many significat changes to the difficulty as well. I don&apos;t think i remember mages using all those protective spells like now. Final battle is greatly improved as well, Sarevok is a real challenge now. IMO this enhanced edition is great and i am very grateful to Beamdog for what they did.  I&apos;d give 10 out of 10 but i&apos;m not convinced to all the new content like new NPC&apos;s or Black pits expansion, it just doesn&apos;t fit the base game very well...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7370491">Expand</a></span>
