<br>This game was so much fun and it just kept on going not losing pace even at the end, wont claim that this game is for everyone but youd be hard pressed to find a similar game that did what this game does better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=5831912">Expand</a></span>

I love the art and the over-the-top comic book-esque voice acting, and the atmosphere really captures that comic book feel, but the gameplay is awful.<br><br>Though the basics are in place, click something to interact with it, it&apos;s the extras that just flat out fail.  There are pseudo-stealth elements to the game, and they just do not work.  Enemies can see you no matter where you stand, your character is too slow and inaccurate to react accordingly.  In fact, the slow pace is very obvious throughout.  The characters seem to wade through water, and though your character is noticeably faster when running (at least compared to enemies) he manages to have the attacking speed of an epileptic sloth, and, on the rare occasion when a projectile based attack hits, you have basically wasted your time because of the sheer slowness of the game.<br><br>The earliest (and best) example of this, that I noticed, was the second mission.  Though this is supposed to be a tutorial mission, unfortunately focused on the aforementioned stealth elements, the overall goal, especially the secondary mission goals, seem to be outright impossible with the guide of the game.  Admittedly, if you&apos;re clever, you can get around this by ignoring the tutorial, but the point is that it seems to me to be a huge oversight when a tutorial doesn&apos;t actually lead to success, at least when it&apos;s intention is supposed to be success.<br><br>Though the game technically works, it has not aged well.  The game is slow and plodding and the action is pretty underwhelming.  Damage seems completely randomized, ranging from one hit kills (for no apparent reason) to barely scratching the enemy with the same attack an instant later, and, though you can technically react to the situations that play out, I never found anything more useful than letting my character auto-beat the hell out of the enemy with my only input being to tell him which enemy.  Though there are many skills to choose, and many characters, it all just seems pointless.<br><br>This game just suffers from age.  The mechanics are either boring or don&apos;t work, and, though it has a fantastic setting and voice acting (that really captures that comic book world) it doesn&apos;t manage to deliver on the action that should accompany that.  It&apos;s just overall a disappointing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=2381882">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is nearly as good and I love that you can create your own custom characters (to fit your personality and gaming style) to recruit later. This is an instant classic.</span>

And it played without a single glitch on my 2 year old system! Something NO other game I&apos;ve bought (except NOX) can boast! It&apos;s nice to see a game that doesn&apos;t need a patch straight out of the box! I would give this game a perfect 10 but I haven&apos;t played it long enough (or online yet!) to rate it that high, but mark my words.. if it continues to play this well - I&apos;ll rate it an 11 when I&apos;m done. Its a polished jewel!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=366189">Expand</a></span>

<br>Was going to rate it 9/10 simply because the controls (especially the camera) are a bit clunky without any modifications. However, all the easily available freebees prvided by players (listed above) and the ease with which they can be implemented/utilized overcomes the one glaring annoyance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=3679992">Expand</a></span>

The variety of environments (snowy hills, different parts of the city, underground areas, etc.) were so welcomed.  Not only that, the different enemies you encounter are so vast!  And the damage they do varies so well.  Ice Warriors for Nuclear Winter either shoot ice bullets at you or use rays that knock you off of your feet.  The voice acting makes me smile because it&apos;s campy... yet it&apos;s awesome.
<br>My favorites were Man O&apos; War, El Diablo (nobody else uses fire so effectively), Man-Bot, and The Ant (shoving baddies off of buildings is so satisfying, as well as using his acid bomb).
<br>My main problem with the game, though, is how slow some of the characters are.  If Minuteman is on a quest with, say, Man-Bot, you can bet Man-Bot won&apos;t be lending much help.  Eve and Microwave are the same... they have powers which can help out a lot but sometimes you&apos;ll be waiting for them to just GET THERE already!  With some missions being timed in a way (like stopping the robots from destroying a certain amount of buildings) this can really mess you up.
<br>But when it comes down to it, Freedom Force is a wonderful adventure that I&apos;ll take again and again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-force/user-reviews?user_review_id=4084092">Expand</a></span>
