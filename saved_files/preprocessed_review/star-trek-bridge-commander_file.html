Loads of addon ships, effects, systems, and more give the game massive replay value, and the online play can be very fun. While the default ship models aren&apos;t very good by today&apos;s standards, the actual graphics engine is quite good and, with some spiffy new ship models, can look photorealistic. The damage modeling is great, and with mods like NanoFX, explosions are absolutely spectacular. Also, this game stays true to actual space physics - when a ship&apos;s engines are disabled, it continues to drift, instead of stopping. And you can go upside down and roll in whichever direction with ease. The combat model is also very complex and satisfying, though it lacks skin shields for TMP era vessels (I don&apos;t blame them, as the stock game only has TNG era ships) The game is constantly being modded and updated by the community with new scripts - and things that were once thought impossible to do with the BC engine are being done by the incredible scripting community. The AI in this game is on the stupid side, leaving some of the single player feeling slightly shallow. However, it is very fun to start massive battles in Quick Battle mode, with 4 or more ships on each side. And it is fun to see how you can exploit the weak spots in a large, powerful vessel and destroy it with a small, weak one. The game is now nearly impossible to find in stores; though it is a must buy. You can probably find it on eBay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-bridge-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=394588">Expand</a></span>
