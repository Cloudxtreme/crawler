This game should be a 10 once the new patch is available.  If you&apos;ve never played a Sudden Strike game, it is unique gameplay on large artistic maps and you control individually up to 2000 realistic military units.  It&apos;s great fun for the armchair general!</span>

<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the game is still great, and you can download the free Add-on (a must!)  the multiplayer experience is very good, it will make your heart beat and it will keep you hyper all the time, it&apos;s a shame that sales were not that good and the community is rather small, or many of them are playing through private IPs.  The game has a dedicated server they added with the add-on to replace the gamespy system which was a terrible mistake.  A big plus is the MAP editor, which is awesome, and will expand the game life greatly.  You can create really cool maps for multiplayer and  singleplayer, there&apos;s some people already doing so.
<br>
<br>One of the best games in the genre, with massive battles and pretty nice campaings, some better than others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sudden-strike-3-arms-for-victory/user-reviews?user_review_id=74228">Expand</a></span>
