Your objective is skating as far as you can along short, but somewhat demanding levels featuring stairs, grinds, vehicles, obstacles. Along the level you get scores for tricks, grinds and combos.
<br>
<br>With 8 key controls the game seems to be easy, but it is relatively unforgiving, which makes you wanna beat it. I mean, how many times can you smash your face into the floor just after landing an epic 20x combo?! After a few minutes you can play the game and after 1-2 hours you get to know more tricks and are able to get quite impressive scores.
<br>
<br>The game features classic 8-bit arcade graphics style and urban music floating between trance, hip-hop and dubstep (no vocals).
<br>
<br>Is it fun? Yes it is. You want to win the level. You want to land the combo. You want to beat your friends&apos; score online (there are leaderboards). The graphics is retro-cool (but at times too simplistic and repetitive) and the music creates right skateboarding mood. At the same time it is a little annoying, especially after multiple failures. Despite easy controls I tend to mix up the keys in the heat of the moment. Music is good, but it just runs in the background, isn&apos;t related to levels or your activity/performance. Some levels are repetive, but the in-game achievements vary from level to level. There are multiple themes including city, port and junkyard. Some are better than others, for example in port the lack of detail on the floor makes it difficult to estimate your current speed. There are some bugs. The game crashed for me once.
<br>
<br>It is a nice little game definitely worth getting in some bundle. Depending on how much you like arcade games you will have 5-20 hours of fun until it gets a little boring.

That was about twenty years ago. So long ago in fact, that I pretty much forgot skateboarding games existed outside of Pro Skater at all. And then I found &apos;OlliOlli&apos; and had about two hours of fun before I inevitably grew bored of this board...skating game. Don&apos;t get me wrong, those two hours were pretty fun and if you get the chance to pick this up for a low price then I&apos;d say that you should. But on the other hand, you may want to keep away.
<br>
<br>The first thing I noticed about this game was the soundtrack, it&apos;s diverse and the songs fit into the gameplay and style extremely well. The second thing I noticed was how weird and unnatural the controls on a 360 controller initially felt. It took me a good half an hour to get used to them, and even after that I still got tripped up from time to time. They&apos;re definitely tolerable enough to enjoy the game though, so don&apos;t worry about that being that big of an issue. The third thing I noticed was that there really aren&apos;t that many tricks, and the levels mostly consist of grinding from rail to rail in search of a large enough combo to unlock the next one. As you can imagine this gets quite repetitive after a while.
<br>
<br>So basically, after a few hours, if you aren&apos;t completely terrible, you&apos;ve pretty much unlocked every level, heard every song, and collected every item. And unless you&apos;re someone who constantly feels the need to beat the highest score, there really isn&apos;t much of a reason to come back to this one. So like I said, if you get the chance to pick this up for cheap then check it out, but anything more than $5 and I&apos;d pass. And $5 might even be asking too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/olliolli/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920740">Expand</a></span>
