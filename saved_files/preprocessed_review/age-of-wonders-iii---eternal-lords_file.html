THats not even the half of what has been added to this expansion(You know, the things that used to be chock full of content that actually added a vast amount to the games, instead of 15 dollars for one new character like most games &gt;.&gt;). If you loved the base game, as well as Golden Realms, then this is a no brainer. For those on the fence, or looking for something different, I believe Eternal Lords may be the breath of decaying(in a good way) air you&apos;ve been looking for.

<br>This expansion is loaded with awesome new stuff and it definitely is worth every freaking cent you could spend on it! (I got the game for my gf, her best friend, my best friend and my American friends and we are all playing pbem together and loving it!)

<br>
<br>Throwing in one new class, the Necromancer, which plays vastly different to any of the 6 original new classes, two new races (Tigrans, fiery sun-worshipping cat people, and Frostlings, Icy Goblinoids who have interbred with a race of frost fey), several new mechanics (many of which build on some other new mechanics that were added in a FREE patch - such as the race relations feature) like Racial Governance, a new victory condition and lots of new content that plugs straight into the game&apos;s random map generator for a seamlessly expanded experience.
<br>
<br>I think the highest praise I can offer is that as I&apos;ve been playing this expansion, it feels like it was always there, fitting in seamlessly to the game experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5196263">Expand</a></span>

That said, Eternal Lords is a content heavy update that many devs would probably sell as a sequel, increasing not only the variety of the game by adding the new (awesome) Necromancer class and two new races as well as new specialisations. It also builds on many already existing systems of the game and makes them a lot deeper and more meaningful...and above all fun to play.
<br>A lot of that is based on the feedback of a very active and positive community.
<br>Triumph Studios have been supporting the game since release, bringing the game to a whole new level and they are going to continue this support for the foreseeable future.
<br>So buy this game people! If not for the countless hours of fun involved, buy it to support one of the last big studios that&apos;s obviously in love with its game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5196543">Expand</a></span>

All in all a great expansion that ads more stuff to a game with already loads of content.
<br>
<br>The free patch makes the AI more challenging. And another victory condition makes it possible to play more peacefully. The good/neutral/evil modifiers work great with this expansion. As it really matters now in diplomacy with other factions and indipendent towns.
<br>
<br>PS: I wrote this review because of one negative spammer who wrote 7 negative reviews. (like all of them) I give this game a 10 to balance it. Well it is close to a 10 anyway. If you like this kind of games aow3 is the best game of them all. Comparable to the greatness of heroes of might and magic 3. It is already a classic game that everyone needs to have played who likes 4x games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5196492">Expand</a></span>

Also with it, three new specialisations which contribute greatly to game play differentiation, one new victory condition that emphasis your relation to the races in your empire and one minor race. Oh, and also a random event system that not only affect your game play but also beautifully reflected in the game visuals!
<br>
<br>Triumph had delivered a great game in Age of Wonders III and this expansion raises the bar further! I love to play the Tigrans and build my strategy on their mobility and special abilities, such as Tigran&apos;s support unit, the Mystics that can shapeshift into Dire Panther, providing them with physical attacks and Pounce ability, unlike any other support units.
<br>
<br>All in all, I am extremely happy with this expansion and waiting for the next one while spending my time with the new races and class!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5197376">Expand</a></span>

<br>just finished playing as Frostling Undead for campaign 1. Very new type of playstyle and mechanics that adds so much more flavour to the game. Units such as beloved Frost Queens, Yetis, Ice Scalpers.. and new ones such as Banshees! (omg I so so love this new unit).. New spells and empire upgrades too! Such as corrupting mana nodes to become Undead nodes.. changing entire city to an Undead city.. trying out mission 2 of the DLC now.. playing as a Tigran Druid class. Gonna be epic with all those new tigran units capable of leaping and even transforming!
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also new artifacts.. damn many of them.. just got a mythical jewel that made me 40% physical immune for my main undead hero.. add that with lifesteal is damn OP!! yes artifacts farming is important in this game.. the higher the rarity the better.. remember that when you&apos;re playing campaign as artifacts can be brought over to the next mission.. other artifacts are a &quot;seduce veil&quot; - legendary artifact that can convert enemies.. an ice glove - capable of throwing ice balls! awesome isn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>... and cosmic happenings! just got one where it says &quot;Blood Moon - +3 melee attack for all units for 4 turns&quot; (with the entire landscape sort of drenched in red aura here and there.. just epic!
<br>
<br>performance wise the game has improved much more as well.. prev i couldn&apos;t play on &quot;high&quot; settings without some sort of lagginess (blame the SSAO). This time even on that my desktop is able to support nicely.

When part three was announced (10 years later) I was ecstatic, even more so when I was invited to join the beta-team. The vanilla game was satisfying, some things could have been better. The Golden Realms dlc made a lot of things better. Now with the Eternal Lords expansion there is such a huge load of everything it is just overwhelmingly awesome. Triumph Studios are very good at communicating with their fan-base and as a result the game just keeps getting better and better.

Actually in the genre of fantasy war TBS. Maybe it&apos;s not the best management 4X strategy, but in terms of tactics and strategies it is at the highest level! Ambushes and global magic, battles with dozens of units, tens of skills, powerful global spells and hundreds of original units, heroes developing, creatures experience and completely different play styles for different classes - all of this is in one great game!
<br>About the DLC. The game has changed dramatically since the release for better! All that was required by fans, has been implemented in the best possible way. The principal differences between the racial units, the modified system of diplomacy, the balance between classes, improved AI and so on. Actually this supplement together with the latest patch just brought the game to a new level! It&apos;s really more difficult to play with PC now however it&apos;s much more interesting now.
<br>What is amazingly good for the game - it is that that the developers did not vegetate, but actually doing great job, listening carefully to the community. Anyone can participate in the development of the game, just taking an active part in the discussions on the official forums. If only for the year it has increased by several times, it will continue to become much more interesting! Everything depends on you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5199249">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As said before elsewhere, EL makes AoW III a complete strategic experience the series fans have long been waiting for. In addition to that, the devs continue to actively analyze the community&apos;s feedback on the new content, and will be adding more stuff, further balance changes and quite possibly some other long-planned gameplay mechanics. The future of this wonderful series is secured. Now go get the expansion and have no mercy on anything living!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5225086">Expand</a></span>

<br>The new class (Necromancer) plays completely different than the other classes as all your units are undead and/or ghouls. For example it costs more effort to heal your units and grow your cities. On the plus side you can quickly raise a huge undead army by turning your enemies into ghouls. It is fun :)
<br>Then there are more treasure sites to explore, there is Race Governance (providing neat bonusses to your races), there is a new dwelling and there are cosmic events (events that effect everything in the world and can have a huge impact on your strategy). Probably I forgot other things but in short I love this expansion!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-wonders-iii---eternal-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=5198514">Expand</a></span>
