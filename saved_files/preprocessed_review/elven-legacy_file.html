AI is good, but since you&apos;re heavily outnumbered, the game becomes unfair. And there&apos;s nothing as disappointing as seeing the AI gang up on your carefully nurtured elite unit and wipe it out in one turn.</span>

The more you play this the more you will appreciate it,the story is good and gets your imagination flowing. This title is really good if your new to this genre and gets you involved although more experienced gamers of fantasy and role playing may want something more robust but for the novice this is more than enough. Having multiple endings is a very good plus point and will ensure you&apos;ll be playing this for sometime to come,has a good and involving story,with just wanting to see what happens next,good sound and graphics,good characters. We&apos;ve all seen a few classic fantasy movies and wanted to play the part of a hero well now you can but are you up to the task,play this and you won&apos;t be disappointed, I&apos;m loving it anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elven-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=83152">Expand</a></span>

Playing the game on easy mode and getting completely crushed in the second scene of the campaign, however, was quite a surprise.  I found success on further attempts but it seems to me  the game takes  the fun out of exploring each map, as you must move directly to the objective as quickly as possible or get wiped out.  Problems still exist though, as these side towns troops end up flanking you or advancing on your tail.  This while trying to win at the gold level, which may be overly ambitious for my skills.

<br>If you&apos;re interested in a strategy game focused on tactics with a steep challenge you will love this series. The difficulty can be overwhelming but all the missions can be won. Obtaining gold level objectives often isn&apos;t as important as exploring the map for items and experience. So just disregard that criticism if you hear it in reviews. Graphics are beautiful and I love that entire units are shown when you zoom in. Great RPG elements with heroes, items and leveling units. My only complaint is that the map overview is always backwards when the mission starts. The plot is just filler and it would have been nice to have the dialogue rendered in cut scenes like Heroes V. Don&apos;t listen to the haters though. This game is dope. Any old school strategy gamer will love this game. Get ready for some saving and loading though!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elven-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874378">Expand</a></span>

It is not complex to play, but strategy really matters in this game.  Units carry between missions, as do unit losses.  Play sloppy, it will hurt you in later missions.
<br>
<br>One detail I like, is there is a turn-limit on each mission.  You get Gold, Silver, or Bronze depending on how many turns it takes, and rewards reflect the rating.  The time-limit forces you use strategies other than the defensive turtle tactic that always seems to work against AIs in other games.
<br>
<br>As for units, they are varied and actually tactically different, and position is important.  Archers can stand behind a melee unit, and when that unit is attacked, the archer gets a free retaliatory strike.  Mounted units do massive charge damage, but only to units standing on plains.  Heros are satisfyingly powerful, but not so much that mastery of other units isn&apos;t still needed.
<br>
<br>All units can be promoted, which allows you to customize them a bit.  There are also artifacts to add more flavor.  You also get to choose the units to bring on each mission.   It makes the game feel more like a campaign, rather than a collection of individual missions.
<br>
<br>So, rating... If I just rated on quality and polish, the game would be a 7-8.  But I chose to rate this game based on how much fun I had playing it, so 9.  I played the main campaign twice, something I rarely do.  It is a great tactical game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elven-legacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3093434">Expand</a></span>
