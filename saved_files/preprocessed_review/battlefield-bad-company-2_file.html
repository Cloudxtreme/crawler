As far as the public is aware, Bad Company 2 is a copy of Modern Warfare 2 and Battlefield 2 does not exist. As a fan of the Battlefield series since Battlefield 1942, I am extremely pleased with Bad Company 2. While many features in BF2 are not present in BC2, BC2 also brings new and amazing ideas to the Battlefield franchise. First, the good. Class system has been redone for so that there are fewer classes but more things to do with each class. I always felt BF2 had an unnecessarily large amount of classes that are too restricted to a single function. In BC2, each class has a perfect balance of skills and you&apos;ll find yourself learning to love each of them and utilizing them to their full potential. Another pro would be the command button instead of the command rose. The command rose was very full featured but it took too much time to select a command. The new command button allows you to point your crosshairs at something and issue a single order depending what you are pointing at. This works very well because you can quickly spot enemies and ask for assistance much faster than with the command rose. The destructible environments is a powerful and realistic factor. A sniper in the window can quickly be killed by a grenade launcher. Mortar strikes can completely bring down buildings. In BC2, camping is significantly more difficult because of the frailty of your cover. The final and most important positive change in BC2 for me is the new game mode, Rush. Rush is am amazing mode in wish you play as attacker or defender and try to make your way through a map destroying MCOM stations or defending them until the attackers reinforcement ticket is down. In this game mode, you will always know where your enemy is coming from and you will be planting bombs instead of capturing flags for no apparent reason, just like in real life war. This objective-based game mode really makes the game feel more cinematic and even though I get tired or multiplayer games easily, I can still play Rush on BC2 again and again and again. Now for the cons. First of all, most of these cons are mostly Battlefield 2 related. Bad Company 2 was not intended to replace Battlefield 2, that&apos;s what Battlefield 3 is for. Bad Company was supposed to be a single player driven game with a fun little multipler on the side. Since that didn&apos;t work so well in the first game, they made it more Battlefield-like in the second. Anywho: No bots. Not really surprised but it&apos;s an important feature to me. I&apos;m really hoping they make an appearance in Battlefield 3. No jets. I&apos;m quite positive this will also show up in Battlefield 3. Only 32 player maps. Not really surprised again but would like to see 64 or maybe even 100 player maps. Hell, put in as many players as our modern day machines can handle, like MAG. On that note, no Commander Mode. With BC2&apos;s 32 player maps, this isn&apos;t as big of a problem, but I would like to see this in BF3. Large amount of players need direction, just like in real combat. I&apos;m really hoping they don&apos;t scrap the command mode just because BF3 is going on consoles. Last but most importantly of all, no privately hosted servers and LAN. This is my biggest complaint and the one that I fear will most likely seep into Battlefield 3. With MW2, Infinity Ward killed dedicated servers. Now every developer thinks they can be the knight in shining armor by offering dedicated servers, but only when rented through official partners. Why shouldn&apos;t I be allowed to LAN with my buddy and kill bots like in BF2. I really hope DICE will bring back LAN in BF3, but unfortunately it doesn&apos;t look like they really will. Bad Company 2 and Mass Effect 2 are definitely the best releases so far this year. Those faint of heart and impatient are better of playing Modern Warfare 2 where the learning curve is nonexistent, but those striving for a more immersive battlefield experience definitely need to play Bad Company 2. PS: There are some complaint going on about the amount of horsepower needed to run this game well on PC. I have an AMD x4 955, 4gb RAM, and 5850 and I run this game full on 1920x1080. While I would normally agree with users and say this game should be more lenient on the technical side, this really is a fantastic looking game, almost (not quite) on the level of Crysis. That I can experience playing a Battlefield game on this level of beauty is something I really just cannot call a con.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1396488">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is very teamwork oriented, which I absolutely love. Seems very very balanced for all weapons, classes and vehicles. Maps are very replayable, and the destructability doubles this. Great game!</span>

An 8600 may be a year newer but as it&apos;s the 600 series; it is not meant for high end gaming. &#xA3;500 - &#xA3;700 would get you a pc that could run this game on med-high. It&apos;s optimised just fine the only problem is that there&apos;s too much volumetric smoke covering everywhere. Saying that it&apos;s bad because you can&apos;t run it with your old ass pc is like me complaining about PS3 games because I only own a toaster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746772">Expand</a></span>

This is where the real MP is. The ability to level buildings and shoot people out of cover is amazing. To the idiot who posted on 1 because of their inability to optimize. I&apos;m running a machine with half your specs on XP DX 9 and have everything set to high at 1440 x 900 and it plays flawlessly and looks great. You probably have driver issues. The only thing that sucks is the auth servers have been bogged down since release making it hard to actually get and stay in a game as PB also kicks people liberally at the moment but that&apos;s not DICE&apos;s fault. I hate EA as a company but this is a great game, it&apos;s too bad the megacorps own everything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746338">Expand</a></span>

I played the first bad company on xbox and was glad it never made it to PC, but this is a much better game that looks awsome, even on mediocre hardware. I was able to get 60+ FPS on max settings at 1600X1200 res. with 2 GB ram, an ATI 4850 and an AMD Anthalon X2 5200. Worth your time and money. (Dedicated servers make it better than the more expensive MW2).</span>

The singleplayer campaign is short and slightly disappointing, but it has great humor and atmosphere. The multiplayer, like always, is where Battlefield is at - stable connections, persistent unlocks, and great squad support. There are some bugs - specifically, I get a slight stutter when playing the game in dx10 or 11, and the collision modeling is a little weird with vehicles. But the game itself is fun, looks great, and sounds awesome.

Nothing is more amazing than blowing a tank off its treads from a shanty 2 story building with an RPG. Or planting C-4 in a house letting enemies rush in to defuse a bomb and leaving them in a pile of rubble.

And it takes FOREVER to load the server list (I am on a very very fast connection so it isn&apos;t me). The game is very well balanced among guns. Gun fights are very fun since you don&apos;t get shot and just die right away. I understand this isn&apos;t realistic... duh.... but war in real life isn&apos;t fun. That being said, at times it gets veryyy frustrating with how many bullets it takes to kill someone. You almost have to empty a whole clip in their general direction to kill them. Even burst firing for accuracy will mean you use most of a clip to kill anyone. Tanks and personnel carriers are very fun. Helicopters are reallly stupid in this game. Get in a helicoper, and every 50 cal from the whole map is firing, tracers blazing up at you. So entering a helicopter is a death wish. And it isn&apos;t fun to fly at all, its been really dumbed down. The gun fights are very enjoyable and the game will keep you occupied and glued to your screen for hours! Go out and support this developer, they are making the game with pc-specific options, rather than just console porting it like everyone else these days. BUY THE GAME IF YOU WANT PC GAMING TO SURVIVE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746347">Expand</a></span>

This is what Battlefield 2 should have been, and it&apos;s definitely worth the cash I spent on it. (Cheaper than MW2 and way more entertaining.) The only downside I&apos;ve seen is the single player, but if you&apos;re playing Battlefield by yourself you&apos;re playing the wrong games. And you&apos;re a lonely person.</span>

However, it just so happens that this game is incredible and that these hollow &quot;gimme&quot; perfects are warranted despite the level of thought put into them. I can honestly say that this is the best multiplayer PC shooter to come around in a number of years, and you would be doing yourself a disservice in not picking it up. The visuals are outstanding given the scale of the battlefield, the sound is ear-shattering (War Tapes), and the level of destruction and realism is unmatched by any other game that I can think of. And aside from this, the gameplay is something that simply cannot be had in any other online shooter. DICE created another masterpiece in the Battlefield series with BFBC2, and the only thing I regret is not having had the first Bad Company on PC to fill the void until now. Get the game, blow something up, enjoy the deliciousness that is BFBC2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746364">Expand</a></span>

This throws a great twist onto the playing field, and eliminates those retarded snipers/campers in your objective building.  There are also drivable vehicles, including tanks, helicopters, UAV&apos;s, 4 wheelers, and many more, which takes strategy and squad tactics to a whole new level.

It offers almost everything there is to offer in a realistic military FPS, and has few downfalls... if any. Squad based combat is good, so you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re a loner such as in Counter-Strike: Source, etc. Teamwork is essential, and makes the game so fun compared to others. The gameplay is perfect in my opinion. I am definitely a fan of realism as opposed to alien-shooters like Crysis. It makes it much more emotional and true to life. The vehicles in the game are especially useful and fun, and each one can counter another. Such as: tanks can shoot down helicopters, to counter the fact that each helicopter can have two mini-gunners to mow down enemies that are afoot. I can&apos;t say much about campaign mode because I didn&apos;t play all the way through it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1547958">Expand</a></span>

Guys could feel like they take one too many hits sometimes, but it keeps it from getting too frustrating.  Team work is a must!  You also get rewarded for team actions.  For example There was a game where my kill death ratio was atrocious, but I was in the top three on the leader boards for spotting, repairing vehicles and healing my teammates.  Loses points because I feel like the hit detection is a bit... off..  but it wouldn&apos;t be a battlefield game if that weren&apos;t so :p.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1549604">Expand</a></span>

Let&apos;s just make one thing clear: if you bought/are going to buy this game for the singleplayer, you are insane. I&apos;ve heard too much crap from reviewers saying that the singleplayer isn&apos;t good enough, and lowering the score for that reason alone. Nobody really cared that BF2 had a weak singleplayer when they tried out the multiplayer. The multiplayer will knock your socks off, though, and THAT is the reason why everyone should get this game (computer permiting). The multiplayer is, to say the least, intense. I basically only play Squad Deathmatch, which is 4v4v4v4, and I gotta say, it&apos;s something to shoot your enemy, who happens to be shooting at another enemy, and then kill the other enemy with a rocket launcher. All in all, this is an amazing game. The audio is top-notch (being designed by Dolby Digital), and the graphics are stunning. Sometimes there are some small graphical problems, but nothing that can&apos;t be overlooked. I don&apos;t know what the people are smoking when they say that it&apos;s just copying MW2, because it isn&apos;t. This game is better in almost every way. MW2 is going to become an alternative to BC2, and not the other way around. BC2 is following in the footsteps of the BF series: they&apos;re raising the bar once again, and I hope they will be for a long time to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746410">Expand</a></span>

The recomended settings include a Quad Core CPU and a GTX 260 GPU with 512 MB VRAM. The only place where you meet that requirement is in your physical RAM. Don&apos;t downrate a game just because your 4 year old rig can&apos;t play it properly.</span>

Features everything that should be in a game of this age. Includes intence destruction, decent graphics, unlockable and customizable classes, varying range of weapons, vehicles and of course that standard of the pc gaming world... dedicated servers. This game prevails in every sence and clearly beats MW2 in every aspect. This game deserves its title. The game does have its draw backs, the game is dependant on DX10 and DX11. It will run in DX9 but will be severly limited in Anti-Aliasing, but dont let this put you off, it still has decent modern graphics and will run on a decent (couple of years old) machine. A must buy for PC FPS gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746502">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer is a rough diamond at the moment but it could be one of the best multiplayer FPSer ever, even better than BF2 or CoD4. There are some problems with it at the moment but they are the same that usually pop up in most FPS games on release. Huge amounts of Lag, Tubing, the whole map sniping/camping, DCs and EA online is a bit broken at the moment. But after BF2 and the all the problems that were fixed in that game, DICE will do the same for this game. The Single player is a bit of a joke but at least they admit it and don&apos;t take themselves too seriously unlike CoD6, but BC2 singleplayer is still a great play and you will enjoy it. Lots of unlocks, lots of maps and lots of achievements you can easily lose several 100 hours playing this game unlike the 15 I played cod6 for before it got old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746556">Expand</a></span>

Whereas CoD has you sprinting off by yourself, drop-shotting, and camping with some twitch-shoot mechanics. Battlefield encompasses the features that made people play First Person Shooters to begin with -- the feeling of being in a battle. Several factors contribute to this. The graphics are not the best out there, but they&apos;re very solid, much better than the first Bad Company which suffered from a grainy effect and low view-distance. Atmospheric effects (sand, debris, smoke) are done brilliantly and are wonderfully varying. One second you can looking down your scope in the desert and see everything laid out clearly. The next, looking in the same exact spot, your vision can be distorted by a rogue burst of wind and sand. The sound quality is even better, arguably unrivaled in gaming. Distant sound occurs a second or two after the event, giving the impression of a larger battle. Guns sound real and powerful, as do the bullets hitting various surfaces. Explosions are deafening and disorienting, and almost everything sounds.. deep. It&apos;s almost hard to describe, but the sound in this game is unlike most shooters on the market, and really do contribute to the feel of a great fight. Destruction is back, and is much improved. Buildings can actually topple, though not without a very fair amount of damage. No longer can trees and doors be cut down with your infantry knife, so it doesn&apos;t have the feeling of being stuffed in your face that its predecessor did. Unlike CoD games, every building can be a shelter without reducing the experience to hide and seek. You&apos;re never safe inside; every wall surrounding you can be shattered down. Vehicular play is smooth as ever, and manages to feel both powerful and vulnerable to an organized team. The blackhawk especially is a blast to ride in with a squad of friends, and the helicopter controls are much smoother than in the last game. The maps are larger and more varied, with a combination of urban and outdoor combat. The classes are now more balanced than before, and the experience each class can gain while helping out teammates gives teamwork a larger incentive lacking in most FPSs. Progression is improved, as are perks, but the customization isn&apos;t nearly as hefty as in Call of Duty games. Suppresors are limited to SMGs, but this gives the engineer kit a greater feel for its purpose. You cannot paint your gun or customize beyond adding a 4x scope or a red dot sight. There is very little in the game to make you feel as if you&apos;re character is really personalized, but the game isn&apos;t about you. You&apos;re a small part of a larger force, and the insignificance is gratifying. The hit boxes are much improved, and the hit marker has changed to the familiar one set by the CoD franchise, making weapons seem more responsive.<br><br>Ultimately, it gives the same pseudo-Battlefield feel that BC had, but it fixes most of the problems. It is the best Battlefield experience a console player can get, while the new mechanics and destruction make it extremely viable for PC owners as well.. at least until Battlefield 3 gets released.<br><br>If you&apos;re anything like me and you tire of the run and gun feel of recent CoD and CoD clone games, this game will be a breath of fresh air. The campaign is about standard for modern FPSs, which is why I didn&apos;t go into detail, but the multiplayer has no equals -- Bad Company really is in its own category.<br><br>Must own!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489223">Expand</a></span>

Gen after gen my rig is kept always top notch so I get the best juice in any game I select to buy. So... This game is... in every respect... everything a game should ever be! Even my most realistic dreams do not achieve the sheer perfection in fun and rewardness -- new word -- as this game does. For me the cheap chat between characters in the single player mode was the touch of genius! The very only thing that was missing in the modern SP game -- and I didn&apos;t even realised it until I experienced that. I now call that &quot;soul&quot;. The SP game that has soul in it! Amazing! Then there is the other &quot;issue&quot; with this game and prior BFs also had this: the fun just never ends!!! There is always a new wild act to be done in the field I have never tried and human creativity with vehicles, explosives and knives is just infinite. I simply lost count on the number of great LOL rushes I had in action with the game and also the number of times I wanted to bang my head into a wall for the level of stupidity one can have -- at the same time! Thank you so much DICE for been so competent and ingenious! If possible my rate would be way over 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1366544">Expand</a></span>

Nothing new to see except for a &apos;mostly&apos; destructible environment. If you expect any semblance of strategy or teamwork from this game you will be sorely disappointed. The description on the box boasts &quot;vast battlefields&quot; and &quot;wide open warfare&quot; when actually the usable map areas are more a medium to small size and are designed to funnel players into predictable choke points which grows very tiresome after only a few short weeks of play. Each map has it&apos;s own favorite repetitive sniper spot(s) where you&apos;ll often find between 3 - 10 snipers doing &apos;their&apos; thing instead of anything resembling helping out their teammates or attempting to help win a round, which when you consider there&apos;s only 16 players per side can be quite frustrating for those trying to complete objectives. A lot of the time multiplayer matches turn out to be just another &apos;sniper match&apos; with 80% of players choosing the sniper class and hanging back sniping. With that many snipers on the field standing still and staying alive for more than a few seconds is almost impossible. Realism is definitely not what this game has set out to achieve, killing people with short ranged shot guns from ridiculously long distances is quite common place as is snipers with silenced fully-automatic sniper rifles taking on assault class soldiers at close range and coming out on top. The single-player campaign also has something to offer but just like the multiplayer, it&apos;s short lived. Good fun for a few weeks, nothing ground breaking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747502">Expand</a></span>

My friend has a Core2Duo 2.66GHz, 4GB DDR2, Geforce 8800GT 512MB and he&apos;s playing with everything on High and with both 2x AA and 8x AF, the only thing he can&apos;t enable is HBAO. The game itself is awesome. The funniest multiplayer game since Counter Strike first came out!</span>

The gameplay, graphics, sounds, and environments give the game an immersive theatrical feel. War Tapes also adds a nice level of immersion and so do the dynamic voice responses to battlefield situations and kills. On the down side the game is very buggy. There are literally thousands of users with crashing and other stability problems with the game. There are also some other issues with connectivity that are being addressed. There are some weapon and class balance problems as well that leave many players wondering what EA was thinking. The maps however seems pretty well balanced, though some of them have quite a few glitch spots that are too easy to exploit if you know where they are. In all reality, BC2 feels more like a $50 beta test than a retail release. That being said, it&apos;s still fun to play and much better than other games in its class like MW2. The game does require a decent gaming rig to play, so keep that in mind. Better yet, you may be better off waiting until the game goes on sale. Maybe by then the stability issues will have been corrected. Far from a 10, a 7 seems like a fair rating since the game has a lot of potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747005">Expand</a></span>

The sound, graphics, and physics makes this game shine. This is the second day from launch and I have no connection issues and successfully played two hours without lag. Single player is intense and the team AI actually kills enemies. Although the game is missing functions and items that are usually in other shooters, for some reason I do not notice it much while playing. I&apos;ve only noticed that I&apos;m unable to add favs, sometimes slow menu navigation when online, and being stuck once in one of the maps. Overall, a great game. And to the fool Trevor, if you think the GeForce 8600 GT makes your computer fairly powerful, you&apos;re an idiot. And you do not need anywhere close to two thousand dollars to play this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746330">Expand</a></span>

The singleplayer was a little bit short and it didn&apos;t leave such a big impression, still it was solid and I didn&apos;t encounter a single bug or error while playing through it. What really caught me, however, was the multiplayer. I&apos;ve been playing some CS and CoD before this, but never really enjoyed their cramped gameplay, but the open areas and vehicle battles was a good change. The graphics are good, most of the maps are OK although some of the Rush maps seem to have been poorly designed as there are alot of chokepoints were you&apos;ll quickly loose if you&apos;re team is slow moving. The squad gameplay is a nice addition, which is even better if you play with friends and can infiltrate enemy spawns just to wait for them to spawn on you and then make your move together. Most of the maps are also open enough to let you find your own way, not just simply alley A or B to reach C and you know there&apos;ll be someone with either a machinegun or a sniper rifle aiming down that killzone. If you enjoy playing multiplayer FPS games over large maps this is definitely a game you shouldn&apos;t miss out on!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1734861">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, it&apos;s fun and requires more teamplay than most games making things more interesting. The weapon mechanics are better than a lot of games today however at the same time they&apos;re extremely flawed in some areas (Example: Shotgun= Sniper, 2 shot kill from any range...) and overall I can&apos;t say they&apos;re as good as other tactical shooters like STALKER or ARMA II. It&apos;s biggest downfall is how dumbed down it is compared to the previous battlefield titles. Weapons do a lot less damage and everything is overly simplified. The class setups are pretty illogical and hurrendous, again they probably assumed console gamers don&apos;t think too much and won&apos;t care, but it really takes away from gameplay. Medics with LMGs is just stupid, it&apos;s not cool, it makes no sense and doesn&apos;t feel or work well in game. Assault&apos;s ammo-boy role is equally senseless and feel&apos;s wrong. Finally, there&apos;s the balance issues which again are more or less because the game is aimed towards consoles: since when were AT weapons cheap and overpowered vs infantry in battlefield series? Well they are now. Giving medic class the LMG and accuracy compensation for lack of prone has made them overpowered and as a utility class it leads to things like full teams of medics in certain modes. A lot of cheap, imbalanced things exist in this game. In the end it&apos;s pretty graphics, unique gameplay, and half-decent shooting mechanics keep it afloat but it&apos;s nothing like PC games used to be. If you get into it and find a nice clan you may get a little over 100 hours overall, after that I&apos;d say the flaws will start to shine a lot more and the appeal will ware off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747239">Expand</a></span>

And while it does deliver on some fronts, it leaves a lot to be desired on others. The Good: Graphics are super slick, the sound is fantastic, the single-player personalities are entertaining and likable, the unlock and ranking system is very nice, Rush-Mode is awesome, plays great on my slightly-above-average computer. The Not-so-Good: Noticed quite a few no-clips in SP campaign and a few in MP, hit boxes seem wonky with shotguns. Can shoot down/through concrete but can&apos;t shoot through thin sheet metal walls... The Bad: LOOONG loading times for Server Browser for which you can only do &quot;full&quot; refresh and no &quot;quick&quot; refresh, poor communication mechanics for a &quot;team/squad-based&quot; game, tons of drops and disconnects from Punkbuster/EA Online and server-side issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746381">Expand</a></span>

Singlerplayer is pretty straight forward, you kill everything that moves. Which can get pretty tiresome, at some points I felt like I was playing a shoot-em-up game, most of the game is just kill all enemies at point A, defend point B, then go kill everybody at point C. The best parts of the campaign were where you were doing something differant, like flying the UAV, calling air strikes, or sniping in the thunder. If only there was more of that, it would really have made a good campaign. But it really just is something you just wanna get completed as fast as possible, just to find out what happens. Some of the parts were kinda predictable, yet I was surprised a few times. I actually enjoyed dying as part of the campaign, that was actually a nice turn of events. But would ofcourse have liked being back in WW2 a bit longer. An other thing that makes the singleplayer campaign good is that it isn&apos;t solo, you actually got some team mates. Which really was nice, having team mates with you all the time is really a positive thing for singleplayer, the standard just-meet-with-NPCs-in-cinematics thing was getting old. The multiplayer is generally fun for a fair amount of hours. Personally I think the differance between the standard weapons and the final unlocks is too big. But ofcourse for people like me, you can just enjoy killing people with the standard weapons and than brag about being better than everybody else for not using your unlocks. Also I was very disappointed at the lack of any (mayor) infantry only mode. Vehicles are cool and all, but unless your engineer (or a lucky recon) you don&apos;t stand a chance against vehicles. But the mayor downturn of the multiplayer is punkbuster, expect to go through a lot troubles just to get in-game. And don&apos;t be surprised to see a cheater in a punkbuster secured server. It&apos;s a fun game, and I&apos;ll definitely keep playing it for a while. But I honestly can&apos;t imagine any mayor community left in a year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746458">Expand</a></span>

Years of experience in the genre mean these guys understand the mechanics of competitive game play, they know how to make a multiplayer game work and most importantly they know how to make it ridiculously fun. If you have played any previous battlefield games - you know what to expect, except this time Dice have successfully implemented new and challenging factors to the game play. Of particular note are the destructible environments. This feature alone separates it entirely from all other multiplayer shooters, and damn is it good. Destructible buildings mean no wall (with the exception of a few) is a surefire safe spot to hide. You might be hiding in a corner halfway up a flight of stairs chuckling and praising your ingenuity when without warning someone decides to implant a rocket propelled grenade through the wall behind you, leaving a crumbling, gaping hole and you either dead - or scrambling away frantically with your tail between your legs. If the building suffers too much damage it will eventually collapse, taking all who reside within to a dusty grave. Another overlooked innovation is the implementation of sound. Sound effects are calculated realistically and projected based on distance &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1483959">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is a blast; a superb alternative to Black Ops, although you will have to spend a significant amount of time leveling up before you can be anywhere close to competitive. The building destruction physics is what really stands out the most to me.</span>

It is cheap, enjoyable and they are still updating it and fixing bugs (absolute opposite of the cod series). I enjoyed the campaign alot, but the multiplayer is definately the strong point. Great fun to play with friends as you can all be in a squad and drive like lunatics on quad bikes.</span>

Any servers that is not 100 miles near you will lag. Any system that is not built with modern (2011) Graphics card and a quad core CPU will lag/stutter. My PhenomX4 940, 4Gb ram, ATI 4850 and 7Mbit connection stutters like crazy online (optimization and overclocking are useless for BC2, forget about it) . NO dedicated servers...this means that you are stuck with cheap data center servers that are not equipped to serve 32 players...And you Can&apos;t host a LAN game. NO custom maps: playing the same maps over and over again gets boring real fast. I really tried to enjoy this game...but the bugs, glitches and all sorts of performance issues just got so frustrating that I uninstalling it...<br><br>BFBC2 is one of the most memorable FPS I have ever played in 2010. unfortunately, the multilayer is practically unplayable unless you&apos;re running it on a exotic gaming rig.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478143">Expand</a></span>

That is because by now everyone is high level and will have so many unlocked weapons you just will die and die and die. The game itself is fun but I will explain why I can only give it a 5. The reasons I take points off is the trend of giving us less in each new game. No more bots. Now you have no way to practice and try stuff out. Poor hitboxes and lag can make it frustrating to hit your target. Dedicated servers can only be rented, you can&apos;t set your own up anymore, which ties into why they removed bots Also possibly because of the destructible environment, would be hard to code a bot AI for that. Which is also probably why they removed prone, or maybe they took it out to try to keep people from camping. But it doesn&apos;t work, you will still be team based raped and headshot by the sniper 5000 miles away or shot to a million pieces by the helicopter whore so you always have to move in a convoy and in team. Which is the biggest joke because the game is called bad company which are basically the rejects in the militrary who are too insane for anything but a special company that is sent in to ruthlessly kill (and be killed as canon fodder). So it is ironic how many f-tards playing this really make the game title shine. But still it is somehow very fun, just disappointing at how little we get for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1584391">Expand</a></span>

Without the special weapons and gadgets it&apos;s impossible to have fun so you have to play at least 10 hours to star enjoying the game.</span>

It has very realistic graphics (especially the light), very challenging but interesting style of shooting, and very magnificent destruction system which allows the player to destroy any buildings. Although the story of the campaign is not fully satisfying, the scene is terrifically designed, it is just unforgettable. The best part of this game is multi-player. The perspective and the view is wonderful, the atmosphere is tense, but still enjoyable. I think the online experience is much better than Battlefield 3, although the latter is also very amazing.

It basically has inherited all the players who finally let BF2 die. Connection issues, server performance and the Frostbite&apos;s handling of the destructible environments SUCK! You freeze in 1/2 the servers you play in as soon anything explodes in front of you (even an RPG miss which keeps you from returning fire even though your opponent has already switched weapons and is still firing on you). The sniper kit!?!?!<br>That&apos;s why 80% of the people playing are choosing. Oh!, and you can snipe with a shotgun. 2 actually. No kidding, 2 shotguns can shoot across the map and people camp with them to the point the gameplay is flawed. You can also destroy targets in rush from areas you cannot be seen or found (usually called glitching) but this game seems designed for it. VOIP does not work and 50% of the players a year later still lose connection sometimes if using the friends list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-bad-company-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570148">Expand</a></span>
