I didn&apos;t play the first one, but am loving it so far. Veteran of Titan quest, Diablo 1-3, Torchlight, PoE and backer of Grim dawn giving VH2 2 thumbs up. The lack of publicity for this game is mind boggling!</span>

<br>
<br>The good:
<br>+ Rock solid gameplay. Fluid, fast and deadly combat, well thought and executed quests and defense phases, a well designed and fonctional UI, a multitude of tactics and skills, different approaches to every situation. This is not a loot grinding hack and slash game, it&apos;s a well crafted RPG with action mechanics.
<br>
<br>+ Higher level cap and more character choices. Several classes to chose from for various gaming styles. Balanced and fun to build, your hero have many perks, abilities, tricks, auras he can learn (and Katarina too!) You can also import your character from the first game. Basic skills keep their usefulness to late game stages, and respeccing is possible after advancing the story for a couple hours.
<br>
<br>+ Dialogues are well written, and the city of Borgovia feel alive and offer some great moments of humor that contribute to the immersion and makes the player root for the characters and care about the game world and those within it. The witty banter between Abraham Van Helsing and his unique companion Lady Katarina is awesome. The storyline is one of the most captivating aspects of the game. Once I started playing I felt a sense of urgency that drives me to keep going.
<br>
<br>+ Well done side quests that never feel contrived and offered great interactions with unusual characters. To help Abraham in his missions, you can make friends, gain allies, micromanage your troops and bolster morale of the Borgovian resistance. Van Helsing doesn&apos;t fight alone, and his choices have consequences. The principal villain have grit and charisma, he must go down, this will not be easy.
<br>
<br>+ The defense of the town of Borgovia and continuous war of attrition with your enemies feels great and is immensely fun. Alternate tower defense which takes an important role, and hack and slash sequences. Lay traps, prepare or evade ambushes, make quick strikes. Being constantly tested, elaborating various tactics accordingly, and seeing your efforts impact the game world offers a deeply satisfying feeling of completion to the player.
<br>
<br>+ Fantastic scenery, stunning graphics. Landscape change with war damage. The various skills offer interesting visuals and some beautiful animations, feel the power of your protagonist putting weight in every combat move.
<br>
<br>+ Character build is of the utmost importance. When built right, Van Helsing is a sight to behold in combat. The game keep things challenging, helped by a good AI and enemies scripts that adapt to your tactics and develop synergies and skills on their own. Also Katrina buffed up and can hold her own in combat. While in the first game she died quickly and was mainly around for banter and passive bonuses, now the bond between her and Van Helsing makes for a very efficient pair in combat, health can drop very fast, a la Titan Quest, so better fight as a pair, Katrina can tank, support or cover Van Helsing retreat quite efficiently.
<br>
<br>+ One of the characters newly introduced held particularily my interest. I kept thinking this guy have his own agenda and motivations, and can&apos;t help but wonder if he is an ally or a liability. Katrina snide remarks and banter whenever this character is present are priceless.
<br>
<br>+ Balanced loot and decent drop rate. Quests are varied and interesting. Monsters both bio and mechanical abound (learn to hate those electrical bots), a hall of trophies, spectacular and non intrusive cutscenes, gothic 19th century Eastern Europe ambiance, numerous easter eggs and secrets to discover, beautiful music, all contribute to a great gaming experience. Van Helsing have co-op and PvP modes to boot.
<br>
<br>+ Game price is $15 on Steam. A buck per gaming hour. This is a steal. A crowning achievement from a small studio that puts many AAA titles to shame.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- Some minor bugs and text typos. A patch is needed to iron some multiplayer issues.
<br>- Would love to start from level 1 and have fun building my characters and grinding levels, especially in co-op. The game is a sequel and it makes sense to play from lvl 30 to 60 storywise, still the option to start from scratch is present but grayed out. This might also alienate new players, hopefully a patch will change that.
<br>- Enemies keep coming in waves in the extended lair defense mini-game. I didn&apos;t mind, but some friends who haven&apos;t played Van Helsing before found it frustrating to have no respite in tower defense phases, which are more important in this game. 5 or 6 of attacks on Van Helsing lair happened in my playthrough, countless waves repelled and generous loot drop made me happy, not all may agree. I guess either you enjoy tower defense mechanics or you don&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4206829">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is really no good reason to sit at my PC and hold down the mouse button when there is really nothing going on in the game. So I&apos;ll play something else. It&apos;s a shame because I found the first game very amusing.</span>

You can change your spec up quite easily in the Secret Lair which is populated with more people for this adventure.
<br>
<br>Campaign is reasonably lengthy, 15 hours or so, with a few alternate quests you might miss first time through. Monster variety and world design better this time, no more wave after wave of electric werewolves like the end of the first game. Scenarios are replayable levels, they are quite good but locked away at level 57 and that will take like 25hrs if you start from a blank character.
<br>
<br>Would have liked to see more lush zones and monster hunting, but the steampunk design is better for this sequel largely thanks to the stunning rainy night misson. Multiplayer is still buggy and rough around the edges, PvP seems the most underdone although it&#x2019;s probably not something I&#x2019;d play much anyway. Couple of areas that overstay the welcome, namely the Viaduct Junction. At least cooperative modes are more fun because of the class variation. I am quite impressed with the performance during heavy action too, seems well optimized for the big battles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4255468">Expand</a></span>

I came into this game with only mild expectations due to some negative reviews and relatively lackluster reviewers - boy, was I surprised! This game advances the status-quo for the genre, taking the best features from games from Torchlight II and Diablo III and then upping the ante. An example of this is the perk system, which is similar to the &quot;reputation&quot; system in TL2, but instead of simply granting extra skill points, you can choose from a handful of semi-unique bonuses/abilities to give your build some more individuality.
<br>
<br>The cheap cost of respecing abilities/skills combined with the in-depth skill trees makes the skill system feel like a perfect blend between TL2 and D3 - you can easily swap out or experiment with new skills to tackle a certain level. Speaking of levels, they are quite varied, and will take you from drainage tunnels, mad scientist labs, urban streets, mountains, forests, and caves. The enemy types are just as varied, and I found the elite mob packs to be quite difficult if you don&apos;t have a balanced skill set!
<br>
<br>Combat itself is a joy, with very satisfying sound effects, explosions, and death animations. I never feel confused or disoriented, and always have total control of Van Helsing, which is great. The interface is fairly typical for an ARPG with one twist: the powerup system. Killing enemies gives you Rage points (also acquired through certain skills!) which can be consumed to activate a powerup associated with a skill. Each skill has 3 possible powerups with 3 activation levels, and you can activate any combination. For example, the basic skill &quot;shot&quot; shoot a single bullet at a single enemy...simple, right? Well, you can use a single powerup to increase it&apos;s damage by +50%, or cause it to do area effect damage for a +1 meter radius, or cause it to slow enemies by -30%...or make it do some combination of these! This really gives the combat some variety and, IMO, distinguishes it from other ARPGs.
<br>
<br>To sum it up, this game is the cream of the crop action rpg, and for the price, I can&apos;t recommend it strongly enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4417773">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is extremely full at character creation ( I &apos;m not talking about appearance) since we offer several classes ( six counting the custom ) . Can resume his character of Van Helsing 1. Modes and difficulties are also offered many (5 + 1 hardcore mode death = death change).
<br>
<br>Good personally I started a game with my personal 1. So on the way to Adventure !
<br>
<br>Hop a little background story ( in English at the moment) to set the mood . Little fear in passing, I have put in French , no! It&apos;s good dialogues of the game are French , developers fix that soon but I&apos;ll come back later.
<br>
<br>First look , it is beautiful, the scenery even more beautiful than in the first , the effects of lights and smoke are very successful . A fight ! The animations are also successful .
<br>Voices, music and sound effects , ibid. The humor is always present and even &quot; Pythonesque &quot; at times (you will need Saving Private Bryan ) .
<br>
<br>The enemies are varied and seem well made &#x200B;&#x200B;, it is the same for allies and yourself. The quests are many and varied . There are new compared with the first name especially in the den.
<br>There is a table of command where you can send officers on missions for a period of time. These missions to defend the den and evolve officers to better defend against invasions den . Yes because in Van Helsing 2 , there is also the Tower Defense with poses traps, tactics and orders.
<br>The second novelty is the hall of trophies. Next the items you win , some are added to the hall of trophies and help boost you and your allies same in return ... but the enemy also leave benefits. It is up to you to weigh the pros and cons . Would you prefer to have 100% chance of winning magic items and the HP of your enemies be increased by 10% or gain HP but the enemy may do more damage or anything if you do not enable these trophies . Combinations are important because you can combine several trophies.
<br>
<br>Of course , you can always crafter its objects with essences and magic. The number of objects is very consistent .
<br>
<br>Lady Katerina is still useful for fighting and also to pick up objects and shopping . It is very customizable ( melee attacks , distance, attack, defense , support ) for the collection of objects, you can also customize ( all rare , potions, or ... ), the same goes for racing .
<br>
<br>Skills and attributes are many and varied and you Katerina . They can offer real winning combination if it is well managed.
<br>
<br>The campaign set to air long (12/15 hours minimum I think ) and there is a multiplayer mode. So good life .
<br>
<br>There is much to say about this game is that you have understood very successful .
<br>
<br>I would have given it a 18 so ... But I put 19 &#x200B;&#x200B;because it is very rare thing in the videogame landscape, developers Neocore do not take us for pigeons opening &quot; stupidly &quot; their wallets . Let me explain, they sell their already good game 14 euros to normal price, even with future DLC , we arrive at 20/22 euros maximum (one is away from COD) . But mostly they offer a real monitoring of their community.
<br>
<br>For example, yesterday ( around 1:00 am ) trying the game, I could not use my character Van Helsing 1. Soi saying the personal was too old to be loaded. I tried some manipulations ( revive a part of one and do a self - backup). Nothing to do.
<br>I&apos;ll see on the developer forum ( Neocore ) and I see that I am not alone in this and that developers solve this problem .
<br>This morning I try to 11:00 ( I could not before ), the problem was already solved.
<br>
<br>Here and there are other examples like this, you have a problem , they solve the better and faster. They had a good follow up with Van Helsing 1 , but then they excel . It is a rare enough to be underlined fact, although a priori it is normal to solve problems , the failure to do so or to drag became commonplace. So thank you for Neocore respect that you have for your players and therefore one to note.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4220069">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Good gameplay
<br>+ Lovely Graphics
<br>+ Has a pretty nice story line
<br>+ Multiple answers to quests. So it aint super linear
<br>+ Some good sense of humor
<br>+ (if you like references, there are a lot of them in here)
<br>+ The skill system is kinda standard, but it has some unique stuff going on in there
<br>+ Multiple classes (although i only played the Hunter so far)
<br>+ What i also is the loot. You will find unique and set items. So its not a pure &quot;Grind for gear&quot; kinda game
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>- Well... some voice acting i dont like. But for the main chararters (yourself and Katarina) it fits perfectly
<br>- The first level is kinda boring to be honest. But when you get past that ;) you will enjoy it though
<br>- Some minor bugs/text typos
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>For a game for just &#x20AC;15 (yes, im from europe) Its a must have if you like aRPG&apos;s. Its a cheap game with great quality. If you ever played the first Van helsing, this is a must have for you</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4214349">Expand</a></span>

Wait a few months for the developers to fix the game before you consider buying it.

Its clever enough to enjoy and they don&apos;t labour the story too much like other dumb ass games where you have to be bored to tears to get through the cut scenes! I play co-op story with a mate and its fun and holds the attention. Bargain priced as well!!!</span>

<br>I loved the first iteration of Van Helsing and this just builds on it in so many positive ways.
<br>
<br>I can understand people saying the skill tree is a little random, but in reality, with a little thought it&apos;s quite intuitive.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s much more to the game than just hacking and slashing, the tower defense game is definitely one of the coolest examples, I can only hope and wait for them to release it on mobile :P. You have your own secret lair, send out commanders on missions and more.
<br>
<br>If you like ARPG&apos;s/Hackn&apos;Slash with a little more meat to them in terms of extra features, like a great story, amazing atmosphere and environments, witty banter between you and your companions, many classic references, tons of humour and hands down one of the best soundtracks in a game, do yourself a favour and buy this for the ridiculously low price it&apos;s at. There are only minor downsides to the game and they really are only minor.
<br>
<br>Seriously good job to the devs - absolutely no idea why this game doesn&apos;t get more publicity, hope they continue this series!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4487823">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Speaking of clutter: the masses of enemies you encounter are insane! Sometimes you&apos;ll be dealing with a whole screen of enemies all clipped into each other and you&apos;ll have to kill them by whaling into the ball of bad guys for 5 minutes.
<br>
<br>The charm of the first game is also lacking. While the first game had its own humor, this one just throws in lame movie references like Terminator.

<br>My recommendation: Get the first Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and all its DLCs and you&apos;ll have a better game than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4360070">Expand</a></span>

<br>There were three good things about the first game - story, gameplay and atmosphere as a result of first two. Now there&apos;s only story left, which is pretty short and unfinished with aiming for 3rd part.
<br>New features like chimera and rune-crafting are insignificant, irrelevant and dull.
<br>Big disappointment, i felt like it could be a great ARPG after failed D3, but Neocore decided to yield mainstream and casual players as well. And for those there already are polished games from major companies with more content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212962">Expand</a></span>

Neocore has managed to improve on many aspects on the game, without changing too much. Honestly, I like ARpg games although I like to play them and not grind them! I like the good story and charachets that feel alive. The game is well done, although it feels more like expansion then a second part. Story is better this time around, its more logical with better character evolution. Gameplay is much better, three classes(actually four, as the hunter class has two completely different trees)  push you to level up all of them ae they are so distinct - warrior specializes in melee combat with either in and out skirmish attacks or tanking the mobs, Hunter rolls with guns and burst damage, Thaumaturge either controls the battlefield and mobs with various spells, or destroys them with wallw of fire, ice and wild energy. This class has lots of drawing, holding and fast clicking skills. The last class is the Arcane Mechanic - he uses various gadgets and can summon awesome mechanical spiders to fight for them - this changes the gameplay completely.
<br>
<br>Environments are different, and some of them are so beautiful and atmospheric with nice weather effects.
<br>
<br>Enemies range from forest creatures, to lots of mechanical and steampunk mutants and to even few undeads. Game could use more undeads actually but they probably saving it for next part. I loved the minigames - one is tower defense(totally skippable if you prefer that), and second is a resistance management game where you decide who to send on which mission. Your chimera pet also gives you choice - do you take it with you as a helper or send it on the hunts for some special items?
<br>
<br>Loot - there is plenty of it! Swords, axes, pistols and staves, and some more. Skills are flashy and impactful, although some of them feel not logical(I know its an ARpg) and not balanced.
<br>
<br>So few things for me detract from 9 or 10 - the game coukd be longer, choices could have more impact, Ui could be cleaner, more enemy types, more rounded story without such obvious sequal bait and better villain.
<br>
<br>So there you have it, bargain for the price - 8 out of 10 for me.
<br>
<br>P.s. Dont forget to check the ingame journal, its awesome</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4302936">Expand</a></span>

<br>The main point to justify a middle score (6) is that the game is still a beta test, launched before the time ends. Let the players pay to test and find errors. It is cheaper, is not it?

<br>On first impressions #2 it looked a lot the same.  Even the starting level as I recall was about the same.
<br>
<br>Some stuff new, and some new stuff they probably shouldn&apos;t have attempted..
<br>There are little one liners here and there, references to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, etc., the horrible voice acting
<br>and, or, the flippant way they were delivered was very cheesy.
<br>For that manner, one of the main characters is horribly voice acted too.  He sounded like that one teenage schoolmate you probably had too that could make this constant guttural burp like voice.
<br>
<br>The bottom line, PLEASE have you voice acting professionally done and directed, and, or, have very little of it.  Even with great professional graphics and what not with such horrible amateurish voice acting it makes the whole game feel cheap and shallow.
<br>
<br>There is one big nagging problem that made me give up and uninstall it this time around after several hours of trying.
<br>And that is the user interface/control interface that has to do with battles (which is really what the game is about after all).
<br>The percentage of the time I could not direct where I wanted my attacks/skills to go.
<br>I would right click in a direction, or most certainly get the cursor right on my target, but the dumb game would be fooled and think I wanted to move instead!  I would click to attack but instead I run right into the enemy..oh great.
<br>Same problems with other skills like I&apos;d try to put down a flame wall (that I bound on right click).
<br>A good percentage of the time the game would mess up and no wall was put down, and with no sort of feedback why it didn&apos;t.  It became unbearably frustrating.
<br>The game was getting hard at points where I couldn&apos;t but help thinking that &quot;humm.. maybe I&apos;d have a chance if the game would just let me control my damn character!&quot;
<br>
<br>For any game really, the #1 thing is..playing it.  You got to get that right.  The player has to be able to expressively control their character.
<br>All the graphics fluff (and horribly voice acted one liners) should come AFTER the game play control is solid!
<br>
<br>My advice if you really want to play this game is choose a skill build that has the least directionality to it, instead go for general AOE&apos;s that go down with a press/click or ones that are centered on your character et al.
<br>
<br>They had a hit with the first Van Helsing game, now hopefully next time around they will mature as a game company and put enough focus more on actual game play and interface mechanics the next time around..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328093">Expand</a></span>

A nice evolution from the first game. People with complaints haven&apos;t bothered to play enough and find out how much there is to see in this game. Very much looking forward to the third in the series.

<br>I only played it for a few hours before being bored with hundreds/thousands of enemies and no real point other than grinding through them with the same skills. I thought the writing and voicing were ok, but repetitive even after a couple of hours. It seems like  a decent clickfest if that&apos;s what you&apos;re into, but all others might want to wait for a deal. Reminded me of the old Gauntlet games.

A lot of the play is old Diablo II style, which most gamers fell in love with and which Diablo III failed to replicate. The Van Helsing series is like a steampunk version of Diablo. VHII is steampunk in the sense that you are fighting in a world of mad science and machines (and you get to use guns and not just the traditional RPG swords.) The music is hypnotic and beautiful. Beginning VHII, you have the choice of three ways to play Van Helsing. I chose Van Helsing classic, because I like the traditional hat-and-cape, gun wielding character, but you can choose from two other character versions, including &quot;arcane mechanic.&quot; This game is different also because you are in command of a team of four experts and you send them out on missions. If you don&apos;t like the &quot;traps&quot; mini-game from VHI, you can assign one of your experts to do it instead. I thought the traps game was harder in VHII. I couldn&apos;t win it and so I assigned it to one of my captains. I have no idea whatsoever why this game was only $15. It&apos;s worth at least twice that. Although I only played for 30 hours, the game has good re-play value, since you can alter the character and it is easier to fail quests (and there are far more &quot;Easter eggs&quot;) in this game than in other games of this genre. There are lots of ways to vary the game experience and you may want to replay parts of the game to see if you can succeed where you failed before. I like the variety of matching armor sets you can collect, too. I only rated the game a 9 because of a couple of technical things. I could never get my &quot;chimera&quot; to come when called. The &quot;summon&quot; button didn&apos;t work. Also, I couldn&apos;t use the rune crafting machine. It wasn&apos;t intuitive like the essence insertion one. I loved this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4274465">Expand</a></span>

Beginning with the ability to import a saved character from the first game, II delivers an additional thirty levels of experience, new items, skills, quests, tower defense levels, enemies, quests, and sarcastic retorts from the ghostly Lady Katerina. It is more linear then the first game, with fewer sidequests overall but more tower defense levels, and additional side mechanics that allow you to send out NPC captains to perform offscreen missions, rewarding you with additional gold and items, and an additional pet with customizable abilities. The equipment-modding obsessed can now alter their equipment in an additional way, via stat-increasing runes. While Van Helsing II treads ground already heavily traveled, it is nonetheless an excellent Diablolike and arguably a better singleplayer experience then many other titles in the genre, due in no small part to Van Helsing&apos;s both varied and powerful skillset. My hunter-class Van Helsing was capable of dealing extraordinary damage both to single targets and in an area, but was also very survivable thanks to a lot of lifesteal. The game is significantly easier on its normal difficulty then other titles in the genre, including the first Van Helsing, but offers two additional difficulty levels beyond that along with repeatable, randomized, high-level dungeons for the discerning munchkin. I will be proceeding directly to Van Helsing III and what I hope is a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy, and I will look forward greatly to Neocore&apos;s recently announced Warhammer 40,000 ARPG, Inquisitor - Martyr.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507858">Expand</a></span>

I bought it because I was pleasantly surprised with the first Van Helsing and I was not dissapointed. Was the sequel improved? Well, yes. But I do not feel any of the improvements actually enriched the game. Many things are the same as in the 1st part, so this can even be called and expansion pack. There will be Van Helsing III and I`m sure than all of them could be made into just one game. Nevertheless, it was 15&#x20AC; at premiere so it is worth it.
<br>
<br>Overall I should say I had much fun with it. Except for the bugs, which are still in the works 10months after release, it is a must buy for aRPG fans.
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>The story picks up on where Van Helsing I ended. It is quite generic but not too boring. The sidequests are a bit tedious. I liked all the minibosses and the endbosses (yes, there are two of them). The ending is very weak. Also, I felt that all of the banter between Katarina and Van Helsing was very weak. Same should be said about some cameo`s which were corny. Still, 34 hours of gameplay is not bad.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>I am somewhat confused about this. The gameplay is overall fun though it is hampered by bugs. I had many CTDs and some graphical bugs and that made me a bit nervous. Had to search for answers on the forums and even then I did not find an answer to my troubleshooting. I had to test the graphic options for a few hours.
<br>Other than that it is still Van Helsing. I started from lvl 30 and to be honest it was quite hard at the start. My hardware was simply not up to the task so I had to get new stuff straight from part II to go on.
<br>The gameplay is very dynamic, using player skills is easy. The AI is not very bright but you face literally SWARMS of enemies at once so it doesn`t matter too much. As in the 1st part, the tower defense sections are very nice and fun with many very cool traps.
<br>
<br>Sadly, the sequel did not improve what should get improved. As in the first Van Helsing, sometimes I had trouble recognizing where to go, I was often stuck at some bushes or crystals which resulted in many cheap deaths. It really can get iritating at times.
<br>
<br>The game features some new stuff with adding runes, getting a Chimera pet but I didn`t find them any interesting. I felt that more should be improved on creating new skillsets and auras, reworking the UI but none of that happened.
<br>
<br>MUSIC
<br>Same as in Van Helsing I. Very good, never boring. The devs gave OST which is very cool. I don`t mind if they use it in Van Helsing III.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS
<br>Not much improvement over the 1st one. Still cool graphics but a little worse optimised. Most of the maps are the same. The user interface wasn`t changed much though it is still good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5038149">Expand</a></span>

And although this didn&apos;t improve too far from the original, everything I loved about it is still here. The witty dialogue from the lovely Lady Katarina, Van Helsing, tons of gaming references, fast fluid gameplay, save game carry over from the first installment, base defense, commanders and tons of loot and customizations. This game is so packed full of RPG customization goodness that it is hard to fault for lacking in anything. There are some interface bugs which reset my melee attack interface everytime I loaded up the game, which is annoying and some lag. The voice acting is also, seemingly low-skill and low budget at best. But for $15, you really can&apos;t complain a lot as there is just huge huge value in this game that far surpasses nasty overpriced turds like Diablo 3. All the money went to development and game improvements. Nothing went to bribing &quot;professional&quot; Game Journalists and Media. No dollars were spent to producing fake expectations and hype. Overall, I love it and yes, I did get Van Helsing 3. Thumbs way up to the devs!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6285629">Expand</a></span>

<br>I did picked this up recently and I&apos;m not seeing all the bugs other reviewers have mentioned.  I&apos;ve had a couple of crashes to desktop but the save system has ensured I&apos;ve never lost a minute of progress, just had to restart the game.
<br>
<br>I love the story.  The character voice acting and interactions are top notch - better than most AAA games.  The plot is engaging and fun and keeps the player invigorated to complete the next objective.  The music is PERFECT, I love the music in this game.  The graphics are cool, lots of eye candy spell effects explosions and very nice animations.
<br>
<br>It is fantastically deep, re-playable, and has a fun endgame.  You can specialize your character or respect into different builds, you can specialize your ghost companion, you can modify, enhance, and craft your items - in fact it has one of my favorite item crafting systems because it uses a number of different modifiers but each one is simple.  Want an enchantment?  Pay gold to the enchanter and get a random enchantment.  Don&apos;t like that one?  Remove it and pay for a new one!  Quite easy, and when you do have the enchantment that you want and get a low roll, that&apos;s OK!  Reroll to get a higher value (at the cost of gold)!  Of course, you&apos;ll need lots gold, lol, which you get by playing the storyline, scenarios, or online.
<br>
<br>I also have to give a shout out to loot explosion lovers like myself.  This is the first game in a long time that genuinely gets me excited about loot explosions.  Sure, the mobs drop and plop the loot but you also get a chimera that you send on missions, when he comes back you get a loot explosion from whatever he gathered (usually 5+ rares on the higher missions).  In the endgame you can do scenarios which drop lots of loot themselves, but you also randomly get keys that let you open up chests in your secret lair that - yes, give you loot explosions and chests can be reopened for each key you have!.  It&apos;s so satisfying.
<br>
<br>I would pay $50.00 for this game, fortunately I only paid $15.00 and picked up the additional scenario for $5.00 which is rather short but I enjoyed it - a game lovers bargain for sure.
<br>
<br>I seriously can&apos;t recommend this game enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4350524">Expand</a></span>

<br>I got into the Giantwoods, the screen was filled with monsters, literally filled. I could not see or control Mr. V. H. There was so many that sometimes I could not even do a thing and I was dead. Who thought this would be fun? The stupid controls were not fixed from the 1st part, so if there are many monsters on screen you&apos;re stuck. It is FUBAR.
<br>I closed the portal and the monsters were still coming back. After around 10000 killed, I lost my interest.
<br>So I died a lot of times and respawned and than I quit the game. That was it for me. It is meaningless, and not fun in any way. This game is even worse than the first one.

If you&apos;ve played Grim Dawn, Diablo or Torchlight you&apos;ll be familiar with the gameplay. The game does have a unique ability system though, as you fight you gain rage which can be spent to powerup your abilities. For example lets say you&apos;re using a lightning spell, powering it up may cause enemies to be shocked, or it may increase the number of enemies hit. A powered up spell only has one charge and can be activated with the spacebar, although this becomes tedious very fast and I&apos;d wager 99.9% of people have this set to auto cast whenever available. The game allows you to set up powerup presets so you can very much set it and forget it and the game will automatically boost the chosen ability(s) whenever you have sufficient rage. Apart from that it&apos;s your usual aRPG fare, you have a standard talent tree with forks and paths, passive abilities and stat points which allow you to customise your character further.
<br>
<br>Throughout the game you&apos;re accompanied by your ghostly companion, Katarina. She works very much like the Torchlight pet, she can pick up items, fight for you and even be sent back to town to sell and buy which saves you the bother! She also has her own stats and talent tree, you can either build her to become stronger herself, or build her as a complete buff bot which will give you lots of powerful auras. Usefulness aside she&apos;s actually a big part of the game, and the banter between you and her is often really enjoyable, the voice acting for both Van Helsing and Katarina is top notch (the same can&apos;t be said for all the characters though!).
<br>
<br>The story will take around 10 hours to complete which is poor, and shorter than the first game. You will finish the story around level 30 but to do scenarios you&apos;ll need to be level 57 and I couldn&apos;t work out how to level up further. Perhaps this was only intended for people who imported their character from Van Helsing I but I started a new character so was much lower level by the end of the game.
<br>
<br>Technically the game is fine, most quests have voice acting which isn&apos;t always a given for this genre, especially from the smaller studios, and while not perfect it is pretty funny at times and there are plenty of references to other games and TV shows which I enjoyed. I will say the voice acting for Prisoner 7 is terrible, absolutely terrible and lowers the quality of the entire game by being so bad. Graphically the game is OK, it&apos;s a couple of years old and wouldn&apos;t have been anything to rave about back then, but it&apos;s fine. Performance is worse than Van Helsing I which stayed at 60fps without dips, whereas Van Helsing II will often dip in frame rate, and certain areas have issues and completely tank the frame rate. There is also a nasty bug with DX11 and Windows 8.1 where textures will not load, I suffered with this often and it made the game extremely frustrating at times.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s better than Van Helsing I, but it also introduces its own problems so I can&apos;t score it higher than 6/10, which is what I gave the first game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366297">Expand</a></span>

It&#xB4;s just one thing that annoys me and it is that the game is clearly made for several people to play coop in. It takes forever to kill some monsters when you play sigleplayer and the floating ship level is just ridiculous. Die, switch levels shoot the damn thing a couple of times, die switch levels shoot some more die...and so on, and You can&apos;t go back to the sanctuary either to do something more fun like exiting the game. I think it&apos;s gonna take me 2-3 hours just to off this boring boss.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4497798">Expand</a></span>
