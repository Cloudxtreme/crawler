It is definitively easier to play (easier to stay on the bike, and you can die and still unlock the next level). Like in Far Cry Blood Dragon, there&apos;s some mini animated retro cutscenes between missions with a voluntarily totally illogical story-line and some just as cheesy (and funny) sentences. Levels are highly dynamic, everything falls and explode as you go, with some really psychedelic events happening all the time, playing on gravity, etc. They also keep throwing you in different vehicles, different environments and making you do new things so that you do not get bored of repeating the same thing over and over. They also added some shooting sections which add to the gameplay. Unfortunately, it is quite short (completed in 2 sittings) and not offering lot of replayability. It&apos;s not meant to be a challenging game with high scores and such, just an arcade style campaign that you can play through and go along for the ride.

<br>After having a blast completing the game, I go online to praise it and am really surprised to read that everybody hate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trials-of-the-blood-dragon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6499278">Expand</a></span>
