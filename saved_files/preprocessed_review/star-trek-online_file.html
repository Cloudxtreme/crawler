However, Cryptic must devote some amount of time continuing to develop this title as it does suffer from some shallow aspects and some general bugs and unfinished areas. That said, as a fan of the series and of sci-fi MMOs in general, this is a genre that is sorely needed with the glut of WoW and DnD clones perpetually on the market. As it stands, I give it an 8 for a classic theme, sci-fi bent of RPG, and quality of play and variety. If cryptic fully supports this game and continues to release content and upgrades, it could definitely move into the 10 range for me. I will be playing and hanging around to see if that happens.

I myself found the ground combat interesting and it&apos;s refreshing to not have to be dependant on other players to accomplish group missions. It&apos;s nice to be able to either play with your friends or make your own away team, so regardless of your situation you have the basic components to almost every MMO. I also find that gearing up two different Avatars is an addictive concept. Gear is easy enough to get and progresses at a rate similar to leveling. The big down side to this game is the extremely predictable quest line.

<br>
<br>For a free-to-play MMO, this game is well above average. The production values, music, and what little voice acting there is, is excellent quality. The game feels quite polished, and for a starship junkie like me, the ships all look fantastic. The main quest chain is gripping and enjoyable, and makes leveling a breeze; a good balance of investment and reward as you level a character.
<br>
<br>The lifetime subscription to this game is quite a bargain at $200 USD, which equates to about 13 months of game time of a typical $15/month MMO, and will unlock everything that f2p players cannot access without microtransaction.
<br>
<br>In contrast to other free-to-play MMOs, the microtransactions in this game are kept to a minimum; all purchases made from the Cash shop are entirely cosmetic, having little to no impact on actual gameplay, and are not necessary in any situation to progress your character. In addition, an in-game currency called Dilithium can be converted in large amounts to cash shop credit, offering a cheaper alternative for those who don&apos;t wish to spend cash, but spend a lot of time playing.
<br>
<br>The space combat in this game is excellent. You have direct control over your ship and it&apos;s stations, with everything being laid out in front of you, and basic starship command is very intuitive. The controls are tight and concise, and is easily my favorite part about my STO experience.
<br>
<br>Ground combat is another story, however. On the ground, your skills are wildly different from that in space (of course), and your efficiency on the ground will be defined entirely by your away team (your group of starship officers that follow you to the ground). Ground combat is wildly more difficult than space combat, with much more focus on movement, equipment, environmental hazards, and multiple groups of powerful enemies. Coupled with the rather basic shoot-em-up feel of mashing your weapon attack, ground missions will wear out their welcome to most.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s loose storyline and setting stays very true to old canon, commonly alluding to the stories and experiences of James Kirk, Jean Luc Picard, and even Kathryn Janeway in their respective series as you explore the galaxy.
<br>
<br>Exploration itself, however, is somewhat lacking. For a world as open as this one, the experiences you&apos;ll have among sectors and it&apos;s planets is mostly predictable and simple. Almost all missions consist of no more than destroying some ships, or scanning some structures. While an over-arcing story helps break the monotony or tie things together, most open-world encounters have no larger plot or worthwhile reward for time invested, making them more akin to little mini-episodes and slightly less gripping as a result.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re one for playing solo, you will quickly discover that upon reaching level cap and completing the official episodes, you will have very little to do. In comparison to other MMOs, the amount of group content is scant at best, and repeating the same few group events dozens of times may quickly wear thin. I personally suggest you play this game with friends, or join a role-playing fleet (guild) to keep entertained and break the monotony of grinding the same few events all day every day.
<br>
<br>All MMOs have some grind in them; STO&apos;s problem is that there is no variety on what you can grind. If you want to be a Borg-slayer and join that NPC faction, you&apos;ll be running 5 of the same events for months. If you want to assist the Romulans, you&apos;ll have a lifetime of ground missions (primarily babysitting and kill-quests) to run around doing.
<br>
<br>However I can&apos;t be too harsh. For a free-to-play, this game is definitely better than most. It&apos;s enjoyable moreso with friends well polished, and a great game for Star Trek fans who&apos;ve always wanted to run around inside their ships, or sit at the helm and fight among the stars.
<br>
<br>I find the game very high quality, personally, but the community is among the ugliest I&apos;ve seen in any MMO to date. Every online game has it&apos;s elitists, it&apos;s dev-haters, and stop-having-fun crowd, but STO&apos;s community seems to house of the most intense of all of these. You can bet any &quot;problems&quot; with the game will be loudly vocalized, and when the servers are brought down to repair said problem, you can expect to see an equal amount of hatred directed towards the developers for the unstable servers.
<br>
<br>Community can be filtered out, however, and basing my score solely off what I get from the game, I can rest with an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3267189">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>2) unlimited content: STO has a system called the foundry that lets players create their own missions and share them with other players. This means I have a brand new mission that I have never played before to look forward to every single time I log in. I will never run out of new missions to do, which is wild.
<br>
<br>But hey, don&apos;t take my word for it. The game is free to play, so try it yourself and thank me later =P</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4522463">Expand</a></span>

With the addition of Legacy of Romulus you gain a new faction and new ships, and the addition of (finally!) warp cores/singularity cores.
<br>However, the core of it hasn&apos;t changed... a lot of the same old lot grinding, with plenty of bugs which are years old and plenty gamebreaking new ones. Also, with Perfect World having taken over, nickel&amp;diming is the rule, not the exception. If you want to compete in end-game PvE or PvP paying real money is a near-must. The last and best equipped tier of ships (Tier-5) for the level 50&apos;s can be bought with dilithium, fleet credits and/or Zen. However, the amount of grinding necessary for the first 2 options is incredible, and while you can get Zen through trading dilithium for it, the grinding necessary for it is just IQ-killing. Making you often just pay for the &apos;last&apos; ship, or keeping on the lesser strong ship from level 40.
<br>
<br>Also the Zen-bought ships have the thing that they have at level 40+ always an very handy console or special ability which you actually don&apos;t want to ignore.
<br>
<br>Last but not least: Cryptic has recently restricted the amount of stuff you can keep in your mail without an announcement about it, pissing off a lot of long-term players. Also the NPCs have gotten some &apos;special&apos; attacks that you cannot see nor react on which can, depending on the category of the ship you&apos;re flying and the current health of your ship (let&apos;s say around 50%), kill you outright in one shot while they have gotten a major upgrade in damage resistance making fights very tedious and long.
<br>
<br>To sum it up: nickel&amp;diming, grinding, still a lot of bugs (including some really old ones). Positive is that Cryptic seems to treat the lore with respect and they are willing to introduce new stuff to make it come a bit more closer to how Star Trek should &apos;feel like&apos;. Too bad the cons against this game are starting to overwhelm the pros....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3202681">Expand</a></span>

Eve Online, Star Wars Galaxies and Lord of the Rings Online all rank in time I&apos;ve spent living there. For a roleplayer, like me, a game&apos;s about living an experience as much as gaming the mechanics. Star Trek Online definitely ranks up with Lord of The Rings Online in an attempt to capture the feel the setting and, more, it incorporates some unique gameplay elements to that end. Space combat feels much like a more simplified but fun, action packed, version of Star Trek games like Starfleet Command. Ground combat has the potential to be tactically interesting as you groom your bridge crew/away team in skills they&apos;ll need to help you succeed. There&apos;s more than a little X-Com-like attachment to your guys and, well, even more because they can be customized in name and appearance and possess four unique traits beyond skills alone that define their abilities. There&apos;s exploration in several clusters that offer a small variety of randomized mission types in a large variety of different graphical environments. More needs to be done here but for daily, pick up n&apos; play, content no MMO comes close to being this entertaining as it is for casual gamers. There&apos;s already a big roleplaying community and the influx of dedicated Trekkers certainly helps. While we have ship bridges they&apos;re largely non-functional breakrooms and hangouts. There is no bridgeview combat or travel yet and certainly it seems hard to imagine multiplayer ships will be in soon. For those so inclined there is PvP, including a barebones Klingon faction, and one minor Raid instance. In the next update the Klingons are going to get much more PvE and more Raid will be introduced. A continuing sticking point is the sheer amount of combat in the game. While this fits Cryptic&apos;s vision of a Federation at war it&apos;s not necessarily the kind of Federation many Star Trek fans are comfortable with. The developers have indicated they&apos;re definitely expanding on the non-combat aspects and this will be focused into the Exploration/Genesis content. Overall, I&apos;m having a ball and I&apos;ve been here since Open Beta. Get with some friends that love the setting as much as you do and you&apos;ll have fun. STO&apos;s not perfect yet but there&apos;s room for growth in so many directions and no great flaws that will keep it from getting better with time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745553">Expand</a></span>

It is just severly lacking in content. This problem in an MMO is huge. There are many people hitting lvl cap already, I&apos;m personally am 3/4 there without playing night and day. The game is very repetitive, and has a terrible crafting system. PvP is really fun, expecially Fed vs Klingon but there are some serious imbalance issues. It was a fun game while it lasted, but there is no way this game is going to keep most people interested more than a month in the state that it is in. It&apos;s an MMO though, and will continue to grow over time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745594">Expand</a></span>

Yet another MMO launch in which the product was evidently rushed out the door by an eager marketing department, ST:O features a great core game obscured by dozens of critical bugs, server failures, and omissions of features common in almost all other MMOs (things like chat spam filters, the ability to sort the auction house, set the home base for your character to use a recall to, etc). Cryptic&apos;s support has been totally overwhelmed by the amount of user complaints, and as such it&apos;s taking a while to get everything in shape. Still, there&apos;s a lot of potential here, and I&apos;m looking forward to seeing it develop. As for gameplay itself, it&apos;s a pretty standard MMO design in many ways. Space combat is a lot of fun, and the different ship types really do require different styles. Ground combat is cookie-cutter and boring, and I haven&apos;t seen such a dearth of mission environments since the original Mass Effect - almost every ground mission looks like one of 4 or 5 different templates and has the exact same goals. Still, the joy of flying a starship can&apos;t be understated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745625">Expand</a></span>

Last dut not least is the Servers which cryptic can&apos;t seem to keep up. In my opinion dont buy this untill 6 to 12 months from now unless you like paying for a game that is...well i was gonna say 20% complete but I will change that to 50% as the game is playable and does entertain for a bit(while the current content lasts).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745626">Expand</a></span>

With such huge potential such as a star trek MMO, Cryptic has really messed up this IP, and no-body will try it ever again, atari will hold onto it and never let anyone make a finished game. Trekies will always give it a 10, but even they will begin to dwindle away after 3 or 4 months, the game will be dead before the end of summer. Expect a few 29.99 &quot;expansions&quot; which really should of been included in the release, such as playable other factions. Its worth the $50, play through the game, probably about a 50 hour game at the most, once you hit Admiral there is literally nothing to do, at all, t he game is finished, sit in a 2-3 hour PVP que, or start another charcter. The game is fun though, i was really looking forward to it, Cryptic has wasted this IP and it saddens me greatly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745776">Expand</a></span>

I have made PD games since 1989 and I can see where the developers have been lazy or not thought about design. Eg planets merging with background planes. Objects placed on the skybox. Overuse of asteroids etc so Cryptic are forced to have really short pop up (just reduce the number of objects Cryptic jeez!). But the main thing that winds me up is your away team using devices out of combat..... I mean why?

The development team does an excellent job of convincing you you&apos;re in the universe. The introductions and segues by Spock are helpful. As far as being a quality experience for free, your experience is pretty amazing for no cost save some space on your computer. The difficulty can be variable and so can the quality of some of the missions, but the story missions are pretty engaging and well though out. The highlight is the foundry, in which fans create awesome missions that occasionally rival those of the STO team. It&apos;s a quality experience, but can occasionally become repetitive or feel limiting based upon &quot;classes&quot;. If you&apos;re a Star Trek fan, do yourself a favor and give it an hour.

I am a Science Fiction fan, not just a Trekkie, just wanted to throw that info out there. By far, the greatest thing this game has going for it, is great space combat. The Graphics are great, with many beautifully built space and ground zones, well above many other popular MMOs.<br>Character customization, the level of detail you can go into with just creating your character was daunting at first, but once i got a handle on the vast number of slide bar settings, you would be squeal with glee at how precise you can replicate some of your favorite actors/family/whoever, with this character creator. Huge number ships available also, with many very degrees of customization available. The Foundry. Have you ever wanted to make your missions and raids in one of your favorite games? In STO, you can. Some of the Player Created content/missions I have played, you would think it should have been on the television, being advertised for &quot;Next Weeks Episode of Star Trek&quot; they are so well made and written.<br>Now a few bad parts.<br>The Foundry. What?!?! I just said it was great thing right? It is, but... Since it was introduced there has been little to no improvements made to it. There seems to be little Developer support keeping it running right, as the Foundry system itself was actually made as a Cryptic Developers tool for their upcoming Neverwinter game, and them bringing it to STO was really more of a testing of the system.<br>The Graphics. What?!? I said the graphics are great? They are, but not so if unless you have a very up to date computer to play with. Otherwise you have to reduce your graphic setting and don&apos;t get to enjoy just how beautiful this game is.<br>The Klingon faction. Often refered to as &quot;that other faction&quot;, has been, until very recently, severely neglected. As a consequence, only about 20% of the player base play on the Klingon side. The brighter side of the sad story is that small player percentage is extremely loyal to their Klingon characters, and they really enjoy being at least partially &quot;in character&quot; all the time, which deeply helps with the immersion factor. Another not so good thing that happened for/to the Klingons, was the recent release of 10 new ships to be flown. Good! Except they are all Game Store ships that require purchase. Another thing wrong, is the lacking of costume options for the Klingons. While the Federation players enjoy about 20 Game store purchasable costume options, on top of a large number of free ones, The Klingons have 1, and only a few free costume options. The Federation characters can show the personal body armors that they are wearing, Klingons can not.<br>(see how I went on about the Klingon faction? I told you we were a loyal bunch)<br>There are some persistant game bugs, but most games have those, and nothing especially game breaking, except for one bug that is currently effecting Klingon progress.<br>Star Trek Online is going free to play on January 17th, I certainly hope you will at least come and take a look, and judge for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2086640">Expand</a></span>

When I heard it was free to play I signed up to play, after playing the demo a few years earlier I new what I was getting into and I thought I would love it. I created my character using on of the best character creators I have seen in an MMO (Especially creating my own alien) I eventually settled with a trill captain an prepared to go boldly where no gamer has gone before (Pardon the pun) I delved straight in. I started playing through the story. A disappointing affair to say the least. When a brand says Star Trek, one expects much more than the general &apos;go in and slaughter them all&apos; attitude in most MMO&apos;s, I was expecting diplomacy and exploration<br>instead I got caught up in destruction and espionage.  All that aside the foundry is a fantastic feature, the ability to create my own missions is fantastic (although I haven&apos;t quite grasped it) and again the system for character creation is great. Then their is Klingon play, it&apos;s underdeveloped and I found it horrible to play, the ability to play as &apos;the enemy&apos; got me exciting but it was horrible, Cryptic have put next to no thought into the Klingon side. So in short Star Trek Online has potential, but it trips up on many hurdles, it has not stopped me from playing it and quite enjoying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2462447">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lets start with how STO earned it&apos;s 6 starts before then rapidly losing 5. It&apos;s a pretty descend MMO thou without any doubt somewhat dated and lackluster. One of the biggest complaints (a side from the Zynga-isme which we&apos;ll get to in a bit) is that the game is compiled of a series of endless instances which in turn means you&apos;ll spend a good amount of time going through loading screens which truly can break immersion.
<br>As a PvE experience you going to have a good time if you&apos;re a Trekkie as a Sci-Fi fan you&apos;ll be happy too if you can glance past the countless bugs and hiccups you are sure to encounter during your missions.
<br>
<br>Now lets get to what this game has degraded to since it took up the infamous Free 2 Play business model. Rumor has it that the executive producer Daniel Stahl once upon a time was a intern at Zynga Inc. and Oh Boi did he pick up a neat trick or two. You can now describe STO in a few simple concepts *1. Narly gambling (lock boxes) *2. Endless grind (time-gated reputation system) *3. The Ultimate MMO Power Trip (starbases  provides insane value both in terms of time spend and real world moneys).
<br>
<br>PvP is straight up Pay to Win and since there isn&apos;t much else to do once you reach end-game you are going to have a bad time luckily you can choose well at least as a federation character to stay clear of any PvP mischiefs.

<br>My hope is that the future of gaming will be about creating great game mechanics and giving players unforgettable experiences and the period of how to manipulate game-play and thus players for maximum profit will became a brief and shameful footnote in development history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170727">Expand</a></span>

Nothing in the game is locked behind a pay wall. Subscribers do get some perks but its nothing that will give them any advantage over someone who is playing for free. Huge amount of content and it keeps growing. The game has lots of issues in terms of bugs and balancing. Space battles are great but anything beyond adv is impossible to play unless you have insane amount of dps. Ground battles are good as well. Story missions are generally good but I&apos;m not all that impressed with the Iconian war story arc so far. They made them too powerful and I have to wonder what comes after that.

Also, the only game that seems to have improved consistently over time. Many of the reviewers need to do a re-review of this. Everything you can get for premium currency you can also grind off in-game currency. there are no hard limits to what a free and paying player can thus achieve (except of course a paying player gets it faster). Leveling is easy in my opinion and there&apos;s lots to do. I&apos;m a solo player, but this game is best enjoyed with a group of friends who can play together when they hit level cap. This is also the only mmo I play that I leave and then return to over and over... The only problem perhaps is the fact that this game is heavily instanced, with set locations so no feel of one of Star Treks core values, &apos;Exploration&apos;, can be readily experienced. Though I suppose events and such may simulate that. I fully expect the game to get even better with ongoing updates and such.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3392467">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Space combat is a ton of fun.
<br>- Ground combat is poor. So poor it will drive some away all by itself.
<br>- Poor new player experience. Poor tutorial. Expect to do a lot of self learning and internet research.

I was immensely excited for the release of the game. I jumped right in when Beta access was granted, and played through head start and launch. I just don&apos;t have any desire to play through the content that is currently available. The game, as it stands, is rather dry, shallow, and underwhelming. Ground combat is bland and uninspired. Character classes/specialties are almost meaningless; you can play through the game as a Tactical Officer in an Escort ship or a Science Officer in a Cruiser in an almost identical manner. The positive is the space combat. It is really engaging, and I really enjoy the times when there are tons of ships battling in close proximity. Wait six months to a year, and this game might be really great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745896">Expand</a></span>

The space battles have become more challenging, requiring more of a tactical approach. The ground missions break up the monotone of space but still need some polish. I like the game and I feel it has alot of potential, but we are a long ways from that.</span>

The space combat is like nothing you&apos;ve played before in a MMO. Its thrilling and fast paced. The idea of having other characters you can give orders too and level up is a novel idea and it works really well. Lastly but not least, It is Star Trek after all. If you like star trek then you&apos;ll like this. If you love star trek then you&apos;ll love this. final comments are its a fun tactical mmorpg with some clear failings but dont let that spoil your fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745340">Expand</a></span>

Space combat is REALLY fun, but ground combat could definitely use some work. The customization of your ships, avatar, and even officers is really amazing.</span>

The ground combat can be difficult at times, but I have enjoyed it. I think the game will improve as time goes on. the bugs will vanish and hopefully some new content will add to the experience of Star Trek.</span>

The graphics are great and it really feels like you are in control of your own Star Trek show. My only complaint is that they didn&apos;t spend enough time developing the game before release and it has quite a bit of bugs, needs more content (Read content for Klingons here) and they need to balance the 2 factions a bit better. On the Federation side you get a ton of quests and just from running your quests you will be well equipped shortly after reaching the next rank, including all of your Bridge Officers, also you are able to do some crafting on the Fed side that just isn&apos;t available to the Klingons. On the Klingons side of the house you have PVP and a few PVE missions. the first few PVE missions take you around show you where things are and give you 3 Bridge Officers, then you get the repeatable PVP missions, and PVE MISSION no that is not a typo, most of you Levling will take place in PVP which will give you all the credits you need to get equipped or you can do the Kahless Expanse. Which will give you different kinds of credits that will get you pretty much the same equipment. This is where we come to the disparity. The Feds get some pretty good Rare equipment starting in their Tier 2 mission (Level 11 through 20) Where as the Klingons will only get the PVP/Exploration equipment that the Feds can also get. Cryptic is supposed to be working on some PVE content for the Klingons that should fix this disparity in equipment but until they do my Liberated Borg Klingon will be staying at level 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745569">Expand</a></span>

Currently much of a hate towards STO is by these people who are upset because Champions Online failed, which was Cryptic&apos;s MMO before STO. Course part of the fault was due to Cryptic but thats another tale. Its not perfect yet but if you are a WoW player who wants something new, something fresh to try. Look no further than STO. It is a fun experience and the potential it has is enormous which is why I rate it an 8 instead of a 7. The Trek IP is just a gold mine for this game and the main storyline does not disappoint as you move into the Romulan sectors.

Although I am a great fan of Star Trek, I think this game would even make sence for non-Star-Trek-guys. Thanks that my childhood dreams became true and I can be a real Captain with my own Crew!</span>

Then theres the forming of fleets that you can modify, put your clan tag on and the like. It&apos;s just sweet, 10 outta 10, ESPECIALLY if you are a trekkie! Let&apos;s not forget, you can customize yourself and your ship to the &apos;nth degree and well. It&apos;s brilliant.</span>

Ground combat is fun, but can be very... boring unless your skills are designed properly. Not much worse than say LOTRO when you are wailing on a boss as a tank. End Game content seems very underdeveloped, though. PVP and Fleet Actions seems to be the only major effort at that stage, but it will take a month of extremely dedicated play (hundred(s) of hours) to get there. Consequently, it is worth the money.

So far the game is small, and endplay is too limited, but it should change quite soon as new content is added. And even ground fighting have some nice potencial.

From the first time I logged on, until I logged off, I never wanted to stop playing. It truly makes you feel like a starship captain. Space combat is absolutely fantastic and well worked out. Ground combat is a little lacking, but running up to someone with a Bat&apos;leth is fun as hell. Customisation is far from lacking, you can pick from three ships per tier (for now, more to come) and are able to change parts on your ship to that of other ships, and are also able to change the hull&apos;s colour configuration. Character customisation is perhaps the best I&apos;ve seen in any game. You can create anything from a Betazoid, to a ferengi, a Jem&apos;Hadar, even a Vorta!(I&apos;ve even seen Yoda ;P) When designing the character you detailed options (more detailed than Oblivion or fallout 3) for the face and body, ranging from eye size and shape, to jaw size, to buffness of your character (and as a treat for us guys, BOOB SIZE!). Cryptic completely went all out with this game, and people are definately anticipating their upcoming free expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745511">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s ability to have so much relation to the story i grew up with even the TRIBBLES. I look foward to more content as it gets better and better. Like most MMO&apos;s its not perfect but has alot of potential.</span>

                                        <span> The game is a very detailed journey through the star trek universe. It has some very strong points that include space comment. Ground combat is fun with a friend and once you get your away team geared properly can be very fun. It got a 9 from me because of the occasional disconnects and lag. However it is an excellent diversion from WOW.</span>

Its from the worlds biggest franchise, it plays and feels like the Tv series. Graphics: are just beautiful and the game will run most systems. Not washed out graphics like wow but clear detailed graphics. The different worlds are different from each other. The layout of the interface and controls are nice with the awesome shield system. Audio: The sound is terrific and adds the star trek theme really well. The phasers to the computers voice are just exciting and well done that make you feel a part of the adventures not just a 3rd person watching. The theme of star trek is really added with the music. Gameplay: Its excellent once you know the controls.The controls with the players can be hard at first but its no different to any other third person mmo such as wow. Lasting play? Already STO has made a great showing of what Cryptic can do and it can only get better as time goes on. Yes it was buggy but that&apos;s a mmo and this is not just a wow style mmo its a complex one in many ways, its star trek. You cant compare wow to Star Trek its to different and in my opinion i much prefer STO because i love scifi. Its nice to see 1 more scfi mmo in the world i was becoming sick and tired of swords and magic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745464">Expand</a></span>

<br>The first 3 weeks of gameplay was interrupted by daily patches and daily server shutdowns to fix the broken patches.
<br>leveling was extremely fast,and boring doing the same cookie cutter missions over and over at each level.I reached the level cap in 1 week and thats when the real boredom started.After reaching the level cap there is nothing to do except a few STF missions which you need to do hundreds of times each in order to try to get the good gear that you need to participate in pvp.
<br>The game seems to be a typical low budget cash cow game. The community forums require a cash payment in order to gain access to them. some of the mission rewards called mystery boxes require a cash payment in order to open the box and receive your reward for  completing the mission.
<br>A never ending stream of bugs and glitches seems to be the major features of this game.
<br>STO makes the same mistake that many other F2P games make, they seem to feel that since it is F2P that all the user can be treated as,and used as,beta testers to weed out and report the bugs and glitches  that infest the poor quality patches and updates.If I want to be a beta tester I`ll go play a beta game. when I play a live game,either F2P or P2P, I don`t want to be the lab rat that tests the poor quality patches and updates.If they can`t be bothered to do a quality job creating and testing their patches and updates why should I have to be burdened with finding and reporting the bugs and glitches in their patches and updates.
<br>overall the gameplay reminds me of some cheap knockoff of an old NES type game.
<br>As with many other F2P games the customer service in this game is dreadful at best and non existent at it`s worst. This game is hardly worthy of the Star Trek name, I expected much better.
<br>If your just looking for another pointless low budget,generic grindy, cash cow game then you`ll love this game.Personally I wasn`t the least bit impressed with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2154507">Expand</a></span>

Basically you could be whoever you wished in Starfleet or the Klingon Empire.  Another plus is how the story unfolds in &quot;episodes&quot; over an entire arc involving one enemy race as the primary antagonist, the game&apos;s equivalent to a regular season.  However, the combat suffers from the same repetitive tactics in every single mission/episode.  The biggest frustrations came from battling the Romulans.  Every single space battle that happens, the Romulan ships always pull the cheapest maneuvers to instantly destroy your starship, the most used one being where the Romulans hold your ship still with a tractor beam before unloading a massive volley of heavy plasma torpedoes that quickly overload your shields and destroy your ship in one shot.  That would be fine if they used it a few times, but the AI seeks to *abuse* that tactic as much as possible in every single mission&apos;s space battle (all within the Romulan &quot;season&quot;), causing the mission to be nearly impossible to complete even though the difficulty of the mission is the same as the level your character is at when you attempt it.  The ground battles are nearly the opposite.  The ground missions are generally very, very easy compared to the space battles if your away team has good synergy between the skills you&apos;ve given them to use in battle.
<br>
<br>Another issue I have is the exploration.  Whenever I&apos;m between missions, I wanted to explore some random world to feel like a true explorer, as was promised from the first looks of the game prior to its release.  Instead, I&apos;m forced to stay in space to either 1) run an errand for a new race, 2) fight a battle, or 3) answer a distress call.  Afterwards, there isn&apos;t even an option to explore the world, at least as far as I knew after scanning the entire UI for the option.
<br>
<br>So, here is the bottom line.
<br>Pros:
<br>+ huge universe to explore
<br>+ visiting familiar places from all of the TV series before Enterprise
<br>+ varied missions
<br>+ the TV-series-like feel of the story missions
<br>
<br>Cons (in minuses):
<br>-   AI repeatedly abusing cheap maneuvers in space battles to get insta-kills
<br>- ground battles are too easy in comparison to space battles (PvE)
<br>-  no option to explore random worlds
<br>
<br>The abusive AI in the PvE space battles were way too much for me to continue playing the game any further and I stopped playing.  If I ever go back to it, I hope the AI has been improved to where they stop spamming the same one-shot-kill tactic in every single space battle (as the Romulans).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3084164">Expand</a></span>

There should be a limit to corporate greed, but Star Trek Online is, unfortunately, not the utopia the Federation is based on.
<br>
<br>The story, the heart of main quest lines, is entirely forgettable.  The plot points is interesting though cliche (war, shadow enemies, putting down rebellions), but poorly executed in game.  The story is conveyed in a large block of text below a character portrait, with few animations, facial expressions,  voice acting, or cutscenes to breath life into the story.
<br>
<br>Star Trek Online does provide a possible source of engagement: bridge officers.  But they also squander it.  The bridge officers lack personality, distinctiveness.  The same text is repeated just with different portraits.  This is partially mitigated by the Romulan expansion with a single permanent crew member, but the game is better served simply having a fixed crew for all missions for the sake of story then allowing the user to select their own after.
<br>
<br>The combat, particularly the ground combat, is a tedious affair.  Moving 4 feet, engaging 10 enemies, then move another 4 feet, then engaging the SAME set of enemies.  Repeat this for 8 more times before the 1st objective is complete.  Then 2 more objectives to go!  Nevermind the ground combat&apos;s mechanic complexity does not even extend beyond mashing attack and occasionally tossing out a special.
<br>
<br>The scenarios are uninspired; go here scan this, go here kill this, go here protect this.  All missions will follow these same patterns; the only difference is order.  Playing the game is an exercise in patience; the equivalent of chopping digital trees ad nauseam.  Time spent on these missions is wasted.
<br>
<br>But the game breaker is the lack of polish.  Icons do not line up properly with their description.  Targeting is not fluid.  The overall map does not relay where the next mission objective is.  Numerous graphical glitches kill immersion.  AI path finding and combat is broken.  The list goes on.
<br>
<br>Yet, there is still something to love.  The space combat IS fun.  The details on the ship, even if not in anything else, is great.  The concept of bridge officers is interesting.  It&apos;s unfortunate these features were not fully fleshed out.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s still something here for Star Trek fans.  But for anyone else, their money and time is better spent elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4477531">Expand</a></span>

It was important to preface my review with this, because at launch, it was bereft of content that most MMO&apos;s would consider a basic requirement (endgame content, for one thing). Now, this game if fully fleshed out, especially considering it is a F2P game. The space combat is highly engaging, reminiscent of Insurrection and Nemesis. On the ground, you don&apos;t feel like a vulnerable away team just waiting to get blasted (and the in-game lore does a decent job explaining why). The opening story and following episodes are very entertaining, but at times repetitive in their objectives. The secondary features of the game may intimidate new players at first, but are well worth getting into. Some people may be put off by the amount of currency required to buy some of the truly top of the line ships, but it is possible to play this game, fully featured, without ever spending a nickel of real money. That approach can be a little grindy, so if you can afford to put US$10-20 towards some ZEN (game store currency), you may appreciate the later stages of the game a bit more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5037716">Expand</a></span>

On the plus side the character and ship customization are excellent, and the combat systems while humorously outdated are serviceable. It&apos;s too bad you can&apos;t explore your own ship, communicate in meaningful ways with NPCs, and create your own story; it&apos;s the usual MMO grind-fest which has been done better dozens of times by other developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=746799">Expand</a></span>

Here the reward is patience and a willingness to immerse onself in the genre ratrher than perfect builds, munchkinesque crafting silliness or stabbing other players in the back for the Perfect Drop. STO is, blissfully, wonderfully and magnificently NOT WoW, and for that I am sincerely grateful. You can play this game without having to enslave yourself to it, and good sportsmanship is actually a plus.

It needs some improvement, but the developer Cryptic has shown that they love giving away free updates that fix and improve the game. The flight sim of space might seem complex at first, what with a million complex button options, but is actually very easy to grasp. The storyline is very simple yet still richly detailed, allowing both Star Trek fans and novices to understand and enjoy. In my opinion, the best battles are on planets with your away team. There are possibly a thousand different weapons - from phaser rifles to disruptor launchers - that each have their own unique sense of purpose and belonging. In short, this is a great game that nobody will forget any time soon, and I strongly recommend buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=746785">Expand</a></span>

Exploration is about seeing exciting new worlds, finding/solving mysteries, discovery, adventure, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Well with STO I felt like I didn&apos;t want to explore after a point, of endless silly scanning around for anomalies. Ground combat is appalling and most focus is on space combat, of which I am not a great fan. After playing STO for about a year I would describe the game as mediocre, only thing great it was hearing Spock talking and the jokes in chats about Sulu and Kirk. Now I returned playing WoW and EVE for sometime (like most ppl I know) and am waiting for SWtOR which looks quite promising btw.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541423">Expand</a></span>

A really refreshing change from the dull grind and raid of most MMORPG&apos;s out there.. Think original mass effect mixed with Earth and Beyond and your not far off what this title delivers.

Space flight is ok because you can control your own ship. Rest is just honestly boring and not much fun. It is going FTP soon though but honestly I wouldn&apos;t even download it if it was free.</span>

Ok, now use these few basic scenarios repeatedly only tweaking some script regarding motivation and ride that out to max level. Get to max level and waste into oblivion. This game offers one week of fun, 2 or 3 for casual players, until you realise you&apos;ve been punked. Then you linger on because you&apos;re a trek fan and you just can&apos;t believe this is all there is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=746122">Expand</a></span>

Originally I played for about 2 weeks before becoming bored with the repetitive and buggy experience. By now the game should be in better shape, right? First the good. The space warfare is fun. For a time. Now the bad. Over the course of the couple of years since launch it actually appears to have become MORE buggy. How this has been accomplished I have no idea, but the situation is so bad I actually started to suspect some kind of corporate-espionage style sabotage. Over the course of my two days replaying, here is SOME of what I discovered.<br><br>1. Certain HUD tooltip elements don&apos;t deactivate on mouseover properly, instead flickering in a seizure-inducing manner. 2. The speed control slider moves up and down of its own accord at inopportune moments.<br><br>3. Gas cloud texture maps are broken<br><br>4. Away team members vanish without explanation on occasion<br><br>5. Keyboard shortcuts for abilities sometimes don&apos;t work - and I mean don&apos;t work at all, not just a long delay.<br><br>6. If you &apos;pin to taskbar&apos; the game icon then try to launch the game from it, it will appear to work until the point of login, when the game will freeze at &quot;connecting to account server&quot;. I noticed several people on the STO forums complaining about this and not realising it was related to the &apos;pin to taskbar&apos; function. They were simply fobbed off or insulted.<br><br>7. Planets sometimes appear as transparent circles, showing the starfield behind<br><br>8. NPCs vanish (which is annoying when they are required to finish a quest)<br><br>9. Invisible phaser beams from invisible enemies sometimes shoot you and your team<br><br>Now I&apos;m bored. **** game, forget it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150645">Expand</a></span>

Do you like doing more than engaging in repetitive and mundane space battles over and over and over again without having the option to skip or use stealth to achieve objectives without resorting to combat? Well then look elsewhere, friend. Sure it looks pretty enough and has lots of customizing options, but that&apos;s where the appeal ends. This is a Star Trek game for those who hate nuance, intelligence, or diplomatic solutions. This is only for those who want to fight over and over and over again. If you want real Star Trek, dig up Bridge Commander. You&apos;ll have plenty more fun than in Cryptic&apos;s piece of trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2775826">Expand</a></span>

Cryptic got one very fundamental and important thing completely and utterly wrong. Star Trek is about exploration. &quot;To reach out to new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no man has gone before.&quot; Star Trek Online is all combat, combat, combat, combat, more combat, and even more combat. There is no exploration. Don&apos;t get me wrong. I thought the combat, especially the ship fights, was fun, if a bit unrealistic. One lone Federation ship cannot defeat 9 Klingon ships (3 at a time, but still), especially when those ships are warships. Sure, Star Trek is a bit unrealistic, but it has always had a tinge of realism that made you go &quot;That could actually be our future.&quot; I did not get this feeling for a moment while playing Star Trek Online. The leveling system wasn&apos;t bad, and was a good tie-in to the actual ranks. The graphics were amazing, for what little actually had to be done. You are mostly limited to being in orbit of a planet when in space, while the &quot;Sector Space&quot; - the space where you pick what system you want to go to - was big but felt too much like a &quot;Level Select&quot; to me. Having to buy the Klingon and Ferrengi races (Note: I may not be understanding the method of obtaining C-Points correctly), and only offering the freed Borg as a perk to buying a Lifetime subscription, rubbed me the wrong way as well. All in all, Star Trek Online is an incredibly disappointing game that focuses far and beyond too much on combat and not on what Star Trek is really all about: Exploration. I will not be renewing after the free month.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745335">Expand</a></span>

Asteroid belts don&apos;t orbit planets. In STO every planet has asteroids, it kinda got to me. No reason not to die. No economy. (WoW clone type economy doesn&apos;t count in my book) Repetitive everything. No reason to buy stuff, everything is dropped by loot or mission reward. No reason to socialize. Frankly, no reason to play. :( Things I liked: phasers and photon torpedoes.... ground combat the first few times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=746983">Expand</a></span>

Now i&apos;ve come back after 7 months or so and found 95% of the bugs have been fixed, theres is no crippling lag, they are constantly adding new content and everything has generally been improved. I&apos;ve noticed some people are **** about &quot;all you do is kill kill and kill some more there is none of the diplomacy or exploration that was what the star trek universe was all about&quot; there are exploration missions with minimal rewards and there is some trade and diplomacy involved in them but THEY ARE THE MOST BORING MISSIONS IN THE GAME. What people are forgetting is that without the warfare this game would cease to be fun. Would anyone be playing a game like WOW (i personally hate the game just using it as an example) if all you were supposed to do was explore, trade and do diplomatic missions with a little combat? NO. now onto the actual combat. The ground combat is very dull though i&apos;ve found its become more enjoyable since they removed almost all of the glitches. The space combat is amazing as a huge fan of games like Starfleet Command and Star Trek Bridge Command among others i found they took most of the best elements of both, put them into a single game and improved the graphics and gameplay by about 10x and while it is true it gets a little tedious after awhile but really doesnt any mmo? my biggest problem with the game is that you cant buy ship upgrades with your energy credits (money) from the vendors you need badges of exploration to do that which means doing the boring exploration missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389676">Expand</a></span>

It has no StarTrek at all. It is all combat, at space mainly, even the combat at ground is bad. I admit the space combat is fun to play, but all is space combat, no exploration, no diplomacy, no Star Trek at all. The skill system is useless. What is the point in having four officers with a punch of skills to level up, when you can only use five or six skills at maximum? It has no sense to raise for example 2 space skills per officer when you can only use 5. The missions are mainly go there and get an object, or go there and kill those guys. The klingon faction is a waste of time, no fun missions, no content, just a bit of pvp with a painful difficult level. Stay away from this game please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745415">Expand</a></span>

People expecting the kind of MMO experience that will suck you in and you won&apos;t want to leave are going to be sorely disappointed, as Cryptic hasn&apos;t even been able to provide much more than a few story driven missions, coupled with a massive number of generic missions that have little to no story. To add insult to injury, Cryptic neglected to put into place any system that would allow any group of people larger than 5 to get into the same instance. There is no &quot;raid&quot; group function, and therefore it is virtually impossible for a fleet/guild to actually be able to get into the same instance of an encounter. This makes the Multiplayer aspect severely limited and makes the reasoning behind joining a fleet to be somewhat laughable. On top of that, may of the developer interviews have been oddly reminiscent of City of Heroes when Cryptic decided to implement changes that completely alienated existing gamers, causing them a loss of 54% or so of their players, and triggering the sale of that game to NCSoft. It is a great game for fun, and reminiscent of SFC III, but if you&apos;re looking for an engaging MMO that lets you do more than fly in and shoot to blow things up, you will be sometimes happy, and most of the time disappointed. I&apos;m hoping Cryptic will be more forward thinking, but for my money, I&apos;ll be going into something else as soon as my sub is up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=746471">Expand</a></span>

First, fanboy expectations of this game are a little ridiculous and quibbling over nonsense like the scale of the star systems is stupid. Do you really expect for space travel from Earth to Bajor to be in real-time? That would make for one exciting experience, wouldn&apos;t it? Beyond that, the jury was out on this game way too early. I&apos;m not an MMO player and I wouldn&apos;t give someone a nickel to play WoW as I have no interest in the genre but I am a gamer and a Star Trek gamer at that and I bought a lifetime mebership as well only for the fact that if I get two years out of it, it will be paid for. That being said, I haven&apos;t played the game in over a month and I just got back into it this week and the improvements that have already been made have been dramatic. I&apos;ll be the first to admit that I began playing this thinking to my self, &quot;that&apos;s it?&quot; as there really wasn&apos;t much of a difference between the closed-Beta version of the game and the initial release. I&apos;m amazed at how much better it has become in just the past 6 weeks. The complaint about not having any incentive to team up... gone. I have been in a multiple battles in the past three days that have required assistance from fellow players or I would not have been able to beat them and that&apos;s in space and on the ground. One of the biggest complaints I had was that the missions were dull and simplistic with little storyline and and the same generic tasks. That to, albeit not perfect, is improving. Cryptic seems very receptive to the input of the players and they seem to want to make the experience improve by continuing to evolve it. In my opinoon what happened s that they released this game ealrier than they really wanted towhich is why it seemed &quot;not finished.&quot; Also, something that really bugs me is when players complain that an MMORPG is subscription based. Grow up, you big babies. It&apos;s an open-ended environment that need to be constantly maintained and Cryptic doesn&apos;t bombard you with advertisements and doesn&apos;t make you buy upgrades. if you had asked me last month where this game ranked, I&apos;d say a 5 but today it&apos;s a solid 7.5. It&apos;s not quite an 8 so I&apos;m leaving it at 7 but Cryptic that they really care about this product to improve what needs to be improved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=747489">Expand</a></span>

I am not exactly a hardcore Star Trek Fan, but I did like the franchise so I decided to give this game a go. STO offers a decently long campaign where you can choose to be either a Federation, Romulan or Klingon character, though only the beginning of the missions are unique to the factions, the later parts of the story are similar. The game is also open world, with many different systems and sectors to visit. Most of the story is told through reading, either from other NPC and cut scenes. Some of the story even continues or relates to the television series of Star Trek, which is nice. Gameplay is third-person, with the option to switch to a first person like. Combat includes both ground combat (character vs NPC etc.) and space combat, including both PVE and PVP. Combat is pretty decent, with different tactics to go about in ship combat. There are a large variety of different weapons, gadgets, abilities and other equipments to go with your play style. Different grades and rarity of items exist, with the good items being hard to find. Almost all the ships from the star trek lore is in this game, from the Klingon Negh&apos;Var to the Sovereign to even Dominion and other alien ships. Overall I did like the game play and the story, I had alot of fun from it.
<br>
<br>Those were the good part of the game, now this is the bad part of the game. During the campaign, most of the story is through reading and combat, it gets dull quickly as a new player, you would be drawn into things like trying to level up to add more skill points, gain access to new ships, thus you would be tempted to just skipping all the reading and just quickly finishing missions. A lot more interaction could be used in the story. Then next, endgame content. After completing the story, you would only have normal MMO things left to do, which is to grind for currency, rare weapons, getting new traits, new ships and so on. You can enter dungeon like PVE game mode with fleets to earn items. However I find some extremely large problems for the end game content. Firstly, the ships. By playing through the campaign to level up, you will be granted free ships from a small selection of choice, starting from small escorts to larger cruisers, then battle cruisers. A total of 5-6 free ships. once you get the last ship which is the battle cruiser, the previous ships are mostly obsolete as they have less stats. However, the normal currency in this game, earned through selling unwanted items, or completing missions, cannot be used to buy any ship that would be at the same level as your last free ships, or better. A small choice of them requires Dilithium crystals, another primary currency. The problem is that you can only obtain the currency in &apos;ore&apos; form, and to convert it, it&apos;s free but you can only convert 8000 a day. And the good ships that cost Dilithium cost like 120000 crystals! That would take you hours after hours of grinding, and even then you have to wait for 15 days. The majority of the good ships, that is &apos;Tier 5 and Tier 6&apos;, the biggest problem is that they can only be bought in 2 ways, real world money currency, Zen, or converting crystals to Zen then buying it. Each good ships cost way too much! Probably any player would want one of the faction specific dreadnoughts, like the Romulan Scimitar or the Federation Odyssey class. However 1000Zen cost $10, almost all of the good ships cost 2500-3000 Zen. That means each ship is about $25! You can earn your way up to buy it without real money but it will take you forever. With the current exchange rate of Dilithium to Zen from other real players, it will take roughly 50 days to convert 400k crystals to 2500Zen! And thats just for 1 ship and for 1 character! There are over 20+ of the good and nice ships in this game! There is currently no other way to go around this. This means that after enjoying your free new ships, you be stuck with that 1 cruiser for at least a month, and that is if you are really a hardcore MMO playing everyday! And this is just for ships. Both your character and your ships have intensive item customization. All the ultra rare items mostly cost way too much, or require a hybrid currency of Dilithium and others like fleet credits. All of these completely kills any endgame content unless your willing to fork out at least a hundred dollars. I have not played much of PVP, but I hear that the tier 6 ships is quite imbalanced for PVP.
<br>
<br>Overall, I played the game for about 6 days, putting hours into my Klingon character to level 55.
<br>While the story is decent, if your willing to read everything, the game quality is average, the graphics are extremely dated especially in this year 2014, and the game after the story is basically all the things you will see in an average MMO, just that its all spaceships. I cant really see any value putting hours into grinding in this game, and with an average quality, its a 5/10 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=4640784">Expand</a></span>

Essentially you stand there firing at each other with the occasional roll or knock back. No use of cover and I&apos;ve actually experienced (like in space) NPCs firing through objects I can&apos;t. There&apos;s no penalty for dieing and you spawn close to where you were fighting. In fact it&apos;s almost rewarded because instead of having to be cautious when your hull was beaten down low, you can just do what you can to speed up your demise so you can zip on it with fully recharged shields and a hull without any dings in it. The quests are repetitive. There is little variation between quests and they can all be summed up as either: kill, scan, talk. Scanning by the way consists of pressing F then waiting for a bar to reach its end. In a game as this with all of the problems faced by Star Trek cast in television series or movies you&apos;d think they could have come up with something different, even if it only happens once in a blue. While they&apos;re at it, they seriously need to fix that useless quest log and make the map more useful. I won&apos;t say the map is useless because you can see planets to travel to and just click which one you wish to head to, but it could have been made so much clearer. Why in space can my ship not do a vertical flip? Aircraft on Earth can for crying out loud. Put some direction in the quests for players new to the game or Star Trek franchise. You say go &quot;there&quot; but never actually give players direction on where that is. At least allow us to access a map of the other sectors while not being in them. There is no logical reason as to why we shouldn&apos;t be able to at least see the lay out. The quests seriously need their repetition toned down. I got bored out of my mind before level 8 and the only thing that has me not falling asleep at the keyboard is, well, nothing actually. I have been falling asleep playing on a few occasions. The Lamb Chop song isn&apos;t as reptitive as the quests in this game. I say this despite others having already done so because the devs apparently love repetition. The voice over narrative is dull, uninformative for the most part and wholely annoying. This game is best summed up as a multiplayer dungeon crawler set in space but with gameplay that isn&apos;t interesting in the least with sole exception with the fleet actions on some occasions (they tend to get easier later in the levels). It&apos;s buggy, has mediocre space combat, subpar ground combat (and terrible NPC pathfinding), poor narrative, annoying soundtrack (I swear one of them is some guy moaning in agony, hopefully the type of agony I have hearing that track), and doesn&apos;t offer any real callenge or innovation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745429">Expand</a></span>

If you disagree fine, but the whole aspect of a mmo is that you dont feel alone but are playing with thousands of other players. There might be some hope but as the game stands now maybe the true star trek fans can enjoy it I however was quite bored after 2 weeks. And i really tried it but its just the same thing over and over. But there is still potential however i will look at it again in a few months see if it has improved. But there are better mmo&apos;s out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=745900">Expand</a></span>
