Over 35 developers would abandon Activision&apos;s Infinity Ward to join West and Zampella at their new studio.<br><br>No doubt hard at work, the developers at Respawn Entertainment have yet to announce their first game, but it all started with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.<br><br>-    Why the history    -<br><br>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is a wrongfully forgotten game.    Released 25 days AFTER Christmas, it had a horrible launch window.<br><br>The game probably wasn&apos;t finished in time for Holiday 2001, and even if it was, it would have been competing with<br><br>Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty<br>Halo : Combat Evolved<br>Grand Theft Auto III<br><br>All critical and commercial darlings, which in my mind took the limelight from Allied Assault.<br><br>Needless to say, not having a console counterpart hurt sales, especially with Halo basically restarting the console shooter trend that Goldeneye 64 began.<br><br>Medal of Honor as a franchise self destructed with 2015/infinity ward, and it&apos;s legacy is tainted with loads of EA&apos;s crappy spin-offs, in the same way that Call of Duty is now being destroyed by Activision with the Treyarch developed Call of Duty games.<br><br>But it all began here -<br><br>The signature last stand wounded animations, the Epic, massive team battles like D-day Omaha Beach juxtaposed with the stealth and sniping missions.<br><br>Clearly, you can see the roots of classic COD4 levels like Gillies in the Mist in the game&apos;s solo and sniper levels.<br><br>By the year 2011, there isn&apos;t much that this game did well that hasn&apos;t been done better a decade later, but the basic joy of shooting enemies is still fun, and more than vaguely reminds me of Call of duty: Modern Warfare.<br><br>Allied Assault is a forgotten classic.    It belongs with Ocarina of Time, Halo: Combat Evolved, Goldeneye, Pong, and Super Mario Bros.<br><br>While it didn&apos;t bring halo&apos;s 2 weapon inventory system or regenerating health to the shooter industry, what it did bring was atmosphere, and incredible action set pieces.<br><br>It&apos;s what saving private ryan did for war movies, made them more intense and visceral, brought you into battle like never before, selling you an experience you couldn&apos;t get anywhere else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490888">Expand</a></span>

Game is a challenge in itself. I admit as my first pC game I had trouble getting used to controls.

<br>Environment and atmosphere are Great  for it&apos;s time of release even now playing it with all details at maximum and all visual effects on it is a delight to watch and play.
<br>All Single Play campaign is very realistic and cinematographic. The Sounds are 10/10 really and the soundtrack...OMG...Powerful, Intense, Dramatic, and so well written it put us right in the middle of the war.
<br>In Multiplayer Mode This game is 10/10. With the best movements i ever saw on a FPS, and those leans are really handy ;). Fast drop of weapons, quick draws of pistol, fast opening/closing doors fights...all possible to save ourselves. And it has so many Great mods to play. Free-For-All; Team-Match; Objective-Match; Freeze-Tag; Countdown; Capture-The-Flag; Base Assault;Escort-The-Tank; Liberation; Tug-Of-War...and so many more. This is a Game that is STILL ALIVE and it is recommended to all FPS game lovers. Even after Gamespy shutdown and EA stop developing more Medal Of Honor Series there is still Big Communities Doing all their best to Keep this game alive, by providing Master Server&apos;s List; Improvement Patches and Anti-Cheats. There are alot of server&apos;s and players online.

Constant problems with environment disappearing for some reason, I was unable to spot enemies huge amount of time. Don&apos;t play it on Windows 10.</span>

(say Omaha ^^) But the second time was just unbelievably horrible! The first few missions are fun, because it is just a bunch of average FPS levels, but after that every mission gets worse. (I know that, because a finally completed the game to find out how I could be so wrong) I can only repeat what Andrew H. said. This game is technically soooo bad! If you want an example of bad game design then this game is all you need, because every gameplay killer and any mistake a designer can make is here! Ever heard of cheating AI? Respawning enemies? Enemies looking through walls? Enemies spawing at positions that you have already cleared or behind you after you move through an invisible lines? (triggers) It is all here! And more! As I said, the first missions are okay, but later on you can clearly see that the designers really had no idea what to do anymore to keep it fun. So they decided to spawn ENDLESS (seriously) amounts of enemies in the later levels just to make it more challenging and to prevend players from finishing the game too quickly. (or at all) On the later levels I found it way easier to just run through all of the enemies without shooting too much, because if every enemy respawns within milliseconds there is just NO way to win in a fight. But nevertheless it is always more a matter of luck than skill if you manage to survive a mission, because the difficulty gets ridiculously high later on. And on top of that there is that particular stealth level that is without any doubt one of the (maybe &quot;the&quot;) worst levels ever been released in a PC game. It&apos;s really no fun at all if you have to literally save/load every 5 meters because you have to sneak past a bunch of soldiers, with absolutely unpredictable/buggy line of sight. I really have no idea how I could like that game when it came out ... guess I was young and easily manipulated by that hype around that game that was going on at the time, because this is just a piece of junk and a total waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=412252">Expand</a></span>

People say this game is realistic? Yeah sure, and Unreal Tournament is realistic too. Just the fact that the enemy A.I. can take a few bullets through the head ticks me off even more. Also where is the blood? I don&apos;t even think they are trying, I know they are trying to keep the game open to everyone, but come on, at least add a little red somewhere. I Think the only reason why people like this game is because of the hype. If it wasn&apos;t so heavily advertised and didn&apos;t have other PSX games to back it up, i&apos;m sure people wouldn&apos;t be giving this peace of crap such a high score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=367821">Expand</a></span>

The single player was fantastic for its time, its treatment of DDay was better than any game had done before it, but it&apos;s online that this game shone far beyond anything else at the time, for me at any rate.  The multiplayer maps are extremely well designed and as far as I know it was one of the earlier games to incorporate lean in multiplayer.  The weapons are well balanced, with a strong emphasis on skill.  Sure, go the SMG, spray your heart away, you&apos;ll get some lucky kills, but nothing feels better than nailing someone across the map, leaning out of cover, with a sightless Kurz.  More than any other multiplayer FPS I have played it came down to how fast and how accurate you were.  I pumped more hours in to this game online over a five to ten year period than I probably did all others combined.  An amazing game.  I only wish there were still active servers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=3992422">Expand</a></span>

I wanted to play the older one first, and it really worked on my win7 system :) :
<br>The KI is very unrealistic, sometimes very stupid and sometimes they shoot unrealistically well, even through bushes. There is a sniper mission that is frustratiing. The most missions are very linear, only the last mission is a bit free. Look at Far Cry, this is how it shall be done. The near fog is annyoing, especially if you could see further with your sniper. The last point is granades: It could be better to have just one hotkey to throw a granade, in this game you need to chage weapon and you have a break between it. So in the time maybe you dont want to throw anymore. In addition the detonation is very weak. So I didnt use it often.
<br>
<br>The good side? The missions are very different. Only the stealth mission was weak, because you could kill everything too. I appreciate, that all the missions were real operations from the 2nd world war. It is very interesting to search for more informations about the operations in real life. The atmosphere is top too, no one will every forget the normandy mission.
<br>I like it, when you dont need to invest a lot of time to get to know all of the game, in this case 6-8 hours, maybe a bit too few, but better then 15 hours and the gameplay is repetitive.
<br>
<br>Result: Surely a top shooter at the release date. But nowadays there are some outdated gameplay mechanisms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=6214378">Expand</a></span>

Bear in mind that this was 2002, before Battlefield 1942 and COD. Only a few months behind the likes of Halo. With a story contributed to by Steven Spielberg this game works out as the Saving Private Ryan movie tie in most of us dreamed of.
<br>
<br>By far the most iconic mission on offer is the Omaha Beach level. An almost direct recreation of the scene in Saving Private Ryan and here its pulled off well. The player struggling to navigate past machine gun fire and tank traps, over hearing conversations of other soldiers struggling to survive.
<br>
<br>Aside from this,  the submarine pen mission also stands out. As an officer of the OSS, you must infiltrate a submarine base, get a disguise and sabotage some equipment. You have to show your papers to guards and avoid other officers who might recognise you.
<br>
<br>Whilst the graphics are a bit dated most of the sound effects are very well done. This games Thompson submachine gun has this great bassy punch to it  that will forever keep it near the top of my most favoured video game weapons. Alongside this most of the voice acting is great and soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is superb.
<br>
<br>Naturally for a game so old there are still many flaws. Here we still have healthbars, which aren&apos;t inherently bad but also make some of the level design harder. Several times I&apos;d get checkpointed with exceptionally low health meaning I&apos;d go into my next firefight and repeatedly die in one shot. Some might say this makes it gritty and realistic but to be honest its just more frustrating. This was particularly noticeable on one level where you are sneaking through a ruined town and need to counter-snipe several enemies. However, because of the draw distance and some of the foliage it was impossible to work out where some enemies were until they shot you. If you had lost too much health prior to this section you would have to memorise the location all the snipers and perfectly take them out. Otherwise you&apos;d have to constantly quicksave after doing a section perfectly. Both killed the immersion for me.
<br>
<br>Interestingly the enemies skill increases as you go through the game, early enemies often bumping into you and needing to cock their weapons whilst later you will face hyper accurate stormtroopers. Sadly the difficulty was only really altered through increased accuracy, reaction time and damage. Most of the missions, particularly the bunker missions gave no opportunity for enemies to demonstrate any flanking manoeuvres.
<br>
<br>There is no multiplayer available but from what I remember it was moderately fun. On another minor issue note, playing through origin every second attempt at starting the game up it would crash. Very weird.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think that  this game still warrants playing (if you can get it working) for some of the level design and sound effects in particular. Naturally CoD and Battlefield have gone on the dominate in the War shooter arena but there are still a few things that MoH can teach the grand children in terms of story telling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=7686793">Expand</a></span>

Storming Omaha</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">So what we have here is a game that&apos;s had almost entirely positive feedback, but from the get-go, I found myself frustrated and slightly disappointed, and continued to be throughout the campaign.
<br>
<br>What this game does do well, however, as nearly all classic Medal of Honor titles do, is create stunning settings and depicts the battlefields of the war with great detail.
<br>Storming Omaha Beach while seeing men around you die like they&apos;re nothing more than squishy flesh (because that&apos;s exactly what they are) really helps put you in the mindset of what such a thing was like. Sure, the game is old and graphically outdated, but it doesn&apos;t change anything with how well-done the presentation is. Also along with the territory of Medal of Honor comes its fantastically fitting soundtrack, which enhances the whole experience of playing.
<br>
<br>Gunplay is fairly well-done. Using the Springfield to snipe is incredibly powerful and satisfying. The gunshot sounds and animations are also crafted nicely.
<br>
<br>However, where I feel this game is the most disappointing, if not just outright frustrating is its difficulty.
<br>I&apos;m all for challenging games that make the player think and practice, believe me, but when the difficulty is nothing more than pure jank or unrealistic, it gets tiring and infuriating.
<br>I have two main problems with the way this game handles difficulty; the most consistent one being enemy spawns.
<br>It&apos;s not enemy placement, no. It&apos;s spawns. An area that is completely clear one second can, and will be infested with enemy soldiers as soon as you move up, even if you&apos;ve already cleared it out, and there are NO entrances into the spot except through the front.
<br>In the very first mission, I was clearing out a room while looking for my objective (to destroy some equipment, etc). I had cleared every other room out prior, and this was my last one. As soon as I destroyed them, turned around to leave and was standing in the doorway, waiting for the inevitable enemies to approach me as I was hearing footsteps, I get shot from... behind?? Wait, what?
<br>As a long-time fan of Medal of Honor, I&apos;ve come to expect a bit of jank here and there, since I grew up playing Frontline and even Rising Sun many times, but I don&apos;t recall this much nonsense occurring, or at least not as consistently as it is here.
<br>
<br>My second issue regarding difficulty is that the enemy just.. either seems to know where the player is at all times, OR doesn&apos;t have any clue of what&apos;s going on. I either get shot as I walk through a doorway before seeing an enemy, or I kill a soldier, and the one walking by somehow doesn&apos;t even notice.
<br>There is no in-between.
<br>
<br>This issue is compounded by the level design. it feels like it&apos;s set up so that the player will get shot, all the time, no matter what, and with enemies that always know you and your squad&apos;s position. There are few flank routes, and the ones that do exist are made nearly irrelevant by enemies that turn and snap to you as soon as you get around them, so you might as well have just not tried to get behind them in the first place.
<br>
<br>Bringing up the player&apos;s squad, however, Allied Assault does a fantastic job at making sure your NPC followers actually assist in fighting. The player is not the only one getting kills, and this was massively refreshing for me to find in this game.
<br>A small caveat about the allies that accompany the player is, well, it&apos;s pretty easy to get blocked by one of them when trying to get to cover, since they&apos;re completely solid and are impossible for the player to pass through. Minor issue, of course.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say that I inherently recommend this title to anyone other than die-hard Medal of Honor fans or WWII shooter fans.
<br>
<br>Thankfuily, the good parts of the game are enjoyable enough to push many of the players through its campaign, and if we include the additional expansions that came out for the game (included in the War Chest edition of the game), there&apos;s quite a bit of content for players to go through, which is a nice and hefty plus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/user-reviews?user_review_id=7691970">Expand</a></span>
