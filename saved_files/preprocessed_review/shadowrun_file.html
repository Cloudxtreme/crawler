Poor/awkward controls (autoaim on a PC game?!) really hurt the accesibility of the game, and that means less enjoyable. Cross platform remains a neat idea, but simply isn&apos;t implemented well yet, but we&apos;re only 2 games in. Windows Gold remains a ripoff since PC games mp has always been free, but at least the game looks pretty nice.</span>

But nooo &quot;What the hell is that? I have to PAY to play? I didn&apos;t know this was an MMO... &quot; So I played singleplayer instead.. And I&apos;m all like.... Hey, this is just a bad version of Counter Strike: Source... With Magic.... and Trolls... On fire... But really now... In singleplayer the rounds are too short... You can only fight for up to six round.. or something like that. And thats not long enough to get all the money for the powers you need. The fact that there is no Deathcam makes for a boring wait for someone to res you. And the maps were just boring. If it was cheaper, and didn&apos;t suck so hard in singleplayer... I might recommend you get it, if not, then just get Counter Strike or Counter Strike: Source. (By the way, Steam is free, and better, in my opinion).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun/user-reviews?user_review_id=414994">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are muddy at best and to top it all off the game is an online-only multiplayer game with no splitscreen option. Second, as for the original fans, this game is Shadowrun in name only. Almost every ability included in this game stands in direct contradiction to the canon of the established IP, meaning every one of the restricted/prohibitted or otherwise impossible aspects in the original universe are standard fare in this game. So in conclusion if your a FPS fan pass this one up and wait for something better such as; The Darkness, Quake Wars, Crysis, Halo 3, Team Fortress 2 or any of the plethora of FPS on the horizon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun/user-reviews?user_review_id=398371">Expand</a></span>

Tech. new toys to play with and help you stay alive. 2. Magic. Abilities to help you kill your enemies. 3. Cross platform play. Now we PC gamers can show console fanboys how much better the mouse and keyboard REALLY are.</span>

Each weapon almost always wins in a certain situation, your goal is to pick that situation and play that role. Each class plays completely different, and different strategies are essential for playing with any of them. For example, Trolls, are powerhouses, but dwarves are the anti-troll. Everything seems to have its place and its use. This game reminds me of halo in the sense of I have about as much fun while playing it as I did in halo 1. Really, I think its more like Counterstrike done right. I for one don&apos;t like coutnterstrike, although I see where its a good game, it just isn&apos;t fun for me to play. This iis deffinatley fun for my style of play. I especially like that the sniper rifle needs to be zoomed in to fire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun/user-reviews?user_review_id=400750">Expand</a></span>

This game takes lots of knowhow and tactics between you and your team. The mix of weapons, magic, and tech makes for a game that you will never be bored of. Only downside is that after this many years, there is now a low playerbase.</span>
