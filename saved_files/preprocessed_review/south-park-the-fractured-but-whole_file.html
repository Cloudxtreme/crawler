To be honest it felt rather rushed.
<br>As far as the game goes, it&apos;s pretty basic nothing extra, felt alright. The ally actions felt like a wast of time and very gimmicky.
<br>Although the game has many game breaking bugs. Frozen victory screens, lost items rendering some objectives not completable. The game&apos;s controls are terribly and randomly mapped to keys. The mouse was absolutely disregarded during the game&apos;s development. All cursors in game have to be picked up by a secondary cursor. This is a very ugly and lazy way of dealing with not spending on PC friendly or PC specific controls or UI. There were many cases where as you enter a new screen no matter which direction key you are holding during the transition it will move the character the way  it faces on the new screen until another button is pressed eg. exiting facing down, pressing left, character proceeds down.
<br>Asid from all of the the U-play connectivity is horrible. If you purchase anything in the game overlay you have to go pick up your newly acquired stuff from your toy box, when they could have been just easily unlocked from the UI where I found them in the first place, locked behind the U-play logo.
<br>Unfortunately the game does not live up to its asking price. You&apos;re probably better of watching the series or someone compiling a video of the cut-scenes. This game doesn&apos;t offer much satisfaction for being an interactive South Park episode...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7627644">Expand</a></span>

After level 9 you no longer gain artifact slots so the difficulty of the game jumps as you can no longer get more powerful but the npc&apos;s do making each fight a long drawn out slog fest. At the end of the day it&apos;s just not that fun and in games fun should be the first priority. Also all the comedy is just fart jokes, very little else. Add in forced uplay even with steam, denuvo which was cracked day 1 so it only hurts people who bought it and content that was removed for dlc..... I just can not recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7629699">Expand</a></span>

The first had clever jokes, even if they were based in absolute crass humor.  This game seems to try too hard to force some of the jokes, so I kept finishing quests and finding myself going &quot;hmmm... ok, I guess... let&apos;s see where this goes... and if it gets funny again.&quot;  A few times it did and I found myself laughing out loud at some points.  Others, I would just force myself through to the next story and quest in search of the laughs of the first game.
<br>
<br>Combat was not as good as I wanted, being granted powers (each have 3 moves and 1 finisher). Costumes are just that, costumes that are cosmetic only.  No weapons, they&apos;re powers now so no weapons to buy, you purchase augments that boost your power rating.
<br>The ending was too fast and didn&apos;t have the epic build-up the first game had. No bang, it ended almost on a whimper.
<br>
<br>I found myself wandering around the map far more often than the first and the fast-travel spots were harder to reach making you travel further to get to spots.  I didn&apos;t enjoy the economy as much as the first, you want to keep almost everything and sell nothing so I didn&apos;t like the progression of the economy.  I didn&apos;t really care about searching vendors for new items, until crafting health items became a must.  For some reason, I didn&apos;t enjoy the costumes as much as the SoT game, for some reason the majority of the costumes for this game are boring or plain and I found myself only wanting to wear 2 or 3 of them, the rest just didn&apos;t do it for me.
<br>
<br>This was the first time in a SP game that at a point in the story, I had to put the controller down and say to the screen, &quot;no, I don&apos;t want to do that&quot;.  They force you to do a thing that is absolutely completely opposite of what I would think of in a SP game, and they don&apos;t justify it, don&apos;t explain it.  It&apos;s like the last part of the game is a fever dream that barely makes sense and each scene smash-cuts into the other with almost no rhyme or reason.  I was scratching my head at why the story was evolving this way.  So I was more confused than anything at the ending when the credits hit.  No sense of accomplishment compared to the first.
<br>
<br>I want to like this game, but it made it very hard to do so.  I&apos;m going to play through again to see what I missed, but my first impression after 20 hours of play is &quot;??!?&quot;, which means a 5/10 for me.
<br>
<br>Also, this game requires U-play DRM always online, or you can&apos;t play.  **** that, I had my internet go out when I had time to play and was locked out of my $60 game for 3 hours because of U-play, even though I&apos;ve set up my Steam for Offline if that happens.  So **** U-play and always online DRM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7624409">Expand</a></span>

For one the game is very glitchy. Luckily you can save at any time and reload and that fixes most issues. I will often find myself unable to move after climbing a ladder or walking in a certain area. I have had music not stop after a scene forcing me to close the entire game. I had a cut-scene freeze and I had to reload.
<br>
<br>The leveling system leaves me wanting. I understand the whole idea that you want people to make costumes but making gear useless seems like a step back. It would be been better to just have a cosmetic override like some MMOs do so that gear could be a thing. I also miss the ability to level up and customize my powers like in stick of truth. In this game you unlock more classes as you go and you can just change class and mix and match your powers. Basically you just change your loadouts. While it gives versatility I don&apos;t feel like I am growing in power and by being able to switch classes whenever I want I feel the replay value won&apos;t be there.
<br>
<br>I have mixed feelings about the combat. My biggest issue is the balance. Battles seem to be either I am not even touched or I barely survive with multiple item use. The fact that they now make items use take a full turn vs a free action in the first game further disrupts the balance. They also incorporated a tactics like grid system for battles but your characters can only face east and west. So if your characters have moves that are in a line you cant go below or above and enemy and face them to use your skill. This often leads to having multiple people in a line or skipping turns outright because there is nowhere to stand to do a move. This could have been fixed with incorporating being able to face any direction but taking more damage from the rear, incorporating a blocking/dodge system and your block/dodge chance is 0 from behind, etc.  I do like how your characters actually feel like they have powers vs just play fighting in the first one.
<br>
<br>It does seem like they just reused the same map from the first game and added/changed a few things. Some of it does feel a bit lazy. Maybe it was the developer change or maybe I expected too much from this game. Or maybe as I get deeper into the game the game itself will get deeper.  Don&apos;t get my wrong I enjoy the game. I like the increased number of party members to choose from and playing with ones I didnt think I would use because I like other characters better in the show but in the game they are just too op (looking at you captain diabetes) that I can&apos;t not use them.
<br>
<br>My recommendation would be if you love South Park, love the Stick of Truth, don&apos;t care about saving money, and have been waiting over a year for this you can buy it now.  Otherwise I would suggest giving it some time for patches to clean up the glitches. I also think it could go on sale around Black Friday.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7615367">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Turn based, grid combat is good. However is very repetitive and all combats feels the same. All the status are also equal, bleeding, on fire, grossed out, etc.. the only difference is that you need a different item to fix them. I passed all combats using the same tactics, I don&apos;t feel like it matters which character you choose in your party or with whom are you fighting.
<br>
<br>Bugs are everywhere. They are not game breaking bugs but all of them combine are annoying. I have to repeat the tutorial three times because the game crashed because the stupid Uplay connection error. Sometimes the controls doesn&apos;t work after a cutscene, sometimes is the mouse control that get stuck after opening the overview mode thingy,
<br>
<br>Minigames are lame. I still don&apos;t understand why do you need to poo in every toilet, there is no significant reward. And the same goes for the rest of the items that you find around. The only thing you need is money and that is only for the cosmetic collectible; which by the way can&apos;t have all if you are not in the Ubisoft club for retards. There is also crafting that you need to be better at to get other collectibles. Again, there is no point in crafting anything other than grinding for nothing. The selfies doesn&apos;t do anything either, just a bit of XP.
<br>
<br>The thing is that the premise of the game is great. It has great characters, the superhero theme is fantastic. It could be so much better game and I have wet dream thinking on a Marvel vs DC turn based game; sort of like X-COM but X-MEN where you need to build your base and get mutants and shlts for everybody and your base.  But the execution of this game is terrible, all the stupid work like breaking stuff that you have done many time before so you have to wait time and past to the next room. I get it, I need to move the stupid yellow ladder AGAIN to climb something. Is like loosing time so the game itself can tell that is not 10h long, &#xA1;but 20 hours long!.
<br>
<br>Summarizing, get fukc. Go play something else. Divinity OS II was amazing for example, your money is much better invested there. (Not to mention, 60&#x20AC; for at best 20h long crap, ha!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7633832">Expand</a></span>

WATCHING the game being played it did have some funny parts. Maybe 50% of the jokes fell flat though. SOT was light years funnier and more fun to play. I feel like Ubisoft ruined this game and loaded it full of cancer like day one DLC and whatever this forced Ubiclub stuff is. Total cancer guys. I can&apos;t believe Matt and Trey allowed that seems more like something they should have been making fun of in games. That would&apos;ve generated some laughs. Lots of missed joke opportunities here which was disappointing. I ended up getting a full refund from Steam thankfully and just watched a full playthrough on youtube. Much better watching it than having to do all those fetch quests to get to the decent parts. I was bummed that this game was a dud been looking forward to it for a year now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7617958">Expand</a></span>

Wait for a sale for this one because its just not that good. Certainly not &#xA3;50 good.

<br>Game could be fun, if it worked, but at the time of this review, it&apos;s a day after release, and I find myself spending far more time waiting for the game to load than anything else, whether it&apos;s minutes on end at load screens or reloading the game completely after a crash.
<br>
<br>Glitchy is an understatement for the condition of this game that has been hidden under multiple layers of already cracked copy protection. This game is working less than half the time and in about 8 hours of fighting with it, I made it through maybe the first two hours of actual gameplay and the glitches have just gotten to the point that it&apos;s virtually unplayable from there.
<br>
<br>With all this in mind, I would give it a 1, but because what little bits I can get to work show it to have promise as a potentially fun game and it seems to be working on some machines it is getting bumped up to a 3. I can&apos;t give it any better in it&apos;s current trainwreck of a condition, though, and because of it&apos;s horrible release condition, it&apos;s just going to have swallow this score in it&apos;s user averages, because I don&apos;t mean to redo this review later, if they fix it. My potential love for this game has already been utterly tainted.
<br>
<br>Update: It&apos;s working, mostly, now, after getting a workaround (as opposed to a real fix) for my problems but still has it&apos;s glitchy and lock-ups behavior and is pretty grueling to actually play. Could be fun. Probably will be fun, if one buys the whole game, but I&apos;m going to weight this final score strongly based on the DLC, exclusives, multiple layers of DRM, original headaches, etc., even though, if I could overlook all those, it is shaping up to be almost as good as the first, which due to it&apos;s lack of headaches with Obsidian at the helm, I rated much higher in the reviews I did give.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7616430">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The beginning and middle is just that, the clean room you can play in and the ending? You open the closet and stuff  falls on you, its like swimming in tar, not fun just tedious. The ending is so rushed (they just pound you with stuff left right and center) and despite that it drags way to long ( you will know how it ends way before the ending).
<br>
<br>There are also other odd decisions for this game, for example costumes are just a flavor thing, no weapons, when you do the &quot;puzzle&quot;  as in &quot; use your follower to do X&quot; it starts a cut-scene, fun and cute at the beginning but when you have to chain 3 or 4 of them in one go? this drags to much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7625986">Expand</a></span>

These people posting reviews 6 hours into the game miss one of the biggest point to be made - it starts off slow but the customization and amount of things you can do increases exponentially as the game progresses (summons, augments, characters can combo ultimates to make new ultimates, you can combine all classes and swap abilities in and out each fight etc.) I saw someone say the mechanics were weak but I think people are missing out on the fact that it&apos;s a tactics game first and an rpg second, that being said it still offers plenty of rpg content and customization that isn&apos;t just gear based you just need to unlock it. A lot of fine details in the environments for fans of the show, touching moments, a well written story (although intentionally silly cause South Park), and overall is the funniest f***ing game I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>
<br>The combat follows a MegaMan BattleNetwork style which I absolutely loved being such a huge fan of those titles, the character interactions are great and each combination of playable heroes has their own banter during the fights.
<br>
<br>The side-quests kicked it up a notch from Stick of Truth aswell - often continuing on during your play-though of the main story with really brilliant payoffs.
<br>
<br>If you are an impatient little baby wanting extreme action and the funniest jokes you&apos;ve ever heard in your life within the first 15 minutes then yeah, you will be disappointed.
<br>I have yet to experience a single bug my entire playtime as well so I do not know where this is coming from either.
<br>
<br>I felt I needed to defend this game cause even though there is Ubisoft cancer all over it, there is a brilliantly designed, well crafted game with a lot of heart put into it from South Park Studios.
<br>
<br>The Uplay is optional, doesn&apos;t help gameplay in the longrun, and you get an assassin&apos;s creed outfit? Why would anyone be upset missing out on this, I run around the game with a bra on my head and it&apos;s great, who cares? it&apos;s south park.
<br>
<br>I love this game, it&apos;s better than stick of truth by a long shot but even on the hardest difficulty it&apos;s very easy to cheese the combat if you are attentive enough.
<br>
<br>Please trust my review I have been a long time south park fan and gamer and I&apos;d like to think I was a rather credible source on the matter. If you like south park and tactics games get this immediately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7621606">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>South Park has so many gags and references in it&apos;s repertoire that it&apos;s pretty unfair to it&apos;s competitors.
<br>
<br>That being said, there are some things dragging the game down. The ubisoft club system is pretty in your face from the get-go and there is something that the original stick of truth had that Fractured but whole simply doesn&apos;t. It&apos;s just not as free-roaming as the original that had the gall to let you play the game in pretty much any order you wanted, with side-quests up the wazoo.
<br>
<br>With that out of the way, Fractured But Whole completely revamps the combat system to the better. Much better. Combat is extremely enjoyable, and the allies too. Even though with it&apos;s savory price-tag, I can safely recommend the game if you have the money to spend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7607635">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well, this &quot;game&quot; is even worse than the worst episodes. It&apos;s like, one big fart joke with no substance, with, as another reviewer mentioned:
<br>- $100 price tag for full game
<br>- day 1 DLC
<br>- multiple layers of DRM (Steam, Uplay, Denuvo)
<br>- microtransactions

All humor was flushed down the toilet, no, seriously all 99.9% of humor consists of farting jokes. And those who made the game must be forcibly put in lunatic asylum. Not only that they everywhere arranged children&apos;s pornography, so still periodically put a hamster in the ass of a 12 year old child. And this happens every 10 minutes of the game. Absolutely all puzzles are solved exclusively by farting and stuffing something in the ass. I wonder whose idea it is? Two **** (Trey and Matt) or Ubisoft San Francisco and South Park Digital Studios LLC? If you are crazy perverts, then leave it to yourself. You need to see a doctor, not make  games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7629701">Expand</a></span>

So few steps ahead, few back. if i had to choose id rather get Stick of truth, but this one is still a good game. Id give it 7.5/10, round up to 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7630984">Expand</a></span>

<br>They tried not to copy the first game and changed almost the whole progression system. In SoT it was a classic RPG system with skills and perks you can upgrade. Now it&apos;s a class system where you have 3 skills and one ultimate for each class, but throughout the game, you unlock new pals with new skills and new classes for yourself. Also, your clothing doesn&apos;t affect your stats at all now, it&apos;s just visual. Actually, that is pretty interesting. I think developers wanted you to make your own superhero costume that you like and give you an ability to stick with it to the end of the game, cause superheroes doesn&apos;t change costumes every day or something like that. All in all, I liked the Stick of Truth system more, but I appreciate the devs attempt to make some real changes.
<br>The story though was really damn interesting. There is a Megaton of references, jokes and satire all over the game. And what is the most important, humor hits the right spots and is very up-to-date, considering our society nowadays.
<br>There are some pretty boring fetch quests and I totally recommend to skip them, cause all the main and secondary quests are great and entertaining. I haven&apos;t had so much fun in a game for a long time, actually. You know, the feeling when you just don&apos;t want something to end. That&apos;s what I felt going through the main story. Also, devs were really trying hard to make battles diverse and put a whole lot of different special objectives and conditions to them at almost every stage of the game.
<br>My main complaints are:
<br>1) you can&apos;t fast travel from any spot on the map and running through the town gets boring pretty soon.
<br>2)devs a little bit overcomplicated the puzzle system and sometimes it gets tedious to wait for a scanning or an animation to end.
<br>In the end, I think the game is amazing and you are going to have really good time playing it. I hope there will be another one in the near future, cause, damn, I liked The Stick of Truth and The Fractured but Whole a LOT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7626450">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are a few dialogue bugs I must admit but I have almost completed the game and it has only crashed once. I get no black screen like some steam users are saying they get but then again I have the Uplay client and not the steam version installed.
<br>
<br>Games humour is very funny and the combat is not just one turn you, one turn your enemy like the stick of truth, it is mixed with obstacles and moving danger zones etc makes the game combat more epic as you rank up XP and move along the world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7632167">Expand</a></span>

<br>This time you play once again as the new kid as the children of south park split into a civil war over who&#x2019;s super hero franchise will make the most money..
<br>The game starts with letting you choose 1 of 3 classes, though your class isn&#x2019;t as important as it may seem in the beginning as the story progresses you&#x2019;ll be able to add more classes and pick and choose your 4 moves to bring into battle&#x2026;
<br>The game takes place once again ins south park, this time around south park to me felt less alive, and much more of a video game hub world.. As it along with the story missions themselves are less varied&#x2026;
<br>since your character stats are attached to artifacts this time that you plug into your DNA strand... exploration felt less necessary if I wasn&#x2019;t interested in new cosmetics that added nothing to the battle system&#x2026;
<br>Artifacts are obtained from fights and leveling up, and can be crafted from recipes you buy or find in chests&#x2026;
<br>Crafting is where exploration comes into play the most as you have to craft consumable items to use in battle, but again I didn&#x2019;t need consumables too often so this didn&#x2019;t entice me to explore.. I had plenty by just opening the occasional chest id notice while playing through this 17 hr. story&#x2026;
<br>improved over the stick of truth in my opinion are the jokes as they&#x2019;re much more current and less inside jokey like the stick of truth&#x2026;
<br>if you have a twitter you&#x2019;ll be in on all of this games jokes..
<br>speaking of social media, doing tasks and leveling up will let you take selfies with characters to gain coonstagram followers, this will also help level you up as will fighting and collecting to open more slots for artifacts&#x2026;
<br>I also like level progression more this time as you&#x2019;re not switching through different modes.. You&#x2019;re just scanning an item and calling in the right character you help you progress&#x2026;
<br>Different this time is while the game is still turn based...
<br>instead of feeling like Pok&#xE9;mon, there is a grind based combat system that I&#x2019;m not a fan of
<br>I like that in the grids there are red zones warning you something is about to happen and you have to try your hardest to move your party out of that zone..
<br>But when it comes to playing with the grid, things just get overly complicated with the different rules of each characters different move and sometimes larger characters are had to tell which grid they&#x2019;re on
<br>every character in south park feels unique. All with their own attacks with different status attacks, but the direct and space they can attack just get confusing which had me canceling, moving and checking, until I positioned them in a spot I could attack my enemy&#x2026;
<br>Most of the characters are pretty straight forward, but a few are definitely awkward to deal with&#x2026;
<br>Farts are also a part of combat this time as you can use them to skip an opponent&#x2019;s turn or pause time for some free damage&#x2026;
<br>There&#x2019;s also a meter that fills up as you take damage.. Filled fasted if you can recover some health by pressing x when you&#x2019;re attacked... and this allows you to pull off a super move that can do massive damage to one character or light damage to all characters but with status effects for example&#x2026;
<br>but I felt matches were a little too unpredictable in story as new characters would come into the fight frequently.. Never really letting you know how close to the end you are... so id hold onto these moves a lot of the time never getting to use them&#x2026;
<br>The best part of this game is easily in its character&#x2026; the story is ridiculous and the writing is great&#x2026;
<br>the grid based combat is good.. but it&#x2019;s not great like the turned based combat in the stick of truth&#x2026;
<br>the game does sequel bait, and if the game stays turn based, I have in the next one they go back to the style in the stick of truth&#x2026; both in combat and variety in the delivery of the story&#x2026;
<br>I give South Park The Fractured But Whole

<br>
<br>No idea how they could screw up this bad when they delayed the Game by this much.
<br>
<br>Here is my opinion why the Game doesn&apos;t give me as much fun as the first one :
<br>
<br>- The Toilet minigame is annoying.
<br>- you don&apos;t feel any progression (gear/custom doesn&apos;t give any bonus, only those artifacts)
<br>- the fighting system is a big step down and just stretches the game because of the lacking content.
<br>- the first game didn&apos;t have any dlcs or season pass and delivered way more fun.
<br>- It&apos;s totally not worth the full price, considering you most likely have to get the dlcs you&apos;re better of with waiting several months till the price drops.
<br>
<br>Good things :
<br>
<br>- It feels smooth and i don&apos;t have any problems with fps or stutters.
<br>- The concept is a nice idea combined with the old fighting and gear system, i&apos;d be hella fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7637363">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My only complaint about the Fractured But Whole is that it is $60 and I finished the game in 16 hours. I think a story game worth $60 should be at least 30 hours, like Witcher 3 and a lot of other games. If this game was $30 I would be fine with that but definitely not $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7638848">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Breakdown:
<br>
<br>Positives:
<br>1. Some great summon cut-scenes
<br>2. a few exceptional gaming moments.
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>1. Buggy as hell. Battle engine stalls out forcing you to load, game hangs on black screens, etc.
<br>2. Really stupid and time consuming puzzle powers that must be used repeatedly.
<br>3. City of South Park feels like a dead joke in this game.
<br>4. inconsistencies with world map enemies and plot progression
<br>5. Weak characters and weak story
<br>6. Long periods that are quite boring
<br>7. Not near as funny as it is long if you play the whole thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7641663">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s one long battle after another at the same setting and this is hideous. At TSOT there were many different fun environments like the alien ship, sewers, gnome cave, inside of Mr. Slave etc. Also battles and puzzles were nicely balanced. This one is a series of never ending, boring long battles with little humor. Also puzzles require no intelligence at all, you just have to identify an object, call the right buddy and it&apos;s done. The artifacts system was very confusing as well. And yet another issue, this game requires much much more GPU power. I played TSOT with no problems at all with my laptop, but with this one laptop sometimes overheated and shut down. Why such GPU power is needed for South Park graphics? In short, I&apos;m hugely disappointed, and I don&apos;t get those high scores the game receives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7671580">Expand</a></span>

I even re-watched all of the episodes before i bought the game. i&apos;m a massive fan.
<br>but this game.
<br>did the critics even play the same game as the rest of us? tame as all hell comedy, basically taking the farting from the last game and then just leaning right into that as the only thing you can do. no replay value because the game just gives you all the classes at the end. though it&apos;s cool how they present it, this kills the replay value of the game instantly.
<br>while the crafting is a good addition the attribute tree is unbalanced leveling holds no weight because everything is tied to the crafting system and your power loadout. it&apos;s like they&apos;ve taken COD&apos;s loadout system and tried to implement it into a rpg, and it doesn&apos;t work.
<br>Then there are the crippling bugs.
<br>Black screens of death
<br>cameras not loading properly and leaving you in selfie limbo
<br>completely shutting down twice.
<br>you have to back track for 5 hours until you finally get toolshed.
<br>just frustrating combat with healing items now taking a full action instead of a bonus action.
<br>battles that just drag out.
<br>yes, exploring mephesto&apos;s laboratory was a great part of the game and the choice presnted there was a grave and gut wrenching decision made glorious by gore and exellent voice acting. but tht decision ended up being made obsolete so quickly that there was no consequence to your action. all that for no return.
<br>your decisions have no real value to the ending as the writers obvioulsy ran out of time or just grew lazy. everything is retconned by the end so cartman suffers no ramifications and it is completely ungratifying and flys in the face of everything the show has done up to this point. there was no lesson. no, i learned something todays. no gay little speaches. just a cut to black and some exposition for some **** dlc which will effectively lock the true ending behind a paywall.
<br>
<br>what the hell, Trey and Matt? this game feels like a sell out. start to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/user-reviews?user_review_id=7682156">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have so so many hours in the game and I love every minute of it!
<br>You can customize your character at any time, craft costumes and stuff all for free with stuff you win in battles and gather in the world.
<br>I love its new battle mechanic with the grid, makes you think your every move. GET IT!</span>
