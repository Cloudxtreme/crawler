The gameplay isn&apos;t too bad but iit does lack the feel of a finished product. Many times you will click and click again just to get the game to respond - this is felt even in the intro screen. What worse is that the although new hex grid is a good move, the combos on it isn&apos;t. Except for the old frustration when your enemy blindly manages to get combo after combo from new games dropping in on the board (And this has been cranked up, get used to 5-10 combo moves) there&apos;s one real problem: While hacking gateways which is a timed mini-game, the game will happily waste your time dropping useless after useless combo while you frantically try to click that gem you need to move. Even if it isn&apos;t for the time stress you&apos;d still be clicking in frustration because there&apos;s no clear indicator of when the game releases the control back to you. I&apos;m going back to the PS3 version of the original game, at least that I can play with the game music turned off and enjoy it (which is a shame because both games have really great background tracks).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-quest-galactrix/user-reviews?user_review_id=422152">Expand</a></span>

Hacking is often criticised but the &quot;you have to wait for the gems to fall while the timer ticks down&quot; design is deliberate, and there to make you avoid cascades, which is just part of the tactical play of the game. It seems almost impossible at first but is easy once you get into the swing. Having said this, Galactrix is not as good as the first Puzzle Quest. Main problems are a less interesting story with relatively mundane characters. They&apos;re just not that interesting or well-written. The original game which had me in fits of laughter, but this one only got the occasional chuckle. Also, some ship modules are just way too powerful and should not have been included as they are basically an I-win button. And the game crashes periodically on both XP and Vista, which is just shoddy and unprofessional. Still, worth getting for your gem-matching fix, I would definitely still recommend it over Bejewled Twist - just don&apos;t expect too much from Galactrix and you won&apos;t feel let down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-quest-galactrix/user-reviews?user_review_id=422546">Expand</a></span>

For some reason, it seems they decided that even that was too complex, made the game slightly simpler, and infinitely less meaningful. The new grid is not necessarily a bad move, but while everything else dumbed the game down, the increased number of angles traded thought out strategy for dumb luck. And is it just me, or are the graphics significantly worse then the original? If this was the first Puzzle Quest game, I would have to applaud it based on the sheer strength behind the concept. As it is, it&apos;s the poor mans PQ:CotW. If you&apos;ve played neither, get the original. If your looking at Galactrix after playing the original, just go play the original again. Though not entirely bad, there no reason to buy this game when there&apos;s another option that&apos;s superior in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-quest-galactrix/user-reviews?user_review_id=423192">Expand</a></span>

At first I was a bit shaken by the new puzzle game mechanics, but after some time I grew accustom to them, and began to under stand why they changed the setup. The new system is provides the player with more options for strategic moves, not only can the piece move in 6 directions rather than 4, the way the pieces fall also changes. The big WOW moment was the first time i opened my galactic map, the number of systems is truly epic, each system with 3-6 &apos;planets&apos;. The only gripe I have with the game is the system to open jump gates. It requires you to match certain colors in a certain order, with a limited amount of time. Because of the time limit, it feels more like luck than skill. I found myself restarting the puzzle two or three times until I found one where the first 5 colors were easily matched.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-quest-galactrix/user-reviews?user_review_id=422084">Expand</a></span>

The actual puzzle bored was intresting as it actually made it intresting and kept you on your toes until the AI which im starting to think is just copied from game to game just plain out cheats. Starting thinking wow that was a lucky combo of bombs / shields together but after 6 matches it was just to plain obvious that the AI either knew what was next or was generating what it needed. Tbh the game is just boring but great if u love losing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-quest-galactrix/user-reviews?user_review_id=2092232">Expand</a></span>
