I must say Penumbra: Black Plague&apos;s story is not as exciting, but is still amazingly written, with more characters than its episodic predecessor (an amazing one that you actually meet in Overture), none of them feel as darling as Red, but no one can ever again. The story actually seems more coherent in this sequel, and the characters are certainly amazing, even so that you have trouble deciding whether or not to actually trust them, whether or not they&apos;re insane. Unlike in Overture, the gameplay is even better. Since the developers got a bunch of complaints about Overture&apos;s combat from misunderstanding critics, they completely left it out. That and the fact that enemies are one million, nine hundred eighty-four thousand, one hundred forty-seven times uglier than Overture&apos;s dogs make this game both far more brave and HOLY SHIT at the same time. I believe it seems to be a bit shorter than Overture, but both together allocate to about twelve hours of gameplay. With the lesser amount of combat (nada), the only thing Phillip can do is hide, and in some cases, run like Indiana Jones as he does from one of those cascading boulders. Some of the puzzles are also a tad more challenging than Overture&apos;s, but that actually makes them even better. Buy the whole package on Steam or something. It&apos;s amazingly cheap and while a bit short, it is an experience you will not soon forget. And remember: Overture first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=83970">Expand</a></span>

It might as well be considered one single game. The engine seems to be the same used in the first game, and most mechanics are identical. The atmosphere continues to be dark and creepy, with the addition of some new surprises that surface throughout. Everything is basically the same, with only the plot and storyline developing further. The one major improvement in comparison to Overture is the amount of thrills found in this iteration. There seems to be more action and more atmosphere overall, which makes the game more enjoyable, more creepy and a bit more scary. The story progression isn&apos;t as interesting or original as in the first game, but at least it has much more detail and much more depth. The voice acting also continues its high quality performances. Loading times are atrocious and much longer than in the first game, which tests patience. Some of the puzzles included in this game aren&apos;t as logical as in the first. The unintuitive puzzles are more complicated and mostly involve trial and error during a particular segment of the adventure. There are also more absurdly hidden items and mechanisms, which makes this game much more difficult in terms of its playability as an adventure game. There is also more interaction between the player and other characters in the story, which quickly dissolves the feeling of being a solitary person in a creepy and scary locale. The developers decided to get rid of the melee combat instances completely (found in the first game), which I agree is for the best and makes the game more tense and more fluid. There are way too many interruptions for plot development voice acting. Without ruining the experience with spoilers, I will say that these voice acting pauses occur almost at any given time, without a focus on storyline turning points. They can get a bit distracting at times. Not having the ability to engage your enemies in melee combat makes the game so much more tense and exciting. The ending is very good and adds to the story rather well. Penumbra: Black Plague is better than Penumbra: Overture in every way, as it corrected some of the developers&apos; mistakes and made the gaming experience more enjoyable as a whole. This is clearly the best adventure game I have ever played; totally exceeding Penumbra: Overture. Once again, the game runs a little bit short, but I suppose it is of adequate length after all, since it is an adventure game with lots of theme and mood. I am now looking forward to the third part in the series. It took me about 8 hours to complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=2087006">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But my major complaint is the voice of Clarence. In fact I&apos;m surprised it&apos;s not mentioned more often. Typically voice acting is something I would leave as a &quot;splitting hairs&quot; complaint, but the voice of this very fundamental character is so utterly wrong it almost ruined the experience for me. He sounds more like a character from a Warner Brothers cartoon from the 1950s than what his character is really supposed to be. Any time I began to really feel immersed in the otherwise intoxicating atmosphere, his voice would chime in, sounding like an anthropomorphic dog with a cigar hanging out of his mouth, and the entire illusion would be shattered.
<br>
<br>Additionally I would like to add that that the AI could have been better. Now, I don&apos;t deliberately go into a horror game looking for all the strings and ruining the illusion, but when I&apos;m supposed to be terrified of a monster that&apos;s supposedly looking for me but is instead stood stationary in a corner pointing it&apos;s flashlight at the wall, the fear very quickly subsides.

<br>Even so, there were enough genuinely terrifying moments, and sumpteous creepy atmosphere to make up for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115476">Expand</a></span>

So the second blew me away. Black Plague did everything Overture had accomplished and made it better, tweaking all the flaws from the first like the incredibly awkward combat. It also more then triples the scare factor of the game, replacing simple animals that were already dreadful with a horrifying new breed of danger. The game&apos;s story isn&apos;t going to win it an award by itself, and some people complain about the ending. I on the other hand, perhaps being a bit more flexible with plot, found the story memorable and thought provoking. Coupled with an atmosphere that is so dark, chilling and gripping that the game demands to be played fully emersed; at night, lights off. The graphics aren&apos;t amazing, but as the name of the series hints *Penumbra: The small area of light surrounded by darkness* , this is not so much about graphics as the lighting. The shadows easily hide the sins of the outdated graphics and while the lighting is amazing, it is rarely reassuring in the gritty, claustrophobic environment that is &quot;The Shelter&quot;. Coupled with some underrated script and voice acting, not to mention immersive sound that leaves you jumping at every little noise that goes &quot;bump&quot;, the game becomes a very frightening world for your character to explore, run and hide in. I bought this game for 5 dollars when it was on sale. Best 5 dollars ever spent. If you&apos;re a fan of horror, do not miss this game. The only reason I gave it a 9 out of 10 instead of a full out 10 is because the game isn&apos;t for everyone and it didn&apos;t smash down the definitions of adventure/puzzle games and set them anew. But it excels at what it sets out to do and creates not so much a game as more an experience, if not an utterly terrifying one. It&apos;s simply an amazing hidden gem in a sea of games. Not everyone will find it or even appreciate it, but that makes it all the more savoring for people like me who have discovered it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=84472">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are good - I am not much into adventure games but this must be my favourite First Person Adventure horror game of all time. It requires quite a bit of thinking, good story-line, and it is scary at times.</span>

<br>
<br>Whilst playing it the game always kept me on edge, especially with the eary music to add to it.

Only &#xA3;17 on steam, definatly worth a purchase.</span>

The sheer nail biting factor of these games is worth far more than the selling price. It reminds me of the first time I played System Shock 2 -- creepy noises, bloodstained walls, and creatures of the night all peeking over your shoulder ready for a snack.

                                        <span> Terrific game with a well thought out story. Dark and scary as hell. Game developers please play this and system shock2 for a week before you make your generic shoot 10000 bad guys and 500 aliens (in the later levels) in order to save earth from doom. It might spare us all from the same old tripe we&apos;ve had since doom was released. Oh and why no reader comments showing for this game yet?</span>

I have yet to play a game this scary. I almost couldn&apos;t finish it at certain points because I was so creeped out by it. The pacing is fantastic and though the plot is predictable you end the game feeling very fulfilled.

This game is actually frightening to play, given the atmosphere, and the fact that you&apos;ve nothing to defend youself with while enemies are charging in your direction. In a mass of flashy and empty blockbuster games that fill the shelves nowadays, this game brings gaming back to the day where games were deep and innovative. It is quite short, however. I took my time throughout the game, and finished a wee under 5 hours playing time. It is also by no means a technical achievement. While the graphics do well on their own, there&apos;s some parts where the lack of budget seems to show through. My only other complaint is that some of the puzzles are generic in the fact that they follow the overly used formula of conveniently placing needed items in the vicinity of a puzzle for you to find. Small complaints aside, this is one of those games that will leave a lasting impression on you, which is the kind of magic many high-budget titles have been failing to do over the last few years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=421651">Expand</a></span>

I had the opportunity of playing it with a Novint Falcon peripheral, where the realistic motions become physical movements. Black Plague is the best game in the Penumbra trilogy by far. The atmosphere is all-around creepy, and game ambiance will make you jump with every scrape or distant thud, and the integration of global lighting for shadows is superb. Hiding in a dark corner in an underground facility while an ominous grotesque figure down a hall walks toward you... terrifying. No way to fight, only to hide. Some moments near the end are truly unrivaled in suspense and terror. The graphics may be somewhat sub-par by today&apos;s standards, but any game developer that can inspire this kind of fear despite the graphics is a master of the art form. I really can&apos;t do it justice with words, so just play it. Any fan of horror games, or even someone looking for a scare will thoroughly enjoy this game.

I first tried out some games and then I started up the game. Well, I have to confess, I was way to frightened to continue playing after the first dog so I invited two of my friends over. We screamed in fear many times and laughed after it, we fell in love with the game, it&apos;s scary moments, it&apos;s atmosphere, the physics and the fantastic story. When we finally finished it we had to continue playing, so we bought Black Plauge. Black Plauge was so much more scary than Overture (that had been extremely scary itself) that sometimes we just took a pause to play CoD: WaW and get some breathing. We screamed, we laughed and we somewhat cried. We had experienced the best horror game created so far. We had experienced the fullest of the Novint Falcon. We had experienced real fear... Buy this game if you like puzzles or horror but to get the most out of it get the Novint Falcon too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=739943">Expand</a></span>

Admittedly I have not played the first game (Overture), but Black Plague picked up right away and did not leave me confused. The game&apos;s most notable feature perhaps is its incredibly effective spooky atmosphere and suspense. The dark, derelict areas, as well as the ambient music really do manage to absorb the player. Just as with one other game by this developer, Amnesia, there is no combat system, i.e. the player cannot attack the monsters in the game at all. The only means of survival are running and hiding. This greatly adds to the horror element and also makes it more realistic. The monsters themselves are somewhat scary-looking. To compensate for the lack of combat system, the interactivity with the items and environments is very good. The storyline is very interesting, and the main character&apos;s alter ego, Clarence, is in my opinion a very nice touch. I personally really enjoyed the puzzles too, in particular the final puzzle. Together with the philosophical message it tried to convey, it had a huge positive impression on me. Really well done. And the ending was simply amazing, perhaps even somewhat unexpected. Despite all these positive points, Black Plague&apos;s main con perhaps is that it is very short, and it&apos;s not like the game has much of a replay value either. This is pretty much the only reason that stops me from giving this game a 9. Otherwise I&apos;d highly advise any horror fan to try it out, at least once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=2055007">Expand</a></span>

In Black Plague, Frictional immediately shows signs of learning from Overture: the combat has been fixed i.e. removed; the writing and storytelling are both well-executed and heighten the sense of solitude and terror. The game starts off a bit rough, but once it gets going, Black Plague has a very effective atmosphere which is helped, not hindered, by the story elements. Long written notes have been removed and replaced with environmental storytelling, ensuring the game maintains a more effective flow than Overture. The story has also been improved, with a particular sequence near the end which proved to be one of the most effective twists I&apos;ve seen in a game. Overall, despite losing some of its predecessor&apos;s subtleties and a rocky opening, Black Plague is a vast improvement for the Penumbra series and will keep you engaged right until its concluding moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-black-plague/user-reviews?user_review_id=2487287">Expand</a></span>

We now have creatures and people lying around and the imersion it creates scares me a bit, also the puzzles are a lot more harder now but also funny.

It scared the beejezus out of me a few times as well.  The control interface was non-intrusive and easy to use.  Highly recommended.</span>

                                        <span>9.2 - Definitely one of the best stories if not the best in the survival-horror genre. Again, soundtrack, atmosphere and puzzles are great here just like in the first. The Penumbra series is without a doubt underrated.</span>
