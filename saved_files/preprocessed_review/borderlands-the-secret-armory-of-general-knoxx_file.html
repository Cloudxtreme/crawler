FPS will drop dramatically throughout about 50% of the levels which completely kills gameplay. The new weapons,areas, missions, and storyline are all great though. It would be the best DLC if only it were able to be played with a stable FPS.</span>

Unlike Zombie Island or Moxxi&apos;s Underdome, it is an extension of the main game that not only added two new vehicles and a load of new guns and enemies, it also added an additional 11 character levels and skill points, making it a better deal overall then any one campaign addon or ulitmate upgrade pack for the sequel. It was succeded by the largely inferior Robot Revolution, which while fun to play added nothing new to the table that the first three addons did. Most notably, Secret Armory introduces some actual narrative to Borderlands, which famously lacked much in plot or any character interaction whatsoever, due to some problems behind the scenes. It also introduced us to Athena, who while absent in the sequel would be upgraded to playable in the Pre-Sequel. If you only buy one addon for Borderlands 1, make it this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-secret-armory-of-general-knoxx/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507881">Expand</a></span>

Knoxx is just about everything great in Borderlands condensed into one DLC, and unlike Moxxie&apos;s Underdome and Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, actually delivers enough content to justify the price.</span>

I firmly believe that this DLC alone allowed Gearbox to capture what they could in the forthcoming Borderlands 2, as you can see with the much more fleshed out Lance Cavalry. Although there is the unfortunate exclusion of multiple fast travel networks in the DLC (which only having one), and the story not mainly focusing on a Vault-specific but loot-oriented ending, this still can plenty enough of your time and focus to forgive these. General Knoxx himself is quite humorous at times, being a more sympathetic villain towards you despite his permission for you to kill himself so he can get off this planet. With the new pearlescent weapons and perhaps the biggest loot area of any Borderlands DLC (1 or 2), you will constantly want to keep coming back to this DLC, and replayability is a big deal in my eyes towards DLC content. IF you want to keep playing back to this DLC, no matter how many of the main quests you completed or how high of a level you are, no matter it&apos;s faults it is damn well worth the try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-secret-armory-of-general-knoxx/user-reviews?user_review_id=3184369">Expand</a></span>

(I liked Claptrap&apos;s Revolution best). True to the core game experience, but with a few flaws.
<br>
<br>The most frustrating flaw for me was the lack of teleporting waypoints. The starting point/home base of this DLC is basically in the center of one long highway. You can go north or south for a long way to access missions, and the journey can become tedious. This is particularly true at maximum level when your vehicle is easily destroyed by the numerous other vehicles on the highway. (At high levels your power is substantial, but so is that of enemies, and vehicles don&apos;t seem to scale appropriately).
<br>
<br>The story overall is fairly good, and the quests are satisfying. The battle against the main enemy can be highly frustrating because of medics healing the boss. Overall, I&apos;m pleased that I bought this, but it is not quite as good as the base game, and after a few playthroughs of it, I&apos;m less than excited to do it again, even when I&apos;m happy to do the core game and claptrap again.
<br>
<br>Solid, but not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-secret-armory-of-general-knoxx/user-reviews?user_review_id=4004176">Expand</a></span>
