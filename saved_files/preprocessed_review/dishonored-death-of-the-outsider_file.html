If you liked Dishonored 2 then I would highly recommend this game. There certainly aren&apos;t levels as memorable as the clockwork mansion, however the levels now contain &quot;contracts&quot;, which have added a much needed dimension to the basic structure.
<br>
<br>Dishonored 2 had plenty to do in each level, but you had to go out of your way to find these extra side bits. With the death of the outsider, there is a new set of side missions given to you at the start of levels. These have waypoints and bounties, and in their own way are quite creative, yet simple. They act as a small detour from the main quest and are quite refreshing.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is much of the same, which in my opinion was always Dishonored&apos;s strongest point, the ability to tackle missions how you see fit. In my playthrough I have been quite brutal, killing any aggressors, but if you fancy a greater challenge, the non-lethal route would also prove rather satisfying.
<br>
<br>The sound, look and mood of the game hasn&apos;t changed from dishonored 2, which could be expected from a standalone release a year later. I would like to comment on the optimisation, which on release has been infinitely better than dishonored 2. I play on a Titan Xp and a 4790k, in 4k ultra settings, and the game hasn&apos;t dipped below 60 (with vsync on) a single time. Dishonored 2 took several months before patches brought it up to the same standard. Of course this should be expected from all developers, but bethesda haven&apos;t seemed to mind releasing their games and fixing them later, or having the community fix them. So i thought it was a point worth mentioning when they do something right.
<br>
<br>This game hasn&apos;t reinvented the franchise by any means, but it is a strong chapter in the series, with freedom and depth that the series is famous for. Would rate 8.5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/user-reviews?user_review_id=7516926">Expand</a></span>

<br>Improved gameplay in a just okay world
<br>Death of the outsider is a standalone expansion of dishonored 2 that seems to set out to end the story of this franchise...
<br>Here you play as Billie lurk, out to put an end to the outsider...
<br>aka the guy that gave everyone their fancy moves...
<br>Playing aggressively I beat this expansion in about 4 hours, so needless to say it&#x2019;s pretty lengthy for what it is as I&#x2019;m sure a pure stealth play through would double the size&#x2026;
<br>Billie brings her own set of skills to the table..
<br>you&#x2019;re still able to dash through the air like corvo, but she&#x2019;s able to get her Eliza Thornberry on and talk to rats to get clues on her task at hand, steal the identity of npcs to sneak pass guards, and freeze time to play as an orb of energy like in beyond two souls where you can go through cracks to spawn a point for you to teleport to
<br>also mark bone charms around to buff your characters stats
<br>you have a sword and bolts at your disposal for combat..
<br>And thankfully this time there are no skill trees...
<br>and I say thankfully because every ability is unlocked through story progression and this means that the game forces you to use abilities for level progression like I&#x2019;ve been suggesting the game does from the start&#x2026;
<br>This means even the most aggressive person like me isn&#x2019;t just going in there parrying and dodging bullets..
<br>I had to use my abilities to problem solve&#x2026;
<br>the world is crawling with targets of course and even contracts&#x2026;
<br>but unfortunately the world here in death of the outsider just isn&#x2019;t interesting to explore..
<br>It&#x2019;s probably the laziest design I&#x2019;ve seen in a dishonored game&#x2026;
<br>this is where this otherwise solid expansion is hurt the most...
<br>absolutely 0 memorable moments or levels&#x2026;
<br>the end of the outsider deserved a much better send off than what he&#x2019;s been given here&#x2026;
<br>I still had a decent amount of fun disarming traps and outsmarting enemies..
<br>especially once I unlocked the ability to blast enemies in the air with my sword
<br>and of course I love the fact the game goes the rout I&#x2019;ve always wanted with designing levels around abilities&#x2026; and as a result abilities being able to be used frequently without consumables attached
<br>but these levels are just a bore making death of the outsider a very forgettable experience&#x2026;
<br>if you&#x2019;re a dishonored fan of course pick it up to see what potentially is the end to this series&#x2026;
<br>but as a for stealth fans in general.. This if a very skippable standalone&#x2026;
<br>I give Dishonored Death of the Outsider
<br>a 6.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/user-reviews?user_review_id=7519462">Expand</a></span>

<br>The performance was solid too. I played on a 6700K and GTX 1070 rig and was able to get a fairly stable 120fps on ultra/very high settings, but it did dip to 110fps sometimes. Not a big deal at all, given the game isn&apos;t a multiplayer shooter.

<br>A unique revamp of Dishonored 2 which brings the story to a climax. The gameplay has been vastly altered in a way that is intimidating at first, but doesn&apos;t take long to get acquainted with. Maps are even more open-world than before, and abilities have been optimized.
<br>
<br>REDESIGN
<br>This game has gone through an overhaul for the character&apos;s arsenal. For one thing, the pistol is now pretty much non-existent. For another, you no longer search for Runes since you don&apos;t earn any new powers anymore. They&apos;re all given to you right at the very beginning.
<br>
<br>Dark Vision, Premonition, and Shadow Walk were all combined into one single ability called &quot;Foresight&quot;. Blink was replaced with &quot;Displace&quot; and slightly altered to allow for a few map-specific usages. A new ability named &quot;Semblance&quot; was introduced, which is an improved version of choking somebody unconscious as it also assumes their identity temporarily.
<br>
<br>Mana no longer exists. It has been replaced by &quot;Void Energy&quot;, which automatically replenishes to full.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>Similar to Dishonored 2, this game also has limited currency and ammunition is hard to come by. Bone Charms are sold in stores more often, and stores offer plenty of upgrades. You&apos;ll primarily be focused on using your three powers for the majority of the game.
<br>
<br>The maps are a lot more open-world now and the design of them forces you to assume a stealthier approach. You cannot go guns blazing as easily anymore as you will be killed very quickly. If you wish to make the most of your experience, try playing with pure stealth to utilize most of the character&apos;s arsenal and to give yourself a challenge.
<br>
<br>This sequel has five maps, and should take at least 10 hours to finish if you play stealthily.
<br>
<br>SUMMARY
<br>An interesting sequel to the series; Death of the Outsider attempts to optimize the game design while also offering more freedom to the player. Maps take longer to complete compared to past games, and easily punishes you for being careless. Overall, this game is a step above the second game, especially with the improved performance.
<br>
<br>I give this sequel a 9/10 for being pleasantly challenging. It is very satisfying to play as a silent assassin as you find yourself having to be more cautious about the actions you take. You can no longer simply rush through like you could with the previous games. The developers are moving in the right direction with the series by keeping it fresh with each iteration while trying to further stress the importance of stealth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/user-reviews?user_review_id=7524695">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dishonored 2: Take Back What&apos;s Yours.
<br>DOTO: Muh Victim Narrative.
<br>
<br>Ever wondered what would happen if you took every vibrant, bad ass character in the Dishonored universe and made them a broken sniveling two dimensional victim?
<br>
<br>DOTO follows Billie Lurk, an elite assassin who first came into her own in The Knife of Dunwall where she led a plan to unseat the master assassin Daud and become leader of his clan. Those expecting more incredible character development will be disappointed, because the writing team from the original series was thrown out and replaced with the dregs of second rate gender studies department. Thus Billie, the relentless, remorseless assassin becomes a mumbling, randomly (seriously, for no reason at all) disabled cardboard cut out with a dash of lesbian thrown in for extra repression points. We know she&apos;s a lesbian because there&apos;s all of two lines of dialog thrown in while staring at a line drawing of a woman. It&apos;s important, because it&apos;s not important at all.
<br>
<br>The Outsider, that brilliant dark being who mercilessly tormented the incredible hero Corvo and the twisted assassin Daud turns out to be a whimpering little boy who must be rescued from some incorporeal darkness. Charisma? Nah. Power? Nah. Because in this brave new world, even the most epic villain must also be a victim.
<br>
<br>Daud just... dies in the meh-est way possible. He was being held in a fighting ring in which he had won 78 fights according to the tally board, but as soon as Billie gets him out he keels over, I suspect simply to avoid being involved in the rest of this unrelenting cringefest.
<br>
<br>The story makes no sense, the levels are cut down from previous games and re-used in this game, so there&apos;s really only three or so. The &apos;new abilities&apos; everyone&apos;s foaming over aren&apos;t nearly enough to make up for the **** show - and for some reason the developers decided to give Billie basically all stealth abilities while making combat basically unavoidable.
<br>
<br>The only saving grace is that the game is over in a handful of hours, so at least you won&apos;t waste too much of your time on this PC takeover of what is one of the best franchises ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/user-reviews?user_review_id=7519178">Expand</a></span>

The story is incoherent put against its predecessors and the characters are flat. For 30 bucks you can complete this extension within six or so hours. A few scenes within the game were disturbing in its implications, such as The Outsider pinning Billie Lurk and forcing supernatural powers on them as Billie tries to fight them off.
<br>
<br>The levels were recycled from Dishonored 2 and felt uncreative. DOTO&#x2019;s small saving grace is Billie&#x2019;s powers are interesting, but not enough to call this game enjoyable. Other than that, Billie is this character with no real motivation, is directed by Daud (who is scarce within the game and dies off screen, out of the blue) on what is to be done, and limps through a story that doesn&#x2019;t quite make sense. I would recommend  watching playthroughs and if you find it interesting, then spend. This is not Arkane&#x2019;s best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/user-reviews?user_review_id=7519718">Expand</a></span>

Daud apparently is suffering from senility.  Too bad he seems to have fallen into the thinking &quot;if it weren&apos;t for you, things would have been perfect for me and I would have been nothing but a good person&quot;. Billie was all fixed in D2 so i don&apos;t understand why she is back to one eye and one good arm. Graphics were great and gameplay also but there was not enough plot. Dishonored has always had too much SJW in it but this time they had to invent a lost lesbian lover for Billie? PLEASE!
<br>It would be interesting see what was going on when Granny Rags was a young Vera Moray and such an enchantress figure. She was very special to The Outsider and I would like to know what sort of relationship they had--remember she thought he was going to marry her?  that whole story needs to be told of her youth and beauty, her disappointment and betrayal of her husband--that would be much more intriguing than the thought of Billie Lurk eating ****
<br>I would also enjoy seeing Daud and the Brigmore Witches a few years after Delilah--they had liked him before and they longed for the special things they missed, such as tea.  I think there would be a story there also with the loss of the Brigmore fortune, etc..
<br>The Dishonored world is just too excellent to be put on the shelf.  I would hope, though, that they stifle the SJW stuff and let enemies be killed without all the shaming.  in real life, every time an enemy is allowed to go away, all it means is that the enemy is given time to regroup and re-arm and plot another assault.  everyone makes choices and that includes the people who are trying to kill you. I think of The Outsider as the equivalent of Q from Star Trek except The Outsider was not the one who created the human condition messes and he is not the one who gave humans the capacity for evil.  The Outsider did not lie to his marked people but they were free to make their own choices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/user-reviews?user_review_id=7527736">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This DLC was a lot of fun that I enjoyed immensely. A great ending to the series in my opinion. I see some people managed to complete it in 5 hours and I suppose on a replay knowing what&apos;s coming I could have raced through it too. But where&apos;s the fun in that? So I took my time, explored, did over the pieces I thought I should have done better, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Well done!</span>
