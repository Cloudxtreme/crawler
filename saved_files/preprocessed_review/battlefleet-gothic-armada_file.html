The graphics are great they perfectly resemble the dark and gritty atmosphere of the Warhammer 40.000 Universe as about the gameplay it is a bit unbalanced (for example the Eldar feel a bit overpowered but you should not forget they are one of the most technological advanced races in the game universe their technology is way more advanced from humans and Orks so their ships are expected to be very challenging according also to the lore). There are also some small bugs but i have not find any serious flaw so far. I hope they release an expansion in the future and add more playable races and more stuff</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6315776">Expand</a></span>

<br>BF:Gs multiplayer will punish you for doing it wrong but gives you the tools to come up with a strategy of your very own.
<br>
<br>The campaign is fine and captures the spirit of WH40k very well. Some of the cutscenes like the orks intorduction are pretty awesome.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s very solid for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6317197">Expand</a></span>

<br>**** gets real.  as in, you have to actually think, and prioritize.  Not just TARGETS in a &quot;map / match / engagement,&quot; but BEFORE, and after....
<br>
<br>Lots of fun things and I cant tell where the generation a tad older than me really got into the dice type games, ala E.T.  (the movie ....DnD? lmao)

<br>Looks
<br>For a 2016 release I expected a bit more from the graphics. Its not bad, but when compared to the effects from another rts hybrid such as Sins of a Solar Empire released ages ago its hard to notice a difference not that impressive for a universe that should glory in the details and atmosphere. This is on Ultra settings, I can only imagine if you have to turn them down. Especially when you zoom into the details on the ships which although glorious in their warhammer gothic feel, leave something to be desired. Maybe some flapping banners (i know space doesn&apos;t work like that, but realism isn&apos;t exactly what we are looking for here).
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>All the right elements, tactical ship combat, broadsides, ramming, upgrades, some rpg tacked on. Its a warhammer pirate wet dream. Except it gets bogged down. Aside from torpedoes, ramming, and some inaccurate special abilities with long cooldowns, most weapons feel rather underwhelming in their damage potential. This combined with very limited number of ships you bring to fights, especially in the early game, makes for a slugfest. Combine that with the fact that coordinating the many manouvers and special abilities even among a small number of ships requires a lot of time slowing especially against the computer. It makes what should be epic carnage a grindish affair.
<br>
<br>Then there are the ship upgrades. You will see a handful of good ones, a few essential ones, and many that just aren&apos;t worth it. What&apos;s worse is even though the game wants to encourage specialization many times whats best for one ship is best for them all. Especially given with few ships, most are always going to be in the thick of fighting and not playing much in the way of specialized roles in fighting aside from squishy escort and with the ships of the line following the small tank, big tank, bigger tank roles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6322597">Expand</a></span>

It is on of a few Real-Time strategies with RPG elements (e.g Homeworld or Star Wolves). You take command of Imperial Navy fleet from Warhammer 40k universe trying to hold back attacks from various Xeno races and Chaos forces. You carry over your ships into next missions as part of the campaing and of course you get to level-up and upgrade them as the game progresses. Campaign is is very fun, the variety of missions is OK.  I am great fan of Dawn of War series and this one has very similar feel.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is well thought-off. Most of the time you command only couple of ships and you have an ability to use &quot;tactical cogitators&quot; and slow time so you can properly manage cooldowns and movements of your ships.
<br>
<br>Now to conclude I have to say that I was inclined to give the game even higher score. However constant crashes and various nasty bugs - like the one when a ship suddenly decides to refuse moving forward for remainder of a mission forcing you to restart - prevent me from doing so. Feel free to add one point in case you don&apos;t mind these bugs or if you are willing to wait until those are patched.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6322209">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Is it epic? No.
<br>
<br>The game limits you to a handful of ships (usually 3-4) which is both tremendously underwhelming if you were looking forward to commanding you know...an armada, and necessitates (or is perhaps a consequence of? Which came first, the dead duck pretending to be a chicken, or the rotten egg?) the other aspects of the game.
<br>
<br>Is it naval? No.
<br>
<br>BFG was always a naval combat game given a space skin. That&apos;s why it was always 2D and the rules never dealt with issues like persistence of momentum in a vacuum. That&apos;s a good thing, suspend disbelief and it helps keep the game simple and accessible.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the units in BFG do not behave anything like ships. Sail powered, motorised or space. They&apos;re more like rally cars with very poor tire grip.
<br>
<br>Ships do not move in a deliberate fashion, instead every vessel from the smallest gunboat to the largest battleship wheels, skids and turns on a dime in fractions of a second. It sort of defeats the point of having things like weapon facings or positioning at all.
<br>
<br>Is it strategic? No.
<br>
<br>The consequence of having very few units to control and allowing them virtually complete freedom to re-orient at a moment&apos;s notice means that there is no room for strategy or planning. The best laid plans can be undone at a moment&apos;s notice and setting up ambushes or positioning for running broadsides is actually rendered a detriment.
<br>
<br>The emergency manuever mechanic will take up the bulk of your gametime. The depleting and constantly replenishing power bar is generous enough to repeated instant 180 degree turns on even the biggest ships and once finally exhausted, it replenishes in mere seconds.
<br>
<br>The remainder of your time will be spent managing cooldowns. And oh my, does this game have cooldowns. It heard you liked cooldowns, so it assigned cooldowns for your cooldowns, so you could manage cooldowns while you wait for your cooldowns.
<br>
<br>Did I mention cooldowns? They&apos;re a thing.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a cooldown to make your shooting better (on every ship). A cooldown to take damage better (on every ship). There&apos;s even a cooldown to reduce your cooldowns! (and yes, its on every ship!). Why these are necessary at all is beyond me. Since its essential to use them constantly they&apos;d be much better off being rolled into the base stats (&quot;But then what buttons will people press?!?!&quot;.
<br>
<br>This is before you even get into the plethora of active abilities that actually deserve their own special buttons. Firing a torpedo spread is a tactical decision and ought to be left up to the player (ironically this is the one instance where the auto-cast actually does an okay job of managing it for you). Unfortunately, most of these tactical weapons are completed wasted due to the scale of the game. There are no battle lines to break up, no target rich areas to saturate. Just three enemy ships pirouetting about like mechanical ballet dancers who you&apos;ll never hit at anything but point blank range.
<br>
<br>And then we enter the much anticipated veterancy system. Rather than using this to allow ships to do what they did before, but be better at it, the game has opted to add...MORE COOLDOWNS! There&apos;re a small number of passive veteran abilities but only two or three will be useful on any one ship. And then you&apos;re forced to purchase yet more special buttons. Special buttons to regenerate your shields (could&apos;ve been passive, or conditional and auto-cast) special buttons to make yourself invincible. Special buttons to throw out yet MORE inaccurate AOE effects that would&apos;ve been excellent choices in a game of epic naval combat, but are completely wasted in this badly conceived skirmish game.
<br>
<br>In many respects its repeating the errors that plagued Rome 2 - nobody wants micro in a strategy game. They want to control a huge army/fleet and direct the flow of battle, not babysit count downs. While Total War had enough of a pedigree to realise their mistake (while of course denying they made one) and quietly removed virtually all of the button mashing from the game,
<br>
<br>Tl;dr - Its a skirmish game stuck in micro-hell. There&apos;s no room for strategy, you&apos;ll be too busy performing handbreak turns and spamming CD&apos;s to actually notice much less direct the battle. You react to this game, you don&apos;t take an active hand in it.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a new MOBA this could be entertaining if you can find big enough team games to actually cobble together a half-respectable fleet on both sides. There is doubtless a lot to appeal to the MOBA fan here - cooldown management is essential, combat is a second-by-second affair about managing a power bar.

Add that onto buggy game play, basic missing game modes, and excessive multiplayer cheating... and you&apos;ve got a game you should avoid, for now.</span>

<br>
<br>Can I recommend it? It is a difficult question since nothing is terribly wrong with this game as well as nothing is particularly good. I personally will prefer to play old Dark Omen (single player of course). Battlefleet: Gothic actually has many in common with it except the gameplay is way worse and it is really painful for me to say. Real time map is absolutely flat and details like nebulas and asteroids just don&apos;t add to gameplay much. With little variety in mission types it became boring and monotonous quickly. Turn based part is good but it is difficult to imagine how this part could be sux anyway.
<br>
<br>Maybe with time it will become better, BGE has a good potential, but as of now I can&apos;t recommend the game for it&apos;s full price.
<br>
<br>PROs
<br>- Warhammer 40k art
<br>- Campaign atmosphere, dialogs and movies.
<br>- Turn base global part and fleet management
<br>
<br>Mixed
<br>- Okayish real time campaign missions. Except for a few battles, all missions are based on few templates and became monotonous.
<br>- Okayish graphics.
<br>- Fleet size in both multiplayer and single player is rather small.
<br>
<br>CONs
<br>- Awful tutorial
<br>- You can&apos;t skip cutscenes in the begining of the missions.
<br>- Mission Design? Never heard of it.
<br>- Lack of gameplay variety
<br>- Game mechanics requires a lot of tuning and polish
<br>- Multiplayer... In it&apos;s current state not for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6344858">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The currency used to unlock ships upgrades etc is a bit too scarce. It doesnt allow you to swap around your configuration much at all. Some of the common missions are not designed too well. If you play normal mode and win all your battles you end up with too many &quot;favors&quot; that are just useless. But an abundance is alot better than shortage.
<br>
<br>There are alot of things that can be polished in this game.

While I am not very familiar with the tabletop version of Battlefleet, I can safely safely say that this game is a nearly complete letdown.  I am very familiar with past PC titles like Starfleet Command, Starpoint Gemini, and Homerworld.  The game very much tries to capture the real-time micromanagement of ships and systems that made these games such a joy to play.  Organizing your fleets and maneuvering carefully...executing special abilities and utilizing unique ship systems...using environmental &quot;terrain&quot; in the form asteroids or nebula to your advantage...
<br>
<br>However, once again, we have bunch of amateur developers floundering around with a novel concept, trying in vain to pad the oh-so-important &quot;length&quot; of their game and make it more &quot;marketable&quot; by a.) establishing clear rules and mechanics, then b.) immediately allowing the computer AI to cheat and ignore those rules and mechanics in a pitiful attempt to simulate &quot;difficulty&quot;.
<br>
<br>Who will -LOVE- this?
<br>
<br>+  Die-hard fans of Warhammer 40K Battlefleet.
<br>+  Gamers that enjoy puzzle-based, reload / retry systems.
<br>+  Players looking to exclusively focus on the game&apos;s skirmish or multiplayer modes.
<br>
<br>Who will -HATE- this?
<br>
<br>-  Players looking for a quality, fleet-based combat game.
<br>-  Gamers that want a single-player game that challenges their strategic and tactical ability.
<br>-  Anyone who finds repeating almost every level of a game 3-10 times annoying.
<br>
<br>What the game does, in practice, is continuously set players up to fail if they try to play according to what they were taught.  For example, one of the first things introduced in the tutorial is the mechanic by which enemy craft are unidentified &quot;blips&quot; until something actually brings them into radar range.  You may be able to deduce the class of ship you&apos;re seeing based on the speed and maneuverability of a blip, but you can&apos;t tell exactly what it is until you get closer and can actually &quot;see&quot; it.  Then, you&apos;re introduced to a mechanic by which ships in nebula are hidden from view -- even their blips -- until they emerge.
<br>
<br>These are stock-standard elements of the genre being reintroduced, and players will naturally assume that these mechanics can be used to mask / hide ships...just like you could successfully employ in games made 15 years ago.  But almost immediately, everything starts falling apart.  One of the first missions you have to accomplish is escorting 3 trade vessels from one side of a map to the other.  The mission briefing even specifically informs the player that splitting up the transports will increase their chances of survival.  Well...of course!  The player can just use nebula and leap-frog the trade transports from point to point, keeping the enemy guessing...right?  Or you can create 3 small groups and ensure they all travel the same speed, so the enemy will have no idea where the actual transports are...right?  Or I can hide the main group and send a transport off on its own to draw off the attackers...right?
<br>
<br>Nope!  As soon as the mission begins, the enemy (Orks, in this case) know exactly where your transports are and B-line for the nearest.  Are they hidden as blips?  Nope.  Are they hidden by nebula?  Nope.  And these Ork craft are SUPER Ork craft, able to withstand all critical hits resist outrageous levels of damage.  Even though I targeted the engines of their ships on 12 consecutive playthroughs of this mission, several times using both of my destroyers and all 3 frigates concentrating their fire on one Ork destroyer...did I ever, in 12 tries, even once, disable their engines?  Nope.  See, that&apos;s been disabled for this mission so that it&apos;s &quot;challenging&quot;.  And the transports, well, they move at about 50% the speed of all other ships.  Because they&apos;re heavy, I guess.  In space.  And Ork boarding parties are automatically successful in this mission -- auto-destroying critical systems and starting fires, even when the little floating message above the victim ship clearly displays &quot;Boarding Failed&quot;.  Because letting the AI cheat adds &quot;difficulty&quot; and &quot;length&quot; to the game, see?
<br>
<br>And so it continues as the campaign progresses.  I played 10 missions, and it never got better.  It got a lot worse, but it never improved even a little bit.  This is not a fleet-based tactical game.  This is a puzzle game that requires the player to know in advance how the AI will cheat.  It&apos;s like playing chess against a 6-year-old that claims, um, for the next game, uh, he gets 3 Queens to start, and, uhhh, you can&apos;t use Pawns to take Queens, and, ummm, every other turn he gets to move 2 pieces at once...!  See?  Now the game is &quot;hardcore&quot;.
<br>
<br>Graphics are very nice.  Sound design is fair.  Voice acting ranges from acceptable to ear-bleeding horrible.  (I want to put the Imperial Commissar out the airlock.)  Interface functions, but nothing great nor innovative.  Multiplayer is really the game&apos;s only selling point, but you won&apos;t play more than a match or two at a time.
<br>
<br>Largely garbage.  Pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6797351">Expand</a></span>

<br>It may seem like the map is being taken over and you can&apos;t do anything but its part of the story and you&apos;ll see when you get to that part in the mission. Some things that you do or don&apos;t do also will affect later missions.</span>

Also like many recent 40k games, it is an ok game that falls short of being a great one.
<br>
<br>Thankfully for me, a strong point is in it&apos;s campaign: a tale of the famous Gothic War, where Failba-er, Abaddon the Despoiler led his 12th Black Crusade against the Imperium&apos;s Gothic Sector in an attempt to gain control of the six Blackstone Fortresses, immense and ancient space stations with the firepower to destroy entire star systems. Through the eyes of original character Admiral Spire, you command the Imperial Navy in battle against Chaos, Ork and Eldar fleets, with branching paths and persistent game flow regardless of the outcome of individual battles, allowing things to go better or worse then they canonically did. The 40k mainstays of Gregorian chanting over thundering orchestras and overacting faux-Englishmen help to set the feel.
<br>
<br>However, certain parts of the actual gameplay fall short in portraying the scale and intensity of this war and, I feel, of the setting in general. Gameplay is strictly fleet tactics- there is no base-building or resource gathering, or any other aspects of an RTS. Battles are restricted to a two-dimensional plane and limited by an arbitrary &quot;point value&quot; as in the tabletop game, severely limiting the size of the fleet in each engagement, and for whatever reason, you are almost always outnumbered by enemy vessels. Towards the campaign&apos;s endgame I was able to field only my four most experienced ships against Abaddon&apos;s infamous Planet Killer, not to mention his infinitely respawning escorts.
<br>
<br>Combat is extremely micromanagement-heavy, sometimes necessitating the use of the game&apos;s bullet-time function. Only your ships basic weapons are automated, requiring you to manage active abilities, heavy weapons such as torpedoes, strike craft, emergency maneuvers and virtually everything else directly. The AI is not smart enough to avoid stage hazards such as minefields and asteroids, or to dodge a speeding Ork Kroozer, though this goes for the enemies as well. The more upgrades and skills you install on your ships to give them greater survivability and lethality, the more difficult it becomes to get the most out of them- so perhaps it is better that you have fewer ships. Still, I preferred Sins of a Solar Empire&apos;s fleet combat. Armada&apos;s tutorial did not adequately explain all the game features, so much so that I was not aware that automating your abilities made them as efficient as those used by your AI opponents until after I had finished the campaign. Still, I was very proud of myself whenever I manually broadsided a Chaos ship with a full spread of my Retribution-class battleship&apos;s torpedoes.
<br>
<br>There are a number of other modes, including online multiplayer, custom games, and skirmish vs. AI, allowing for a second player for coop, as well as post-release DLCs that add Space Marine and, if you&apos;re into them, Tau fleets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810435">Expand</a></span>

<br>In general - never again anything from this developer. It&apos;s really time to start blacklisting some of them. When the state after the release is poor but solved by patches in next few months - I can live with that. But if after a year nothing like that happens - you will not see my money anymore!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefleet-gothic-armada/user-reviews?user_review_id=7096088">Expand</a></span>
