I was one of those who couldn&apos;t wait to get my hands on it and in the end, I was not disappointed.  The game is actually a bit different from the first one because it&apos;s not a &quot;point and click&quot; adventure.  It feels very natural because you explore the world in full 3D and still have the deepth and content of old adventure games.  The core gameplay consists of interacting with the wonderful characters.  This can look limiting but it stays interesting through the whole game thanks to the excellent writing and voice acting.  All the characters are well developped and contribute very well to the emotional roller coaster that is Dreamfall.  There are some very minor stealth and combat gameplay elements but those are not the focus of the game.   <br>
<br> <br>
<br>While the technical aspect of the game isn&apos;t exactly top notch, the art design makes up for it very much.  The sound is especially good; voice acting is probably the best ever and music is always very fitting and well composed.  The story is amazing and very inspiring; this is number one reason to get into this game.  My only grippe is that it&apos;s way too easy.  There are few puzzles and they are very straightfoward.  Also, the ending raises a lot of questions which is both good and bad.  It&apos;s good because it leaves you thinking about it and you feel like you have to go through the game a second time.  But at the same time, you don&apos;t get the same kind of resolution you would get from your typical movie, which is a little bit less satisfying.   <br>
<br> <br>
<br>In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good story and very well done dialogs coupled with good production values.  9/10 !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=58504">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay, the graphical style, the character you play for most of the game, and the tone are all different from the original Longest Journey. And yet it is still very much a sequel, with some of the same characters (and a few important new ones) living in the same world(s), with enough common plot points and historical details to make it clear that you haven&apos;t accidentally bought the wrong game with a similar title. But still, it&apos;s a third-person 3D interface instead of point-and-click. It has little of the Longest Journey&apos;s snarky humor (except when Crow and Roper make their welcome reappearances), making the game feel somewhat darker. And because the humor is limited to characters you encounter, rather than the primary character you inhabit, the game feels a lot more serious overall. Also, the added freedom of exploring a 3D virtual world is offset by less interactivity; you have fewer choices, and your choices have fewer significant effects, than in the Longest Journey. Dreamfall comes close to being an &quot;interactive movie,&quot; as other reviewers have described it. In short, I enjoyed Dreamfall very much, but not for any of the same reasons I enjoyed the Longest Journey. It is simply an engrossing story set in an interesting world with enough ties to its predecessor to feel pleasantly familiar. If you prefer combat and/or a high degree of non-linearity, look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=2526408">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dreamfall is a third person action adventure game (more adventure than action) which takes place in literally 2 worlds, Stark (technocratic) and Arcadia (Magical) and concerns itself with two main plots and a variety of subplots.
<br>What i liked :
<br>- Straightforward simple puzzles, none of the esoteric logic some other adventure games have.
<br>-Beautiful world and superb aesthetics. These places do feel familiar if they would&apos;ve existed. Nothing looks too out of place and thus doesn&apos;t draw away from the immersion of the game.From Casablanca in stark to Marcuria in Arcadia, they all look equally wonderful and imaginative.
<br>-Stealth sections. Now compared to other reviews i didn&apos;t mind them. A couple of them have a puzzle sense to them (ie a different way to be steathy). Even if you don&apos;t like them, you can still complete them
<br>What i didn&apos;t like :
<br>-Combat  It feels weak and rather random if you happen to hit the enemy or visa versa. It honestly seems tacked on.
<br>-CLIFFHANGER ENDING  Now the good part is, at least 1 major plot gets resolved, but the game opens several others and doesn&apos;t bother to close them. AND THERE WAS NO SEQUEL IN THE NEXT 3 YEARS that really took 1 point off the total score.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you like an engaging narrative you&apos;ll like Dreamfall. You may not love it, but still like it. A 7/10 from me</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=3154973">Expand</a></span>

Dreamfall is about exploring different worlds and character development. To put it quite bluntly, Dreamfall is a story driven game, with some flawed action sequences and some underwhelming stealth portions. I have always wanted to play Dreamfall, and for some reason I only just got around to it. I&#x2019;m glad I waited, since my younger self probably wouldn&#x2019;t have appreciated the game for what it truly is, since it lacks any real action.
<br>
<br>Dreamfall presents itself some 200 years into the future, where corporations seemingly act as the government. There is often references to the wire, which is quite honestly just the internet from what I gather, only everyone seems to be connected to it at all times. Everyone seems to be reliant on the wire for everything, and it&#x2019;s heavily monitored by corporations.
<br>
<br>The setting of Dreamfall takes place in a sci-fi world called Stark, but also a different world of magic called Arcadia. Only a few people can travel between both worlds, often called shifters. The story is completely linear, and although the game allows you to choose specific dialogue when in a conversation, the outcome is eventually going to be identical to everyone else that has played the game. The only reason to choose the other conversation options is for more back story of each character, or maybe a event. It&#x2019;s quite a nice feature, and although the story is static, this makes it seem a little bit less so.
<br>
<br>Ranging from 10-15 hours, the game is a decent length. The story itself is one of the most interesting and immersive narratives I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Most of the game is actually listening to conversations between 2 or more people, so take that into consideration. There is also some fairly easy puzzles in the game, with a few non-obvious ones thrown into the mix. The world itself is very static and linear. There definitely can be exploration, but there isn&#x2019;t anything interesting to find if you deviate from your path.
<br>
<br>Combat and stealth need to be mentioned. Combat is simply clunky, often times you&#x2019;ll be throwing punches into thin air because of how bad it is. The stealth in the game doesn&#x2019;t present a meaningful experience either, as I could be standing in-front of someone 5 metres away and they won&#x2019;t even notice me. Why this was even included into the final product is beyond me.
<br>
<br>The worst part of the game though, is the awful ending. Two hours up to the games ending, you begin seeing a lot of events taking place, and a lot of questions get brought up. The ending flat out refuses to answer any of the questions you might have about other characters or sequences you saw before the end. It&#x2019;s completely left to your imagination what happened to everything and everyone else besides Zoe.
<br>
<br>Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, is one of my most favourite adventure games. The story itself is something everyone should experience at least once in their life. While the combat and stealth are completely awful to your experience in Dreamfall, the game is worth your time if you can appreciate a interesting narrative in a sci-fi/fantasy world</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=3362416">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And I agree with MC. If you don&apos;t like cutscenes and stories, just don&apos;t play a game like this! There is absolutely no way you can call this a bland game unless you completely skip out on the story, which would be a real shame, because it&apos;s one of the best I&apos;ve seen in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=77578">Expand</a></span>

Every aspect of action that has been thrown into this game sucks. Fighting is beyond bad it&apos;s the worst. Stealth is just boring, feels like ir shouldn&apos;t have been there. But apart from the action parts this adventurous journey was an enormous pleasure for me. I guess the creators had to make it more action oriented than the first Longest Journey, because the adventure genre is getting unpopular, but they mesed up on that. In short great adventure, bad action. Can&apos;t wait for the sequel. P.S. I give it 10 ignoring all the action parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=743022">Expand</a></span>

It could&apos;ve been the best adventure game ever if there were some more good puzzles in it. Anyway if you&apos;re a fan of The Longest Journey , an adventure gamer, or just someone who likes a good sci-fi story then you should buy it. And this is not just a good story it&apos;s an epic.</span>

It was a rewarding experience to play this game and that time was definitely not wasted for me. This title also has a replay value, although of course, it doesn&apos;t offer any new content or new ways of solving puzzles, but it&apos;s the kind of game that I like to play again from time to time (time being measured in years) and still enjoy myself while doing so. It&apos;s a very good relaxant. I am sure though, that this kind of title generally has more appeal to female audience than to a male one. / I was looking forward to the sequel, but that was probably because I hadn&apos;t been seeking any gameplay-related information in advance. If only I had known...  / The game was fine at first, only to gradually get worse and worse. Fighting in TLJ? Really? And of course, also a pretty lame one. Why put that there? So the console users would feel satisfied about having at least some action and wouldn&apos;t run away to let off their steam elsewhere? The biggest problem though - at certain point, the game stopped being a game and turned into an interactive movie. Also, the storyline... I can&apos;t comment about the inconsistencies with the prequel because it has been quite a long time since I played both games (and when I was playing Dreamfall, I didn&apos;t remember all the nuances of the original title to be able to compare the storylines perfectly). But I must say, seeing April again was dissatisfying and her character was only a shell of her old self (which is understandable, given the circumstances, but still... a letdown) and the ending was depressing and clearly prepared for a next installment. / What bothers me about this (apart from what I already mentioned), is that some imagination was clearly still present here - e.g. nice and interesting environments, but for some reason, it&apos;s full potential was not unleashed. It&apos;s always sad to see there WAS some idea, but the team failed in delivering what they were supposed to deliver in terms of gameplay. / I am definitely not looking forward to another TLJ title (if any will be produced), because I don&apos;t believe that anything is going to change here, even though a lot of criticism has been voiced towards the creators. Seems to me like the authors are just milking the fame of the original game and they want to happily continue doing so. /<br>I am giving this game a 4 (I considered giving it a 5) - the main reason for it being a lack of gameplay. I don&apos;t want to support a trend of movies posing as adventure games. And of course, the re-playability I mentioned in the beginning drops to zero for me with this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=1893448">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Music is just fine, although nothing the stood out for me
<br>
<br>Now the negatives...
<br>
<br>You are essentially playing a walking simulator from beginning to end,
<br>It&apos;s puzzles are far too easy and uninspired, it attempts to bring a fighting mechanic into the mix, but it&apos;s just terrible and felt completely phoned in.
<br>
<br>While you are given multiple choices in the game in the form of dialogue prompts, I&apos;ve heard that the choices you make really don&apos;t affect the game in any way, making it completely linear.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s story actually pulled me in and made me want to find out what&apos;s really going on.
<br>
<br>But in the end I was like... &quot;WHAT?!&quot;
<br>
<br>It&apos;s very confusing and apparently has a lot of references to it&apos;s original game which I haven&apos;t played.
<br>
<br>I went into the game thinking that I was going to be  treated to a head-scratching Broken Sword-esque puzzle solver, but was disappointed.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worthy of at least one playthrough but beyond that it doesn&apos;t really have anything else to bring you back.
<br>
<br>It really does have some great visuals and audio though</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=4951629">Expand</a></span>

The game is linear, which you expect from a shooter like Max Pain, but this is a sequel to a brain wrecking puzzle adventure. This lame game plays like a movie. Except you have to use a controller or keyboard to move the actors. And it&apos;s a lousy anime movie with HORRIBLE action (they actually try to make action game sequences inthis). There is no way to zip across areas, so often you have to walk the maze back and forth to do the only one thing that you possibly can do. THere is no challenge to this game. You know those errand running quests you are put up to at the beginning of RPG&apos;s to level up quickly? Well that&apos;s all you ever do in this AWFULLY BORING game. Run here, run there. The interface is unintelligent and boring. The action (fighting if you can believe that!) not rewarding. Swordfights are for melee games. What kind of game is this? Playing this game, I felt like I was wasting time, but maybe it would get better. It did not.

The puzzles are way too simple, the action sequences are repetitive, but worst of all, the game is so linear that you are actually told what to do in a step by step walkthrough throughout the whole game. And the ending... well, it&apos;s obvious they planned a Dreamfall 2. But with the complete lack of effort the development team put in the creation of Dreamfall, I almost hope we&apos;ll never see the sequel. All in all, a decent movie, an awful game. If you REALLy want to play it, my advice is to borrow it. Even the price of a rental is too much for the enjoyment you&apos;ll get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=394749">Expand</a></span>

Even if they do ask 1000 times what you want to do next, the only choice is &apos;a: Follow the only storyline.&quot; Don&apos;t waste your time. This creator sold out and is cashing in on the cult following of the original. Its not even a well told story.</span>

A story I can&apos;t help feel has been destroyed by poorly executed game development. Don&apos;t expect anything remotely good from the graphics. Cheesy, cheap, limp, poorly choreographed 3D animations, its appearances such as these that make the old 2D sprite games look beautiful. This game brings all the worst features from console gaming to the computer. As with other obviously console ported games, dreamfall suffers from maddeningly clumsy controls. Sound and story are good, however overall this game has the feel of a beta. Not to be to repetitive, but its horrible to look at and has worse game play. Save your money, buy the original &quot;the longest journey&quot; it is far superior and in my opinion has better graphics in spite of its dated appearance. I dearly hope that the developers correct these issues before dreamfall chapters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=404986">Expand</a></span>

The controls are terrible and the camera makes for a frustrating experience. But you don&apos;t have to worry about that very much as you won&apos;t find yourself actually playing the game all that often anyway. The game is comprised almost entirely of cut-scenes. In fact, you do little else but fetch items in order to trigger another cut-scene. In the game there are three primary characters you watch babble. These are: Zoe (who looks eerily like a Bratz doll), April (who is extremely amusing in the first game but is-alas!-no longer. Instead her character is very macabre in a contrived way, having allegedly &quot;lost&quot; her Shifter powers along with, I suspect, her sense of humor) and Kian (a man who offers no surprises for the player nor, as is seen, for his enemies). You play briefly as the heroic Brian Westhouse in a Tibetan monastery during the beginning, which I thought would turn into a wholly welcome tutorial but that ultimately resulted in the game&apos;s first cut-scene (probably foreshadowing; if only I had seen it sooner). After you&apos;re done with Brian you never play as him again and although he appears later on in the game he seems as artificial and droll as the other NPCs. That was really too bad, too, as Brian&apos;s segment was the most enjoyable time I had during the game though even then it was only because Brian is an intriguing drunkard in Dreamfall&apos;s predecessor. When you do find yourself playing the game (an oversight on the director&apos;s part, I&apos;m sure) you&apos;ll either have to solve insultingly simplistic puzzles (there are a grand total of 10 puzzles throughout the game, I think. None are memorable.), fight with a clumsy battle mechanic or sneak past a guard. Failing to sneak by in one of the sneak sequences normally results in a fight or instant death. The story is said to be the game&apos;s redeeming feature, but even this comes off as uninspired from the start. Almost immediately we are greeted by A Mysterious Girl (who is mysteriously alike to Samara, better known as The Ring Girl, or the girl from the Ring) who has a message for Zoe and attempts to convey it in a ghostly fashion via a Screen (Dreamfall&apos;s version of a television) amid static. However it would be unfair to judge the game solely on that one cliched character. The story does become rich and expands admirably. So rich and so admirably expansive does it become that it ends on a cliff hanger. Really try to avoid buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=415127">Expand</a></span>

Said tiny levels are also almost completely devoid of anything to do except pick up the one item you&apos;ve been sent for or talk to the lone interesting NPC. &quot;Combat&quot; consists of waiting for your opponent to block then pressing heavy attack until they fall down. But most importantly, all these things could stand aside in the face of a good story. Which of course isn&apos;t present in this game. While it definitely has its moments for the most part the story slowly goes nowhere, takes a few contrived twists, and finally to top it all off all the good guys die and evil wins the day. Despite one character&apos;s claims to the contrary, by the end it seems like everything would have worked out the same if you had just stayed in bed. Except maybe fewer people would have died.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=408129">Expand</a></span>

Most of the input from the player-- I mean, viewer, consists of running through towns to the next cutscene. There are a handful of symbol puzzles. There are also a number of interactive &quot;world&quot; puzzles, but all of these have either painfully obvious solutions, or are clunky and tiresome. The story takes a long, long time to get good (I was bored witless for about 80% of it). But it does get good, very good, eventually. Right when it gets good, however, it ends. None of the plot&apos;s major elements come to a conclusion and this immediately sours and frustrates what little enjoyment I recieved from this gam-... movie. Don&apos;t pay more for this than you would for a night at the movies, popcorn included.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112439">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The shift from point-and-click adventure to adventure-action provides for a slightly better pace of the action, while not taking a thing away from the game&apos;s strongest suit: storytelling.
<br>
<br>Zoe&apos;s quest for his friend&apos;s whereabouts quickly picks up pace and leads her to various places both in her world and in the alternative universe of Arcadia.
<br>There she&apos;ll finally meet April Ryan, the protagonist of TLJ. From there things will get more and more complicated, involving both worlds and a multiversal conspiracy.
<br>
<br>The ending doesn&apos;t tie all the loose ends, far from that. Which can be a bit disappointing and frustrating, but on the other hand it leaves us players wanting for more.
<br>A more &quot;traditional&quot; finale would have felt a tad cheesy, while the openness, with a rather strong negative vibe, fits the narrative tone of both worlds.
<br>
<br>Our heroine(s) didn&apos;t save their world, their future hangs in the Balance (pun intended), but there is still hope, and the core message is &quot;fighting is always worth it&quot;.
<br>
<br>All in all a great adventure-action game (with more of the former, as it had to be expected considering its origins) with a cast of memorable characters and locations.
<br>Besides the already mentioned finale, it&apos;s a shame we didn&apos;t find out even MORE about some of the other NPCs, and the worlds of Stark and Arcadia.
<br>
<br>Very much recommended to anyone who values a compelling story over mindless button-mashing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=7010525">Expand</a></span>

I have been playing adventure games for around 16 years and I really cant say that this game will be getting anywhere near the list of my favourites. Older games such as monkey island series, Grim fandango, Blade runner and the longest journey offer so much more. Overall im just dissapointed that from the makers of such a wonderful original comes a fairly drab sequel. I also find that I cant really feel any empathy for zoe. Something this has inspired me to do is get the longest journey out again and prove they can create a wonderful game. If they do follow this up I hope they return to the originals roots in gameplay, puzzles and actually when I think about it presentation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=388894">Expand</a></span>

The ending is well done and the fighting is fair for this genre of gaming. I found Crow to be my favorite character giving some laughter into this game. OH! I can&apos;t wait for a 3rd game. Apart from some excruciating long dialogs, I love it!</span>

The most boring game I have ever tried. Oh my, when I have to run up and fro through four scenes to get something just for bringing it back, and nothing happens during running! (Yes, you&apos;ll see eight &quot;loading&quot; just because you gotta run for something and bring it back!) I guess the developers thought this is fun, but in my opinion only for those who never played with good games. And the controlling method of the game! Oh boy! If I&apos;d ever have a chance to ask a geek who thinks this is a good way, what he thought when developed it! Not to mention those very long and boring dialogs, and cut scenes... And the voice of characters? Most of them are like someone was wakened up from the deepest sleep and read it. Zero acting performance. My &quot;favorite&quot; is Na&apos;ane. Anyone could act it&apos;s voice out better. And the mimics of characters? It would have been ok 5-6 years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=397503">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are incredible, the gameplay system (including fighting) well crafted. The plot is clever (although involving an unfeasible number of beautiful female characters), the acting mostly good. But &apos;anonymous&apos;s review is quite right. There is just not enough game. There are a handful of bits of proper adventure, problem solving etc. But it is mostly just walking from one location to another in order to have very long and involved conversations with people. Zoe&apos;s refreshing attitude soon gets lost. This is like a mildy interactive film. If that&apos;s what you want, then fine. Otherwise, go back to playing Monkey Island.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=398864">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s almost a fusion of different genres and pushes the boundaries of what a game is. I haven&apos;t enjoyed a game this much in quite some time.</span>

Nice graphics for sure, (credit where credit is due) but that is the ONLY interesting thing about it, If I were a teenage girl, (which I&apos;m neither of) with little hand-eye coordination, no friends to speak of, and little interest in reading, I might enjoy this &apos;game&apos; just for it&apos;s unrelenting ability to waste one&apos;s time. One word of advice: before you play Dreamfall, buy yourself an extra spacebar. You&apos;ll be wearing the one you have now out skipping through the meaningless cut scenes and the teeth-grindingly long dialog sequences. Better yet, don&apos;t waste your time and money with this stinker period.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=415100">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a fantastic game, but it does have a couple of flaws. However, when you start playing it, it really sucks you in. At least it did with me :) In the words of the merchant: Wonderful! Fan-tastic! :)</span>
