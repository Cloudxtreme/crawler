The added level cap is more than enough of a reason to get this DLC over any of the others, but on top of that it actually felt like a continuation of Fallout 3 rather than a crappy side mission. Operation Anchorage and Mothership Zeta were just quick combat missions that felt tacked on. Broken Steel actually added new content to the Capitol Wasteland and changed the world that I had come to know and enjoy. To me, the missions were the most exciting of any of the DLCs, and the Tesla Cannon is easily the greatest weapon in the game and reason enough to complete it.<br><br>To all the people who are saying that Bethesda cut content from the main game and threw it in Broken Steel just so they could charge us more money for it just plain need to get over it. Fallout 3 was a HUGE game, and I doubt that any more than 1% of the people who played it ever completed all the quests. There was a ton of content that was cut from Half-Life 2 and used in the HL2: Episodes that was merely cut DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS. The situation is likely the same here. It doesn&apos;t mean it was an intentional ploy by Bethesda to get more money out of us.<br><br>Broken Steel was awesome. It wasn&apos;t perfect, but it wasn&apos;t the money grab people keep making it out to be.

<br>
<br>Stay away from this dlc, only terrible roleplaying opportunities and poor combat scenes await you here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-broken-steel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4316378">Expand</a></span>

<br>-&gt; It is about the level cap and freeroam-after-ending.
<br>-&gt; I had a strong feeling that the last portion of original game (such as ending, level cap) were removed so it can be repackaged into purchasable DLC pack. It&apos;s a very cheap marketing tactics I really have seeing dev practicing such things to the loyal fans.

<br>-&gt; It is about the level cap and freeroam-after-ending.
<br>-&gt; I had a strong feeling that the last portion of original game (such as ending, level cap) were removed so it can be repackaged into purchasable DLC pack. It&apos;s a very cheap marketing tactics I really have seeing dev practicing such things to the loyal fans. 
<br>
2) Does this DLC pack involve choice/decision making and its consequence,aka roleplaying?
<br>-&gt;Barely, most of the content is focused on combating enclave remnant force. Only choice that you are making is either leave Citadel to be burned or not...which I dont think it qualifies to be an RPG thing.
<br>
<br>3) The Level-up perks for lvl 22-30, are they good?
<br>-&gt; No, not at all.
<br>-&gt; most of the perks they added should be for level 4-12. 
<br>-&gt; there is nothing special or unique in terms of high level actions or roleplaying. 
<br>-&gt; lvl 30  perk, Nuclear anomaly is suppposed to be the strongest perk in the entire game..but it is bugged and kills player at frequent occasion.
<br>
<br>4) Then, what is so good about this DLC?
<br>-&gt; again, Level-caps and Freeroam after Ending were taken as hostage by the dev. Any player who enjoyed should buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-broken-steel/user-reviews?user_review_id=83425">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And also during the final mission of broken steel you probably make the biggest choice in fallout 3 (not spoiling it.) and it take a huge change in the game. Also you get a extended level cap to 30 and also you also have some new weapons and armor, side missions and not to mention you get to free roam after you finish the entire broken steel DLC. The DLC plays kinda short but I would get this DLC. it&apos;s necessary to get this for story completion and the free roam addition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-broken-steel/user-reviews?user_review_id=5444596">Expand</a></span>
