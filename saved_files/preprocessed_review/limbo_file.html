First off, it&apos;s way too short, even for a budget title. After beating the game, Steam had my playtime logged at 69 minutes. That means this game actually costs more to play per minute than your typical bloated. big-budget title. My biggest complaint about professional and amateur reviewers is that they pay so little attention to cost. The professionals get the games for free, so I guess they have an excuse. But it is an important consideration. This is a good game but only for a much lower cost. I would price it at $5.00. Another factor relating to cost is that it has virtually no replay value. But that is typical for puzzle games.<br><br>The other serious flaw is that many of the puzzles are entirely unsatisfying. You might think you are solving puzzles at first but at some point you realize you are just taking shots in the dark. Some of the puzzles are not possible to solve until after you&apos;ve died at least once. My favorite part of playing a puzzle game is trying really hard not to die the first time. This doesn&apos;t happen often, but I just feel deflated as soon as I realize there was no way I could have solved it the first time no matter how carefully I thought it out beforehand. You can tell how good a puzzle is by how high you throw you hands up in the air once you finally solve it or are told the solution and say, &quot;Ah, jeeze! How did I not see that to begin with? It&apos;s so obvious now!&quot; Many of these puzzle will just leave you shrugging with indifference making this game more of a metaphor for life (and perhaps the afterlife) than I would care for. But it is still a fun game. It just doesn&apos;t live up to the absurd amount of hype buzzing around it. I would give it a much higher rating if the price were much lower.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1748691">Expand</a></span>

The simple story, brilliant graphics and unique gameplay all came together to create something that transcends video games to become art.<br><br>Although I would categorize this as a puzzle game, it doesn&apos;t match up to traditional puzzle gameplay. Progress in this game is based around trial and error and the frequent deaths that result. Although this sounds terrible, the frequent save points for the most part prevent it from being bothersome. In fact, the experimental style adds more depth to the game as it so closely matches the approach a small boy on an adventure would take.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1998053">Expand</a></span>

I actually though that the game will go more in the direction of violence and philosophy/psychology (e.g. seeing another character walk into a pool and die, just to bounce over his dead body  that&apos;s the strongest moment in the game imo), but unfortunately it takes a purely mechanical setting later: boxes, saws, magnets  I&apos;ve seen all this stuff in many games. If you take out the art and focus only at the second half of the game, you will see a good but not an outstanding puzzle, much like the ones you can find on Kongregate for free. The first part however is simply a work of a genius. That&apos;s why after finishing this game i have a somewhat mixed impression. Also, the ending was unexpected and i didn&apos;t get its meaning (or the meaning was too banal? i mean, walking thru so many hurdles to just get a girl? duh, that&apos;s too teenager-oriented). I also agree with some reviewers that most puzzles make you die a few times before you can at all figure out what&apos;s going on. That&apos;s not too bad, but I still had a sense that the author just enjoys hurting the player  Anyway, with all these minor flaws (which aren&apos;t actually flaws) the game is just excellent. It surely deserves its popularity and it&apos;s definitely a step forward in the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201085">Expand</a></span>

Fail decision on Playdead&apos;s part.

<br>
<br>The animation alone is amongst the best I&apos;ve ever seen for a 2D Platformer. I&apos;ts fluid and the physics feels just right.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are challenging but intuitive and the setting is immersive.
<br>
<br>Not much replay value, but definitely an Indie Classic.</span>

It is a game with only one real flaw, and that is the insanely short length. I beat it in 45 minutes. As the negative reviews all say, it should have been 5 bucks. The puzzles are extremely easy, and if you pay attention, you will never die. I beat the game (on both areas) dying a total of 3 times. Once when I screwed up the platforming, once on the final puzzle and once in the pitch black puzzle section where you have to rely on sound to avoid the traps.
<br>The people saying you need to die on multiple puzzles to find a solution are completely wrong.
<br>
<br>Its like Dark Souls, you can predict every single trap before hand if you pay attention and know how to spot tells. Even the traps that give you 3 seconds to react are obvious before hand. It disgusts me that modern gamers still cant spot tells in games. Reminds me of Dark Souls how 90% of attacks from bosses could be figured out in 3 seconds simply by the design of the boss and the arena.
<br>
<br>On the aethetic again, it sports a dark monochrome colour scheme, with no music except for atmospheric sounds. It also has a great physics engine and minor dust effect to give every falling block force. It is a very very good looking art style and is extremely immersive.
<br>
<br>The narrative is minimalist. All you know is a girl (I believe it said it was your sister or something?) has gone to Limbo, and you follow her. Nothing else is said at all. If you want a complex narrative, you wont find one here.
<br>
<br>Overall, I would have prefered it to be far far longer, and more difficult puzzles. I also would prefer that everyone look at the  tells of enemies. Regardless, it has a great art style and atmosphere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3273524">Expand</a></span>

The little things were what impressed me most, small details in the world you could (and sometimes must) pick up. Parts of the &apos;story&apos; you could piece together by just being attentive. The one problem with the game is length and re-playability. I could imagine if you were to play through it a second time you could be more appreciative of the surroundings and what is going on (I didn&apos;t realize a certain detail of the game until I started a second time). The problem is, with today&apos;s audience it seems everyone just wants to win, they don&apos;t bother with the details and if they get stuck it&apos;s straight to youtube for the walkthrough, A great game that I fear may go less appreciated than it deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1714876">Expand</a></span>

The art style of the game is uncomplicated and lends itself toward the overall metaphor. Many have complained about Limbo being overly short while others have described it as an arduous journey that is well worth the effort. I would say that I played through at an above average pace and finished the game in about five hours. Many of the puzzles were tricky and the feeling of success was a great reward when I figured them out. As far as the story goes, well will have to form your own opinion about that after you play through. Lets just say its an open book.
<br>
<br>Great games leave a simple taste of I want more in your mouth and this game gave me that. Sadly there isn&apos;t much more I can milk from it so 9/10. It looses one point for lack of real replay ability. I accomplished 90% of the achievements on my first play through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2530539">Expand</a></span>

But what they fail to realize, is that back then, the difficulty levels were only hard to stop people from finishing a full price game in a short amount of time. Nowadays, when I pay $10 for a game and find myself dying instantly every time I reach the end of the screen, I don&apos;t feel gooey nostalgia, but only bubbling rage. Limbo is a game with such a mechanic, albeit a fantastic sense of design and atmosphere, but nevertheless let down by its complete lack of story, cheap sudden deaths and boring and repetitive physics puzzles. I swear that see-saw puzzles make their way into every single game with a basic physics engine and they have NEVER BEEN FUN.<br><br>It&apos;s unfair to rate a game down based solely off its difficulty and simplicity and all things considered, Limbo isn&apos;t that bad.

Puzzles were still of a decent difficulty at the start and gradually developed into taking 5-10 minutes to figure out each puzzle. While the odd few of the puzzles simply required jumping or running at the right time, most of them are well thought out and logical - unlike many other games where you feel that you never would have thought of the solution and ended up trying everything in trial and error. The atmosphere in the game is powerful, very creepy and I found myself genuinely freaked out at some of the things the boy encounters. Checkpoints in the game are well-placed so that you didn&apos;t have to repeat vasts amount of gameplay to get back to your origial point. The sound adds to the atmosphere, though a drawback is that you couldn&apos;t edit the volume in the options. While in hindsight I think that the story of his sister is a little underplayed, as even towards the end we don&apos;t really know what happened, while playing it didn&apos;t really occur as an issue and I found it fun watching the silent story of his journey unfolding. The game is relatively short (3.2 hours to finish or so), it is also very cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2068805">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s grossly overrated, though, I&apos;ll say. It&apos;s a good game and all, but how can people be that blown away by it?

<br>I liked the art and music.  The controls were slightly awkward but not unbearable.  The main negative to this game would be the pseudo-puzzles.  If it was all good quality puzzles, then the ratings would be appropriate - otherwise it is over-hyped and it isn&apos;t worth paying much for this.  I was fortunate enough to get it for $2.50 on Steam, which I think was reasonable.  But it isn&apos;t worth more than that.  It&apos;s worth the short amount of time to play, just not worth much money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2690703">Expand</a></span>

The only problem is that it&apos;s so short and when you finish, you are done. While it lasts though, it&apos;s experience that will stay with you for a very long time.</span>

As it is its a decent 2d platformer with some interesting puzzles. There are some major flaws with this game in my opinion first of all  there is just not much to it. If you read the description your searching for your sister but in the game their is no story whatsoever not even a single message so you have to pretty much read the store page description to understand whats going on. It was also somewhat confusing when i first started playing on the PC because there was no tutorial what so ever and the sad part is there are only 5 buttons 4 of which are arrow keys used in the game so a tutorial would have taken 3 secs. I enjoyed the first 10 or so level of the games because it felt like a interesting world with dark forest, monster spiders, and fellow children. However about halfway through the game all other forms of life disappear and you are left with somewhat boring mechanical puzzles which serve no other purpose then to make you spend more time in the game. The end of the game just reaffirmed my belief that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life it was very subtle and I did not receive the boss battle/ hard puzzle I was hoping for. The end cut scene was also very weak and had no emotional impact on me whatsoever the previous hour of mechanical puzzle solving left me completely numb and i just wanted the game to be over. Overall this game would have been great if it could have kept the feel it had for the first 10 or so levels but as it stands half the game is amazing and the other half is varies in quality from mediocre to mind numbingly meticulous.<br><br>I&apos;m glad i got it for $2.50 i would surely have been extremely disappointed to waste $10 on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1979506">Expand</a></span>

Not only do the black and white colors combine to make an excellent creepy atmosphere but the ways you die and the events that happen in the game create tension. The puzzles are pure quality, they are so good they nearly seem comparable to puzzles in Valve games, and there is a lot of variety in each situation. My only complains with this game, the story is really not clear and some of the puzzles are quite difficult giving you many deaths. Limbo is an amazing game which becomes challenging but not frustrating, this is one of my games of the year and a must-buy title on any platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2114557">Expand</a></span>

A lot of the game is simply dieing and then correcting the mistake you made that led you to die.  I don&apos;t find it very entertaining.  Compared to Braid, this game sucks.</span>

A few more hints at a story would be great, but I admit as a FPS player usually, the style, mystery and foreboding grabbed me completely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2314460">Expand</a></span>

The art and backgrounds are very well done but that&apos;s about the only things the game has going for it.  For starters, it lacks a story line or any kind of basic information that might give the game coherence or meaning.  When you begin, you&apos;re more or less thrown to the wolves (literally) to figure out what the heck you&apos;re supposed to be doing.  As the game progresses, you move your character across a black and white 2D platform setting and try to solve seemingly simple yet frustrating puzzles.  There is no health or life bar in this game.  You make a mistake, you die immediately and start over at the beginning of the level (and die you will, over and over and over again trying to work through one unexpected hazard after the next).  Bottom line: The artwork is good, the gameplay is simple, the storyline is non-existant, and the general gameplay can get frustrating.  Don&apos;t buy this game at the regular price of $10 because it&apos;s not worth more than $5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863542">Expand</a></span>

The very nature of the art style (black and white, blurry effects) means the art style itself inhibits gameplay by putting things in the foreground in your way, and it not being entirely clear is something is going to kill you or not. THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING. A good puzzle platformer should be able to be completed without many deaths if you can actually sit back and think what you&apos;re going to do: eg. braid. With limbo, so many of the puzzles simply cannot be attempted first life because they usually result in instant death just finding out what the obstacle is. For example. I see 2 spike traps attached to ropes above me. I have no idea when they will trigger and swing at me. I have no idea the length of rope on the spike trap, so it is pretty much impossible to estimate it&apos;s range or If I can outrun it arcing behind me. my only option is to just run in blind and see what happens. Admittedly, the game does allow you to respawn after death fairly close to where you died. Unfortunately the art style also shoots the game in the foot again because the game is simply not that interesting to look at. Yes I agree that vague black shapes that look like giant spiders would be &quot;scarier&quot; than an actual rendered giant spider, but when you start re-using the giant spider for the 15th time, it kinda loses the effect somewhat.
<br>The game is very short, it took me about 80-90 minutes to complete it, and there is little- no replay value. What&apos;s the point in replaying a puzzle platformer if you know where to go and what the puzzles are?
<br>
<br>There is virtually no music at all in the game, just ambient sound effects. In my mind this is just pure laziness. Yes, no music gives an eerie atmosphere, but music can do so much more, and can create any kind of atmosphere you want to create, eg cave story.
<br>I suspect most people are rating this game highly simply because it&apos;s something different and unique, which is fine, god knows we don&apos;t need more Call of duty&apos;s and Battlefields, but please actually take into account other things apart from how unique the game is, especially as the majority of inde titles created have a unique aspect to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2529237">Expand</a></span>

The developing thinks they are being &apos;smart&apos; but really there is no way we are supposed to know how to solve most of the puzzles without dying.  You cannot even change the controls(result of lazy programming).  The spider part was literally the only part I enjoyed, and the atmosphere and sounds were spooky, that was a plus.  The cool lightning effect could vary at least once in a while.  Seriously, it was not worth the $2.50 it was on sale for.  This is not a troll post, or a hate post, I am being serious.  I seriously had to quit in the middle of the game because it was so stupid and annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2021961">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What makes this game suck: Very short, not worth $10, should be $5 at the most. I finished it in 3-4 hours. Over half of the puzzles require you to die at least once to see how to solve them (robs you of ever feeling like you are smart and adaptive when you have to die to say &quot;oh yeah, thats not going to work!). Half the puzzles arent even puzzles, they are just idiotic reflex / timing/jumping challenges.
<br>
<br>Summary: Nice idea, failure in execution making this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1741296">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re, let&apos;s say, more of a mature gamer like I am and have been around since the dawn of gaming, then the puzzle aspect of this game is just too simple.    I have to stress however that this does not take away the enjoyment of basically controlling an excellently animated, very intriguing character, in a feature length cartoon.    The third reason for the controversial rating is the re-playability, for me is NIL.  A bit like watching a Christmas movie, maybe I&apos;ll play it (watch it) again in a few years but that&apos;s it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1725532">Expand</a></span>

I believe I have spent 3 hours on the first try, another hour to get achievements, and the remaining 16 hours on getting the No point in dying achievement, which requires you to complete the game with 5 deaths or less. Having attained that achievement, and subsequently not touching the game since then, this is what I have to say: The game is interesting during the initial run. Mario-like gameplay and unique puzzles, together with the presence of the gothic greyscale theme of 2D sied scrolling, make this game quite an ejoyable and unique experience. However, that&apos;s basically it. There are, in fact, quite a number of shortcomings to this game. The first and most obvious one is, of course, it&apos;s short game play. 3 hours for 10 USD is real short, especially for a game in 2D. Furthermore, this game has absolutely no replayability. Unless you want to pass each and every level with perfect precision so that you can attain the achievement No Point in Dying, there really is no point in replaying the game. If that is not enough, this game&apos;s background music is relatively mundane, in a way that I have to load a few albums of my own if I don&apos;t want to fall asleep and end up pressing the wrong button and dying. Oh and one more problem. This game&apos;s controls is slightly problematic for the keyboard. You can adjust your movement speed with the xbox joystick, but that is not possible with the keyboard. This is a real problem in areas such as the part where you have to jump over a gap with the cocoon limbo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2094447">Expand</a></span>

In the other hand, Limbo is short... and most of all - not even challenging. You&apos;ll need about 3-5h to beat it from start to the end, depending on you how easily you get frustrated. Limbo constantly pushes your poor character to.. die. In your first playthrough there no chance to predict what obstacle awaits you. Most of the times, you die...  and with the new knowledge start from the nearest checkpoint. I guess it&apos;s not the way the platformer game should work... And believe me, most of the tasks are rather easy to perform, when you know how.  In conclusion, Limbo is a perfectly designed game... but it&apos;s better to watch than to play. I&apos;ve enjoyed the gameplay, but overall im disapointed.  Nevertheless, game deserves at least 6 points. I had a good time... but i guess only once, there&apos;s no need to play it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1988202">Expand</a></span>

I did not expect much from LIMBO at first, what in my head was &quot;Meh, another lazy indie puzzle game.&quot; But after I have played the game, I really like the black and white, very artistic. I played this game with my girlfriend besides me and guess what? We both enjoy it! Solving the puzzle together and sometimes screaming together. Good game and worth your time.</span>

I&apos;m not sure I particularly like it - relentlessly claustrophobic and grim. Some of the puzzles are ingenious and others pretty straightforward - reminded me of Braid a little.It became very frustrating to me in the latter stages as the loss of my hair will attest! Deaths galore because of my inability to time the moves to perfection - I just ended up getting more and more irritated and eventually just watched the ending on a walkthrough video. It seems I did not miss a great deal. Perhaps I just didn&apos;t have enough time to make the necessary corrections to timing - I was not after some Super Mario type challenges but instead something more cerebral and less punitive. Unique design and mood but just too irritating for me to derive any pleasure from playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2109834">Expand</a></span>

From the beginning you are thrown into a very dark depressing place with no real understanding of why you are there (not sure if this gets clearer really). The graphical style is beautifully creepy and the sound is second to none. Play with headphones turned up loud to get every rain sodden footstep and every sickening thud of the bear trap severing you in two. The puzzles are quite challenging requiring both skill and thought, with a great sense of achievement upon completion.

It may be short lived and the puzzles are kept rather simple, but the fact that a side scroller is able to carry heavier atmosphere and emotion than most other games just through it&apos;s visuals and sound design, is still amazing to me.</span>

I created an account on Metacritic just so I could review this game!  The graphics are all in black in white, done in the style of an old, flickering film.  The difficulty level of the puzzles are just about perfect - just hard enough that they provide a rewarding challenge, but not so difficult that you start tearing your hair out.  I only had to look up hints online about twice, and even then I had usually gotten the gist of the solution but just needed to be a bit more persistent.  The creativeness of the puzzle mechanics is superb and makes for some very interesting interactions.  One of my favorite things about the game is it&apos;s attention to subtle details in the physics of objects and little graphical flourishes that really make the experience rich and mesmerizing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2464040">Expand</a></span>

<br>That got old after the 1st or second puzzle.
<br>
<br>This played like an overgrown flash game.   The puzzles were sometimes interesting, but more often than not they were trial and error tedium.   (Try once, die on something you really couldn&apos;t have foreseen, try again)
<br>
<br>Possibly worth the $2.50 but I was sick of it even during the couple hours it took to complete.</span>

I rage-quit several times during my play-through.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t consider myself stupid, so I have to assume this game is intended for people &quot;less bound by the parameters of perfection&quot; (to borrow a line--in jest of course). Or perhaps it&apos;s a cultural thing. I prefer to feel like I&apos;m winning a game and/or accomplishing small feats versus simply dragging my lifeless corpse through to the bitter end.
<br>
<br>How is mandatory and repetitive death supposed to equate puzzle solving? Quick answer: it doesn&apos;t. It is simply trial-and-error memorization of sequences. That&apos;s not how puzzles are solved. Puzzles require taking a step back and looking at the pieces available to you. Usually all the pieces you need to solve a section of a puzzle are immediately available or at least recognizable. Most of the time you aren&apos;t even aware of the scope of a sequence until you&apos;ve died at about 3 or more points in the same sequence.
<br>
<br>Enough about the &quot;puzzles&quot;. Let&apos;s talk story. There is none. I found out more about the story reading the synopsis here on Metacritic than I did playing the actual game. Does that tell you how poor the narrative is? I imagine in order to reach the widest audience and avoid localization work, fees, etc. the developers simply opted not to have anything other than UI for text/dialogue.
<br>
<br>This shows a gross level of disregard for one of the key attractors for games in general but also incompetence to understand the fundamentals of building what one would claim is a game. Sure, it&apos;s been done before, but usually there is an overwhelmingly stunning performance of another aspect of the game that either negates or marginalizes the lack of story. Fighting and racing games come to mind, but both offer clear goals and rewards for player accomplishments.
<br>
<br>Both also offer clear control schemes which also was sadly lacking. Bringing us to controls, they are retarded--in the purest sense of the word. You would expect to be able to sprint in a game so reliant on timing for its &quot;action&quot; sequences. But no, an ambulatory, happy-go-lucky trot (strange considering the overarching tone) is the default pace and fastest you&apos;ll move beyond falling. You&apos;re only other means of interaction with the world is to scale ledges, drag boxes, swing on ropes, and throw switches; hardly an exhaustive list, especially for a &quot;puzzle&quot; game.
<br>
<br>Even this game&apos;s detractors concede that the graphics are good or at least artistically significant. Original, I&apos;ll grant it, but also annoying. Much of the shock and puzzlement rely upon the complete lack of color to differentiate assets, scenery, and traps. Some are blatantly obvious, such as giant sawblades, while others are indistinguishable from scenery until you venture into them, like bear-traps in ankle-high grass. I&apos;d hardly call that artistic. Fiendish is far more appropriate.
<br>
<br>For redeeming qualities, you have unlimited lives, and abundant checkpoints that prevent you from chucking your machine out the nearest window. But another downer to the unlimited lives is the nagging &quot;in-your-face&quot; pause between respawns to rub your face in the developer induced failures you&apos;re suffering.
<br>
<br>TLDR: this blasphemy of a game is not worth the bandwidth cost of downloading it. Watch it on YouTube and be grateful there are so many other games to play that don&apos;t require anger management or suicide prevention hotlines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2686132">Expand</a></span>

Some people clearly like that, but as the game progresses and the laggy controls start to have an impact on the game it becomes unbearable. There is a nice idea in here but the implementation on PC is just no good, maybe the console version was better and this is just a bad port.</span>

However, its puzzles are highly original. Visuals and main character is so dark, and the deaths are so cruel, you start wondering if it may be the darkest game you have ever played.</span>

It&apos;s amazing what it&apos;s able to accomplish with so few: and that is one very atmospheric puzzler. In all honesty, aside from the game play and puzzles, LIMBO is all atmosphere. From the moment the game starts we are already playing, given no obvious cues and expected to learn as we go. If you read the sales page, you probably already know you&apos;re looking for your sister in limbo. And honestly, that&apos;s all the information you&apos;ll be getting on that front. There are a lot of blanks, and as the player you&apos;re left to assume what it all means and how it relates into a story. If you pick up on the visual ques, I believe there is one dramatic story being told here. At any rate, I was going to give this game a 9/10 because it seems to be having some issues with my rumblepad (got it sorta fixed, but it&apos;s not a perfect solution), but honestly I&apos;m sure the issues will be fixed down the line otherwise the keyboard controls are quite doable. 10/10, another great example of how video games can be executed as an art form!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1714772">Expand</a></span>

I think the atmosphere is really what makes it stand out from anything else. I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s pretty short, but I felt it was well worth the $10 after playing the steam demo. I look forward to seeing what&apos;s in store for this odd, lost little kid in limbo.</span>

No grahpics settings either. There&apos;s one &quot;action&quot; button that controls everything you do that isn&apos;t moving around. The puzzles are really basic and uninspiring until you get to the last 5-7 chapters of the game. The game is under 3 hours long and I ended up wishing it was shorter because of how boring it really was. There are some nice easter eggs hidden throughout the game which was nice to see. Overall though it was a basic and boring puzzle-platformer. I don&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/limbo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2454182">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>limbo is a good puzzle game. Artistic and great environment, it still disappoint me a little bit to see little innovation in the mechanics. Good and interesting puzzles is a strong point but its nothing really special.<br>This game is worth the time to experience but only buy it when its on discount.</span>
