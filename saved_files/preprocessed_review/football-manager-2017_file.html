Once again, we have a game here which is nothing more than an over-elaborate spreadsheet that ignores your instructions.
<br>
<br>What do I mean by that? Well, there&apos;s a plethora of options here - you can tweak pretty much everything and anything you want - but none of that really matters when you come to a game and you see everything you set being ignored by the match engine, as players float around like they&apos;re on ice (again) and &apos;keepers laughably dive over weak shots, strikers sky over the bar from one yard out and so on. I&apos;m not expecting every player to follow instructions every game - I understand you can get beat and need to adjust etc. - but I expect at least a semblance of it playing out on the pitch. Since they changed the engine a few years back, everything you do doesn&apos;t seem to matter.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s not just me being bad at the game, or new to it. I&apos;ve played these titles since CM97/98. I still win in this game, but it isn&apos;t a result of my decisions beyond stumbling across one semi-broken 4-2-3-1 tactic and spamming Continue. Why bother with the intricacies if they make no discernible difference in getting a result and, indeed, are more likely to cost me one?
<br>
<br>The graphics engine is improved in terms of animations and fluency, but as noted above everyone just skates around. It&apos;s a completely immersion killer - just stick to the 2D engine unless you fancy a laugh at just how bad the action is portrayed in 3D.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s been barely any innovation elsewhere. Press conferences are still painfully annoying. Training settings are still convoluted. A few graphs have been added here and there. The one good addition (yet already repetitive) is the social media feed, except even a no-mark club from the lower reaches of Italian football apparently has the same social media profile as Real Madrid, but willing to let that slide.
<br>
<br>My overall impression is a game that is both stale and fundamentally broken. Every year we get a video from Miles going on about how this is the &quot;best year ever&quot;, yet the game barely changes, and what changes they do make add yet another pile of crap to sift through when the reality is they should be fixing things and removing what doesn&apos;t work to make the game accessible and accurate on the pitch. As it stands, this game is not fun - it&apos;s work. It&apos;s like a job you pay for and clock into because habit tells you to.
<br>
<br>Yes, blame can be placed on SEGA for forcing the yearly releases, but SI don&apos;t escape it - for a good three to four years now, they&apos;ve went down the FIFA path of releasing what basically amount to patches, and not good ones either. Get a grip and get back to basics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=6791535">Expand</a></span>

SI rarely responds to criticism. What used to be an all around inclusive game, that would attract football fans from all over the world and enhance their passion from the game, ended up in a very exclusive group who denounce change and innovation as if we lived in the middle ages. You would think when enthusiastic Joe comes up with a brilliant idea &quot;Director of Football&quot; mode, people would be excited. Yet their arrogant response is, I don&apos;t want SI to spend their resources on your thingy, cause those resources will be taken away from &quot;mine&quot;.
<br>
<br>And here is the catch. Where do those resources get spent on, cause with FM2017 we were waiting till the very last week for SI to announce what&apos;s new, when essentially nothing significant was new.
<br>
<br>The game is fun, but apart for the updated databases, innovation is long gone. All you get every new year is updated databases.
<br>
<br>There is a monopoly in the market of manager games and FM17 fully takes advantage of that. Had a rival company the resources of SI, they could potentially make a game 3 times more fun.
<br>
<br>Eventually I would suggest to either pass on the genre, until SI gets off their high horse and land on earth, or at least wait a few months to buy it on a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873334">Expand</a></span>

<br>Final Verdict 4/10
<br>Not a bad game but it is now getting to the point where the series is getting lazier than FIFA</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=6895711">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Been playing the series form the start, hell... as im writing this im looking at my FRAMED Eidos CM99/00 actual CD.
<br>
<br>Been buying the games and even &quot;working&quot; as a scout (they dont pay us, just copies of the games) on several.
<br>
<br>But this year the greed is just too much.
<br>
<br>They took FM16, ignored everything that needed to be fixed and added more of the things no one wanted.
<br>Fake Twitter? Yey... more bland samy fake media to deal with... its what i always wanted.
<br>Screw the revision of the lacking training system... you guys get fake twitter!
<br>
<br>Another great new feature is to add your own face in the game, as in have your picture stretched over a 3D avatar (that serves no purpose what so ever, mind you)  in the most horrible and unnatural way possible. Im no sex symbol... but even the wife says im not that much &quot;Cathulu-looking&quot; (actual quote).
<br>
<br>Not even gonna touch on the AI, as i know how hard it is to balance things.
<br>But this year it seems freakishly badly designed.
<br>Its advertised as &quot;Improved Decision Making&quot; but by the looks of it, most defensive players just got lobotomized.
<br>Almost reminds me of 2008 with the infamous injury &quot;tweak&quot;, that meant you would lose 1-3 players each math until it got fixed in a patch.
<br>
<br>To surmise,
<br>Its still FM, its playable, its fun. Its what we already got in FM16.
<br>FM16 is a much better game, because its missing its Fake Twitter and Lobotomy.
<br>Just keep playing FM16. Your are missing absolutely nothing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=6928962">Expand</a></span>

<br>Take FM16. Play it for months. Manage to enjoy it, after the usual February patch.

<br>
<br>The essence of these management sims is building a team and I&apos;m not sure why people get so caught up in needing to have up to date squads etc. One in-game window later and squads are going to be out of sync with reality anyway. So really, picking up anything from 2010-2016 for a fraction of the price is more cost effective.
<br>
<br>That and 2017 is a bad FM installment in itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=7348805">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First off as pretty much stated it is nothing more than 2016 with a new skin. There is almost nothing of note in the game other than the standard up to date player stats, transfers etc.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the list of bugs in this game is larger than ever. The main point this year seems to be after a few years it becomes impossible to sign a player, which as a Football Sim you would call a major stumbling block.
<br>
<br>After a few season the transfer system shows how broken it is whereby every player you want to sign will cost you at least 10x there current value. Youth players of 16 and and 17 valued at 50k will only leave for 10-20 million pound transfers unless of course the AI will bid for the player who will sign at a price nearer to the actual value. Also dont be thinking the upside of this will mean you can sell players for a higher price than their value as it is next to impossible to sell any player for more than their value.
<br>
<br>Taking this up on SI dedicated forum will result in nothing more than a group of poster and moderators ganging up and attacking anyone who mentions this, telling everyone they &quot;just need to learn how to player the game&quot;. It then becomes obvious this is who SI are now targeting with the game as any idea or suggestion that doesnt fit into this small groups idea of how the game should be is &quot;wrong&apos; &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;not how your suppost to play the game&quot;.
<br>
<br>The game now requires far too much time to play and enjoy and as somebody who has a full time job will often spend a weeks worth of game time going through player happiness, loan offers on every player of your club and if you want to try and sign a player as mentioned above maybe factor in a few more hours of game time before you want to play an in game match.
<br>
<br>And talking about player happiness expect after every bid for a player they will want a new contract and refuse to play if you say no. If managing a big club and have a number of star players who attract offers expect to have to hand them 3/4 contracts a season.
<br>
<br>Again taking this up with the support just leads to responces of &quot;you cant expect the game to work like this if you dont want to give them a new contract each week sell them and learn how to play the game properly&quot;.
<br>
<br>The other thing to mention is FM Touch, formally classic but now a standalone game. This would be more along the lines of what I would enjoy playing as I dont have the time to spend 3/4 talking with ficticious footballers, but it still lacks a lot of features to bring it up to a half decent game. One major one is the use of custom Databases from the games editor. Taking a look through SI forum there is a full thread on requests for FM Touch (or classic its being going a few years) and every page is littered with people asking for the custom DB and not one person has recieved a reply. They cant even look at a feedback and request thread and impliment something 90% of people have asked for.
<br>
<br>After numerous years of buying this game year in and year out it looks like 17 is finally the one that stops me buying again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=7332311">Expand</a></span>

The lack of immediate, responsive returns you make to players/tactics. The minimal amount of written reactionary content from NPC&apos;s for a game thats been around nearly 20 years. A 3D engine that is surplus to requirements in a strategy game that already had a solid 2D engine, yet has so much time invested in it but has hardly improved in its physics engine over the last 3 or 4 years.
<br>
<br>And yet, even if forced by publishers to release a new game every year, no fundamental change has been applied to these issues. It&apos;s like you can see into the production meetings:
<br>
<br>- It needs to be shinier.
<br>- We need a new feature (whether its useful or not) to advertise about so it can differentiate from the last year.
<br>- Make sure to focus efforts on fixing things that specifically make it easier for only a first time user to play.
<br>- If there&apos;s any time left, you can focus on graphs &quot;and stuff&quot;.
<br>
<br>The result is a game that focuses near entirely on its aesthetic, and nearly ignores what makes the game interesting and competitive, the football strategy.
<br>
<br>If you appreciate planning out tactics, preparing how to counter your opponent, and appreciate what it feels like to actually interact with the footballing world in terms of players, the press and coaching staff, this game isn&apos;t for you. But if you&apos;d really like to try it, play FM2015. When the new UI stops mattering and you can see into the game mechanics that matter, they&apos;re the exact same game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=6841177">Expand</a></span>

Like another user wrote these yearly editions seems like nothing more than a patches. Yes the match engine keeps getting a little better by each year, and yes they added a social media profile, but it is not enough to justify the pricetag.</span>

At full price (55!!) is really a joke.I do not recommend it to anyone who has bought FM in the past three years, because the differences are few.</span>

And I&apos;m not talking about the fact it&apos;s a ctrl+c ctrl+v FM 2016, I&apos;m talking about the same old problems about the match engine completely ignoring your &apos;tactical instructions&apos;. If I set my team to play deep, pass fast and try a conter attack, I am the one who gets conter attacked! In the same match, the goals my team scores are all slow paced, short passing and working the ball into the box, which I didn&apos;t select, or set pieces, while in a match which I go for possession, BOOM, opp are caught on the break! And cmon, believe it or not, 2017&apos;s goalkeepers are EVEN WORSE than all the previous fm! I&apos;m serious!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=7376729">Expand</a></span>

In the middle of the season always comes a great crisis and for several weeks it is impossible to win with anyone! Is this a joke? Motivating players does not work, and tired opponents run around the pitch just as fast as fresh players. I have been playing this series for a long time, but this part is a failure. The game is not playable at all and you can not enjoy it. Without cheating and playing a few times a game, you can not even win a draw. It is a shame that you have to go back to the older parts to be able to comfort some of your team&apos;s victories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=7324819">Expand</a></span>

<br>Recomendar&#xED;a antes el modo carrera de FIFA como juego de manager qu esta cosa, una aut&#xE9;ntica chapuza de juego, deber&#xED;an pagarnos por jugar a el.

<br>No recomiendo para nada la compra de esto, ni a&#xFA;n qu&#xE9; lo vea&#xED;s por 0,01&#x20AC;.
