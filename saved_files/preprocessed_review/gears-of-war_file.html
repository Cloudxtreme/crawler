Notice all the comments about how &quot;console gamers don&apos;t know what good games are&quot; and so on. Not saying this is a masterpiece sitting next to all other PC games, but this is definitely up there and not deserving of a measly 5!</span>

However, the single-player campaign suffer&apos;s from offering a likable story and enduring atmosphere. Technically, this game has aged well. The game engine is in good shape, with solid graphics (even up to this date) and I have not encountered any errors, bugs, etc. What stands as a positive remark is it&apos;s gameplay. The shooting is generally satisfying, treating the reload quick-time as an opportunity to boost your damage attack. There is a great variety of scenarios, that offer different perspectives to the shooting mechanics. Unfortunately, the story is underdeveloped. No details regarding the world or the characters. The protagonists are just stereotypes of soldiers that you can hardly relate and the atmosphere dissipates from the very first level because the maps feel more like levels for shooting and not situations for people to survive the war. So, the storytelling is poorly executed. This game is certainly not for those people who seek a story driven campaign. The atmosphere can&apos;t serve it&apos;s purpose because Gears of War is gameplay-oriented. In conclusion, it has disappointed me from offering me a story-driven experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4425118">Expand</a></span>

Great maps and gameplay, also you can almost hide behind anything which is great. Not to mention, the weapons in this game are fantastic. See this game on the shelf?

I only ever tried the console version for about 15 minutes before, and I feel as though it held up, even if I am a sucker for extra content. This game has great graphics and good controls. It isn&apos;t a great PC game, but I can&apos;t think of any way to make the controls better than actually having a chat option, instead of opening the console and typing &quot;say etc.&quot; That just gets plain annoying. Enemies are really tough though. The basic locust will take half a Lancer clip before dropping on the easiest difficulty, and most of a full one on the hardest difficulty. If I empty even a quarter of a clip in to a marine from an AK47, he&apos;s still going to at least be grievously wounded. Then the tougher ones aren&apos;t any tougher. A Boomer take three headshots to drop on Normal with a sniper, three to drop on Insane. Difficulty sky-rockets once you get on to the Insane difficulty. You die very fast and enemies die half as fast. There isn&apos;t much variety in weapons, so you just need to worry about one for the situation. Its a gore-fest too. How many games allow you to run up and stick a grenade to an opponent. I&apos;ve heard about a lot of very good PC games, but as I have only recently started gaming on the PC, I haven&apos;t played them. But I liked this game. If you&apos;re looking for a good tactical game with a lot of gore, go for it. If you want an actual FPS, this isn&apos;t for you. As PC games go, its not the best, but it is still fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=412872">Expand</a></span>

This is a solid port to the PC people. The single button system that allows you dodge, dive, scale and cover works great; it spices things up without complicating this shooter game. The campaign revolves around a simple and clich&#xE9; story, but it is told really well with top-notch voice acting and exciting music. The graphics and sound effects are of high quality. Nothing beats the sound of your enemy being ripped apart by your chainsaw equipped rifle! I had the scale the game to medium graphic settings to keep a smooth framerate, but the game still looks impressive. So make sure that you have at least a decent PC by today&apos;s standards. The multiplayer is really fun (but tough, be prepared for your butt to be kicked for a while until you start gaining some good experience), and this is coming from a guy who really doesn&apos;t like to play multiplayer. The only reason why this game doesn&apos;t get a 10 or 9 from is due to some instability and bug issues. The game has a nasty habit of sometimes crashing to desktop during loading the savegames or intense gunfights in the campaign. And in the multiplayer you sometimes come across this weird bug which makes you and other players &quot;phase&quot; from place to place. Also, some people may find the really long installation process and the not-so-simple on-line sign-up procedure annoying. But any score lower than 8 would be an insult to the developer Epic and their game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=405547">Expand</a></span>

The simplicity and the cover system seem like they would hinder the experience, you&apos;d think that this was a detriment, but really once you get into it, they provide a skill cap that is ridiculously high, pressing a single button to take cover and leave cover seems like a waste, but it takes a ridiculous amount of skill to master this in multiplayer. This was one of those few games that had so much potential for a competitive shooter scene, multiplayer was fantastic, out of the few people who played the PC version online, I was certainly a name you would see frequently, and high on the scores at that. The reason I stopped playing this game is two fold, both problems stemming from poor PC support, first off, the game causes my graphics card to glitch out and crashes my display drivers, so I uninstalled it, and lastly, the game itself has unbelievably poor PC support. You have to do some ridiculous things to simply download the patches for the game so you can play multiplayer, getting the game to work properly is just finicky as hell. This game would most certainly still be installed on my computer and I&apos;d still be playing it, if Epic games would have taken their time to properly support their PC version so it is reliable. It&apos;s a shame I have to give a great game a 6 for this, but it is just touch and go, and the people who play this game online are dwindling because of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1669753">Expand</a></span>

The cover based combat works fairly well and the interactive weapon reloads adds a nice touch. Movement controls are rigid and a little clunky. Your squad-mates have no proper AI and the weapons, while interesting, lack weight. At first, the game puts you in a variety of interesting situations and the environmental brain-teases are fun. The enemies are absolute bullet sponge. When behind cover, you are virtually invincible which encourages you to coward behind and shoot from afar; This goes against the grain of the experience in terms of dynamism and pace. The difficulty spikes and the battles become repetitive and start to drag halfway through; This is likely a budgeted attempt to make up for the lack of interesting new set pieces and design scenarios. The hit detection system is unreliable, especially in third person mode, often leading to unfair deaths. The checkpoint system is questionable since it will have you often replay through entire sections previously beaten, artificially lengthening the game time. The story and characters are comically bad; This is very much a product of its time, likely designed to encourage young Americans to go in Irak. The environment and overall graphics are very detailed and aged quite well; That said, the game is visually monotonous, and the locations are quite repetitive and lifeless. GOW is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, I had a descent time with it, and there are some commendable design choices and game-play innovations. In Co-op,  this game must have been quite fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=6300926">Expand</a></span>

I was glad to finish it, so that I would never have to play it again.</span>

Mediocre, repetitive, corridor and cover based TPS should be just left for the xbox console kiddie to enjoy. This is a kind of relief and salvation for the PC community. Disappearance of such kind of mindless TPS franchise in PC is a welcome move.</span>

Games for Windows - Live is a mess. PC gamers have very little to be excited about when having to use the GfW-Live - which is relatively featureless compared to Live for XBOX 360.

The combat is repetitive with little variation. The only variation is with the enemies tactics. The AI team mates obviously have downsyndrome as they try to rush into enemy turrets and get instantly whacked. The weapons are pathetic. While having a chain sword attached to my gun is cool the mechanics behind it make it almost worthless. The body armor the characters wear is worthless and most assault rifles are the equivalent of a pellet gun to the enemies (campaign). They say use the shotgun, but a game that forces one to use a single weapon isn&apos;t worth ones time. Despite every ones &apos;glorious reviews&apos; the game is simply a sub-par shooter that is not worth any ones time. You might like it, I think it is personally over-hyped, over glorified, and sub-par...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2945457">Expand</a></span>

After playing COD4 and Crysis, this game was deleted from my computer 3 minutes after I finished playing with it. I&apos;d rather poke me eyes out and fill it with lye than playing this game again!</span>

I only ask because the PC game I just played was nothing short of awfully mediocre and I can&apos;t see anything about it that would make me want to play it for more than about 30 minutes. Things started badly with the installer; I wasn&apos;t paying attention and so missed the &quot;More Options button&quot;, meaning that after a single click the game was installing to the C drive. One quick cancel and restart later, I was treated to probably the longest install for a game that I&apos;ve ever encountered, with a full 25 minutes of &quot;Decompressing Files&quot; after it had actually copied them. Undeterred, I fired up the game, configured my settings and launched straight into action...or at least I would have were it not for the fact that the game helpfully informed me that I couldn&apos;t save my progress without a Windows Live profile - the dialogues for which only had the Xbox controls listed for navigation, making the whole experience somewhat tedious. When I finally got into the game I have to say it looked very pretty and it had a suitably clich&#xE9;d storyline, but the gameplay itself way just...flat, I guess. Run across open area, dive into cover, empty several clips into each identical enemy to bring them down pausing briefly to play the reloading minigame and then repeat ad nauseum. What really annoyed me was the seemingly random way in which your health is calculated; you can take an arbitrary amount of fire and then a red thing appears in the middle of the screen, then you take some more fire and a coloured-in red thing appears in the middle of the screen, then you take some more fire and die. Hiding for a few seconds makes the red things go away. No health bar, health gauge, health-o-meter or health display of any kind, just &quot;OK, Not OK, Dead&quot;. Maybe I&apos;m missing something here, perhaps the game is stunningly amazing on the 360 and they&apos;ve just screwed up the port - it wouldn&apos;t be the first time - but as far as I can see there is absolutely *nothing* special about Gears of War in any way and I certainly wouldn&apos;t pay &#xA3;35 for it, in fact given the choice I doubt that I&apos;d even download it for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=405292">Expand</a></span>

I am sad to say that this game is mediocre at best. Visually, it is a very striking game at times, with an excellent cinematic feel. However, the visuals are rather repetitive during the majority of gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, there is really very little to speak of. This is one of the most linear games that I have played since Dragon&apos;s Lair. Almost every step that you take has been predetermined by the developers; they may as well have drawn a bright red path on the ground where they expect you to walk throughout the game. Follow the path, hide behind cover, fire at popup targets, repeat. It does take you through a story that is interesting enough, although nothing very special and riddled with cliches and stereotypical voice acting. The AI is borderline abominable, both enemy and friendly, as though they were all mounted on tracks in a carnival shooting game. The audio is pretty good, though, with a lot of audio cues used throughout the game to help emulate a more dynamic experience. The controls were a nice surprise, since that is typically where most console ports fall down, but the control in Gears is actually pretty solid. I never really felt like I was fighting with them to get my character to do what I wanted, which is extremely important in a shooter. Overall, Gears of War is a decent bit of fun to jump into for a few minutes of coop or multiplayer mayhem while killing time before doing something else, but it doesn&apos;t come close to being the amazing game that it was portrayed as on the Xbox 360, and barely qualifies as a decent PC game in general, especially at a time when other far better titles are hitting the shelves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=405964">Expand</a></span>

Horrible movement, terrible controls, no first person option, crap burst mode on the basic weapon, sluggish, gimmicky, confused, nonsense. This was NOT a first person shooter. This was NOT a PC game.

The fine details in the environment and characters are noticeable, but that&apos;s all that&apos;s original about this game. This should be given for free as a tech demo for their engine - I wouldn&apos;t pay any money for it.</span>

One mistake I won&apos;t be repeating. As the disparity between the Xbox and PC user scores will illustrate, this is a pretty good shooter for the XBOX, where they don&apos;t have any to compare it to. It compares favorably with Halo, but has been wearisomely flogged in other forums; Halo is mediocre outside the confines of its fan base and Gears of War rates _lower_ than it in every way. The video effects are surprisingly good for such a game. Things look pretty nice, no where near as good as Halo, Bioshock or Crysis; But given the other down falls I was seriously expecting Doom graphics. The terrain look fairly nice, when the graphics are cranked up and the enemies look pretty nice for the shallow automatons that they are. The main characters look decent, if reminding the author of apes or overly developed babies. In the course of the game I had to marvel at how how round and soft the game&apos;s sole black character looked. He look as if he was a large toddler with veiny arms. Disturbing to say the least. The sound effects are fairly decent, if half hearted in comparison with the sole focus of development: The combat system. The voice acting is terrible and one dimensional, but I won&apos;t take the game to task too harshly for this as the game is quite playable with the sound muted. No ambiance and no character development is lost. The combat is quite adequate with sound either on or off.

The &quot;cover system&quot; is in place I think becasue console players can&apos;t cope with the concept of hiding. Menus are designed for a xbox pad which is sloppy. Live is a joke, only telling me I can&apos;t save after I created a profile that was apparently offline then not letting me create an online one. It gets one because what I saw of it was pretty. But I only saw less then 10 minutes because I couldn&apos;t take anymore.

How typical of Microsoft to use people who paid $50 as beta testers for their new compulsory system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=409893">Expand</a></span>

Like a pop up wooden bad guy SAS training sim level. The taking cover thing is dire. One key to take cover? What about moving behind cover as in COD4. This game annoyed me because I buy after reading reviews. They all lied. This is a worthless game.</span>

I tend to spend more time dealing with crashes than I do actually playing the game. Additionally, do not believe the system requirements. The requirements listed are the bare minimums. In order to play this game, you need a system that can handle Crysis at near max. As a final note, this game may run decently on Vista (I have noted that Vista Ultimate users have the best luck with getting this to work), Gears just does not run properly on a XP based system.  I recommend that you wait for additional patches before buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=68215">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is a very good Xbox 360 -&gt; Pc port. The controls are very good, aiming with mouse is very fluent and visuals are very good. On game play side it&apos;s fun, the story is interesting and the gun play is awesome. The only big downside I see is that sometimes it can get a little repetitive. With that said, I personally think it&apos;s one of the best shooters out here on Pc.</span>

The duck button doesn&apos;t seem to work unless I am taking cover (pointless), so I&apos;m required to take cover all the time. The problem is that this greatly restricts where I can and cannot be at any given time. Why is the map so big if 95% of it is a dead zone? Even the first monsters in the game will kill you with just a few shots, so most of the wide open area is a cock tease. This game is not worth $50, but it&apos;s worth getting if you see in the bargain bin for $20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420879">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay boils down to a game of room to room peekaboo. Cover system is alright, but I&apos;d rather the game let me do things manually, Press a duck key, a jump and lean keys . Looks nice though.</span>

Ignore the comments about repetitive combat; if you want to play that way, expect to get bored fast, but if you want to try out new ways and new weapons to obliterate your enemies, you&apos;ll have a blast (literally). Chainsawing the bad guys never gets old, and the squad-based element - while annoying at times - makes a nice change from standard one-man-against-the-world FPSs. The environments are huge and well-done, and effectively complement the combat. Unfortunately, what could have been a great game is hampered by a lack of character and plot development - and don&apos;t let me get started on the crashing, which is a direct result of a fact that this game is a straight port from the Xbox. Hopefully Epic will learn from their mistakes and ensure that GoW2 is properly polished, before releasing it for PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=420505">Expand</a></span>

Some of the larger enemies make the repetition even more obvious, with the player having to repeat the fire/duck/reload process for four of five clips worth of ammo. The story and characters (such as they are) are massively forgettable, with most of the mission objectives being so generic that you end up just following the trail of enemies to the next checkpoint. The visuals, while occasionally showing great finesse (the character models are pretty good) suffer from hugely overblown textures and reflections, giving the game an ugly overexposed look. The graphic style is a matter of taste, but the endless grey/brown/desaturated blue levels did nothing for me (with the exception of a very pretty rain-soaked section). Gears of War seems to me to be more like an arcade game than anything else. It reminds me in some ways of Time Crisis, with the cover and gunplay being everything while story, character and creative identity are left as little more than footnotes. Casual gamers will probably dig it, but those of us spoiled by more complex and intricate titles like Call of Duty 4, Bioshock or the Half-Life series will likely tire of it pretty quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=421896">Expand</a></span>
