Then the camera view... it is one of the worst I have ever seen in a video game. In a game, where it&apos;s bloody dark, and it&apos;s vital to always see the character in a proper angle. At the music box (piano sheet) I gave up. Three consecutive rooms, full of ghosts and plenty of chair and other furniture blocking the way. I could never correctly guess the distance between me and the supernatural beings - only the vibration of my controller helped me a little. They touch you, it&apos;s game over, you may continue from the last save point, like in Alien Isolation. But in that game the first person view let you see the freaking surroundings. These ghosts rather teleport back to their guardpost after a few steps of pursuit, so you just can&apos;t outplay them, or they float after you till dawn. It&apos;s pure luck whether you lose them or become ghost food. I get this &quot;light is your only chance of survival, otherwise darkness absorbs you&quot; focused gameplay, I have beaten Alan Wake and Amnesia. But this piece is hard to enjoy. Beyond lame, nonsense and irritating pursuits, I found the puzzles way too childish. Then the graphic - unique and gives a nice mood to the player, but not good-looking at all, rather banal and ugly often. Also I didn&apos;t feel the music, it seemed very minimal, however the sound effects are great. All in all, even Murdered Soul Suspect was a better game... I am hugely disappointed, since from teh first trailer I was looking forward to see how this pearl does. Well, after opening the seashell, this one has lost it&apos;s shine way too early. Shame. And about the story: starts out promising and exiting, but I nothing outstanding, I have seen better (after canceling, I watched the remaining game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/white-night/user-reviews?user_review_id=5052849">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Story is good but I&apos;m only 2 hours in so I don&apos;t know what is in reserve for me.
<br>
<br>In reality, I would give the game a 8/10 but I give it 10/10 because of peoples who wants to skip the game with a button.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/white-night/user-reviews?user_review_id=5053316">Expand</a></span>

Ok, maybe it&apos;s not THAT bad, but it&apos;s not good either. The story seems interesting enough, the atmosphere is ok for a horror story, and the black and white depiction of the game world adds to the overall quality. But then comes the technical side of the game. The camera angles are terrible. Most of the time you have no idea what you&apos;re doing. Then there are the controls. On PC with each camera angle change the controls slightly change. One direction becomes antother. Left becomes up or down or sometimes even right, and before you know it, you run into a wall, instead of going clean through the door. Not cool when you have to run away from a ghost. Secondly you operare mostly in the darkness or near darkness with nothing but light from matches to rely on. That&apos;s ok, it adds to the atmosphere. What&apos;s not ok is when you have, several times during the game, go through a complete darkness with no light source whatsoever. Apart from a spot of light it&apos;s pitch black. Your character is black and there is no way to discern him from the background. Thus you get lost, a lot. I had to replay one stupid scene, not a difficult one!, 10 times, because I had no idea where my character was and got completely lost in the darknes. 10 secs in the dark and you&apos;re going coo-coo. Load. Repeat. Aaaaaaaargh! I managed to get through 3 out of 6 chapters, around 6 hours of game time in total. Wasn&apos;t able to finish. Game with potential, but really unpolished.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/white-night/user-reviews?user_review_id=5392619">Expand</a></span>
