The Player Characters themselves have Wonky and Strange Animations, but the Zombies are well animated. The graphics are good, The choice of weapons is decent. Little disappointed at the fact that there were so few guns. I love the idea of limited ammo and shots count but there&apos;s very few choices in guns. It has a few glitches mostly graphical, it is annoying though that all the dialogue in the game is centered around Co-op along with the Cinematics. If your playing solo it can be somewhat annoying and confusing seeing the other characters even though they arent with you.<br>I did enjoy the game though. Story was pretty lame and quests were down right appalling as if they were written by 9 year olds. One such quest, &quot;Were starving here! We need more food, Go to the gas stations and pick us up two boxes of Juice!&quot; .... Um.... Ok..... Relevancy 0 Strange 1. Anyways if you can overlook the strange quest flaws its a good game to play-thru and then maybe shelve or sell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749517">Expand</a></span>

<br>Aside from that, it&apos;s hit-and-miss. The story-line is (quite frankly) missing almost entirely. This isn&apos;t the first game to put you in a quarantined area with unexplained zombies, give you a weapon and say &quot;go to town,&quot; but aside from gathering supplies, you&apos;re never really given a reason for having to move from survivor camp to camp. If the summary is true, and you&apos;re trying to find a missing wife, then I apparently wasn&apos;t paying attention at all during the introduction, because I have no idea what that&apos;s referencing. This game has many bugs, and they can be crippling. Running V1.2, some of the bugs I&apos;ve encountered include:
<br>1) I occasionally have to toggle between full screen and windowed and back to re-enable the sprint feature, which is crippling (It took me awhile to figure out something was definitely amiss)
<br>2) I lost a very powerful weapon into thin air after I had just spent a couple thousand repairing and upgrading it, which isn&apos;t crippling, but just plain disappointing
<br>3) A horrible, HORRIBLE UI port from what was PLAINLY a console menu to the PC. The mouse is incredibly slow on the menus, everything has to be clicked on because the arrows are very clunky, and some options are simply grayed out for no reason (usually because you have to have an Xbox 360 controller plugged in)
<br>4) Weapons on your &quot;quick select&quot; menu tend to be replaced by whatever you pick up off the ground, with the most popular being alcohol. This tends to result in irritation if you notice it in time, or at the worst, you find yourself charging into a fight and then quickly downing a bottle of Jack instead of slashing a weapon. Definitely not a fun brawl.
<br>This game is still fun, and definitely worth a rent for its sandbox environment, collectibles, upgrade and deterioration systems, weapon modifications, and the intense firefights (when you face human enemies). The zombie slaying doesn&apos;t really get stale, but it does lessen in excitement from the beginning of the game. As of where I am right now, I have seen about 5 different classes of zombies, and each definitely had their own unique attacks and corresponding player strategies I needed to use. A good rent (assuming you stick with the PC version, Xbox version might be better).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757501">Expand</a></span>

It was an amazing amount of fun, really engrossing, just a flat out great time. Yes there was the clipping issues i noticed a few times. Than all of a sudden when im driving around my game just crashes, and the night goes downhill from there.<br><br>Game Receives a 7.. and i feel i am being incredibly generous there. It is an amazing amount of fun but they release a game that to say its buggy really understates the point. Friday they are suppose to release a patch, so wait till after Friday to pick up your copy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742478">Expand</a></span>

Since there will be patches though, I&apos;m only judging the core gameplay here because I&apos;m sure it will improve as they fix it up. For me, this game has so much I&apos;ve wanted in a zombie game where it takes place in a large open world and supplies are realistically limited so that you really have to scavenge for supplies which encourages exploration. The combat in this game is a lot of fun and the gore from beating down zombies with blunt objects is incredibly satisfying and with the limb breaking it&apos;s also realistic. There&apos;s also a TON of sidequests and a lot of weapon mods to craft which will be taking up even more of your time. As far as graphics go, the island looks gorgeous and even with the bright sunny atmosphere, it managed to scare me many times with the infected screams and other ambiance. Only real flaws I&apos;ve found with this game is that the coop seems rather broken as of now and the story and character development is subpar to say the least. I&apos;d say this is a must buy AFTER it&apos;s patched up a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742940">Expand</a></span>

Its as If Borderlands and Dead Rising got together and had a baby, that baby would be dead Island. This game has rich four player co-op, simple yet effective story, a deep weapon crafting and character customization system. Do you love zombies? Exploration? character advancement? item collections? co-op? then dead Island is a no brain-er. The only reason this game doesn&apos;t get a ten is due to a slightly bugged user interface that should be fixed this week with a patch.<br><br>I would like to add that Dead Island on a high end pc is the ultimate zombie killing experience. This version has no texture loading issues, great control and much better graphics over all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1741897">Expand</a></span>

With gameplay this solid, though, the narrative sinking into the background while you and your friends are on voice chat suits it just fine.<br><br>The controls are slick, your actions feel purposeful. The melee combat is really well done, I was definitely impressed. This is all rather insubstantive so let me take you through a cool moment:<br><br>My friend and I saw this swole zombie by the edge of a pool full of bodies. I threw my cleaver at it, my buddy threw both his knives (and was then out of weapons). I moved in start wailing on it with my baseball bat, but it punched me and I went flying into the pool. As my character stumbled to his feet, the bodies in the pool got up.<br><br>I went into Fury Mode and started boxing them and my friend had to walk up to the big guy and pull his knives out of him - while he was still up and dangerous - in order to continue packing in the damage.<br><br>The game is full of things like this.

After being linked to this metacritic thing and seeing how biased people&apos;s votes were, I just had to make an account myself to rate it for myself.<br><br>The game was quite nice even when there was obvious bugs/issues that literally consumed 2 hours for me and my friends in trying to get a single lobby going where all of us were in the same game. Of course after we got that out of the way, we only suffered minor issues such as graphic cards overheating and crashing someone&apos;s computer and crashing our game due to random things like, crashing into a female zombie with a truck. But overall, I found that the game had a huge potential. Its intended features/concepts are present but just left in a lackluster manner due to the known bugs/issues that was released on the first day for the US. So I say give this game a chance, and ignore the &apos;rage&apos; from these people that are bringing this game&apos;s score down to as low as 4.4. Chances are you&apos;ll like this game since it offers a lot of fun and exploration, as well as replay value. Oh and in before massive negative votes on this review post from those same raging nerds that can&apos;t just go have a life and maybe return late in the evening to find a better patch---Or something, rather than wasting their time trying to defame a game after only a single cluster of issues (admittedly a huge cluster). Because don&apos;t get me wrong, they should have avoided all of this via quality assurances or something.<br><br>Was actually going to give this game a 8/10 or 9/10 because it was quite satisfying for me, excluding all the annoying bugs and the inability in &apos;push to talk&apos; or having an easier way to arrange lobbies. But since the game&apos;s score has been shot down by angry nerds, I must give it a 10. Enjoy the game when it&apos;s fully patched.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742241">Expand</a></span>

Dead Island is an extremely fun game, that is worth the money . Logging in and playing with a friend for the first time is a blast, as you hack and slash every zombie that comes your way and you always scream &quot;Ooooohhhh&quot; whenever you slaughter a zombie. The co-op set up was very convenient, but lacked hints or a clue on when your co-op buddy can join you, after the Prologue your friend can join. Otherwise the co-op seems to really play smoothly and not suffer from any other issues that I came across.<br><br>Experience: I am a gamer who does not fully believe every &quot;Professional&quot; reviewer, I look through them and then try the game myself, and find that most of the time I enjoy it even if the review was abysmal. It all matters about the experience you have with the game. As I mentioned before I played with my buddy through the co-op system, and we had a blast. The game does not seem to get old, the hacking and slashing, the gore and the exploration is just a pure treat. Every swing and throw I have done was an experience I have never felt before in a game, the brutal contact you make with a melee weapon to a zombie is just satisfying and you can feel their head crunch and necks snap. Overall Dead Island is definitely an experience you&apos;ll remember for a long time, and especially with a friend, you&apos;ll be laughing a lot.<br><br>(re)Playability: Every gamer wants a game worth the money, and a game they can come home and enjoy hours on end, and this game is one of them. There are a TON of side-quests waiting for your acceptance and a vast amount of weaponry. There are weapon upgrade/repair tables around the world, which can be used for creating weapons, repairing weapons and upgrading weapons, and every single weapons has at least 3 upgrades giving you a chance to craft some crazy weapons and gather materials for blueprints and look for weapons. That&apos;s a lot of (re)playability there. Overall the (re)playability is very high, and I can tell that the game will offer another or...another play though, and I could tell there is too much to explore, and you won&apos;t be exploring it all on the first play through.<br><br>Graphics and Animation: When I first starting playing the game my first reaction was &quot;Wow this look nice&quot; Its a rare case to find an open-world game to look so beautiful. As a 3d Environment Artist for games myself, I study the game world (I know nerdy) and I just felt in love with the environment, it is very well done for a open-world game and they deserve two thumbs up, but one thing I noticed is that some zombies tend to look too &quot;wrinkly&quot; the normal maps on some enemies are a bit &quot;over exaggerated&quot;compared to others and seems that the normal infected look better than the bosses, which was kind of odd to me, but it is not too much of a deal. The lip-syncing is not very good, but its nothing to ditch the game for, and the cut scenes are &quot;meh&quot;  The animations for the zombies are great though as they switch and run at you, there is one kind of zombie that I seriously acted real (if zombies were in existence of course) Overall the art in this game is well done.<br><br>Conclusion: As I mentioned this is my early review on things from what I experienced, and take what you want from this, but what I can say is Dead Island is getting some harsh reviews for things like: Glitches, story, lip-syncing, performance,etc&quot; and this game JUST came out, I feel that it is quite unfair. The reason this is not a 10 is because of the rumors I heard on a Dev-build in which I figured because of the no-clipping, and some evidence of code that a steam user posted on the forums. This hopefully should be fixed, but I don&apos;t rely on that, as I mainly rely on my enjoyment and experience I had, and I already had an amazing experience with the game that is not even finished yet! Are you still debating whether to get this game or not? Well the comparison of &quot;Fallout 3 with Zombies&quot; is actually fairly true, it is really great. This game is the first game in a long time that I look forward everyday to play its the &quot;I can&apos;t wait to get home from ____ to play this game&quot; kind of feeling, and I haven&apos;t felt that in a long time. I don&apos;t blame anyone for waiting to get the game when things clear up a bit, but this is a must get no matter when you decide to play it. 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742013">Expand</a></span>

Also anyone who says it&apos;s a port should have their ratings taken away because they don&apos;t know that it&apos;s actually not a port the pc just got the wrong version upon release. But it&apos;s still has plenty of fun in it.</span>

I have had no problem with controls and any issues other trolls have problems with. If u like survival horror, rpg and fps melee you will like this game. If you like games being a movie, then go away.</span>

In it&apos;s current state, Dead Island is not playable.<br><br>First, you have the sound. The sound works intermittently, one moment you have working sound  and the next moment you have piercing static or a repeating sound clip. Next you have the actual playability. Dead Island freezes and lags constantly, even on excellent hardware. It&apos;s beyond annoying to attempt playing a game under those conditions.<br><br>In the end, Dead Island does have the potential to be a fun game but the wise gamer will sit on this title and see if the developers can improve its functionality, else this game will fail hardcore. Right now, the game will leave you wanting to pull your hair out more times than it will offer an enjoyable gaming experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742474">Expand</a></span>

The midnight release play was absolutely terrible. The game stutters every 3 seconds for no reason. Everyone&apos;s mic is open and there&apos;s no way to mute them. I only got to play first three chapters before Techland decided to wipe my save without warning. Apparently they uploaded a console version to steam (DOH!) and considering how it still hasn&apos;t been fixed, the issue goes much deeper. The graphics looked absolutely terrible compared to what I was expecting from trailers. The character animations are hideous. Honestly, I&apos;ve seen half life 2 mods with better animations. The inventory is a pain in the ass to use. Interface was made for consoles and it&apos;s absolutely baby-punch-frustrating as a PC gamer to slowly click through things because they were too lazy to change it. Honestly it wouldn&apos;t be so bad if weapons didn&apos;t break so quickly and I have to access item menu every 3 minutes. You shuffle through 10 diff containers and get 50 dollars which you&apos;ll have to spend to repair a knife that breaks after 5 swings. But seriously though, YOU SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME OPENING CONTAINERS AND PUNCHING BABIES THROUGH BAD INTERFACE MANAGING ITEMS RATHER THAN KILLING ZOMBIES AND SURVIVING.<br><br>The characters are also horrible. The models are hideous and it&apos;s really hard to take a liking to a character and level them when they&apos;re not likable at all. While they call this game an RPG the characters have no story behind them other than a tiny paragraph intro where they basically prove the developers are bunch of racist white men who never seen a non white person in their lives or something. The asian woman sometimes sounds super asian and sometimes just sounds white. The &apos;sure&apos; and &apos;yes&apos;s that they say when accepting a quest are sometimes totally out of place and kills immersion. I will say that I liked the zombie animations and their ragdoll mechanics. It&apos;s pretty hilarious to stand on some stairs and watch zombies fall down the stairs when you kick them.<br>When I was buying this game, I was expecting more L4D element but I was very wrong. This game definitely has borderland written all over it. It even has aimless driving. Btw, Why does a truck have infinite health in a survival game? It needs to get damaged and stalled by zombies. It&apos;s pretty ridiculous you just go godmode-run-over-everything.<br><br>Am I mad bro? I think so bro. I just spent 50 dollars on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1744459">Expand</a></span>

This to me is completely unacceptable.<br><br>Once the cut scenes have finished and you&apos;re into the menu, the first thing you&apos;ll notice about the PC version is how it is nearly impossible to control your cursor. No big deal, after nearly suffering from tennis elbow trying to navigate yourself through the overly simplistic and console-like menu system, you&apos;ll find your standard sensitivity bar. Naturally you&apos;ll &quot;crank that sh*t up to 11&quot; and enjoy being able to actually move around somewhat normally in the menu. As mentioned your options are EXTREMELY limited, and for those of you who enjoy playing on 120hz displays, you&apos;ll notice that the game for some reason has a maximum of 100hz display refresh. No big deal I&apos;m over that.. LETS FIGHT SOME ZOMBIES.<br><br>Once you finally stumble your way into an actual game, the first thing you notice is because you set your sensitivity to max that it completely uncontrollable in game. You turn that back down and just hope you never have to go back into the menu system for fear of pulling a muscle trying to change anything in the future. Now most people&apos;s first instincts is to try and invite your friends or have them try and join your game. What&apos;s that? You don&apos;t have any option and aren&apos;t sure why? It&apos;s because the game requires you to play through the first part of the &quot;Act&quot; giving you some back story before actually allowing you to play with friends. This is fine, but I would recommend they actually explain it to people so they don&apos;t spend 10 minutes trying to get people into the game.<br><br>Once you have completed the first Act, it&apos;s on to what I call &quot;the cabin of despair&quot;. Why is that? Because you are going to be sitting in that cabin for a good 30+ minutes trying to get your friends actually into your game. Once they are finally in there, enjoy having the in-game Voice over IP system always running.<br><br>Ok, an hour after the games been installed we are now ready to fight zombies. One thing that I found extremely annoying about this game is the movement. After exiting the cabin and you start to move around the island, the overly done bloom effect mixed with the sluggish movement feels like I&apos;m suffering  from a terrible hangover. I decide to power through it.<br><br>After about 30 more minutes of wondering around the island picking up badly explained objective missions and fighting a very very small number of zombies around what I can only assume must be luxury resort due to the lack of people/zombies I find myself bored and playing with the &quot;developer features&quot; they forget to take out such as noclip.<br><br>Unfortunately I found flying around the island using noclip and driving my truck off of cliffs much more fun than any of the gameplay thus far. People who claim this is only just &quot;First Day/Week Hiccups&quot; are definitely underselling it, and I would not recommend anyone spend any money on this horrible, bug riddled game. Please, think of your wallet and your elbow before wasting away either on this monstrosity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1742434">Expand</a></span>

Blaming bugs on the wrong release version is the same as giving a teacher an intentionally corrupt document to get an extension on your homework. This is a dishonest practice, and this company should be called out for it. I feel scammed that I pre-ordered an unfinished product. I hope they will correct the issues with the game, deal with the messed up FOV, lack of basic PC graphics options like vsync, etc, but I would recommend anyone considering buying this game to wait, I don&apos;t anticipate problems being fixed overnight. Deep Silver and Techland have definitely fallen of my &quot;Potential companies to pre-order with&quot; list due to this turd.

There is something fun about fighting against zombies that is better than fighting people.  They&apos;re scary, they leap at you, they are gory, they don&apos;t have guns, they&apos;re usually slow and they make noise to announce their position.
<br>This game is an excellent zombie game.  The graphics are beautiful, and the story is great.  It&apos;s an open world island with fast travel points, quests, driving vehicles, lots of weapons (melee blunt &amp; sharp, firearms) and a neat weapon upgrade/mod system.
<br>I haven&apos;t tried the multi-player yet, but it got good reviews as well.
<br>I had to give this a lower review though because it&apos;s got some horrible bugs that don&apos;t appear to be going to get fixed.  Most notably, when you exit the menu from inventory/quests/skills, if you click the back/exit button it performs an attack (I guess since left click is also the attack).  Well, this seriously sucks if you are holding a grenade (i.e. you just made one at the mod/upgrade bench) cuz you end up tossing a grenade against a wall 2 feet in front of you, and dying.  Workaround: press escape instead of clicking.  Another annoyance is the randomness of picking up new items.  Sometimes they bump the current item out of your hand into your inventory.  Most annoyingly - when you pick up alcohol (quest/mod component) sometimes it replaces your weapon and when a zombie charges you, you end up drinking it and getting drunk instead of chopping a zombie.  Being drunk makes it hard to fight cuz you are wobbly and your vision is fuzzy.
<br>I assume these issues are due to a poor port from console to PC so things probably are better on consoles.
<br>All in all, if you like zombie games, you&apos;ll appreciate this one.  You just have to train yourself to work around the issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2568830">Expand</a></span>

After the L4D games you really need to bring something unique to the table to set yourself apart. This game tried but the gameplay mechanics didn&apos;t lend itself to the campaign.<br><br>This was the buggiest game I had ever purchased from Steam day one. Connection issues to host or join in a game with my friends. No excuse to release this half cooked. Maybe spend less time on your ad cinematics and more time polishing the game?<br><br>I understand it was trying to be a zombie survivor RPG, a novel concept, they just fell short. Weapons constantly breaking and needing repair would slow down progression through the story. You need to amass a fortune, find a plethora of weapons lying around on a resort island, and MacGyver recipies is silly. The quests are tired and absurd. &quot;The chosen one&quot; storyline is used more than...just play L4D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2418786">Expand</a></span>

I had to install a third-party helper (i.e., EXE file) to tweak the graphic settings in order to make the game stutter-free. This was not a successful port to PC as the code was not optimized for PC and the graphics look dated (circa 2007). The good news is that the gameplay can be fun at times.

                                        <span>I would have given the game a higher score if it didnt have so many bugs still till this day. Love the game but the developers took too many shortcuts with the game and ruined it in certain areas. But i get which direction they wanted the game to head towards but just couldnt do so.
<br>
<br>Overall, its been 2.5 years and I still love the game.</span>

The whole thing felt rushed, incomplete and unpolished.  From glitches to stereotypical characters (that you never develop empathy for) Dead Island and it&apos;s story fall very short from the game it could have been.  Maybe next time.</span>

<br>I thought it was kinda cool to have a mission-based game in a zombie setting.  It is cool that you can upgrade weapons several times.
<br>What&apos;s killing my interest is the nagging weapon maintenance.  The wear is remotely believable for the wooden weapons.  But something like a heavy pipe wrench or a crowbar would &quot;in reality&quot; split a thousand zombie skulls with at most cosmetic damage to the weapon itself. It gets old gathering money constantly and delaying quests with trips to a repair bench.  How does a workbench take money, anyway?  If Dead Island didn&apos;t have this weapon maintenance aspect, I&apos;d give it a 7.
<br>Throw in healing, or maybe less damage from zombie punches, and I might say 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2717886">Expand</a></span>

Now, why in these games where only character development occurs in a handful of cinematics that are hours apart and in some random comments during gameplay, I will never understand. The game focuses primarily on a fun melee combat system where the point is disabling the enemy by attacks to the head or limbs, combined with lots of gore and dismemberment, you have good gameplay experience that gets boring by the end of the game, depending on the player. Miraculously, there is no automatic health regeneration, and despite the fact it&apos;s regained by eating snacks and drinking soda, the limited health and stamina make you want to be careful and precise in combat. As far as RPG elements go, there are rather simple skill trees that slightly alter how you play. The world is fairly open, it comes down to decent story quests and generic sidequests, with very little replay value. Graphically the game looks good, even though it overuses bloom effects and animations are on the downside. If you play with your friends with mics you are bound to have a good time, yet if you play alone or with uncommunicative strangers it will quickly get annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2880478">Expand</a></span>

Have a lot of fun the online. You will love to pass the game many times. The DLC made this game very complete. I Love Dead Island.</span>

There are hundreds of side missions, many locations to find and exclusions notes which actually make for a better story compared to what the game attempts to portray. The Graphics are impressive and Banoi is a related destination for paradise holidaying. Basically the game is about four main characters who have mutated an immunity which has given them the privilege to do 1000 fetch quests for pretty much everyone. The aim of the game is to get off this Island of hell and discover what actually is going on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=3837683">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story... well... uhh... it&apos;s there. It sucked but... it&apos;s there... right? I mean seriously half the time I didn&apos;t even know there was a story.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even remember any of the characters. None of them had an impact on me.
<br>
<br>Graphics and visuals were below average. I never seen something like this at the price it cost ever. Except for the water which was oddly the most detailed thing in the game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay was just down right atrocious. The hit box for some melee was just awful and they want me to jump and hit too? Yeah no. Controls well... it handled well but again... with the combat being so spotty you can&apos;t really say it controlled well. Multiplayer CO-OP made it a tad fun as all my friends and I laughed at all the horrible things in the game and cracked jokes.
<br>
<br>OH BOY WAS THIS GAME HARD! If you&apos;re looking for a challenge look no further than this! This game&apos;s poor hit box and controls and overall boring game play just makes everything a god damn challenge.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this game? NO! DO NOT TOUCH THIS!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272737">Expand</a></span>

The story is a little boring at times, but the game compensates for this by allowing you to leave the story altogether and focus your sick mind on forging together weapons of much carnage. Not one of the best zombie games, but it is good.</span>

It&apos;s a beautiful looking game with some fun gameplay to be had. It is however, ruined by a nonsensical, clich&#xE9; ridden and disjointed story that is less half baked than completely uncooked, with voice acting that, while never awful is never truly convincing, either. There is also no sense of character development, with each cutscene (which barely even appear until the halfway point) showing the characters, both playable and no randomly changing their personality with no real explanation as to how or why, even within said scenes. The facial animations are at best laughable, while I did notice the zombies seemed to display a convincing look of rage, the characters the player interacts with always seem to look blank, even if they&apos;re supposed to be terrified for their lives. The combat AI for humans is also hilariously bad, with enemies directly in front of the player seemingly shooting right past them. The item break mechanic also seemed to make no sense, with the player going and seemingly paying a workbench to repair a weapon with cash, which given the large variety of items the player seems to run across makes it seem like a really lazy solution to an unnecessary feature. The combat was fun enough, although with zombies and specials pretty much spawning in the exact same place not minutes after the player cleared it out made it repetitive and quite frankly tedious.
<br>The item loot mechanic, which not only looks lifted from Borderlands was highly unsatisfying. I think this game had a lot of ambition, with some excellent ideas, a solid concept and a beautiful world but it was ruined by poor execution in many aspects of the game. It could have been something special but will probably be confined to the depths of mediocrity like so many other potentially great games. Still, it was better than Walking Dead: Survival Instinct.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833205">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not the best game - tons of glitches for one - but it is hours and hours of fun, great solo or in multiplayer.  There are shortcomings of course: the sections where firearms are required get a bit tedious, and firearms themselves seem pretty weak when stacked up against the ridiculous amount of melee weapons you can get your hands on.  There&apos;s also a fair bit of dumb design decisions in there, like making Alcohol an item that can take up a weapon slot, or having higher level weapon modifications available before the lower level variants.  Despite that, the melee combat is both fun and challenging.  The game holds up decently well, though it loses a bit of its charm in the later levels when things veer away from the combination of beautiful scenery with horrifying zombies.  Still, it&apos;s not like it stops being fun, it just loses a little bit of that humorous juxtaposition.
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s a great game, even moreso on the PC since it is HIGHLY moddable.  Don&apos;t like some aspect of the game?  There&apos;s probably a mod out there to change it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=4058167">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Dead Island Is a mix between Borderlands and Left 4 Dead! The graphics are good despites the glitches that occurs often in the game! Also It is mostly made for Co-Op, If you play alone you will get to act 2 and also bored to death! Otherwise, play with 3 of your friends online and you will have a lot of fun! I recommend it for any fans of zombie games!</span>

<br>Once again, the added value comes from the mutliplayer experience, as you can get all together in car and break some zombie bones on the way. It&apos;s a bit buggy but it&apos;s not ruining the game at all
<br>
<br>The storyline is not the best one, but it&apos;s decent, and some parts of the world are really challenging. It&apos;s horror, rpg, action, range and melee. I love it !
<br>
<br>The weapon crafting is nice, even if you have to repair your weapons twice during the missions, but you can create pretty much everything and you find new weapons all the time to replace the old ones.
<br>
<br>Conclusion : Forget the bugs, forget the sensation of unfinished game, this is fun and you know it !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294785">Expand</a></span>

To the point that I found the game to be too much balanced between enjoyment and...frustration. I hesitated to give it a 7 btw.</span>

I installed it and finally started the game...and now after 20 hours and more of gaming, I really notice why this game wasn&apos;t all that greatness they mentioned in the past. The best way to describe this game is that it&apos;s a hybrid between Skyrim/Oblibion and Borderlands, even though it doesn&apos;t completely work at its finest. However there are positive things: I actually like the fact that you&apos;re a survivor against a zombie infection and the fact that you&apos;re basically stuck on a island and you have to kill any zombie you cross even though the scare factor completely dies because this island is never in the dark and the zombies never stop coming, meaning that you won&apos;t have any growing tension or unexpected meeting. The 4 characters aren&apos;t extremely different with the exception of their main weapon skills (blunt weapons,blades, thrown weapons and guns) but they differ enough to be interesting to play all of them. There&apos;s also a story but I hardly followed because I was focusing on the game itself and the quests (like in any WRPG). The island isn&apos;t &quot;huge&quot; but it&apos;s big enough that you&apos;ll take some time to explore it all, especially when you need to find materials for making your modified weapon, which is a nice addition...but it&apos;s extremely hard to make those weapons. However, I do have 3 big complaints in this game and, to me, they are BIG flaws that ruins my game. A lot. First of all, the controls are clunky...I understand they tried to make this as much realistic as possible but I&apos;m pretty sure I can move and walk AND fight better than them! The combat for instance is very harsh because you don&apos;t have a huge range, understandable since your main weapons are melee weapons, but you don&apos;t feel in control of your swings and you can easily miss zombies because of the slow pace the characters have! Without mentioning that you can&apos;t parry (at least I never could, if there is one) and your dodge is hard to use and has a really weak range...plus it&apos;s useless since you need to be in melee range ALL the time and you&apos;ll only use it once in a while to avoid sudden attacks from the zombies. Maybe I&apos;m nitpicking, but the controls aren&apos;t my favorite part here. And no, I can&apos;t try analog controls, so I can&apos;t say if that&apos;s good or not. Second: your energy never recovers in time....really? I don&apos;t get why I don&apos;t recover my health, especially when they just hit me with fists! Yes there are some zombies that hit with weapons and you&apos;ll sometime fight men with guns, but this is still a big problem because the zombies HIT HARD! I&apos;ve died a lot of time because they can easily 3-4 shot me, and add the fact that you&apos;re always in numerical disadvantage, you cannot parry and dodge sometimes it&apos;s useless since some zombies can run faster than you you can see big problems on the way The only way to recover health is to eat and drink food or use first aid kits, which are rare to find but luckily not costy to buy, but I don&apos;t get why our energy never gets back with just resting or waiting (and no, it&apos;s not because we&apos;re infected): it basically says &quot;gunshots can be easily recovered with few seconds of resting (the general fps idea), but fists? They hurt you more, so you need a lot of cheap food to recover!&quot;. I don&apos;t know, maybe I&apos;m taking it too seriously. And third: the game seems a lot short: I&apos;ve played for almost 23 hours and I&apos;m at 70% of the game...and I&apos;ve done PLENTY of quests, so that means that the game itself it&apos;s even shorter! Of course the game will be longer if you manage to do all the quests and the problems I&apos;ve mentioned will disappear if you play in co-op, which is very well implemented, without mentioning that it makes the game a lot longer too, but even Borderlands had a longer main quest! It&apos;s still longer than the average game but my guess is that if you want to make it last long, you have to do quests or else it won&apos;t last very much, which is a pity. I liked the game though but It&apos;s not the best I&apos;ve seen: it looks like an attempt to copy both Borderlands questing system and Oblivion combat, but making one weird hybrid that doesn&apos;t really shine in either side...so my advice is to stick with either those 2 games (which are ten times bigger also) or you can give this game a try if you want to play something different...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574856">Expand</a></span>

All in all, this is a fun game. I&apos;m gonna give a LOT of negatives and few positives, but the positives I give are really big, and the negatives are very minor. So while at first glance this is gonna look like a hate speech, in the end, I do enjoy this game. Before I start off I&apos;m just gonna say - this is a long review. to sum it up - Combat is great, tons of minor things that will annoy the hell out of you if you&apos;re half as nuts as I am. If you want more examples, then let&apos;s get started.<br>Positives: The combat in this game is downright fantastic. I love it. every weapon has an individual feel but they all feel weighted and realistic. when I smash a zombie with my oar or stab it with a kitchen knife, it feels like an actual weapon. the graphics for combat are much better than the graphics for everything else, and the engine really shines when the player cuts a limb off. (excuse the graphic details-who am I kidding, you guys are here for a zombie killing game). I feel compelled to play the game simply so I can kill some more zombies. Another large positive is the world. It feels alive and dynamic, in that there&apos;s places you can go that have their own minor stories that aren&apos;t (so far) connected with anything regarding the plot and are just put in to give the world flavor - coming upon a room with a zombie tied to a bed and a dead man next to the struggling zombie comes to mind, for example. People (most, anyway) react realistically for an apocalypse, and the large majority of the people in the safe houses are terrified because *guess what*, they&apos;re just average people, not everyone is a zombie killer like it feels sometimes in other zombie games. Anyway:    The Negatives: This game is ABSURDLY unpolished. Like, really unpolished. I play as a female character, and several conversations have the other person refer to me as a he. Shadows in the game are blocky and odd, and I have all of my settings turned to maximum. There&apos;s a certain part in the hotel where I could literally see a dark part of the hallway - it was cut off from the rest of it, there was an actual line of darkness. that&apos;s just basic phasing to make the shadow bleed into the rest of the world, a weird graphics problem. Yes I know these are minor gripes, I said in the beginning that most of my negatives are very picky, remember. Another minor gripe - and this one is really pointless. You pay for repairs, which is understandable...but you&apos;re paying a repair table. Not a person. What? Like just...where does the money go? Driving in this game also, was designed by a team of people just learning to drive. Because it&apos;s very realistic, in that it&apos;s the view of being in the car. That&apos;s great, until you have to go in reverse and smash the car into the wall behind you. I feel like an imbecile when driving simply because I can&apos;t look all the way behind me like I would when *actually driving*. Also the car makes skidding noises....regardless of the speed you&apos;re going. Which is weird. Another thing (slightly more important) weapon durability is really, really frustrating. An average weapon breaks in about thirty swings, which is at most ten zombies. Less important - two odd things with the female characters. First, they&apos;re all in bikinis. Sure sure, they&apos;re on a beach vacation. Fine. Five hours into an apocalypse and they can&apos;t grab a shirt from somewhere or something? Seriously. Also, almost every single one of the female avatars have an mp3 player on their arm. Random I know, but it freakin&apos; weirds me out. Another thing: Voice acting. Terrible. Also it seems like it&apos;s on a  different audio channel from everything else, when I say yes or no to a quest. Strange.    So yes, my negatives section was much much larger than my positives, but the positives were much more important than the negatives. In the end, I suggest one of two things: If this game sounds like the perfect match for you, get it. GET IT RIGHT NOW. Otherwise, wait a few months for the price to drop a bit - I definitely suggest anyone who loves zombie games to get this, but unless you reaaally hate zombies, you may want to wait for the price tag to drop. If you do buy it, good luck killing the infected, and maybe I&apos;ll see you guys in game.

The trailer that got everyone talking was the teaser trailer containing a slow motion emotional trailer, of a family stuck on an island in a hotel, infested with zombies. This emotional trailer suggested that the game could be about the back story to these people, and how there lives met such a tragic end. However, the characters in the main game itself have absolutely nothing to do with the actual game, the game opens with a mediocre rap song about zombies, before you are introduced to the shallow and stereotypical characters in the game. The combat is slow and slightly dodgy, and  &quot;The Infected&quot; run at you so fast, unless you can kick like a donkey you are screwed. This game is Left For Dead, meets Borderlands, except a version where everything went wrong. It tried to be original but ended up being a shallow and unimaginative game that leaves you unsatisfied. Don&apos;t even get me started on the weapon combat system either. There are so many problems that the only thing that I enjoyed, are the beautiful graphics, and driving around the island running over zombies. Don&apos;t play it on your own, it&apos;s pointless, having a friend makes all the difference in the world. Over all a bland game that did not seem worth splashing out money for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2299336">Expand</a></span>

The core gameplay is good, and it&apos;s one of the few games I&apos;ve played in recent years to actually feel like a horror game. The adrenaline that flows then knocked down by a thug and surrounded my walkers is immense. Melee combat is sastisfying, and the game is huge and provides lots of gameplay for your money. It does have a few issues though. There are minor graphical bugs and clipping which mar the game slightly, and weapons break a little bit too fast for my tastes. I understand it&apos;s meant to build tension, but it doesn&apos;t seem right that a lead pipe would break after 10 hits to a zombie arm. I think if the bugs can be ironed out, it could be close to perfect as a game. Some of the criticisms for it seem a bit harsh. It was buggy at release, but that doesn&apos;t make it awful by default. Some criticisms have been levelled at it for a lack of guns, but that was one of its main selling points. If you want a fun game which goes against the grain, and are willing to put up with a few minor bugs and questionable design issues, you could do a lot worse than Dead Island.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1754817">Expand</a></span>

However the storyline is rather drab with highly predictable quests. It has a terribly clunky interface. Developers need to stop releasing games with so many bugs, then working on a fix. I don&apos;t pay $60  to beta test bugs.</span>

After 25 hours of game play I can say, that this game worth 8/10, if you like open world, cooperation, RPG elements (perks &amp; so on) you must buy it too</span>

The one drawback is that once you see the first couple waves of zombies, it becomes pretty repetitive. I still enjoyed it though and would recommend this to others. As for re-playability...I don&apos;t know if I will come back to this. It was fun.. now time to move on.</span>

                                        <span>Dead Island was heavily flawed on release with game breaking technical issues and though I managed to fix these afterwards, I still wasn&apos;t impressed with the game. Although I was entertained for the most part on my first playthrough, the game was littered with bugs and glitches that proved annoying and I felt the story wasn&apos;t very engaging either.</span>

It tends to get a little repetitive and at some points I found myself getting irritated and running through certain areas without attacking a single zombie. The story is a little generic but that doesn&apos;t take the fun out of slicing a zombie&apos;s head off with a machete. The stamina system works well but also gets a little irritating when fighting off a good amount of zombies. The melee weapons degrade quickly but luckily there are workbenches scattered throughout levels to repair your gear. A pretty solid game with a few glitches. Most of them have been fixed and I haven&apos;t run into any game breaking glitches yet. Co-op is fun especially if you have friends to play with. It can get a little challenging with one person.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2532774">Expand</a></span>

Crafting is interesting, graphics are nice, music is acceptable. If You close Your eyes for lots of small stupidities You will enjoy this game. Gameplay is nice and makes You play many hours without stoping.  It is also very important to play Dead Island before starting Riptide.</span>

<br>I have put 20 hours on this game, the game has interesting story BUT it sucks as hell, i had to uninstall the game because of the endless annoyance it has.

1  Major problem for me, FEELS LAGGY! the game feels extremely laggy even i have +120 fps.
2  Mouse movements, in the menu the mouse is extremely slow.
3  No option to disable the head bobbing.
4  Combat system sucks!</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">BAD GAME!

<br>4  Combat system sucks!
<br>5  No proper AA, AA seems doesnt work or has poor effect even on max settings
<br>6  Bad interface.
<br>
<br>I wish it worked as smooth as L4D series but forget that, the combat system makes you break your keyboard because theres nothing in combat system to learn, just hit hit hit, and hit and dont forget to hit again but for sure the zombies will hit you before you even reach them...

While having to repair my weapons on a regular basis may get monotonous it pushes me to be more selective and focus my skills in an intelligent way.

While this game has its bugs (which one doesnt) it still is a great game nonetheless. Now I can see how its boring if youre playing by yourself, but it encourages multiplayer so get some friends together. I enjoy dead island quite a bit and i believe alot of people just wanted some kind of instant gratification zombie killing game, like L4D. While L4D is fantastic, this is quite a bit different, and it was meant to be. I love the fallout games, and borderlands, and this is a great crossing of both games. While Deep Silver isnt a giant company, it shows in the games overall quality, while not fantastic, it gets the job done. This game obviously wasnt a big budget title like the CoD series, or valves L4D, so im giving Deep Silver credit for doing a damn good job with what they had. All in all i love it and will be enjoying it with friends (and solo) for many months to come</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1745073">Expand</a></span>

This game is great and is far less buggy on the day of release than so many big games I have played lately! Anyone remember Black Ops - unplayable for over a week! For me, the only bugs I have seen is a couple of floating objects (which loads of games have lately) and I can&apos;t kick the sandcastles over (which is not a bug but a shame). My mate who has AMD GFX had issues with some lighting, but that will do down to AMD drivers and not the game as it is perfect on my NV card.<br><br>Back to Dead Island... it works like a cross between Fallout 3 and Left 4 Dead set in Crysis - it&apos;s great fun. The story and the characters are pretty good and the fighting is awesome. The game is very pretty, but set on a pacific island it&apos;s hard not to be pretty - but that aside, the graphics are done well but they are quite intensive.<br><br>Can&apos;t wait to get home and play this again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749934">Expand</a></span>

Some friends bought it on steam sale recently so I thought I would have another go so we could play it together. New super PC with 12 core (hyperthreaded) intel etc.  One of my friends has been unable to play it at all and despite all the many many fixes I tried I am unable to stop the graphics drivers on my machine restarting every few minutes. The other guy has performance issues.  I tried taking out all GPUs except one in this machine and it runs between 200-300 fps. Trying to lock it to the Vsynch of my monitor at 120fps makes no difference as it does nothing at all.   I dont know how I got through it the first time. The gameplay itself is great but this is one of the worst console ports I ever saw.  Competes with Rage for the worst all time ports.  On the upside, it will run on anything if you can get past the really bad use of PC resources.  A great game let down by terrible porting.  With a worthy port this would of been one of the few good games to crossover.   I am stunned that it seems to be in even worse shape than it was at launch when I first played it with people complaining of new bugs introduced along the way.   What a shame.  Unless your on an Xbox, dont bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2537971">Expand</a></span>

Each map is large enough to have a few hours in but exploring the island on your own isn&apos;t a possibility. Is the island (maps) huge? Simply stated, no. Although each map is large/medium it doesn&apos;t compare to other game in terms of world size. Even exploring is slightly boring and tedious. Only a few interesting things to find but nothing encourages you to explore since the developers put little effort in placing entertaining things/objects/locations to find. Explore, see zombie, kill zombie. That&apos;s about it for exploration besides a couple of locations. The graphics are dated but are just barely passable. There are some graphical issues like explosions that are invisible and areas of maps which haven&apos;t been properly edited. There are glitches but what game nowadays isn&apos;t plagued with them? Most will hopefully be dealt with in upcoming patches. The storyline is laughable and barely interesting. The developers wanted you to feel something for the characters but it never comes across. The voice acting isn&apos;t good and the characters themselves (main and side characters) are one dimensional with poorly written dialogue. The developer also made the characters a clich&#xC3;&#xA9;. For example, the Chinese character has a horrible clich&#xC3;&#xA9; accent glorified during the 1960-70s kung fu movies. The quests, and I&apos;ve done most if not all of them, are repetitive. Not to mention there isn&apos;t as many as the developer alluded to during production and the promotion of Dead Island. All this stated, the game is fun whether on your own or with a few friends and you&apos;ll find yourself doing the quests just for the exp. Overall, this game shows promise but falls drastically short of being what it could have been. However, you&apos;ll never get bored of crushing a zombies head with your foot or slicing it&apos;s head off or even burning them &quot;alive&quot;. I can see this game spawning a Dead Island 2 in the future. Oh and for anyone that thinks this game is going to be like the theatrical trailer for it (the one with the family), you won&apos;t get that. It was a theatrical trailer promoting the game (not gameplay) it was meant to put the game in the minds of consumers not to display what the game will or will not have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1748343">Expand</a></span>

The entire idea of being stuck on a island when an outbreak happens and trying to get off of it, sounded fun! However, the design was just as dead as the zombies. This game feels like it was designed and developed by a couple of college kids fresh out of programing school with no knowledge of good gaming design. Setting aside all the bugs, glitches, and errors this game is filled with, not to mention poor graphics even on the highest setting, this game is just bad. In some areas you can break glass. I&apos;ve seen better glass and glass breaking visuals from Games created in 1999. The marketing and hype made this game out to be a serious horror zombie game, yet the mission in the game are out of Sesame Street.  Example - You are stuck on a zombie infested island fighting for your life and a woman asks you to go find her Teddy Bear. (WTF MOMENT) right there. Another lady asks you to get her necklace. WTF AGAIN. The game starts by giving you no real reason as to how or why you got on the island other than it looks like a Holiday resort. There&apos;s no story line between any characters. The game just dumps you onto a sandy beach to start hacking zombies and figure out what the heck you are doing. After hours of playing this game I found myself making comments to myself like &quot;WTF, I&apos;m stuck on this island about to be eaten by zombies and this fool wants me to get him beer?&quot; Or &quot;Gee, that suitcase must have been restocked with cash since the last time I checked it, 10 seconds ago&quot; Or&quot; Wow, everybody in this island keeps cash in suitcases and dressers?&quot;<br>Not to mention just about every zombie owns some sort of knife or weapon. I wonder how they got those past TSA. Any interaction you have with characters is an experience you want to just ran away from. Bad choice of voice actors, bad cut scenes and scripting.  I could go on and on about the very bad design, programing and graphics, but I think you get the point. This game was released in what seems to be the ALPHA version. To the credit of the creators, the idea was a good one. The zombies AI is good, ability to break arms, legs, or cut them off, and not just hack and slash until they fall is good as well. I&apos;m running this game on a custom system with an intel I-5, Windows 7 64, 16GB or Corsair Ram, the NVidia GTX560 video card, a 1TB system drive, and the graphics still look bad set to full resolution. Sorry guys, I would have turned the game and mission design over to Professionals and let them take your idea and make it great.

You should develop games.  You clearly understand how to tell a story and the meaning of life.  2. You should be fired.  You presented a game that doesn&apos;t exist.<br>3. The developers who approved these trailers should have stepped back and realized that they do not represent the game whatsoever.<br><br>So this game is a definite miss for me, as much as I really wanted to enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2025005">Expand</a></span>

About 2 hours into the game and I find the crafting decent (nice to see pockets are not limited for crafting parts, only main weapons), Co-Op seems to be similar to idea in Borderlands (Harder and more zombies and loot for every player that joins in) in that even solo mode is advertised as a LAN or Online game through Steam so folk can join if you want them to without need for solo and multi characters. Slighty disappointed with lack of customising on the graphics settings, maxed out in 1080p FRAPS was reporting 145fps which is impressive, but I&apos;d rather have it limited to 60fps and better quality textures and tessalation for Dx11 owners etc.  Overall the game does add a new zombie game to the collection and it&apos;s a worthy choice, unlike rubbish like dead rising 2 or resident evil 5 which suck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1744447">Expand</a></span>

Story is so so, typical zombie out break, graphics are ok, physics could use some improvements. Some zombies seem to run through walls, barricades etc. Knock back with certain weapons needs another pass as well. A hit from a sledge should knock someone to the ground. The RPG idea is a good one, but the route this one takes just doesn&apos;t fancy my taste.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=2510103">Expand</a></span>

The graphics engine provides a truly beautiful landscape that causes the player to become fully immersed in the apocalypse. The game combines a lot of elements from a lot of other good successful games - It is a combination of games like Left 4 Dead, Fallout 3, and Borderlands. Gameplay itself is exhilarating and fresh. The games begins as you learn the mechanics by taking amateur weapons like a paddle to defend yourself against a few walking undead. As the game progresses and players learn how to work together and coordinate themselves against zombie attacks, the game seems easier and more relaxing in such a beautiful landscape. The chapter one &quot;tutorial&quot; then begins for real - difficultly ramps up once players begin to become skilled with one another, and it no longer is a &quot;4 player hunting party&quot; but a &quot;4 player party fight for survival.&quot; Zombies become faster and more horrifying. You no longer clear a building for all its loot, but run from place to place picking up scavenged objects to simply stay alive. The game works well - you eventually develop a healthy paranoia and almost never feel safe at every turn, which leads to a great adrenaline filled experience. Even better, this great experience lasts a long time...I have more than 20 hours played and still haven&apos;t even scratched more than half of the game content. The game has a high replay value with four character classes each with three separate skill trees. The only negative point I can add about the game is that its not a single player game. Its not meant for single player. As difficulty ranks up it would be extremely challenging to survive the undead by yourself...and the developers know this and even implemented an easy to use system to meet new people in case you don&apos;t have friends. If you do have friends that play games Dead Island is a must get for all of you. Nothing is a better cooperative experience than screaming at the top of your lungs in pure horror because your friends can&apos;t drive the getaway vehicle fast enough, or aren&apos;t climbing to safety in time for your own demise. A person reading these reviews may wonder why a game as great as this has such a mixed response, and the reason why is because many people downloaded an incorrect version of the game. Since the real version is now out, players can enjoy an ENTIRELY bug free game that is a must have for 2011.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1744469">Expand</a></span>

Now about the game, it is a free roam zombie rpg game that takes place on a tropical island, basically everything i like about video games in one. However, the thing i like the most about dead island, is definitely the combat, The gorey zombie killing in this game feels more realistic than any other game i have played, Just the ability to chop off different limbs and kill zombies with numerous different weapons makes it that much more fun. Do not get this game confused with L4D, you do not kill 40 zombies with 1 shotgun blast like that game, At the beggining of the game you may even be overwhelmed by 4 or 5 zombies. But it feels like you are actually killing things and not just playing some arcade game. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1744352">Expand</a></span>

I give it a 7 tops maybe as low as 6.5 based on the gameplay and story alone amongst other things<br><br>I finish the game. This game is largely melee based with a few gunplay moments<br><br>Let&apos;s talk about the good things first<br>-Lengthy game, can&apos;t beat in one day.<br>-Good challenge, sorry no easy mode. I died sometimes during certain main quests<br>-The graphics are good, however lacking more advanced graphical options. A bit too much bloom.<br>-Good skill tree for each character; helps create a &quot;build&quot;<br>-Lots of weapons and mods, some only attainable through sidequests<br>-The city and jungle environment looked good, reasonably detailed<br>-Driving is fun<br>-Combat is good. Can cut off limbs or break limbs, creating a use of strategy when fighting.<br>-Always zombies around, endless population<br>-Can carry infinite misc items that are not weapons,heath and throwables<br>-Never safe, doesn&apos;t matter what level you are; if you get swarmed and surrounded you are dead<br>-Stamina ensures that most people cannot just run around and spam attacks.<br>-Great zombie sounds<br>-Weapons durability rate is fine; encourages the use of different weapons<br><br>Now the bad<br><br>I dislike the fading health bar; it&apos;s always important to see the health bar because life and death well, depends on health...<br><br>-The story is not exactly compelling. The things you do in an hour before the end of the game was not exciting at all; there is no climax point at all. That&apos;s it? Really?<br><br>-The characters are very simple, little to no history. Players don&apos;t really get to be immersed in their struggles on the island.<br><br>-Not enough unique zombies, only 5. Most of the time it was just walkers and the raged infected. I like to fight strategically, and I found myself bored before half way of the game. I became very bored of fighting walkers and infected; I started to avoid zombies all together whenever possible. The combat was great but the limited zombie types made it very repetitive.<br><br>-Sidequests have nothing to do with the story and don&apos;t reveal anything. Not only that, they are very tedious and boring because it&apos;s always fetch X item for Y person. -Auto saves are very bad especially for the quests that involve escorting a person. If the person dies and you choose to load the last save, the zombies come back but your ammo and weapon durability stays the same right before the npc death AND the game AUTOSAVES AGAIN which makes absolutely no sense; If you don&apos;t pass the point of struggle, eventually you&apos;ll have a &quot;save&quot; where you have no weapons left because they&apos;ll all be broken by then. It didn&apos;t exactly reload in time, the games just places you back where the &quot;save&quot; location was which was ridiculous. Sometimes I was stuck in a very bad situation which I could not fight through, luckily I made backup saves but I had to play up to the point where I was ruined by the autosave. -The facial animations are poor, little to no expression and sometimes even the wrong expression during cutscenes and conversations. Their eye movement was a little robotic and looked lifeless.<br><br>-Thinking back through my playthrough, there&apos;s not too many memorable moments at all. Again, story is weak<br><br>-Main quests are similar to one another, not enough variety<br><br>-This is a preference but the lack of hectic events and the overall intensity of the game was not as high as I expected. No real exciting moment other than the regular uh oh I&apos;m swarmed or oh no here comes the raged infected.<br><br>Side notes:<br><br>The experience may be better when playing online; you&apos;ll kill less zombies playing with someone else and less strategy is required. I think I probably would not be bored as fast playing with a friend but now that I beat the game on my own I think I had enough of this game; I can see where people are coming from when they say it is tedious,boring and repetitive because there were times I felt that way. At the same time, near the beginning of the game it was fun and enjoyable. As the game dragged on, I felt it became a chore to continue on. It&apos;s a decent game and I may replay again in the future with friends if things get patched up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1747545">Expand</a></span>

These technical issues, however, do not prevent it from being what I would argue is a unique and thrilling game. While almost none of the concepts in the game are original, the eclectic mix which I have described as Dead Island meets Oblivion meets Borderlands, is a unique and incredible atmosphere.<br><br>Graphics : Absolutely stunning, the world is made fantastically and incredibly, with a myriad of environments to be absorbed in. The zombies running around on the beaches, for example, stand in stark contrast to the dark and creepy halls of the hotel, or inside certain larger buildings. The zombies themselves are crafted brilliantly, being appropriately disgusting, and they even look good when limbs start coming off. 9.5<br><br>Gameplay: Combat has yet to get old for me. The fact that guns &amp; bullets are so scarce creates for some epic zombie hacking gameplay, and using the lady from Hong Kong, her special ability to crush heads with high-heels is perpetually hilarious. While quests may be tedious, the combat isn&apos;t, and as such it makes the quests well worth while. Co-op makes it that much better, and it never stops getting funny when there&apos;s one zombie left and your crew runs up and starts stomping it to death together. 9<br><br>Sound: Nothing spectacular. Enough to create atmosphere, but the voice acting does leave a bit to be desired.  6<br><br>Atmosphere: Brilliant. I touched on this in the graphics section, but Ive found the environment to be engrossing and enthralling. Being able to explore a large open world, which is littered with zombies, is an exciting and unqiue experience. While the penalties for death are quite low, the game manages to keep me on the edge of my seat as I traverse the zombie ridden landscape. Never, when outside of specific safe zones, do I feel totally safe. Furthermore, many of the areas are composed of very compact little lanes with limited visibility, so you never know what could be around the next corner. Even when driving, the game keeps you very worried about hitting something or getting stuck, because when you do the zombies will be all over you. This fear is diminished when playing in co-op however, as having friends there creates a sense of security that is otherwise absent when playing by yourself. 8.5<br><br>Technical: The game suffers from bugs. Straight up. These seem to be constantly worked on and are being patched out, which is excellent, and in time it will resolve them. For now they can be very irritating, like arbitrarily being spawned on the opposite side of the map from where you were, while your friends are still there fighting. 7<br><br>Overall, I chose to rate this game a 9, because its short comings, in my mind, are more than made up for by its strong points. Its quirky, unique, odd, and a damn good time. I would, however, highly recommend playing with friends and using voice because when you do the game is that much better.<br><br>Thanks for reading this and for your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1747572">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I was suspicious about that game from the start. In one hand was really teased with trailers where you smash zombies with everything you can found. But in other hand I was skeptical about gameplay and overall feeling.
<br>
<br>Because of that I was waiting for Steam 66% off to buy this. I was not wrong. This game is not worth paying full price. I would be more happy if I would pass that one.</span>

<br>The graphic as others mentioned before: the humans animations are flat out horrible, the zombies look great however. The environment is gorgeous we stopped several times and said: wow while taking screen shots. The game has 5 different type of environment through the story and it does not feel rushed.
<br>The sound and background ambiance together with the music is also very very good.
<br>The bugs: I was lucky enough to play with the after-patch version only and played through the whole game without anything game breaking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1750148">Expand</a></span>

By the time you&apos;ve read this, you might already have heard about the problems @ release. That seems to be the main complaint with people. Since after the patch everything works just fine, this complaint is no longer valid.<br><br>What is Dead Island? Its smashing zombies heads in with hundreds of different weapons, with different stats and levels (unique and special weapons ). Its upgrading your weapons with your hard earned cash.<br>It&apos;s by far the best look&apos;n&apos;feel I&apos;ve seen in a melee fps ever ( go f... yourself oblivion )<br>Its collecting blue prints for special weapon mods ( simple, but effective and fun crafting system ). Its tons and tons of loot. Its dozens of sidequests, plus an athmospheric main quest. Its collecting XP for an unexpectedly interesting skill tree.<br>Its managing the deteriorating conidtion of your weapons.<br>Its a kick ass intro song.<br><br>Its..... all kinds of crazy fun.  All that in an engine with virtually no loading times and a smooth framerate even at high settings. Now there are some bad things aswell. The driving, being very very arcade, doesnt count to the games strengths. BUT: a) youll be on foot like 99% of the time, since this no gta clone. b) if you need the car its effective and brings you safely from a to b...in these moments you wont regret this not being gran tourismo c) C&apos;mon guys, the protagonist shatters the windshield when it&apos;s cracked like the thoughtful bastard he/she is - thats gotta count for something :)<br><br>Also something PC players ( like me ) might dislike: theres no quicksave/load option since the game relies on checkpoints only. But since I&apos;m usually a quicksave spammer, I appreciate the change of pace. This game is easily one of the best Zombie/Infected ( minispoiler ) games out there and has to mentioned along with games like left 4 dead and dead rising. But be advised ( or intrigued ): this game has a gore factor of Dead Space * Bloodymess Perk ( Fallout series ).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island/user-reviews?user_review_id=1746027">Expand</a></span>
