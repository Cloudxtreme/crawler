And I&#x2019;m honestly not very fond of watching the lives of all of those losers, hipsters, skaters, wannabe artists, smug leftist college professors and so on. Terrible crowd. I hope there will be more sci-fi and less teenage drama in the next episode.
<br>
<br>P.S. In spite of everything I said above, the game is actually quite good. So give it a try. It&#x2019;s not my cup of tea, but maybe it&#x2019;s yours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4937984">Expand</a></span>

Awesome!
<br>It&apos;s very realistic and embodies the American Way of Life pretty accurately.
<br>I definiately reccomend this game. Escpecially if you are into kinda slow indie movies like Donnie Darko, Big Lebowski and Telltale games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5353581">Expand</a></span>

That being said, I enjoy the concept and the narrative style game. I really enjoy the soundtrack and the game in general. I have played through episode one myself and once where a friend did most of the playing. I noticed a few cons on the second playthrough. Some of the consequential decisions are not forced on you, which leads to some misplaced dialogue, and things you didn&apos;t know about being brought up like you did. I also noticed the decisions don&apos;t have much of an immediate weight, however I can see them having a much larger effect over the course of several episodes. I am extremely excited to see what follows, and I could see this being a great game as future episodes come out with a little less teen drama and more powerful decisions, should that come into play.
<br>
<br>Animations 6/10 - Lips are animated horribly in a very dialogue based game. General animations are okay, but they definitely don&apos;t blow anyone away.
<br>
<br>Story 9/10 - Although it is very teen drama oriented in this first episode, I feel that this is just a setup for a much greater story. Based on the end of Episode one, I think this will develop into a very well-done narrative.
<br>
<br>Gameplay 7/10 - Going into it as a Telltale-esque narrative focused game, and expecting more of an interactive movie, you will enjoy it. Don&apos;t expect advanced gameplay mechanics. This is ultimately a narrative aided by interactive media.
<br>
<br>Interest rating 10/10 - My scores for animations, story, and gameplay are relatively low, but I can definitely see this becoming a great game as the season continues, and its a refreshing break from something else. I am very excited for Episode 2, and found this to be a nice surprise for something I almost didn&apos;t bother to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938802">Expand</a></span>

<br>the atmosphere is really strong and it&apos;s a game you can get yourself lost in whilst time flies by. I don&apos;t want to go into the storyline, rather on the mechanics and its effect on you, the consumer of it.
<br>
<br>the world is filled with a lot of attention to detail, posters, lovely decorations that breathe live into the scenery, the mix is stunning and if you open yourself to it lets you dip right in. it embraces you and let&apos;s you almost feel your decisions.
<br>finally being able to think over the decisions which face consequences for the first time is a very handy gimmick which puts pressure out of the game and lets you decide which decisions to make, not a hasty timer ticking down which makes it way more enjoyable to me.
<br>
<br>however, you have to be the right type of gamer/person to being able to enjoy this piece of art. it&apos;s not action, it&apos;s not comedy, it&apos;s drama after all. reading comments like &quot;Bad jokes. And a lot of them&quot; etc just shows me that people are not comfortable with this genre and are judging the game for something it&apos;s not supposed to be. you don&apos;t purchase a blender over amazon and then complain about is disfunctionality to microwave your chese sandwhich.
<br>
<br>anyhow, there are minor details, especially in animation (like the lips which are more or less independant from the spoken word) but all in all for a first episode it gives leaves behind a very strong resonance and urges me to continues with episode 2.

Chrysalis introduces you to all the characters of the game, and gives you a brief background on everyone.
<br>
<br>The characters of this game are very typical of a teenage drama film. You have the quiet main protagonist, along with the stuck up bully and her posse, while also including the sad girl who copes the torment of the bullies. The way these characters are presented though, is what separates this game from an average teen drama. I became immersed in their world and attached to their personalities.
<br>The protagonist, Max, is one of the most refreshing characters I&apos;ve played as since Jodie in Beyond: Two Souls. I became attached to her great personality and the way she is presented by the developers is truly exciting for whats to come in this series.
<br>
<br>The difference in this game compared to other episodic story driven games, is the ability to time travel. The time travel mechanic is a nice feature, and separates the gameplay from any other similar game. The game also gives you an option to travel back right after making an important decision, in case you want to change your mind and hear what the other choice has to offer.
<br>
<br>The only flaw I have with the game is that story wise, the first episode didn&apos;t really provide much. It is only really an introduction to the gameplay and characters, while showing you around Arcadia Bay and providing you with the history you need to know on characters.
<br>Also, some of the gameplay I found difficult, as the game tells you an objective but doesn&apos;t show you how to get there. I found myself spending too much time trying to figure out what I was meant to be doing, but while saying that the game also aids you to defer from the main objective and find one of the side choices to make in the game.
<br>
<br>Overall, Life is Strange: Episode 1 is a spectacular opening chapter to what I hope will be a brilliant game. I look forward to Episode 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063428">Expand</a></span>

Story, characters, atmosphere... everything is near perfection. The gameplay itself is all about character interaction and making choices that will have consequences later on. The trick is that you can reverse the time (to certain extent) and remake those choices. The mechanics for this work great, although the game would probably be ok even without this gimmick.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s minor issue which isn&apos;t a biggie, but worth mentioning: The choices you make are divided to minor and major ones. The game logic is that you can reverse the time, but still keep items you acquired previously. This basically allows you to first select path that gives you some items and the select some other, more favorable path while keeping the items. However, for major choices this doesn&apos;t work which is somewhat inconsistent and even confusing at first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5086813">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First, the not-so-great: I have say that  the lip syncing is, well, not bad, more like nearly nonexistent. You get used to it, but it&apos;s a standout in a game that otherwise really looks, sounds and *feels* good. My behind-the-scenes suspicion is the developers, who are a small French studio, synchronized the animation with the dialogue en Francais.
<br>
<br>Neutral: The dialogue can be pretty awkward, though I feel like a lot of that comes from it seeming to draw from a cultural lexicon spanning the early 90s to today. Being able to clearly remember being 18 myself, it may just be Max and her peers have settled on a vocabulary unique to their specific time and place, which does what group lingo does best: Makes you feel not quite invited to the party, but it grows on you.
<br>
<br>Great: I really, really like Max, and I&apos;m glad they stuck with a female protagonist, because I feel like her vulnerability is an important part of her story. Her voice actor (Hannah Telle) is a perfect fit. The time reversal is a unique mechanic, and it takes a little trial and error to realize what you can actually do with it. I really like the look of the whole game, all the little details that are present in the environment. The soundtrack is fantastic - and the developers have a &quot;Life Is Strange OST&quot; playlist on Spotify. The game is powerfully atmospheric, which is a tricky thing to get right in any game, doubly so in one that doesn&apos;t rely on flashy action. Her friend Chloe so far has had the best pithy one-liners out of everyone we meet in this episode.
<br>
<br>In summary, I&apos;d say my only real regret was discovering this game before all five episodes were available. Definitely looking forward to the next four.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5002066">Expand</a></span>

Definitely a game worth replaying (after finishing all 5 episodes, though). Too bad it&apos;s so short, I fully explored all of the areas and it took me around 4 hours to finish this episode while seriously taking my time through it which is not that much (most episodic games I had played before took me around 7 hours) and left me with a slightly empty feeling, like I deserved a little more. Despite that, I can&apos;t wait to find out how the story is going to progress in Episode 2. And I guess that&apos;s the most important thing about a video game - wanting to play it more and once again after you&apos;re done with it. So, let&apos;s give this one a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5102931">Expand</a></span>

<br>What is &quot;Life is Strange&quot;? Well, I would say Life is Strange is an story driven adventure game al&#xE1; Telltale Game.
<br>Is that it? No, that&apos;s the thing, it isn&apos;t. If it was I might have called these guys &quot;copycats&quot; but that wouldn&apos;t really have been fair, since I do not call Call of Duty copycats of Battlefield or the other way around.
<br>
<br>But to return to the subject, it isn&apos;t a Telltale Games clone in that way that it actually has game play.
<br>Telltale Games are famous for letting the player draw his or her own story by choosing different paths, and sometimes some easier puzzles (At least in The Walking Dead S1) This game has that, and a little more. This first episode has more puzzles than a whole season of Telltale Games, sure they aren&apos;t hard to do, but... The way you are doing them, that&apos;s the interesting way.
<br>
<br>As you probably know, this game is about a girl, her name is Max and she&apos;s 18 years old, she just started going to this high-school which name I&apos;ve unfortunately already forgot. It was something typical American. However, she discovers very early in the game that she can timetravel, at least a few seconds. This time-traveling is the main focus of the puzzles in Episode 1. You want to do something, you try to do something, you fail, you rewind time, see what&apos;s going on, change what you did earlier, and ta-da success!
<br>
<br>Unfortunately this time-travel option is not available, but only when the game want it to be, which at times are a bit frustrating. I was at the time of playing talking about the game with a friend who became very interested when a certain scene happened in the game, so I said I could show him with the Steam-stream, however I wasn&apos;t able to turn back the clock at that time. Nothing big but I just wanted to state that.
<br>
<br>How is the atmosphere of the game? Does it fit an 18 year old girls mind? Well, in a stereotypical way, yes. Do I like it? Yes. It fits perfectly to Max and her surrounding. The music is great, the art style of the game is beautiful. Not perfect though. There are quite a few graphical glitches and the faces seem... a bit... lifeless at time. But Life is Strange eh? ;)
<br>
<br>One thing that did surprise me quite a lot was the length of the episode. Used to playing Telltale Games I thought this would be like... 1.5 - 2.5 hours at most. I spent a bit over 4 hours playing this game! I wanted to explore everything! Get to know everyone. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t even get that chance! The episode is taking your through different areas of the campus and some other places, but there are loading times between these areas, and if you enter &quot;Area 2&quot; from &quot;Area 1&quot; and you have something to do in &quot;Area 2&quot; you can&apos;t return to &quot;Area 1&quot;, it simply tells you &quot;I can&apos;t leave yet&quot; or a similar message.
<br>
<br>This was quite sad because I didn&apos;t explore &quot;Area 1&quot; fully, I missed a lot of photography possibilities, yes you can actually take pictures of things. (Only things the game wants you to take pictures of though, and there are achievements) So not only did I miss these things, but I also missed achievements. (Not that important though, I just wanted you to know)
<br>
<br>Now I talked about quite a lot of things, but haven&apos;t really mentioned the story, except the whole time-travelling thing, which by itself is big thing but the story is more than this. A girl has gone missing, which is made known by all the &quot;Missing person&quot; papers everywhere, and this made me think the whole story has something to do with her, she is mentioned more and more often while the time is passing, so I guess there is something mysterious going on around her.
<br>
<br>Either way I can&apos;t wait for the next episode! Which apparently will come in March 2015. I highly recommend this to any adventure game player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4938079">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are a lot of decisions you have to make. Different decisions lead you to different consequences. More interactivity in this game than in any TT game. You can control the MC pretty much from start to finish (without too many cinematics get in the way) so it gives you a feeling of greater involvement in anything that happens.
<br>Graphics is pretty nice.
<br>Not one dull moment I can remember. It grabbed my attention from the first moment and succeeded in keeping it until the closing credits. The game has a very immersive atmosphere.
<br>Controls are smooth as well.
<br>Overall everything works as it supposed to be. If the creators can keep this up with the upcoming episodes this is gonna be my favorite game of all time.

I played some telltale games but in my opinion Life is Strange feels much more nice and lovely to play. You feel like you are important for the story to exist. Can&apos;t describe my love to the game any better.</span>

<br>1.Graphics is just awesome.Color combination used here is just perfect and capture the true American theme...what is more, the attention given to graphics is insane ..even the little things are done with care....(10/10)

<br>
<br>The game is a huge step forward for this genre. The world is beautiful, and well served by its indie soundtrack. The time travel mechanic is a great addition, because it allows you to try different choices on the spot. Again, just a huge step forward for this type of game. Technologically speaking, Life is Strange looks and plays like it&apos;s from a completely different decade than any of the other story games.
<br>
<br>The story is a bit more subjective. Just as billions of girls (and, in fairness, less combat oriented guys) around the world feel no instinctive kinship or investment when they&apos;re handed a controller and find themselves playing a floating AK-74 on a giant noisy battlefield, I&apos;m sure some guys will need a moment to invest in a teenage girl whose life revolves around photography and trying to survive her final year of high school. While discovering that she can control time. There&apos;s a lot of shop talk on the photobug side of things. This game name drops famous photographers in the exact same way that the Treme writers were always trying to prove they knew more about jazz than their audience.
<br>
<br>Personally, I like the main character, Max, a great deal, and I enjoy her art school a lot more than I enjoy her time travel. We&apos;ve all been a teenager in an unfamiliar new place. We can all remember the pressures of potential clashing with inertia as we approached the end of high school. The fact that she is a girl does not affect my ability to identify with Max. (You&apos;re a human, from Earth, you really should be able to fully empathize with all TWO of the genders on your homeworld, ffs.)
<br>
<br>I would, however, give this single warning to the less artsy people in the audience: If you could never enjoy being an art museum, large sections of this story will probably seem boring and stupid to you. The photography is not a line of background on a bio when you press C, it is who Max is, and what she does, and what she thinks about, much of the time. The complaint that this game is aimed at hipsters is far, far more valid than the ridiculous idea that the target demographic is teen girls, which is no more true of Life is Strange than it was of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
<br>
<br>All in all, I would call Life is Strange a tremendous step forward, not just for story games, but for the general level of narrative in a medium that so often struggles to find a mature, adult voice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4939719">Expand</a></span>

<br>The settings of the story may make it seem like it was aimed at younger audience and i wish they do check it out, but it truly just shows us in one of the scariest parts in our life, in a mature way. The first episode did heavily focus on characters, and set up stories. Some already wrote it off as a teenage drama where nothing happens, but i am not getting that feeling, i am glad it established the characters before tried to tell stories about people i don&apos;t know or care about. These episodic adventure games could get into the habit of making the first episode a double, just to strongly establish the series. I recommend taking the time to read everything and pay attention because that&apos;s how these games should be played, and i had a blast doing so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4945132">Expand</a></span>

This powers and choices... there are something wrong with them. I mean, a lot of choices let you do both options at once, and you always can see what will happen and remade choice, what the point in this opportunity? Look at the walking dead series, it force you to choose, and this is the main point of choosing in game like this. Square Enix put a lot of time and work in it, but this is terrible anyway.It&apos;s look like they&apos;re wanted to wrest piece of bread from Telltale company, but this is really not their field of developing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5009489">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is a good game. And only good. Has good graphics, good talking, but unfortunately it is not as immersive as other games in the genre, the story isn&apos;t. I felt a bit distant from the main character (whose name I don&apos;t remember) and the choices are not, at least for now, important ones. It&apos;s good enough to spend some time though.</span>

<br>Too many similarities with that movie.
<br>Also i didn&apos;t like much the fact that there is no real reaction when she discovers her &quot;ability&quot;.
<br>
<br>&quot;Hey i can bend time! It&apos;s so normal!&quot;
<br>
<br>Even Hiro of tv series &quot;Heroes&quot; had a better reaction to that!
<br>
<br>Poor writers.</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4941535"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Life is Strange looks like a game that was made for teenagers girls. The central story is about a girl called Max whom just moved back to her hometown. She goes to a high school that have a special program for photographers. After a few events Max find out she can go back in time and have some occasional future sights.
<br>
<br>This could be a prelude to the next GOTY, however Life is Strange is a big way down to the hipster hole that communities like Tumblr live in. For almost the entire episode you have a big problem to find good characters. Almost all of the characters are nothing less that a big cliche of everyone is sick of it. A gym guy who keep bullying the fat nerd guy, who likes to stalk the girl who achieve to be a magazine model, who is the arch enemy of the rich girl, who also don&apos;t like the protagonist, Max. Max is a poor mid class girl who doesn&apos;t have many friends, but is always talking to everyone. Max likes vintage cameras, but is always getting jealous of Victoria, a rich girl whom has the best digital cameras. Max says that she is not a hipster all the time during the game, but she is always acting like one.
<br>
<br>Another problem with the character making is that the personalities is very poor. It looks like everyone is the same, and again, everything is a big cliche. One girl has problems because she got pregnant. Another girl has problems because her nude pics leaked on facebook. And the other has a D step dad who likes to hit her on the face. You may think &quot;But it&apos;s good that games are minding those real day problems&quot;, and that would be really cool. But the problem is that Life is Strange is a game about living up with those problems. Like I said: A story for teenagers girls, because only them would be interested in a story that talks about how hard is to get a boyfriend that really know what you are felling.
<br>
<br>So, why a 6? Even with all the bads sides, the game still has some good things. The option system is not the best, and very limited, but the way you can use the power to go back in time make it worth. You have some good power on your decision making, like checking the possibilities of each choice. Another thing that is cool is that you can make a change on the history, go back in time to avoid the consequence of that change and later on still use the knolowdge you got it. E.g: You check some files and leave a mark on them. After checking the files, you may go back in time to the point were the files does not have any mark, and keep going with the game while still holding the knowlodge you got on the files.
<br>
<br>This may seem like &quot;overpowered&quot; or &quot;ez game, ez life&quot;, but it actually follow up pretty well with the game story and real life. If you had the power to control time, wouldn&apos;t you use it to your on advantage?
<br>
<br>The game does not have the best animation, but all the scenario is like a watercolour paiting, and I think its pretty cool. The sound track is also really great, and you can see all fitting pretty well in each scene.
<br>
<br>tl;dr PROS: Good watercolour painting like graphics; awesome soundtrack; good use of the power of rewind in time during the game.
<br>
<br>CONS: It&apos;s like a Twilight Saga game, where the focus is the generation Z teenagers problems; bad characters with poor personalities; poor choice system (is just A or B), and sometimes they lead to the same way;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4941535">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles reminds me of the ones from Resident Evil 3 - they have logic but they are far from beeing smart. You just cary on through the game, cause you count on something revealing to happen. With no luck (except the tornado theme).

<br>Music is fairly okey, main character likable, and time travel idea, in general - appealing. That&apos;s all there is.

<br>Life is Strange, strangely fits it&apos;s price tag and resemble more indy-game, then some &quot;triple A&quot;  title, that some of you are trying to make out of it. &#xFEFF;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4955473">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game constantly holds your hands and all the choices you can do feel so stupid.
<br>
<br>Also, it&apos;s so short you can complete Episode 1 in like half an hour.
<br>
<br>And graphically.. are you serious? Low poly, low textures, objects that are repeated, like in a library you have 3 book covers that repeat 10 times, you lazy developers.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t suggest buying this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5041961">Expand</a></span>

Muddled graphical style, clich&#xE9;d &quot;twee font&quot; interface, dialogue which utterly fails to feel genuine and comes off more like something from a fanfic than the work of a professional writer...
<br>
<br>Everyone keeps raving about the &quot;depth&quot; and &quot;complexity&quot; but truth be told, all the choices felt meaningless and the characters felt like contrived stereotypes. I felt like I was playing a marketing team&apos;s idea of what &quot;the kids are into these days.&quot;
<br>
<br>The main character feels like she&apos;s meant to be a victim from the start, as people are mean to her for no apparent reason and she takes it VERY seriously.
<br>
<br>The supporting characters are just there to be stereotypes and seem to have no real depth or ability to stand on their own, they only have significance in relation to Max. When they aren&apos;t spouting memes and making strained pop cultural references, they&apos;re blatantly fulfilling the one-dimensional role they&apos;ve been given in the story. Max is the shy art girl. The pretty blonde girl hates her just because and takes any opportunity to show it. The blue-haired chick is the edgy stoner. The rich kid is the **** everyone hates who actually does seem to be something of a psycho. His friend is oblivious to how psycho he is. And so on. Every teen drama trope is there and its so heavy-handed that I found myself cringing my face off.
<br>
<br>Conversations feel forced and it&apos;s always very apparent that you&apos;re listening to something being read by a voice actor, rather than a believable, organic-feeling character. Nothing feels natural.
<br>
<br>Quality writing and acting makes you forget that what you&apos;re seeing and hearing isn&apos;t real, but everything about this game feels calculated to appeal to a very specific demographic of special snowflake types. As a result, Max is the -only- character so far who actually feels like she could be a real person, because everyone else feels so &quot;written&quot; and exists only for her, which is exactly how the type of narcissist who would enjoy this &quot;game&quot; perceives themselves and the world. Always weeping about how no one notices her despite being an unusually pretty girl, although to be fair, basically everyone in this game is pretty.
<br>
<br>Most of the &quot;gameplay&quot; is walking around listening to Max&apos;s internal monologue comment on anything and everyone you click on. You can&apos;t even speak to many of the characters, and the from the start it feels as though you don&apos;t get very much control over Max&apos;s choices or character development. There is a very clearly laid out, linear story going on here, which the game really doesn&apos;t want you to disrupt. And even when you do get to make a choice which actually matters, the game actually goes out of its way to remind you that the choice will have consequences and that you can rewind to change it.
<br>
<br>The whole thing feels like a teenager&apos;s power fantasy, better suited for a movie. Lots of films have already done this as a comedy, where LIS is basically the same concept presented as a pretentious, unintentionally funny art house non-game. The closest it comes to laughing at itself is when it &quot;says things ironically,&quot; but much like real people who &quot;say things ironically,&quot; it fails to convince you that this is actually the case. There are even a few instances where ignorant or biased viewpoints are presented in a matter-of-fact sort of way, such as &quot;only women should have guns.&quot;
<br>
<br>Moreover, the music seems to cater to a niche group of appreciators and the graphics have this inconsistent feeling to them, as if they&apos;re sometimes meant to look realistic and other times meant to look like a graphic novel, and still other times as if they&apos;re somewhere in between or something entirely different.
<br>
<br>All-in-all this is a shoddy attempt to steal some of Telltale&apos;s thunder and I&apos;m glad I played it on a friend&apos;s system instead of buying it. You should do the same before you give your money to such lazy developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4955685">Expand</a></span>

However the one thing I did not like at all was the emotional angst with chloe about her friend rachel. I don&apos;t care about this character Rachel who is being forced down my throat at every possible turn. The emotional teen drama was quite off putting but I understand why it was there. Hopefully the next couple of episodes can be more about the concept of time travel instead of it being about the teen drama.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t like how Chloe kept saying &quot;hella&quot; it&apos;s really annoying and no one in the real world says &quot;hella&apos; unless they&apos;re joking or with their friends. Saying it in the face of a gun.. was kind of stupid and did not appeal to me what so ever. (minor nitpick)
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t really like how you couldn&apos;t go back in time and take a picture of Chloe almost getting shot to show the principle... that would&apos;ve made sense but yeh
<br>Postives.. the music was good. The characters aren&apos;t that annoying, the story was good, aswell as the stuff you can do in the world. I just didn&apos;t really like the whole &quot;Find the CD to put the music on&quot; what?
<br>
<br>overall, a decent episode. Not what people have been making it out to be, but decent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5538632">Expand</a></span>

Actually the girl can reverse time, so you have the chance to change each of your decisions from bad to worse. No matter what you do, the consequences will prevail. This is exactly how an adolescent feels like, all the time. If you are older, you will feel reminded of times you thought long time forgotten. And yes, it&apos;s boring. Even though there is crime and murder everything drowns in the desperate dullness of a place that should never have been populated. Apropos nature: You will see the worst drawn trees in your life, and much of the other graphics details is sketch-like, unfinished. I guess the game might be a good recommendation for many female players, but it&apos;s just a guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-1---chrysalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=7641551">Expand</a></span>
