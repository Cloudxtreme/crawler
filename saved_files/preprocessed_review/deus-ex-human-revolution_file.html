The atmosphere is just perfect and the musical score just enhances it. Some scenes are just jaw-dropping. The gameplay is also spot on. The controls are responsive (except mousing over keys on keypads), the graphics are sharp, the story is compelling and the characters are interesting. A warning, though: when you first play the game, some things may irritate you, but you will soon see that they make sense. Your inventory size is limited and you often have to leave behind precious things that you KNOW you&apos;ll need later. But that makes sense. No matter how much you&apos;re enhanced, you&apos;re not a pick-up truck. Already, the game makes unrealistic concessions to allow you to tote a bazooka, a sniper rifle, a mini-gun, and crates of ammo through public places without being noticed or even through metallic air ducts without making a sound. You might want to try a Schwarzenegger-like charge through a cluster of enemies, only to find that a single bullet can kill you. Well, shucks. A bullet really CAN kill you. The game forces you to play smarter than the usual shooter. That&apos;s a good thing. At first, the hacking just seems arbitrarily frustrating and you might try to avoid it at all costs... until you figure out how it works, and then it becomes fun! The only thing that remains that still frustrates me is that you can&apos;t carry more than one of each type of weapon (to sell them). If you have a pistol and you pick up a second pistol, it gets converted to ammo and you&apos;re left not with two pistols but one pistol with more ammo. But that&apos;s a drop of lameness in a bucket of awesomeness. And yet more awesomeness: you really can play this game many ways. Early decisions have an impact on later events, so you can replay it trying out different approaches and you will see different results. The result is that you&apos;ll probably replay it many times, playing the good guy, the bad guy, etc. This might not be a fair comparison, but the nanosuit in Crysis does &quot;feel&quot; more powerful than the enhancements in Deus Ex. I wouldn&apos;t mind a cross-over where I could play DE using a nanosuit, just to compare. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1978401">Expand</a></span>

This game is bloody brilliant in every single way.  Great story, great dialogue, great graphics on pc maxed out and at 60 fps.  You cant beat that.

Now, 5 hours into the game I have been able to dig deep into the core and see what play &quot;Human Revolution&quot; is truly like, and it is good. I feel like they captured the original perfectly. From the moment you begin playing HR you realize this REALLY is the new Deus Ex, not some cheap knock of made to make money. The cover system really enhanced the way I was able to go through levels. The tiny details made me feel like I was not only killing and knocking out bad guys, but actually uncovering secrets I wasn&apos;t supposed to know. If you are a fan of the original or FPS games in general, I *highly* recommend this game.<br><br>You might ask if this game actually deserves a perfect score. The reason I gave it one is because it does everything a game should, immerses you into a world and allows you to connect with the characters. The action is unyielding and exciting, while the story is better then most movies. This game deserves the 10 I gave it because it delivered on the promise of giving me a new game in the series just as good as the original.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1727678">Expand</a></span>

Sure the inventory control is sticky (why?) and many NPCs have the shakes (um why?) but it is true to the original - nonlinear play (um, this isn&apos;t a sandbox like Oblivion tho) should you cloak and zip passed the cameras, or evade the guards, or walk around the roof and float down if you have the right aug to get to your objective, etc.  It is very PC friendly (with one exception below), allowing you to save almost anywhere at any time and good remapping of key ability.  It has COMMON SENSE - thank you for not making us RE-FIGHT the last boss to see all the endings.  Sheesh I hate that.  My only real criticisms are (1) I had trouble mass delete saved games; i.e. i couldn&apos;t go into the directory and delete 80 games at once, b/c it would still think they were there - very frustrating and (2) it should let you have more than 100 saves.  Finally, sometimes it felt a bit too easy even on the very hardest difficulty (3) I tried very hard to get a pacifist rating but i guess i blew it somewhere without knowing it - sigh; would have been nice to know where so I could re-load... (4) and finally, I felt like maybe there should be more enemies if you get caught or something.  I played non-lethal all the way (so I thought; maybe i screwed up the beginning scene) and sneaked passed everyone or took them out quietly.  But you could play through WAY faster just popping everyone in the head.MINOR BUT NECESSARY SPOILER (below): XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXWait out the credits for secret scene.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729669">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a distinct sense of nostalgia in the air, and not because of the high regard or this game&apos;s predecessor but because the game doesn&apos;t expect you to be an idiot, you need to make informed intelligent choices, plan ahead, use your brain, try approaching things in different ways - failure to do so often results in the player getting stranded in areas they can&apos;t advance from. One of my favourite aspects of the game are the implementation of the augments, contextual or otherwise. The social/persuasion augment is fantastic, hacking games are smart and others open up areas of the game previously unavailable. However the graphics aren&apos;t mind-blowing and conversation animations are limited but not so that it detracts from the enjoyment of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1737353">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game was made for the fans of the original, that is for sure. I remember hearing about a reboot of this franchise and was almost 100% sure it would fail. i&apos;m glad to see that Eidos Montreal has stayed true to the franchise and brought this floundering franchise back to the forefront of interactive entertainment. That, and most of the IT Terminology is actually correct.</span>

I&apos;m giving it a 10 not because it&apos;s perfect (no game is &apos;perfect&apos;) but because it represents the ceiling in modern gaming -- this is what other video games should aspire to be in 2011. Human Revolution allows and encourages player experimentation and freedom. There is no &apos;right&apos; way to play it, be it good, evil, stealthy, talky, actiony, or any combination thereof. The level design is freeform and there is always more than route to your objectives. The dialogue writing is solid, and the plot is compelling. The augmentation system is fantastic, and if you choose intelligently you can make Adam Jensen whatever kind of superhuman you want him to be. Minor quibbles include some spotty voice acting and stiff animations, but neither detracts from the fact that this a strong game of the year contender. I recommend this to just about anyone who likes video games. There&apos;s something in it for everybody.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729734">Expand</a></span>

Not many originally believed that a console oriented Deus Ex sequel developed in an era of dumbed down gaming experiences could in any way approach its predecessor, which, released in the year 2000, showed the world what does &quot;Interactive game&quot; truly mean. Turns out it could. Human Revolution is everything Deus Ex was and more, it is a true sequel to the cult classic and is a masterpiece on its own. It shows that, even in the year 2011 and despite the obsession of the gaming industry with simplifying games to the point where they can barely be called games anymore, it is still possible to have a high budget, blockbuster gaming experience designed not to be played by your grandma, but by you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729162">Expand</a></span>

However after playing the first game, I was doubtful that a new installment in the franchise could really be as good as the original, especially after the mediocrity of Invisible War. Nevertheless, I preordered the game and eagerly awaited its release today. A few hours into the game and I was completely blown away by what the developers had created. With countless number of ways to play the game and customize my augmentations, i really managed to feel like my playthrough was personal. Side Quests, usually the bane of RPG gamers, are deeply immersive and add to and flesh out the life of the intriguing story. The art design is ridiculously good, mirroring and alluding to the renaissance while the color palette really brings emotion and life to the dark game. My only woes about HR is the voice acting and animations. While some cutscenes and dialogue scenes are well animated, a few are a bit stiff and not lifelike. However for a game that does so many things right, these are only minor complaints. Human Revolution is still a great game and i&apos;m sure i&apos;ll lose my social life to it for at least a month</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1728882">Expand</a></span>

It has that old school RPG flare to it that has been missing in RPG&apos;s for over a decade.  Luckily, this game doesn&apos;t try to hold your hand like pretty much every other game out in existence nowadays.  You can do what you want, when you want.  The augmentations are interesting and adds depth to exploration and combat.  I really do feel like a badass when I am sneaking around taking guys out stealthily, and the characters in this game are phenomenal.  I actually care what they have to say, though the facial animations could use a little work, but that&apos;s minor to everything else this game offers.  Overall, this game deservers GOTY and is the best RPG i&apos;ve played in a really long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729862">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m the kinda guy who only buys games to sit on multiplayer with friends so this was a big risk for me. The only big single player games i had played were bioshock 1 and 2 and Farcry2. This game is by far one of the most exciting games ive played. It surrounds 3 major ways to play which entices all style of player and allows you to play stealthy or head on. If your looking for a good plot, graphic action scenes, and a game that leaves you in awe even after you&apos;ve done what would seem repetitive in most games then this is a game for you. Ive never found the story mode of a game so interesting but im 2 hrs in and if i didnt have school id sit on it all night it just always has more to throw your way</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730022">Expand</a></span>

To say the least, DX:HR is a great edition to the franchise series of Deus Ex, I have not gotten very far, as I am taking my time and learning the games setup, options, intrigue, and story as well as plot built into the games system through ebooks and emails. The writing and acting in the game is incredible, streaming an awesome cast and very neutral to aggressive outlook for the main character Adam Jenson allowing you to come to terms with the main character without feeling like not a part of the action. All aspects of this game is fun, from the hacking, social, combat, and stealth, everything comes together in a great combination that makes this a great game for the year. If this game doesn&apos;t have GOTY I will be greatly surprised. The only thing that seems to match this games integrety, complexity, gameplay, and story has yet to come out for another few months. And given this games capabilities and concepts, it will probably last just that long if not longer in my game collection as I roll through the games this year.
<br>II believe this game deserves a extra .5 added to the score, it soars way above my expectations of the game, and provides that little extra umph that I am glad I waited for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729029">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s all just amber monitors and &apos;future shine&apos; with tons of useless clutter thrown in everywhere.<br>I wouldn&apos;t really care much about those things if the game play was any good, but it&apos;s not. Dues Ex doesn&apos;t do much but sample and dilute the game play from superior titles. It doesn&apos;t do stealth nearly as good as splinter cell, thief, or Hitman. It doesn&apos;t do combat as good a myriad of recent and ancient titles too long to list, and the RPG elements are pretty bare bones. It&apos;s basically, talk to it, shoot it, stun it, or walk around it (hacks / stealth). And Stun it and Shoot it are the same thing for all intents and purposes; just another body to drag into a vent.<br>[As dragging corpse simulators go, it&apos;s not even that good. Sling the **** over your shoulder and hussle would you.]<br>More Gripes: Hacking Mini-game? Haven&apos;t we had enough of this crap? (The only enjoyable instance of this was in Dead Space 2 for the tension it brought). Please stop giving me a puzzle a goat with Down&apos;s Syndrome could solve and call it game play.<br>Weapons? Completely uninspired. They just put a &apos;future&apos; skin on the same dull weapon archetypes you see in every shooter since time immemorial. You can have a rifle, a pistol, a grenade of some kind, and some heavy guns. This is all they could think of? Oh, you can also have those things in &apos; stun &apos; versions, so you can be a pacifist. And the &apos;Typhoon&apos; Weapon...? Nothing says &quot;we&apos;re out of ideas&quot; more than an autokill button. Also, Max Payne called, he wants his spin animation back.<br>AI? Terrible. The same old, &apos;&apos;oh no a dead body, lets investigate... oh well he&apos;s not here, resume combat patrol.&apos; This day and age, and with a budget as big as this game, this is INEXCUSABLE. They make up for this by just making them super accurate and giving you limited health, to disguise the fact that the enemies are dumber than Doom zombies.<br>Game play innovations? None. Zero. Not one thing is new in this game. And as I&apos;ve said, they can&apos;t even STEAL from games properly and make it fun.<br>Plot? Pretty dull Tom Clancy style thriller with some allegorical crud about augmented people being a new minority. Not to mention it heavily cribs from Mass effect 2 / Dead space 2 with the whole Hospital Resurrection after traumatic event scenario (Not that that concept wasn&apos;t done to death a decade ago). At least he didn&apos;t get amnesia as well. Want a better plot? Why not make it the protagonists choice to augment himself. Make it a moral issue. Give some **** conflict too it. Nope, he just wakes up with some cool new arms and a heads up display.<br>Augmentations? Boring Boring Boring. 6 or so levels of &apos;energy enhancer.&apos; In the far future, I&apos;m picking up Zelda Hearts. Woop-de-doo. There&apos;s An eye enhancement that literally tells me when enemies will resume their combat patrol. And some other miscellaneous nonsense that lets me run faster or pick up heavier items or steady my aim. RPG-wise this is just a JAVA fantasy RPG rapped in sci fi skin, but you don&apos;t have spells to make it fun.<br>Cover Based Fighting? I don&apos;t mind this in games, but Dues Ex manages to make it clunky enough to not want to use, but necessary to use almost 100% of the time if you&apos;re going for stealth. Have fun sticking to walls wherever you go. Also, This game can&apos;t decide to be first or third person, and generally picks the worst of both worlds.<br>Auto KILL / Stun? You can press Q to instantly kill or stun someone near you. You get to watch an animation. They don&apos;t even give you a quicktime event to be bored with.<br>Climbing? Nope, YOU NEED TO STACK BOXES, even though you&apos;re a superhuman killing machine. And to get around this, you can buy an upgrade to let you jump higher. Whatever it takes not to make a climbing over short obstacles animation huh?<br>To anyone wanting to play this anyway, wait till it&apos;s on the bargain bin. If you spend $60 on this you&apos;re a sucker. I&apos;ve played the original Dues Ex, but this game is Dues Ex in title only, and a pretty cynical attempt to rake in cash based on brand loyalty. I guarantee, if this game had another title and less hype, it wouldn&apos;t score past 60% on most reviews.<br>And no, I didn&apos;t finish the game, because if it&apos;s not fun in the first 6 hours, It won&apos;t be fun later, says my common sense so don&apos;t give me this &apos;no-patience, go play CoD crap.&apos; I have patience enough for good games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1731139">Expand</a></span>

I was pleased to hear about the release of Deus Ex: Human Revolution (HR)- which is the first of a series of three upcoming Deus Ex games in the franchise. Many in the PC community had doubts about whether it would be developed as the original - for PC (windows) then ported out to the consoles, and as it turned out: we were right to have those doubts. HR is a polished linear FPS trying to be everything at once. Trying to be like Gears of War - much of the game scenario&apos;s are built of the ability to hide or crouch behind cover. Trying to be like Mass Effect, with a lot of dialogue and story. Trying to be like the original game, with a futuristic avatar newly augmented with upgrading weapons and augmentation tech tree&apos;s. All good developments in gaming, and yet the game does *not* even come close to excellent gameplay.  Trying to be everything at once is an underwhelming feeling in the game, and takes away it&apos;s original flare. The story is also very predictable. Now those aspects are important but they aren&apos;t the real reason why I dislike this game. They alone make this game no better than a 7/10 - at best. But the reason I rate this one low, is for PC gaming related issues. This one is important to PC users. The original Deus Ex game is one of the mecca&apos;s of the FPS genre. It was a huge step in all the right directions when it came out and re-defined what a computer game and be and do. Many people went out and bought PC&apos;s after playing the original game, myself included. Now as a PC gamer we can tell - immediately - that the whole UI and key mappings systems (controls) - were developed by a console gamer, for a console gamer, then ported to the PC. In short - they don&apos;t work. The game play is a constant battle (much like other games brought out by this developer like AC and AC2), having to constantly force yourself to learn the cover mechanic is a huge step away from traditional FPS gameplay and I don&apos;t like it one bit. It feels like an arcade game, not a deep experience.<br><br>Anyone who has played Half Life (by Valve) knows what I&apos;m talking about. That game is a deep experience. So was the original Deus Ex. Now we have a console rip off with bad UI, poor controls, trying to be everything at once - and it&apos;s just, well, boring to play.<br><br>This game already has a *huge* fanbase and following. Many of us spent out $45 expecting big things, I for one will not be making that mistake twice.<br><br>I rate it a 6.5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1736086">Expand</a></span>

The amount of times I dropped out this game was shocking. It suffices to say that had this game been released 10 years ago it would have been jaw droppingly amazing but in the here and now, it is just plain bad.<br>The graphics are great, but unimaginative. Honestly lets stop making worlds that set out to be realistic, only to be thwarted by the fact that realistic is outside my own window. I want to enter someone&apos;s imagination.<br>The sound is as almost always nowadays great, it doesn&apos;t bother me if I don&apos;t like some of the characters voice, that&apos;s part of the experience.<br>The gameplay is boring. There it is, the single most important aspect of the game and it falls flat on its face.<br>Dead Space gave you one way of playing and you were drawn into the game. It was tense, fun, scary and above all you remembered having played it.<br>CoDMW2 really made you feel like something important was happening. What would you do to win? Again a memorable game. Again the creators of the game decided on a direction and stuck with it. Memorable.<br>The original Deus Ex was groundbreaking, not for its graphics or sound but for it&apos;s playability. At the time there had been nothing else like it. The creators had a vision, then made you see it. I remember that game well.<br>Alan Wake, physchological thriller, brilliant! Made me scared of the dark for a while. I loved being affected that way.<br>This game just plain annoys me due to its complete inability to hold my attention.<br>Shoot some police and they run around, stare at you through the vent you&apos;re hiding behind then run around some more until they decide that a cop killer obviously hiding in the ventilation shaft is not a problem anymore. Excuse me?<br>i actually moved a drinks machine right up to a cop who didn&apos;t once bat an eyelid! I popped out from behind it and bam he shot me. WTF?<br>Lets be honest this game is mediocre. An up to date, well polished mediocre game. Oh and on the Xbox version at least it&apos;s bugged on a side quest, mother&apos;s instinct. It&apos;s not allowing the quest to be completed during the final dialogue phase.<br>Enough said, sorry for rambling. BTW I wrote this on my Ipad, not intended to be a boast. I love it but want to say to Apple - I&apos;m not buying a stupidly expensive additional keyboard to edit what I write just because you won&apos;t put some extra and obviously missing keys on the screen keypad. So sorry all for the mistakes!<br>Enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1733499">Expand</a></span>

Still, it&apos;s relatively well made and better than most games this year (I&apos;m looking at you Bioware). The PC version felt pretty native, even with it being a console port. What saddens me most is that they had to cut out an entire city hub to meet the deadlines. I swear, my first Deus ex playthrough was twice longer than this. It was fairly obvious they couldn&apos;t hire any decent voice actors either, but that&apos;s not a major issue.<br>I&apos;m giving it 5 for &quot;average&quot;, as in &quot;good, but there is room for improvement&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1731399">Expand</a></span>

I remember when I played the first Deus Ex there was something magical about it, which I quite don&apos;t recall, but I hold the feeling deep inside to this day. I was pretty excited when I saw the trailer to Human Revolution - it had that gritty dark ambient future feeling in it, technology and mankind mixing together and the troubles along with it you could craft a nice solid story around it. Now playing the game all that really creates any atmosphere are the colours and maybe the music. Everything else is bland.<br><br>Also the reason why I chose to create this account was because I noticed something weird. And surely it is no big discovery, but most of the people commenting on the game have one comment and below most of them lies &quot;11 of 13 users said yes&quot;. So the marketing team are fully at it, tampering with the user score to cover up the lameness of the game. Sad really. And that&apos;s the reason I gave it a 1, to get closer to the truth that the game is average and worth 6 points at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1736460">Expand</a></span>

Are they real people or augs? I wanted to keep playing because the design is kick a**, but I hate it when games just repeat environments, repeat boring tasks to gain info and fail to make me care about characters. The games awesome ads and artwork pull me in but the gameplay kicked me out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1733894">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are polished, but five years late. The environments are so flat and ugly even present-day metro Detroit is beautiful in comparison to ANY city hub in the game (Adam&apos;s apartment is an exception). The obvious  2D backgrounds and lighting effects are disgustingly simple and not worthy to be called AAA for sure. Blurry textures are commonplace at max settings and you WILL see clipping. The gameplay is okay and will hook you, but the AI has nothing special going for it and is often embarrassingly dumb. Kill a guy, hide in the vent in front of him, watch as he suddenly fails to see you and forgets about your existence. Okay. 2011 gaming for you, but at least it&apos;s polished. The first time you quit, you won&apos;t feel the urge to launch the game again, though. Speaking of vents, they mostly conveniently connect vital areas, so if you&apos;re trying to be &quot;stealthy&quot; you&apos;ll spend your game watching your feet for the stray vent. Other promisingly difficult routes end up in impossible spots you simply can&apos;t cross undetected, which means you have to backtrack and find your vent, which is often a much easier route. The characters aren&apos;t memorable: a pathetically annoying sysadmin, an old receptionist and your classic **** of spiderman fame will be your main cast for a good part of the game, while the main character has the appeal of a fossilized trout from start to end.  I won&apos;t even get started on how the few good ideas this game has are a blatant copy of other better titles. A hacking minigame. Seriously, AGAIN? I could rant all day, but in alternative i could go play a better game than Deus Ex: Human Revolution and forget about it. It probably deserves a 5 or a 6, but in the face of &quot;universal acclaim&quot; 0 is all it will ever get from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1733789">Expand</a></span>

I picked up the quest item and headed out. I tried for over an hour to get back out the way came, but sneaking up proved insanely difficult. So I reloaded my save from the basement, fooled around, and found a possible exit through the sewers. The sewer entrance is locked and requires level three hacking. I have level two, with now way to upgrade. So basically, my &quot;chosen gameplay style&quot; was incompatible with actually playing the game.<br><br>I liked the original game and WANT to like this version, but after eight hours of play I am throwing in the towel.

Story line seemed good, but the game felt like I was just completing tasks to see the next cut scene seeing they were the most exciting parts. This game would have made a much better movie than game. Controls and customization of such lacked none.

The story, characters and voice-acting are easily its strongest points. These are backed by solid game play that stays true to the original. The explorers among us won&apos;t be disappointed either -- the game&apos;s scenery is nothing short of beautiful, and riddled with hidden areas. Unfortunately, the game forces the player into a small number of &apos;boss&apos; encounters which are not conducive to certain play styles. Stealthy players in particular will find themselves having to put aside their silenced munitions in favor of high explosives for a short time. This, combined with several small, but irksome graphical quirks (ie. take-downs on seated NPCs) will occasionally interrupt an otherwise perfect experience of total immersion. However, these minor blemishes won&apos;t sway one&apos;s opinion of the game in any major way. It&apos;s still an absolutely amazing title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730858">Expand</a></span>

First they patched the game so many of the bugs that it released with have been fixed (tho, Steam forums are still populated with people having problems).  Second my opinion of the game got worse.  There is nothing good at all in this game.  The AI is the single worst I have ever seen.  The graphics (despite DX11) are very bad with overly simplistic environments made up of the same prop copied over and over.  Likewise the sounds are repetitive and enemies will get on your nerves repeating the same thing over and over again.  Character models look at least 4 years old, to compare I went to Half Life 2 which is 6 years old, about the same.  The story is so full of unbelievable stupid downright thoughtless missteps and pitfalls its more of a parody of something, tho what I have no idea.  It will have you doing things like covering for employees stealing from your company, though you are the security chief and as far as you know the company saved your life.  Later you will be asked to collect debts and steal things, none of which have anything to do with....anything.  Your actions have ZERO impact on the story or outcome.  To be sure of this I started a second play through and murdered everyone in Detroit, except quest givers, but I did murder quest objectives before I had received their quests.  No change in anyone&apos;s behavior, guy A tells me to &quot;take care of&quot; guy B and so on.  I even killed all the cops in the station which didn&apos;t seem to bother any cops outside, or even on a different floor of the station while I was doing it.  There are no consequences for any of your actions unless maybe you kill a quest giver before you finish his quest.  On the hardest difficulty the game is pathetically easy because the dumb AI will all stand in a row for you waiting to get shot.  Out of ammo?  No problem, just duck behind a corner or box for about 5 mins and they will forget about you.  Also the freedom and open gameplay which is so prominently advertised is nonexistent.   Your choice is to get from point A to goal B by either crawling through vents (and for a 40 hour game, do you want to stare at the insides of duct work for that long?) or by shooting your way there.  It&apos;s as linear as linear gets, the goals never change, the order never changes and once you are done with an area it&apos;s done, there is no going back to explore more.  I am genuinely dumbfounded that anyone likes this game and is willing to look past its multiple and glaring short comings.  If you enjoy good graphics, a solid story that makes sense, intelligent enemies and challenging gameplay look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1728951">Expand</a></span>

In fact, it could arguably be a direct copy of Mass Effect 2 with the added elements of climbing ladders and crawling through vents. That is not a compliment. The shooting is stiff, the graphics are dated, the quests are glitched, and some of the augmentation upgrades are practically necessary if you want to experience anything resembling nonlinear gameplay. Hacking is a perfect example of this. It&apos;s used everywhere for almost everything. Be prepared to fully upgrade the hacking augmentation before doing anything else (unless you just want to run from cover to cover shooting people until you reach the end of the level). Overall the game leaves an impression of poor planning and stale mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1729141">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay overall works very well, but I would first like to address my minor problems with it. Sometimes when you have an object such as a crate against a rail, you will have to press and hold space multiple times to get where you are trying to go. There is also no &quot;hold&quot; options for crouch, iron sights, etc.; only toggle. This means that you cannot hold your crouch button, and release to stand up. You have to press the button once to crouch, and again to stand. In other words, there are some clunky moments, but it&apos;s definitely nothing unbearable. Avoiding lasers and cameras, neutralizing guards, finding secret areas and vents, etc. all work very well and are just plain fun. The character customization is a bit mediocre. Upon replaying the game, I found myself picking the same old upgrades I did last time. It&apos;s pretty obvious which abilities are good, and which ones just aren&apos;t necessary at all. This is one of the few games that I think should go down in time as a must play from generation 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2255372">Expand</a></span>

That could be the reason why I enjoyed it as much as I did, though. It seemed almost as if it was made for consoles, even though I know it was made for PCs. It had a few bugs here and there, and I thought the first boss was very OP, but I still enjoyed playing this game very much. The story line was hit and miss, and depended a lot (almost entirely) on Adam&apos;s love interest. The hacking system was INCREDIBLY well designed, forcing me to think strategically every time I had to get through a door, open a safe, etc. All hacking was also done in real time, meaning that the world around you doesn&apos;t go on a lunch break just because you need to get though a door, you will still be shot at. This game did a LOT of things right, and even if you rated this game a 0, you must admit that it had something that every game could learn from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757494">Expand</a></span>

Eidos and Square Enix never managed to fully fix those. With the latest patches and drivers it got a bit better but the stutter is not gone entirely.</span>

I really think it should have had a reset button for your skills though, going around with a particular skill set and then figuring out that none of them will help where you&apos;re at is a bit annoying at times, but those times are scarce enough not to matter too much. The AI isn&apos;t all that bright but you do have to think in combat situations as you die quickly if you botch it up.

So it&apos;s obvious that when I heard about the new prequel that was supposed to capture that same vibe, it was a must have. I didn&apos;t just invest in the game, I chose my new PC on the basis that it could run this game. And sure, it&apos;s good, it&apos;s occasionally fun and the world is absolutely brimming over with little interesting details like conversations, emails and props that make it appear living and breathing. I love the stealth feature where the camera goes third person when hiding behind walls and objects, and the visual aesthetics and music aren&apos;t a letdown. However, when I got near the end of the game, I either got bored or got a bout of gamer fatigue, and I would argue that if a game ever lets you experience that, then it&apos;s not worthy a 9 or an 8. It&apos;s a good game - no doubt about that - but the experience I had was nowhere near that of the original 2000 release. If you haven&apos;t played any game in the series, go get the original. It&apos;s on Steam and it&apos;s cheap. If you&apos;ve played that one and want to pick this one up, prepare to be - if not very, then a little disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796727">Expand</a></span>

Firefights are extremely clunky, and once you engage in one, you might as well cross your fingers and hope you saved recently.<br><br>I also felt the progression was very linear, for what initially appears to be a sandbox style game. At the 20 hour mark, I simply gave up and sold the game. Being a new parent, my nights are limited to only a couple of hours to myself, so after eating up 2 solid weeks of personal time, I can safely say I got my money&apos;s worth. I recommend this to anyone who is a HUGE fan of stealth based games, but if you&apos;re looking for action, steer clear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1754124">Expand</a></span>

The bad: the story was lacking a little and could have been more captivating by showing and setting up new levels or important situations, there were quite a few loose ends in the story that were never fully explained which was disappointing, the voice acting didn&apos;t sync very well with the character&apos;s facial animation (almost a travesty sometimes), the connection between the characters was fairly dull and forced (besides Sarif and Jensen), and some of the graphic textures and sky overlays were not good for a DX11 game.

Probably, but timing and the release date is everything nowadays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800393">Expand</a></span>

The added bonus is that it also has mystery and conspiracy, which I also have a deep appreciation for.<br><br>Note that I never played either the original &quot;Deus Ex&quot; or &quot;Invisible War&quot;, so my opinion is not informed by any past experience with the prequels; and this is not a review or an expose on the features of the game, but a surface-level stream-of-consciousness jotting of a quick thought with the intention of merely scoring it.<br><br>I hated on it at first. It really took a while for me to warm up to the game as I thought it was pretty dull in the beginning, but by the time I got to Hengsha, I started to really enjoy &quot;Human Revolution&quot;. This at a time in my life where even games I used to enjoy seem stale to me and I&apos;ve all but stopped playing games. So I think that says something for the appeal of the game. I have yet to finish as I take month-long breaks, but every time I play, I never feel disappointed. The infiltration aspect is par excellence--Up there with the MGS and SC games and the challenge is worthwhile. The environments, although over-abundantly &apos;gold&apos;, still possess quite a bit of atmosphere. And the story can be very engrossing at times.<br><br>What I didn&apos;t care for at all were the boss battles. I suppose some of the inspiration for them may have come from the MGS series, but they were nowhere near as fitting or engaging. They just seemed like clumsy add-ons to a game that would have been fine other wise. What&apos;s really disappointing about them however is that in a throw-down between two seriously OP transhumans, you would think the fights would be as epic as something out of a high-octane anime. But alas, they were little more than predictable shootouts.<br><br>O well. Overall, the seratonin in my brain was much healthier playing &quot;HR&quot; than it has been playing games of late, so the devs done something right.<br><br>Play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2119900">Expand</a></span>

It should really be called &quot;Hacking Simulator 2.0: Now With Stealth!&quot; It seems like hacking is the solution to EVERYTHING. Locked door? Hack it. Security camera? Hack it. Hostile robots patrolling? Hack them. Turrets? Hack them. Lasers? Hack them. Computers? Hack them. Hacking gives you xp, too, so there&apos;s never any reason NOT to hack stuff. Even in the final boss (UGH the bosses!!!) I was able to hack at my leisure.
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>That would be fine if the hacking were fun, but it really gets annoying. Especially since the % chance of detection is completely ridiculous. I kid you not, when attempting to hack a 35% detection node, I counted being detected 7 times in a row. That wasn&apos;t unusual, too.
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>The stealth can be rather fun at times, but the AI is absolutely ridiculously bad. Enemy 1 will be facing away from me, and I&apos;ll take down enemy 2 standing 10 feet behind him and get away with it. Enemy 2 will gasp and grunt as I snap his arm, drop his gun which clatters to the ground, and get slammed on his back on the ground, while enemy 1 is none the wiser.
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>The game prides itself on letting you play how you want, but combat doesn&apos;t feel like a valid choice. It feels like you failed at stealth. Also, most of the guns are worthless. The standard 10mm pistol is way easier to kill enemies with than the shotgun, machine pistol, assault rifle, heavy rifle, and even the sniper rifle. Plus, you won&apos;t get the cool guns (grenade launcher, rocket launcher, plasma rifle, laser rifle) until right before the end of the game anyway. At least I didn&apos;t, and I explored everything and did every side mission.
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>The plot is interesting, but way too busy. This person is behind it, but no they have an excuse, so THIS person is behind it, but no they have an excuse too, rinse and repeat. The &quot;bad guy&quot; changes so often in this game that eventually you just zone out. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I like what they were going for here, but I don&apos;t think they quite hit it. Couple that with how much everyone raved about this game before I played it, and I ended up disappointed. You may like it, though. It&apos;s certainly not a BAD game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2769156">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack is fantastic, the story isn&apos;t bad, and the character you play is a dude. I also really liked the art neuveau style clothing and indoor architecture used in the game. There really is a lot to like about this title but I wouldn&apos;t put it at the top of my list of favorites.<br><br>I enjoyed the stealth aspect, it didn&apos;t focus on it, but gave you the option all the way through to go completely undetected, it was very basic though. Pathfinding was a bit a joke as well really... Can&apos;t hack this keypad? Well, there&apos;s probably a convenient ventilation shaft you can climb through to access this person&apos;s office, or police armoury, or high level governmental official&apos;s house, or something... Are security set-ups really that lax?  The cover system was pretty similar to Mass Effect 2 but it was a lot less forgiving, you really couldn&apos;t take many shots before going down (that&apos;s not a necessarily a bad thing though). You had to make sure you got your headshot aimings spot on because the enemies didn&apos;t give you a second either way to take aim. Unfortunately that made me go for the nicely overpowered cinematic takedown route. You could literally run at someone, tap Q in reach and watch as the protagonist lays a swift roundhouse or chokehold to the badguy, regardless of their armour, rendering him out for the count - the count being, forever, or until a buddy finds them and cracks out the smelling salts - and after realising the last &quot;energy cell&quot; (used for takedowns) runs out, it recharges, there was no need to use my stun gun or tranquilizer rifle for most of the game. The social aug that allowed you to analyze and and influence personality gave a nice touch to the NPC character interactions at key parts of the game. However It really didn&apos;t seem like any of this made a big difference to the outcome of the story (if any at all) it was all just a means to an end. If you couldn&apos;t get someone to do something for you, you&apos;d go ninja vent crawling and cinematic take-downing until you did it yourself. Which to be fair, made you feel like a bad-ass anyway!<br><br>I&apos;ve probably focused on the bad aspects too much, the game is far from bad, my memories of Deus Ex have just lead me to want the perfect game from the series! This is definitely a worthwhile addition anyway!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1746030">Expand</a></span>

The story felt too weak and there isn&apos;t much motivation for what you are doing. IMO, the beginning should have really been in the middle.

I was very entertained and intrigued by the storyline, and the gameplay was fun and engaging.
<br>
<br>The character customization felt impactful.  I did not feel that I was dumping my points into meaningless categories.  I enjoyed the combat aspects of the game...but I was happier with the idea that I had the OPTION to fight or find an alternate way of handling a scenario.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t feel like the game was holding my hand through the exploration of maps or finding specific objectives.  The game does have map waypoints and helpful tools, but there isn&apos;t a shiny line guiding me in a certain direction, which is usually because there are multiple ways to get to a given objective.  This game is a reminder that it can be fun to figure things out.
<br>
<br>I would have liked to have more interaction with the world.  There are many buildings, doors, windows, things lying around, etc., that you cannot do anything with.  They are simply part of the game&apos;s &quot;sift through things to find what you need&quot;.  If you need it, you can interact with it.
<br>
<br>The game felt to be more rewarding if you followed a path that involved sneaking &amp; hacking.  Hard charging into an area with guns blazing proves to be effective, and sometimes very fun...but it&apos;s over quick.  Taking  your time, mapping out in your mind what to and where to gohide, and planning a strategy all seem to be what the developers had in mind.
<br>
<br>I played on the easiest difficulty (because I want the story, I don&apos;t care about how many bullets it takes to kill a bad guy).  I don&apos;t believe playing on EZ mode detracted anythiing from my experience.  The puzzles were still fun.  The combat still made me think about my next move.
<br>
<br>This game is worth the time, and worth the money.  I was happy with how long the game lasted, although I admit that the game would be a significantly shorter experience if I went around killing everyone.
<br>
<br>Although I haven&apos;t started a second playthrough, I would agree that there is absolutely enough of a game here to give the game a second playthrough.  There are many missions with different paths, and I was left many times wondering what would have happened if I went with a different method.
<br>
<br>Suggestions for developers:
<br>
<br>Playing &quot;non lethal&quot; really restricts the ability to modify weapons, as there isn&apos;t a lot of inventory space to carry much of both my lethal and non lethal weapons around.  I love modifyingtinkering with weapons so I&apos;d try to carry them around just in case I came across some weapon mods...because the non lethal options didn&apos;t permit many upgrades.
<br>
<br>There is an ability to store my gear in a central place...but I did not like how disorganized it was.  I didn&apos;t want to simply drop items on the ground and come back later.  I wanted gun racks, drawers that I could put things in, etc.
<br>
<br>This game could have done without the boss battles.  In a sense, I felt punished for my play style.  In a game where I am given the option to resolve scenarios in so many different ways...I am trapped into a trigger-happy-hope-you-are-good-at-shooters-even-though-this-game-really-isn&apos;t-a-shooter type thing.  I felt very removed from the experience in these areas, even though the story line was linked to the encounter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1767996">Expand</a></span>

What I enjoyed the most was that the game encourages you to seek alternative paths and rely on stealth. However the game lacks a bit of character development as far as I&apos;m concerned. Most of the NPC&apos;s are bland while some feel underdeveloped, like there was no time to finish and record more dialogue. What I would have loved to see is meeting your friends or colegues at your apartament to enjoy some R&amp;R, just to ease the transitions between missions a little. Overall I was satisfied with this title. I will be purchasing the dlc that came out recently as soon as it&apos;s less than 10 euros.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1799389">Expand</a></span>

The legendary boss battles for me, weren&apos;t such a pain as my character was tooled up for a fire-fight, but I can see why they weren&apos;t that popular. Currently this my game of the year.

This game has a ton of atmosphere. Whether you are hopping between the cramped rooftops of lower Hengsha or crawling through a sewage drain in Detroit, this game always feels like a living breathing world. All aided greatly by an interesting aesthetic and an incredible soundtrack (as well as a spot on Alex Jones parody on the in game radio). The gameplay is well executed and varied, always allowing you multiple ways to tackle any area ranging from running in guns blazing to moving through vents undetected to hacking a robot and letting it mow down the enemies for you. The first couple bosses are quite challenging especially as I was doing a pacifist playthrough, they reminded me of boss fights of old where I actually had to try more than once to beat it. Too bad the rest of the game is fairly easy, even on the hardest mode. Finally the storyline is compelling and satisfying, a morally ambiguous conspiracy ridden tale which will throw most people for at least a few loops (Unless you frequent TV Tropes) and leads to some interesting choices at the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2120503">Expand</a></span>

One of the biggest downfalls, as many players have pointed out, are the lack of challenge in the boss fights. Once you figure out the &quot;shortcuts&quot;, the boss fights are insultingly easy. The plot also gets a bit convoluted as you progress. Other than that, it has generally solid gameplay. Most weapons can be upgraded, you can install Augmentations to enhance your abilities, and you have an XP system, where you acquire a Praxis kit for each time you level up to select said Augmentations. Stealth is an optional approach, as are non-lethal means of neutralizing bad guys. Using cover in your combat environment is a must - going Rambo will get you killed quickly. There are plenty of side quests to take on throughout the game as well. I have not played the first two Deus Ex games though, so I&apos;m not in a position to compare it to earlier games in the series. Regardless, gamers should try this one out if they haven&apos;t already.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2287228">Expand</a></span>

The story is entertaining enough to get the player through the game, although it is not spectacular. The settings are varied enough to keep the player interested. The quests offer some variety thanks to the dynamic gameplay. The player often has choices as to how he/she wants to complete an objective. Stealth, pacifism, combat-- all ways the player can play through. The story is slightly affected by character choices, although only the end is really changed. at the end of the day, this game is part of the Deus Ex series. As such, the game is an entertaining role-playing shooter. I definitely recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507974">Expand</a></span>

Graphically the models fall short of the quality you find in Mass Effect 3 for example but they are convincing and quite good non-the-less.  The game is going for peanuts now on any platforms I&apos;ve noticed - absolutely worth picking up imo.</span>

The plot is relatively strong, although could be stronger. The gunplay and stealth &apos;feel&apos; like you would want them to. The hardest difficulty is balanced perfectly. The graphics can simply be described as &apos;acceptable&apos; - they don&apos;t detract from the gameplay, but you can&apos;t help at times but to wish it was running on a better engine; and there are negatives - The decision system is used rarely, and when it is, it feels like your choices make little impact - then when it comes to making the &apos;end game choice&apos;, you don&apos;t get to see how it plays out, you don&apos;t even get a cutscene. The praxis system make it too easy to level everything if you save all your cash and just buy praxis points, and your choices in how to specialise don&apos;t really feel like they have a huge impact on how you will end up playing the game. Would have also been nice to have more side missions available to you rather than the handful there are, with only a couple of those feeling relevant. Normally I have a lot to write, but in this instance I don&apos;t - It&apos;s a good game and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112653">Expand</a></span>

Hell, I didn&apos;t even need a real gun except for the out of place boss fights. Interesting, but graphically dated game. It&apos;s not open world-e, and the open world-esque parts just make you feel claustrophobic. The voice of Sarif sounds familiar.</span>

The main flaws in this game are the ease at which you can avoid the enemy by hiding behind a box (even though the guy is right beside you) and the combat (it&apos;s too easy to run and hide without having the enemy chase you).<br><br>However as you progress further and further the story and missions tend to make up for a lot of the easy combat.  This game is NOT a perfect 10 and although some of the negative reviews have valid points this game doesn&apos;t deserve a negative score either.  I think a lot of people got so hyped up at seeing the trailers that they might have been expecting a little too much out of this game..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1755601">Expand</a></span>

Deus Ex: Human Revolution provides people who are not very big fans of open world settings with a comfortable gameplay style that isn&apos;t too linear or too open ended. It offers many different choices to each possible scenario, may it be combat, stealth, or even talking your way through at specific points. DE: HR is a perfect example of GOOD console porting with its numerous and lovely DirectX11 bells and whistles. It will barely strain your PC, but still possess some lovely visuals. The characters do look rubbery and sometimes undetailed, but the environments are quite often stellar looking. All this eye candy runs at max framerate for me! But graphics alone don&apos;t make a game. The story, characters, and setting are all quite immersive. There is conspiracy and corruption abound within the dystopian future of DE: HR, and it provides us with emotionally powerful moral and philisophical implications! A highly reccomended game!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2105328">Expand</a></span>

The only reason it is not perfect is that the game worlds are a bit small and I feel the game could have been a lot longer with more side quests.

I am new to Deus Ex franchise and immediately got hooked in first couple of hours. The presentation and dialogs are handled similar to mass effect which I liked very much. However, the main strength of this game is the game mechanics. It&apos;s unusual for a game that combines so many aspects together. there are so many paths in each level to take, you can sneak past your enemies, or you could silently take down each enemy and hide their bodies, or you could grab a machine gun to fight your way through and if you increase your hack abilities, it will open even more ways to approach your goal. It&apos;s just so much fun to try each way out . I recommend it to any general PC gamer and I also bought the original deus ex at direct2drive. hope it will be as good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1950460">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll go to Hong Kong, for example, and there&apos;s not substantially more to explore than there was in the first DX. The game just wasn&apos;t that big, basically. It&apos;s not an open world game, which is fine. But when I&apos;m lead by the nose from location to location, I want to at least feel mildly overwhelmed by the expanse laying before me. In DX:HR, I felt more like I just entered a COD stage.
<br>
<br>The augmentation system is alright, I guess. It&apos;s been a while since I played this game, so I don&apos;t recall exactly how I felt about that at the time. All I know is that it didn&apos;t stand out in my mind as either good or bad. I guess I was pretty apathetic towards it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give the game credit for the strategy aspect - it really did present you with multiple opportunities to negotiate any given obstacle. If you were good at hacking, for example, you could alter the turrets/robots to attack your foes. Or maybe stealth was your bag, and you opted to shimmy past all the bad guys. Or maybe you just straight-up went in guns-blazing. Whatever the case, you really could contour the game to suit your play style.
<br>
<br>The absolute worse aspect of the game, however, was the boss battles. There were a few of these thrown into the mix, and they srsly detracted from the experience. For one thing, they were extremely difficult. Also, if you didn&apos;t possess the necessary resources to overcome your foe, then you were pretty much out of luck. Basically, you had to download a third party mod that allowed you to cheat your way through the encounter. Pretty lame, tbh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=5878934">Expand</a></span>

The combat is well done and stealth is a great way to save ammo which is in limited supply early in the game but is plentiful later.
<br>
<br>What I did not find amusing are somewhat dated graphics look, occasional freezes and in game map and inventory controls. Also, the way story was told was kind of boring. A lot of emphasis on reading instead of telling it in more indirect ways like Bioshock did (through background voices and videos). The dialogs are also too long for what they worth - they are not changing the game flow enough to justify time they take. The endings are also dissapointing. In fact, there was no reason to have multiple as they basically the same.
<br>
<br>With all said, It is still one of the best few titles of 2011 and is a very engaging and fun game. If you liked Bioschock or Escape from Butcher Bay then it should be on your list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2200011">Expand</a></span>

But that&apos;s to be expected, since the original Deus Ex is, in my opinion, the best game ever made. You shouldn&apos;t regret buying this if you are looking for an awesome adventure.</span>

The game was extrodinarily fun, had excellent gameplay, above average graphics, some of the best stealth in any game, but still was missing... something. That edge which makes a game transcend the 9-10 border. Deserving of a nine? Absolutely. Ten? Just... not quite.</span>

Deus Ex: Human Evolution is the third in the series and the second best of the bunch.  DE:HE is a well designed game that cleverly uses RPG elements with FPS gaming as well as the hacking gameplay from the original Deus Ex games.  It uses an odd engine that can be very tricky to master and can cause some frustration for some.  It&apos;s &quot;sticky&quot; as it uses the cover technique from games like Gears of War but doesn&apos;t utilize it in the environment properly.  It&apos;s not bad - it just takes a lot of getting used to.  The upgrade system is very well thought out and uses a system that is gained from XP.  XP is gained from hacking, quest completions and attacks.  It uses quite a bit from the previous Deus Ex games and it uses it well.  The visuals are well rendered with a huge nod to the Bladerunner film and any other similar cyberpunk work.  The game runs smoothly and has no visual flaws for the most part.  My PC did freeze completely during a FMV towards the end though as well a lighting issue on the same area.  The voice over work is very good and the audio foley is very creative.  The weapon selection is very good as well as the upgrade system.  There are various stores to buy equipment and ammo.  The credit system is simple and there are plenty of opportunities to gain creds.  There are a few different ways to approach the game by upgrading yourself: you can be more of a hacker, stealth expert or simply kill everything with weapons and attacks.  At times, DE:HE can be repetitive and frustrating given that the jobs are similar and cause the player to walk back and forth over and over.  The enemies AI is very predictable in some places and erratic in others.  The bosses are way too easy when using the Typhoon weapon, but if you want a challenge then you shouldn&apos;t use it. It&apos;s a very entertaining and vast world which is immersive and technical.  It&apos;s not perfect and falls short when compared to the first (Invisible War is slightly worse) which is a big compliment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2105864">Expand</a></span>

Well, my first play through ran 25 hours and I&apos;m debating if I want to dive in again because the game is just that engrossing.
<br>
<br>Graphically, there isn&apos;t much to brag on here.  HR does suffer from consolization, but the overall look and feel of the game is excellent.  The atmosphere of all the game locations is interesting and compelling enough to make you want to snoop around to try and find all the different things hidden.
<br>
<br>Sound is done well, if not slightly repetitive.  The soundtrack itself is good, but again, not stellar.  Voice acting is done particularly well and helps drive the narrative along.  Interaction with side quest NPCs made me want to go do their tasks instead of just seeing them as XP dispensers.
<br>
<br>Combat was much more in depth than I thought it would be - the cover system takes a little getting used to and a long time to completely master, but the options are vast.  You can roll through killing everything and everyone or you can go secret squirrel style and avoid gun fights if you want.  The game has a  way of rewarding your choices for achieving difficult tasks, which led me to replay some scenarios to see how I could do it differently.
<br>
<br>The RPG Skill Tree is adequate - depending on how you play the game, you can end up with many different abilities.  I was slightly disappointed that you can basically max everything out if you are really trying, but completionists can have a field day with it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d give this a 9.5 if I could, it just lacks a little graphical wow and polish, but this is an excellent buy and something you can really put your teeth into.  Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2294038">Expand</a></span>

The story is fairly believable, the voice-acting quite well-done (for a video game), and the characters seem fairly deep. The graphical quality of the game is fantastic, and the design is very pleasing to look at (though some more variety in objects would&apos;ve been appreciated). The physics involved in the game are a bit screwy, especially when the game determines whether or not you can pick objects up, but that&apos;s quite forgivable. Combat is what you&apos;d expect with cover-based shooting. The hacking mini-game is surprisingly intense, and the options to explore in the game are rewarding and interesting. There is an issue with Deus Ex being so serious, however, and that&apos;s when they let you do whatever you please. I was getting a bit bored with the quests (throughout the game, I never found the quests interesting - just something I had to do so I could progress to the next area) and decided to massacre the police department. It was fun and intense. It didn&apos;t fit my character at all when he got back to the storyline dialogue, however, which broke immersion.  Overall, I was often wanting more action in the game, and it was difficult to come after breaking the &quot;timeline&quot; of the story by wiping out every collection of gang-members, police, and civilians I could find. I recall wandering around gunning civilians in the Asian environment, and killing a civilian who was apparently important, dropping something that seemed to have no significance. However, upon picking it up, my character decided to phone a security officer at the company the character works for. The conversation went something like &quot;Do you think a pendent with some insignia on it will come in useful.&quot; &quot;Yeah, why?&quot; &quot;Just wondering.&quot; Overall, I enjoyed the game, and I think playing it on the hardest difficulty would have been much more preferable (keeping in mind I&apos;m not particularly good at FPS games) -- at medium difficulty, there just wasn&apos;t any point wasting time with stealth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782586">Expand</a></span>

If you know any Greek you would know that the tone is set in the title; &quot;God of Human Revolution.&quot; This game is the prequel to the first; Deus Ex. The events take place in the near future when biotic upgrades can be given to improve one&apos;s attributes, whether it be physical or mental. The main character Adam Jensen, a so called &quot;cyber-punk&quot;, is the head of security for the largest corporate contributor of the biotic upgrades, also known as &quot;Augmentations.&quot; Adam starts out talking with his ex-girlfriend, Megan, who is the head scientist of the same biotic corporation &quot;Sarif Industries.&quot; They plan to release a new found science that would change the face of medical history permanently. After a quick debrief, Adam is notified that an &quot;accident&quot; occurred on one of the research floors. He quickly responds, only to find some highly armed mercenaries had broken into the building. Equipped with strength enhanced augmentations, the mercenaries throw Adam through a wall and some glass, fatally injuring him. His last moments of life are spent seeing the murder of his ex-girlfriend.<br>Because Adam was the head of security at Sarif Industries, he was considered a valuable asset and was treated with care in a costly effort to bring him back to life. With the treatment successful Adam was spared his life, but is now roughly 80% augmentation, 20% human. Six months of recovery left him asking questions of the attack, but no one knew any details. The only person recovered was Adam, and no one else experienced the mercenary attack.<br>The full game then picks up from there. Now that Adam is mostly made up of augmentations, he is available to upgrade his mechanics. He can only upgrade them slowly over time, however, otherwise what&apos;s left of his real body might reject the radical changes in performance. Some upgrades include an invisibility suit upgrade, and another is a sort of Electromagnetic Parachute which slows falls from large heights, reducing any chance of injury.<br>The game is spent uncovering the reasons of the mercenary attack, because Adam is led to believe it&apos;s purely about augmentation competition, but he feels it goes deeper than that. As the player you are able to make any decisions in conversation to try and get to the bottom of your main quest, as well as many variable side quests which can have impact on the game in future events.<br>The game is also set up to fit 3 different playstyles; Stealth, Force, and Adaptation. The amazing thing about the level design is that there&apos;s obviously one way in, but if you are determined enough you can find up to 4 different routes to your objective. There&apos;s the front door, back door, window, or air ducts to explore, and each option provides different challenges including: hacking, stealth assassinations, diversions, pure unadulterated stealth, or simply guns blazing.<br>In the end, there is a crystal clear ultimate goal which until the final boss fight is as murky as an oil spilled mud puddle. It keeps you going to the end, and once you&apos;re there you have ultimately 4 history altering options to chose from. Ultimately, you are the god of human revolution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex-human-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=1976964">Expand</a></span>
