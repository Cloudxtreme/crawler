                                        <span> This was a bit of a dissapointment. It was short, and the few puzzles were repeats of puzzles in other ND games. When the end came I was surprised for two reasons, 1) I thought I had a lot more to do, and 2) it was horribly abrupt. The graphics were well done and I liked the addition of the Hardy Boys, but overall I was really dissapointed.</span>
