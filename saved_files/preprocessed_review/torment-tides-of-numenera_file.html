<br>Numenera was kickstarted four years ago, in March 2013. It promised to become Planescape: Torment spiritual successor, to be released in December 2014 and managed to achieve a number of stretch goals. It failed to deliver on each and every one of those.
<br>
<br>Let&#x2019;s start from the end. Things that were promised include player stronghold, crafting system, an additional major city of M&#x2019;ra Jolios Oasis, alternate exit from the Labyrinth to another part of the world&#x2026; None of those are in the game.
<br>
<br>Then we have the release date, postponed over two years. One would assume that because of that game is a&#xA0;pinnacle of polish, runs smoothly and is bug-free. Nope. On a&#xA0;modern machine, having no problems running, for example, Rainbow Six: Siege at max details with optional hi-res textures from the DLC enabled in 80+ fps, Numenera&#x2019;s framerate is somewhere between 30&#xA0;and&#xA0;50. There are multiple bugs, though thankfully nothing severe&#x2014;some formatting codes in the text, sometimes you can&#x2019;t turn off a&#xA0;pop-up and you&#x2019;ll experience plenty of inventory problems, including multiplicating gear, selling things that cost you money (sic!), drag&#x2019;n&#x2019;drop not working&#x2026; The game is fully playable, yes, but it makes you wonder what exactly programmers did with those extra two years, especially when they used preexisting game engine used in&#xA0;Pillars of&#xA0;Eternity, which didn&#x2019;t have any of those problems&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Finally, we should compare Numenera to the original Planescape. The predecessor was narrative-heavy game with seven fully-fledged followers with interesting stories; complicated, unique and weird world that was a&#xA0;joy to explore and interesting, philosophical overarching plot. Most of those things are still here&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a&#xA0;ton of beautifully written text, long dialogs full of interesting stories, the world has a&#xA0;rich lore that you can explore&#xA0;etc. However, one of the things that made Planescape so good and memorable were the followers. Here, you have six, but they are not nearly as interesting as Planescape&#x2019;s ones. They have very little to say, which you can explore *with a&#xA0;single dialogue* plus occasional one-liner dropped here and there. Their quests are a&#xA0;joke&#x2014;they can be as simple and short as one single dialogue, reveal next to no information about them and be a&#xA0;chore (Callistege&#x2019;s and Rhin&#x2019;s especially; I&#xA0;don&#x2019;t want to go into the spoiler territory, but when one character returns to you with something that could be an epic tale, they just give you one sentence that amounts to &#x201C;too much to tell, so I&#xA0;won&#x2019;t tell anything&#x201D;).
<br>
<br>The first one third of the game (part which you could see and explore in the beta) is great, full of life, interesting quests etc. For this part only, I&#x2019;d give at least 8/10. Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s the best that game has to offer and it&#x2019;s all downhill from there. Locations are rushed, NPC have next to nothing to say, quest quickly devour into &#x201C;fetch me this thing from two locations from here, that&#x2019;s not even heavily guarded&#x201D;. And then there is the ending, which boils down to &#x201C;here is the list of all possible outcomes, choose the one you like the most, done&#x201D;. Nothing you did before that matters but for a&#xA0;quick recap in the epilogue.
<br>
<br>The game at this point is not worth its price. It&#x2019;s not that long (it took me 20&#xA0;hours to beat with *all* sidequests, but I&#xA0;read quickly and that is the most limiting factor; conversely, original Planescape was almost twice as long), quite bugged and not that fun overall. If you like reading in your games, you&#x2019;ll like it, it is really well written. It just doesn&#x2019;t feel too much like a&#xA0;game and I&#xA0;feel really sold short on the promises the developer made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6997167">Expand</a></span>

But the whole &quot;spiritual successor&quot; thing was a scam. inXile made some very specific promises when they put the project on Kickstarter and most of those promises ended up on the cutting floor. Not only they kept the backers in the dark about their plans to make the game turn-based (PS:T, like all Infinity Engine games, was real-time with pause), they misled everybody with the stretch goals they evidently never even intended to implement.
<br>
<br>If you don&apos;t mind heavily consolized UI, forgettable music, so-so backgrounds, hideous character portraits, irritating voiceover and whole pages of redundant text, T:ToN is OK. It&apos;s perfectly playable.

<br>Minimalistic combat. Thats probably an understatement. Combat is not a relevant/positive gameplay element.
<br>Numerous tedious MMO like quests: go to A - go to B - go to A with minimal story to them.
<br>The writing is average at best in english (more details below), the german translation is atrocious! Someone literally copy pasted the original text to google translator and just went with it.
<br>Many minor annoyances like quest relevant information is often times not put into your journal AND even though the game gives the option to have characters repeat ever IRRELEVANT DETAIL about them, There is most of the time NO OPTION to have them repeat questrelevant Information. This is an issue that is so prevalent that i believe it was a design decision.
<br>
<br>Let me go into detail about the writing.
<br>First of all im not a native speaker but i have played both Pillars and Tyranny (and many older CRPGs) and ALWAYS found the writing enjoyable and relateable.
<br>
<br>In this game however there seems to have been a competition between the writers about who can come up with the most complex garbage.
<br>Youn cant read a single line of text without a metaphor, the words used are often times ridiculously uncommon, the punctuation is as annoying as it possibly can be hindering the flow of reading, there is a TON! of useless information in each conversation and in top of they added dialect for some characters which is represented by misspelling words (which is, as any half decent writer will tell you, the worst possible way to include dialect).
<br>
<br>In addition to that 90% of the characters in this game are special snowflakes but not a single one of them is ever fleshed out. So between the escaped pleasure Robot who has apparently met you in a previous consciousness and who gives you riddles (All of which is dealt with in only 5 boxes of dialoge). And the guy with the 3 faces who are apparently arguing but who is kind of fine but also not fine with being like that at the same time and who gives you a quest that you can finish in 1 Minute by literally just walking 7 meters and clicking a thing (all of which is dealt with in about 10 textboxes)

<br>I really stopped caring about all these &quot;unique&quot; characters. Every single one of them could be the protagonist in its own game but since not a single one of the characters is fleshed out or has anything interesting/plot relevant to say (they mostly just gibber idiosyncratic nonsense/super mega hyper science/mysticism)
<br>
<br>Its just bleh. The game actually managed to make me stop wanting to talk to NPCs because i knew their first line was going to be HOHOHO weve met before, also i can read your thoughts, also i am actually a robotghostninja.
<br>
<br>In addition to that the actual main story is incredibly short. If you skip all the pointless and annoying side NPCs you can finish the first major HUB Area in LESS THAN AN HOUR!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6997178">Expand</a></span>

<br>-   Extremely poor audio-visual presentation, even by indie game standards. For a 4.5 million dollar Kickstarter, this is a disgrace.
<br>-    In spite of its rich world and lore, it utterly fails to create an emotional connection with the player or make us care about anything going on in the Last Castoff&apos;s story.
<br>-    RPG mechanisms, character development, inventory acquisition and management are at amateur levels.
<br>-    Meres and their sad, sad implementation. It would have been preferable to save some face and not include them at all.
<br>-    The bitter aftertaste in players&apos; mouths, that this was merely a tech demo for selling the Numenera world to prospective publishers for future projects. There is no game here.
<br>-    The silently cut stretch goals of the Kickstarter campaign. In light of the project&apos;s extremely poor quality, the argument of &quot;We wanted to focus on polish&quot; seems even weaker. High tier backers should be furious.

That they managed to actually do it is a testament to their love of the original game, isometric RPG&#x2019;s and their undeniable talent. Torment: Tides of Numenera features writing that rivals the very best the genre has to offer and it has the kind of satisfying ending other games can only dream of. It provides a lengthy campaign with little filler, engaging characters, replayability and is nearly bug free. It could have used some more combat and hopefully the cut stretch goals appear in some form via DLC or expansions. I really enjoyed my time with the game and it deserves to stand tall among the new crop of top notch isometric RPG&#x2019;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6989300">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I read, and if I wanted to read a book, I&apos;d do just that. I&apos;m playing a game because I want more than just text. So far this feels rather disappointing, but I&apos;ll update if I can make myself play again and it improves.
<br>
<br>Edit: Played more, lowered score from 6 to 5.
<br>
<br>I really don&apos;t understand the need to create a completely new vocabulary for everything. &quot;Crisis&quot; for &quot;battle,&quot; &quot;esotery&quot; for &quot;spell,&quot; &quot;glaive&quot; for &quot;warrior,&quot; etc. A few here and there would be fine, but it&apos;s like I&apos;m being forced to learn a new language, and I&apos;ve constantly got to translate what they&apos;re talking about into terms I know.
<br>
<br>Along those lines, the game absolutely BOMBARDS you with technical mechanical details at character creation without doing much to explain any of it. I just know I&apos;m going to have to restart after playing a few more hours and regretting my initial choices, which is disappointing.
<br>
<br>Edited again: Lowered from 5 to 4.
<br>
<br>The music is terrible, and the characters are ugly.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t help but wonder where all the money went if this game was so well-funded. I didn&apos;t back this game, but I still feel betrayed by inXile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6993268">Expand</a></span>

This is what the game screams at you as you play it. First thing you will notice is that there are no cutscenes whatseoever, and the only thing coming anywhere near the notion of &quot;cutscene&quot; is the narrating voice that appears here and there. Another thing is that, unlike Planescape: Torment that had an assortment of cookie and bizarre companions, in ToN there are only boring humans, there aren&apos;t even any Minsc and Boo nor some pompous Anomen, just boring, forgettable humans voice acted by the same crappy British voiceactors that you can hear in each and every low budget title. Obviously, making more playable models and with interesting personalities and proffesional voiceactors would have cost...you know...MONEY, and InXile just didn&apos;t have the funds for such fluff content.
<br>
<br>But let&apos;s say you get over all of the above. Another problem with this game is the...BOREDOM! Honestly, 99% of this game involves walking and talking to various NPC. Combat is almost entirely optional, there are no trash mobs to speak of and no elaborate dungeons. I think there is one small dungeon, though. Obviously, I didn&apos;t expect Diablo nor would I want a Diablo, but this game is nowhere near Baldur&apos;s Gate nor even the old Planescape: Torment in terms of combat content. In fact this game is more Adventure than RPG, and is more related to Monkey Island than to Planescape: Torment. It&apos;s quite ironic considering how many weapons and armor vendors are in the game, who turn out to sell stuff you barely ever use if at all, as you can easily talk your way out of each and every potential combat situation, and the only unavoidable combat is against the final boss.
<br>
<br>Unrelatable game universe. I dunno, this is an issue for me. The game&apos;s universe is so...BIZARRE! I&apos;m always irritated when game developers make up strange names for regular things or make up entirely new and almost unpronouceble names (right, Obsidian?!). In ToN, get this, a warrior is not a warrior, it&apos;s a...&quot;glaive&quot;, a mage is not a mage, but a...&quot;nano&quot;. Seriously|!? Your universe is strange enough, did you really have to make up weird names for regular things?! Also the game has a ton more things that barely make any sense. If you thought the universe of Planescape: Torment was strange at times, you ain&apos;t seen nothing yet.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even know why do people say the game is related to Planescape: Torment. It has absolutely no connection with that game other than the interface. It&apos;s not the same universe, it&apos;s not the same story, there isn&apos;t even any mention of characters from Planescape: Torment, everything is entirely new, and the only reason they say it&apos;s the spiritual successor of Planescape, is to sell the game.
<br>

It&apos;s pretty in more ways than just the visual; it challenged me to question the motivations behind my decision-making paradigms and behind my moral reasoning. I especially appreciate the way that it enhanced my perspective on loss. I see loss as being much more personal now; in particular, I am more apt to think of loss in the broader context of the experience of the individual who has taken the loss. My ideas about what makes things worth it and what makes things meaningful have similarly shifted because of this game, and I have stronger, less heavy-handed, and ironically simpler convictions now. I think that taking the game seriously will do that. Tl;dr: The game mostly succeeds in giving players the opportunity to enrich and sharpen their perspectives on Torment&apos;s themes.
<br>
<br>Those were the best things I have to say about T:ToN. What follows is basically a set of caveats to modify the impression that the above things might leave.
<br>
<br>The story&apos;s overall arc is better than most good games I&apos;ve played but is still slightly disappointing; there isn&apos;t enough buildup and the climax is weak. That might be partly because the game is so short. I wanted to see more of the Ninth World - three to five times more, minimally. The experience wasn&apos;t satisfying enough because of the length.
<br>
<br>There were a lot of themes that could have been developed much more thoroughly. There were pieces of the lore that alluded to high technological mysteries that were never fully explored, so the game never felt epic in the way that it promised to feel. It also lacked cohesion; the different things that the player occupied themselves by doing were somewhat unrelated to the player&apos;s main pursuit. The pacing in the endgame didn&apos;t make much sense, but it was fine elsewhere.
<br>
<br>If the game had been longer; maintained roughly the same quality of the content that I saw; and used the greater length to develop the story more and give the player opportunities to do greater things and shape their place in the Ninth World, the game would have easily been an 8.5/10.
<br>
<br>The graphics are pretty but limited by the 2D isometric style. The combat is a chore, although it is better than Planescape&apos;s, thankfully, and it (the combat) is functional. I should mention that I ran this on a bleeding-edge consumer rig with a gtx 1080, 32gb of 3000 mhz ram, and a 4.0 ghz 6700k intel processor. Others have reported technical issues.
<br>
<br>I was fairly entertained all the way through, but I often found myself wondering why I was doing what I was doing in the game. A lot of things felt like distractions that I, personally, would have blown through if I were the last castoff. In that sense the game felt slightly too long - padded - for what it did, as it delayed giving you certain answers. I feel that it should have been more ambitious - in other words, that it should have had a denser and longer story. I actually said &quot;lame&quot; out loud when I realized the game was over. I was disappointed that it was over, which is good, but I did not feel satisfied, which is bad. If the game were a paper, it would have been half the length that it should have been and had a rushed concluding paragraph. Before you realize that the paper doesn&apos;t really finish, you will probably enjoy it and think it&apos;s fairly good.
<br>
<br>Alright, that&apos;s basically it. 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7159166">Expand</a></span>

<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Let me say: I&apos;m a big fan of these sort of games but this one just left me unsatisfied and disappointed.
<br>
<br>1. This game is mostly about READING walls of text - even if you try to skip reading, you can&apos;t - and there&apos;s just too much TEXT - it slows the game down to a halt and most of is not even interesting or crucial even though the writing is good
<br>
<br>2. COMBAT is really shallow or should I say inconsequential - and there&apos;s very little of it
<br>
<br>3. GRAPHICS are outdated, art style is good though. Character models look like crap
<br>
<br>4. You call this a climatic ending?
<br>
<br>5. There is enough content here to warrant a WAIT FOR DEEP SALE approach but you really, really need to LOVE reading

The game is far from bad, it&apos;s fun, there are many options and huge story, so don&apos;t think this is a bad review, it&apos;s just that if you want Planescape Torment 2, this is not it.</span>

<br>You will read a lot of text, as the most advanced cutscene animation is *character walking*. You will need aother soundtrack, because the game has one that is below random flash game quality. You will wonder how a game like that can have loading screens everywhere after Skyrim, Like really, every small room.
<br>You will be thankful that you can avoid combat, as its so pointlessly boring.
<br>I can bash and bash it forever - but it has some fair writing, a bunch of nice ideas and a very promising first quest hub with a few story pieces worth reading.

I dont mind a good read, but when I sit to a computer to play a game I just expect it to be a game not an interactive book. Especially that the quality of the writting is not that good. The authors fail do deliver an interesting story. You get a lot of boring graphography, which in my case resulted in skipping most of the text. The whole experience was boring, tiring and frustrating. This game is nowhere near the original Torment. I really regret to see another kickstarted funded ripoff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7435822">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a huge CRPG fan and original Torment is still to this day one of my favourite games of all time, so I was hyped for this. I loved all the new projects that resurrected the genre including Pillars Of Eternity, Wasteland 2, Shadowruns, Tyranny... But this one is where I&apos;m the most conflicted.
<br>
<br>First, the good. Story, writing, dialogs, all of it is superb. It&apos;s probably the best story of all the previously mentioned titles and in this field it really holds the candle to the original Torment. Another amazing aspect is the uniqueness of the world and the weird factor of everything. Not really a fantasy, not really a sci-fi, something weird in between. Creating a really special experience and atmosphere. Unlike most others, I liked the visuals, the backgrounds of the world and Mark Morgan did a decent job with the music, recreating that special Torment feeling a bit with reverbed pianos adding some new fresh flavours. I love the game for all of this and it was a great adventure.
<br>
<br>But then, there is the bad. Combat is absolutely terrible. Whoever thought that making this full turn-based is a good idea was just wrong. It made certain amount of sense in Wasteland2 or Shadowrun, with the cover system, snipers, grenades and it all felt like an X-Com light, all good. But here it&apos;s just annoying, it slows the game to no end, there is no way to outplay your opponent by skill, by the actual gameplay, it&apos;s all about stats and most importantly it&apos;s not FUN at all. And the final nail in the coffin - the bugs. Combat is completely and utterly glitched, Enemy characters stops doing anything, unable to progress the game, some battles overheat the GPU and a few solid freezes to top it off. I had to restart final battle like 10 times to progress further, without the option to save doing everything again, forced to suffer these horrendous combat mechanics. Ugh, price of being naive/hyped and buying the game on release I guess. Fortunately most fights can be avoided and solved via dialogs, so in the end I had like 6 fights in the entire game, which might be another massive let-down for some.
<br>
<br>Also, one of the most important parts of any RPG - character progression, is a complete fail. While I liked the fact that it tried to do something different with stat edges, efforts and so on. Everything else just falls flat. No good new weapons, spells are very few and mostly useless and cyphers ended up being just a junk that you collect and overload your characters with.
<br>
<br>Speaking of characters, that&apos;s another disappointment, most characters here are totally bland and forgettable and unfortunately I didn&apos;t really found any sympathies to my companions either, which is really bad especially if you compare them to the original Torment which had one better companion than the other. Thinking about it. You don&apos;t even really have much choice here, I just played the game with the same 4 guys I found in the first city and never met anyone else that would be interested or interesting for that matter. Zero to little voiceover doesn&apos;t help either. These games always had only the important parts voiced, but here it goes to the extremes of lackluster, I just wonder where all the budget went.
<br>
<br>Considering relatively short length. It took me around 40 hours to finish it, doing everthing, which is not bad, but feeling-wise, especially in the second half it felt a little rushed and unfinished. In The Bloom where I thought I&apos;m somewhere in the middle it was basically the end.
<br>
<br>That said, despite so many bad aspects, I still love the game for it&apos;s story and the feelings it gave me. Story is fantastic and reading is what you will be doing here 90% of the time. It almost feels like this is more of a gamebook (especially the merecaster parts), and interactive reading experience, not a full RPG package. Considering what it promised to be and considering presenting itself as the most funded kickstarter RPG, it ultimately might feel like a disappointment for many. Disappointment that I actually loved playing through with absolutely fantastic story in a unique world, but still a disappointment. 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7038348">Expand</a></span>

Alas, I was (maybe unsurprisingly) disappointed.

<br>The theme is familiar enough - immortality and lost memories/identity, but the story of the Las Castoff (and all the other castoffs) feels like ill-fitting clothes - crude and poorly made, thrown on you for want of anything better. The companions are a characterless bunch who you never know or care much about (and who don&apos;t have much to know about anyway, their backstory being so threadbare). These are the biggest let-down of TTON because from the people who created PS:T you&apos;d really expect nothing less than great story, great characterization and great dialogs. Instead we have a lot of writing that tries too hard to be &quot;deep,&quot; and very little about the characters, events, surroundings, etc. to actually explore by ourselves.

<br>At 30+ hours for my first playthrough (which is likely to also be my last, since the game has little replay value), I guess I can&apos;t really say the game&apos;s too short, but it did come as a big surprise when I realized the &quot;final showdown&quot; was imminent - like, What? This is it? This is what we have waited years for, and what the inXile SNS feeds never tire of telling us is loved and raved about by the media?
<br>
<br>As an early backer, I paid $28 for the game, which is about 60% of its current price, and which, incidentally, is what I feel the game is like - about 60% of what it could and should have been. And which is why I&apos;m giving it a 6 out of 10.

<br>+ Bloom was visually awesome
<br>
<br>- Combat is buggy and just plain horrible. Did a &quot;might&quot; melee character and in the end still couldn&apos;t fight off mobs of more than 5. This is mainly because turn-based mechanics
<br>- Horrific player models
<br>- Boring companions
<br>- Buggy
<br>- Weird camera movement
<br>- End was lazy
<br>- Feels unfinished
<br>- Wasted potential everywhere. Just look at those &quot;boss fights&quot;
<br>- Took ~12h to finish with min-maxing. Just steamrolled that effort-based system in the end; roll, sleep, roll, sleep etc.
<br>- Character customization is quite restricted
<br>- You can never really use your abilities in a combat</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7052554">Expand</a></span>

<br>No, it&apos;s absolutely not. Even disregarding all concerns above, this game is my horrible RPG disappointment just because of the botched story and writing. Before I tear those aspects to shreds, just let me tell you I am a great fan of Planescape: Torment and text-heavy RPGs.
<br>
<br>1) If T:ToM is what devs nowadays understand as &quot;deep, high quality writing&quot; then I&apos;d prefer to play hack n slash, because surviving the writing style of this game was... torment.
<br>Planescape: Torment had a lot of wonderfully written, moving, wise, meaningful text. Torment: Tides of Numenera looked at this and the only thing it understood is &quot;a lot of ANY text is good&quot;. The final result: the game is filled to the brim with verbose, overdescriptive, exhausting, pretentious, redundant, meaningless, writing. TTOM is proud of describing the most trivial **** in the most bloated, pseudo-intellectual way possible, and breaking rules of &quot;show, don&apos;t tell&quot; in every way. And trust me - I read a lot of books, so I&apos;m not averse to a lot of reading - I simply hate meaningless writing which confuses quantity with quality.
<br>Maybe I would be less angry on writing in TTOM if next to this nonsense it actually bothered to be emotional in some aspects. But it has completely failed to move my heart and soul. In this game you will get 100 000 words describing how characters look, yet very very few words which even attempt to make you feel what those characters feel. You actually get more lines of text describing environment and looks of some side characters than dialogue interactions with any of your companions. Creators of this mess were so obsessed with impressing you with Numenera setting that they forgot to forge any kind of emotional connection between virtual characters and a player.
<br>2) Story.
<br>Another catastrophic failure, on a level completely separate from the horrible writing style.
<br>Planescape: Torment had story which was simultaneously personal, moving, emotional, philosophical and coherent.
<br>In this game, you spend 90% of it to &quot;find x to get information on artifact y&quot;, waiting for hours for your questions to be answered - for some kind of reveal - only for this reveal to be super disappointing. Within first 15 minutes of the game, you ask yourselves a lot of plot questions (&quot;What is Sorrow&quot; etc) - none of them are really answered in a ridiculously rushed, chaotic mess of an ending. Main story of TTOM is hilariously desperate to be &quot;philosophical&quot; but it doesn&apos;t have anything genuine to say, so it indulges into pseudo-intellectual babble about Tides; it uses a lot of angsty metaphors, but when you look at them really closely you see there is nothing meaningful behind them.
<br>This is a game with no real main character, no real villain, no real intrigue, no closure, nothing except purple prose and pretentious ambitions.
<br>3) Nonlinearity, morality and endings
<br>My character was follower of compassionate, Golden Tide, so he got two extra lines of description on one of the static, ugly ending slides. That&apos;s it, folks; that&apos;s the impact your character has on the world of Numenera.
<br>4) Characters
<br>It&apos;s hard to say anything about characters of this game, because creators were far more interested in indulging in pseudo-profound metaphysical ******* rather than actually forging relationships between characters, or creating any relatable characters at all. The only exception from this rule is Rhin - the only being in this game who I cared about. The fun fact is, it was not written by devs but by the guest writer. What is even more hilarious, is that this character uses perhaps the simplest dictionary of all beings encountered across the game world, without thousands of  half-baked pseudo-philosophical garbage, yet it works better than all of remaining ones combined - because you care about this little girl.
<br>
<br>Other than things above, the game has terribly designed gameplay (combat, technical aspects, balance, pacing), has basically no soundtrack (absolutely nothing memorable - just bland ambient) and numerous other failures, I just wanted to focus on the story aspects.
<br>I give it 3 because of Rhin, few good ideas and visuals and few cool side quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7227517">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1) Saugus, typical cRpG town, not as good as Atkathla (from BG2) but ok.
<br>
<br>2) The valley of dead heroes: total rip off, small courtyard very boring then teleportation to areas that all looks the same. Total let down. Did enjoy the design of Miel Avest and the quote from my mad brother
<br>
<br>I asked *Can we destroy the things that dwell here* and he replies *better two ants declare war on the seasons* that was **** top notch.
<br>
<br>3) The bloom: Phenomenal idea, we&apos;re inside some sort of trans-dimensional, mega huge monster that&apos;s entirely made of flesh and teeth and tendons, it&apos;s a total blast to explore it, decide what you want your relationship the map to be basically. I&apos;ve never EVER seen a map come alive like that. Literally :) That&apos; probably the BEST thing about this game. Honestly you even forget about the rest of the story. I mean **** the sorrow give me a game about this trans-dimensional monster with entire societies living inside of it. Goes from medieval villages inside of a stomach to mutant hideouts into space ships. TOTAL BLAST. This game is worth it for the bloom alone. It&apos;s over too quickly is all I can say.
<br>
<br>4) Mental map, Labyrinth. I&apos;m gonna be honest, HATED IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7193251">Expand</a></span>

<br>And they were incredibly poorly planned and managed. We saw some of these issues with Pillars but it&apos;s even worse with Torment.
<br>
<br>Much of the base game that was planned was cut. Entire stretch goals that we earned were cut. These cuts, while not only making the game significantly more shallow with significantly less replayability, are the antithesis of this RPG system. Go on, count how many companions shipped at launch, the laughable amount of focuses, literally no factions as we were promises, no crafting system.
<br>
<br>Kickstarter is allowing developers to deliver whatever they want. And that is something I&apos;m never going to support again. If there would be a platform that binds the developers with a contract to fulfilll their promises and design targets, I would reconsider it but Tides, along with so many incredibly successful kickstarted games simply aren&apos;t delivering what they&apos;re promsing. What we paid for.
<br>
<br>InExile has had zero transparency about the entire thing, and will only acknowledge it after the fans make it into a scandal. Zero accountability. I am sorry I backed Bards Tale 2 and now I understand why they kickstarted the next Wasteland before this launched and blew up in their faces. Who knows how many dollars from this sinking ship they put into those more marketable games?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7065940">Expand</a></span>

EXCEPT IT&apos;S NOT. it&apos;s too much. you talk to a guy, you need to read a novel. You make 2 steps, talk to another guy: another nove. too much. too boring. And they&apos;re all SUPER SPECIAL!
<br>and there are almost no animations for things that happen in the game. say, for example, the game writes &quot;the characters makes a polite bow when you approach him&quot;... BUT IT&apos;S ONLY WRITTEN, NOT SHOWN. that character doesn&apos;t actually bow, it&apos;s only in the description. all the game is like that. it&apos;s a damn text adventure with backgrounds.
<br>&quot;tell don&apos;t show&quot;
<br>or when the game tells you that a character is &quot;incredibly fat&quot; but its sprite is just slightly larger than the others.
<br>there also are NO portraits of the characters that you&apos;re talking to. not even the most important ones.
<br>the game want to feel special at all times. the skill system is weird and overly complicated. cyphers are a stupid idea. all the vocabulary of the game just DOESN&apos;T WANT SO BADLY to be like the rest, and you have different terms for things you already know. also the way you solve stuff by investing point... yeah, go on, keep trying to be original AT ALL COST: you&apos;re also being NOT FUN.
<br>combat is super boring and buggy.
<br>you can lose a VERY important skill and a companion in the city if you actually HELP HER by giving her money. and there is no warning for this, and no second tries. It&apos;s infuriating.
<br>this is a complete slander of the name &quot;torment&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7068682">Expand</a></span>

By that I mean the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; choices should have been made a little more apparent through either the graphics or text before hand.
<br>
<br>Another detractor is no portrait of NPC speakers! Just a blank space where one should be. With a zoomed out isometric game, you can&apos;t really see them on screen so need a portrait (or at least I do) to make a connection. Otherwise everyone is virtually the same. This is something you might expect to see in Beta but not in the finished project. I would deduct one whole point for lack if this element.
<br>
<br>Combat is pretty basic and follows the rules of most turn based RPG combat. You get to move and attack in a turn. There are some really interesting abilities that liven up the combat especially with Cyphers. Lots of area and cone type effects. The way you can interact with the environment in combat also spices it up. Flanking exists and adds another strategic element. Animations and sound effects are fairly good. Characters will often do a voice plug relevant to the situation (for instance if flanked and they move will say &quot;let me get out of here&quot;). I was pretty happy with combat overall, others might not be but I liked it.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t beat the game yet so interested to see how many hours it will take. For a game in production so long I think 50 should be expected. I would recommend this to old school hardcore RPG players only. If you look at today&apos;s mainstream RPGs like Dragon Age, I don&apos;t think most of them will go for it even if they play tabletop Numenera.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7011706">Expand</a></span>

<br>It feels cheap, despite being a $5 million property that was entirely under the dev team&apos;s control.
<br>
<br>Combat feels awful, and every attempt was made to ignore and bypass it as a game feature. As an actual approach to game design, this **** sucks. If you decide a particular aspect is a drag, remove it, don&apos;t embrace its drag-potential by just refusing to address it as anything any player would actually want to do. The team seemingly had the same idea about character graphics.
<br>
<br>The backgrounds are pretty. Gotta give them that.
<br>
<br>The game doesn&apos;t succeed or build upon PS:T. It mimics it. Badly. It sticks like glue to the idea of wordiness, as though that was genuinely one of the strongest features of the original. This is why the word &quot;pretentious&quot; exists. Everything feels like the Architect scene in the second Matrix.
<br>I get it, vocabulary. Cool.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re willing to simultaneously forgive all of the errors in oversight, which arguably should&apos;ve been fixed by giving the team 5 years to make this game, all the errors in lack of game immersion, which should&apos;ve been fixed because the team consists primarily of veterans who ostensibly knew they were designing a GAME, if you&apos;re willing to be cool with a team that raked in kickstarter funds by promising strech goals that were removed without initially even letting backers know (and surprisingly didn&apos;t offer any refunds for), if you&apos;re willing to forgive empty attempts at &quot;depth&quot; through short-bus existentialist exposition, then...
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know, read more? Still skip this game.

I get that was partially in PS:T as well, but they really went overboard with it. The full game is 30 hours and I read everything and did almost all side-quest. The replay-ability is virtually non-existent as your choices are not really interesting. Picking your gender does literally nothing significant. There is literally no point to fight in the game almost everything can be solved without it. Yes I like when there is an option to skip fights especially when it is RP wise makes more sense, but here there is literally no point to do so. The characters are completely bland are overall a let down. The game went for an isometric view and despite that the graphics are still sub-par. It is painful to say, but Pillars of Eternity that came out way before this is a superior game to this (and I didn&apos;t like that much either, but at least it had an atmosphere). Normally I would give this like 3 points, but knowing the background of everything I consider this an atrocity against gamers and fans to the original so it well deserves a 0.

<br>
<br>I should point out that I am one of the original backers from 4 years ago and loved the Original Planescape Torment - having played it a dozen times at least.  The original Torment was reviewed by the New York Time which felt that it should be elevated to the status of literature due to the depth, beauty and originality of the writing - and I completely agree - the writing was that good.
<br>
<br>http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/27/technology/game-theory-a-universe-where-ideas-can-trump-actions.html
<br>
<br>Not so much the sequel, Planescape Torment: ToN.  I am not sure where to begin with all the problems this game has.
<br>
<br>1) Poor NPC introduction and character development.  During this game I really reached a point of not really caring at all about my fellow companions.  Mainly because there wasn&apos;t really anything compelling to care about.  If you look at the original game, each companion is introduced to you from a space that matches who they are.  Morte you meet in the beginning after you awaken in the Dusties mortuary.  Fall-from-Grace in the Brothel Of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, Anna-From the Shadows you meet in the Beggar Kings domain surrounded by shadows and thieves, Nordrom is found in a tainted Modron construct and so on...  They are all incredible well-voiced and have distinct opinions and personalities as well as extensive backstories that you have to dig out.  They also are linked to you through a unified theme - that of being broken and/or creatures that defy their own nature.  In ToN I felt the companions were just kind of there - not much to the backstory nor are they all that important.
<br>
<br>2) Way too much flavor without substance.  There was just an exhaustive amount of shallow flavor interactions with this game that didn&apos;t have a whole lot to do with the main story.  Although this feels like more a result of the universe - the Numenera - which is everywhere.  The whole point of the Numenera is you never find out who made any of it or what its original purpose is/was - which can be fun in small doses but this game is lousy with that sort of thing.  It just becomes one exhausting and unfulfilling interaction after another - wondering if this strange thing is important (usually not).
<br>
<br>3) Show don&apos;t tell - this has been said many times and it is spot on.  This just doesn&apos;t feel like an RPG - more of a story we are being told and we have to click the screen a bunch to get to the next part.   I lost count of the number of times the writing devolved into telling us what we should be experiencing and what we should know instead of showing us what is there to see and letting us figure it out.  The original Planecape has been called literature - and I agree - it definitely hits that bar.  ToN is barely storytelling - and at the juvenile level at best.
<br>
<br>4) The combat is terrible, boring and confusing.  It actually ends up being a blessing that combat is so rare in this game (although it shouldn&apos;t be if the game was well made), because it is really unsatisfying.  Thankfully mostly you can skip it.
<br>
<br>So basically there is a lot more but it comes down to this -it&apos;s pretty clear that the real genius behind the original Planescape Torment was Chris Avellone - who was not present on this project.  Thankfully Chris is working on Divinity Original Sin 2 - so I have that to look forward to but I am done with Brian Fargo and InExile Entertainment.  Wasteland 2 was just as weak and tedious story-wise as this title and its clear they don&apos;t have the writing chops to offer anything worthy of the titles and legacies they are pilfering just to make an extra buck.
<br>
<br>Skip this game and everything else form InExile - they are talentless hacks - all of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7051781">Expand</a></span>

<br>Kickstarter games are weird to review as they often sold before they produced and you can either grade the game removed from any promises they made or in a historical context.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7036617">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My biggest praise goes to conversations - ones made with lots of text - but in contrast to its predecestors (Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny) where you could just skip to conclusion, here these walls of text really make an interesting read and create immersion.
<br>
<br>Combat is dull and boring (despite I love turn based combat), but game gives you lots of options to simply avoid it. But be warned - if you prefer hack and slash with bit of story pasted on like PoE, this may not be your cup of tea.
<br>
<br>World is great - in my opinion much more interesting than it was in Planescape. A lot of scenes are described in text and are not shown to the player - but it forces to use your imagination and allows to create scenes otherwise impossible. But of course it can be flaw for someone.
<br>
<br>One minor complaint would be that character graphics are definately worse than PoE, Tyranny and inXile previous game Wasteland 2. With beautifully crafted backgrounds, models can really stand out. But it is really minor flaw of this otherwise wonderful game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7020799">Expand</a></span>

And that&apos;s why this game is so good, because it focuses on what matters: realistic characters that spark your imagination and amaze you at every turn, and the interaction you can have with them, along with all the accompanying choices and consequences. The fact that it dedicates itself so well to that particular aspect makes me thing this might be one of the most groundbreaking RPGs of all time.
<br>
<br>Fair warning, this is not Planescape 2, it&apos;s not done by the same people, it doesn&apos;t use the same setting or the same rule-set (thank the gods!) and it doesn&apos;t play the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7104718">Expand</a></span>

Planescape, Baldur&apos;s Gate, Icewind Dale, KotOR to name a few.
<br>
<br>I loved Planescape. I even liked the combat. Nice hack and slash, spells and effects. Not the best by any means but, hey, the game was very enjoyable. The writing was astonishing, still not surpassed by anyone. And there was so, so much of it. It never felt heavy though because every sentence had context and a reason to be there.
<br>
<br>This game is an abomination. I lasted 3 hours, desperate not to fail in giving this game a chance. I am their target audience, this game was supposedly made with me and other like minded people in mind.
<br>
<br>I hope this travesty was made with honest intentions cause the execution is so poor it actually made me sad. The premise is interesting but that&apos;s the only positive I can find.
<br>-Story/writing: Oh boy, this game challenges you not to break your screen. Text upon text upon text. Boring infodumps everywhere that just can&apos;t stop. The player needs to be given a reason to care, to get emotionally invested in the story. This is neither a game, nor a book. It&apos;s the worst of both worlds.
<br>-Audio/visual: Great graphics are not needed for a game. Nor sound. Artistic direction is what&apos;s needed. There is none here. The game looks horrible. PoE didn&apos;t look that great either but the colors they used weren&apos;t such an eyesore.
<br>-Gameplay: Nonexistent. This isn&apos;t a game by any means. Maybe after 5 hours there is some gameplay where I can actually do stuff that&apos;s cool, who knows.
<br>
<br>Save yourself your hard earned money. Old school RPGs are never coming back and maybe that&apos;s a good thing. Cause when they do try to come back, they remind you how great the sex was, but now you are just a dude in your 60s who can&apos;t get a hard on. Let&apos;s just keep those memories and move on with the times. Find yourself a blowup doll and play the witcher or something.

<br>The CON list is endless, but I&apos;ll try to sum it up:
<br>
<br>- Character development is bad, really, really, really bad: no matter what skills you choose, you can click easily through all dialogues.
<br>- Dialogues are often (but not always) boring: every character wants to tell you his own life story and I&apos;m sorry, but it&apos;s often not exciting.
<br>- Combat is so tedious that you don&apos;t want to engage in any fights.
<br>- Decisions don&apos;t matter. No matter how you play, then ending is the same.
<br>- The areas between the main locations are terribly designed
<br>- Most companions are boring
<br>
<br>I could continue with this list: The game is filled with game mechanics that don&apos;t make any sense (e.g. the option to choose more cipher spots that you will never use).

<br>The developers made the highest promises and delivered a really bad game. If you add the fact that the game was well funded and took four years to develop and if you think about how quickly RPGs used to be made in the 90s, one can only scratch one&apos;s head.
<br>
<br>InXile has failed on all levels.
<br>
<br>I played through Numenera quickly and then started another Planescape Torment play-through - and it is so much, much, much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7084385">Expand</a></span>

La sfida pi&#xF9; grande &#xE8; stata quella di essere il seguito spirituale di quel capolavoro senza tempo che era e che &#xE8; ancora Planescape Torment.
<br>
<br>Nel contesto di oggi, il possibile insuccesso di un GdR come questo pu&#xF2; dipendere da recensioni superficiali e poco approfondite e da una comunit&#xE0; non avvezza a leggere una mole di testo molto elevata. Se ad un mese dalla pubblicazione &#xE8; stata esclusa la localizzazione italiana, possiamo comprendere in parte la rabbia dei giocatori nostrani, anche se non sempre &#xE8; giustificata.
<br>
<br>Dietro ad un mole immensa di parole troviamo un GdR molto solido con una un&apos;intercapedine mostruosa di scelte e conseguenze che pochi titoli delle stesso genere possono offrire. Una struttura pi&#xF9; semplice, ma allo stesso tempo ben implementata e moderna legata a combattimenti ben fatti e dal buon tasso strategico, lo rendono pi&#xF9; alla portata di tutti.
<br>
<br>La mole dei dialoghi rappresenta sia la forza che la debolezza di un gioco che non lascia spazio a compromessi: o lo si ama o lo sia odia. Ma se un giorno avr&#xE0; la localizzazione italiana aggiungete, a vostra scelta, dai 5 ai 10 punti in pi&#xF9; al voto finale.
<br>
<br>Non vi scandalizzate se da qui a qualche anno questo GdR potrebbe diventare di culto, anche se non un capolavoro assoluto come il titolo Black Isle del 1999. Noi ve l&apos;abbiamo detto in anticipo, quasi ad essere profetici...

I was initially drawn in to the setting, however my patience with the game&apos;s writing has worn perilously thin and the gameplay has me on the verge of giving up (I am determined to finish it however, to see just how bad it is going to get by the end).
<br>
<br>I do not feel that this game presents particularly good writing. It does however provide a great example of a situation where an editor was desperately needed. A lot of the text that is presented is redundant, either with other text in the same presentation (suggesting a lack of proofreading) or with other graphical content (why describe features of the environment that are being shown on the screen?). So much emphasis is given to the setting and environmental characters that the companions are left poorly developed, and the motivation for why the main character is on their quest in the first place is lost. I guess there is a big bad that we are supposed to be afraid of? That others have successfully eluded for centuries? Where is the urgency?
<br>
<br>The crisis encounters are baffling. There are not many of them, but even those that were included are poorly thought-out. Turn-based combat does not mix well with throwing large numbers of enemies at the player. Even worse when there are NPC turns that they spend running around (this problem goes back to the original Fallout, at least). If there are six consecutive enemy turns coming up, can you not find a way to have them all act at the same time? Or perhaps do not create encounters with large numbers of characters?
<br>
<br>I am currently &quot;stuck&quot; on a crisis encounter (feels like I am 2/3rds through the game) where one character makes a heroic sacrifice to allow you to save others. The way they do so however consistently draws the enemy&apos;s large area of effect attacks to precisely the area where the characters I am trying to save are hiding. So far I have restarted the encounter three times. Figuring out how to game a poorly-designed system in order to succeed is not how great Friday nights are made.
<br>
<br>Finally the skill system (you will spend far more time dealing with this than with combat). The skill checks are frustrating. You spend effort points in order to increase your % chance. Initially these are quite limited (and resting can cause you to suddenly fail at quest objectives) so you will enjoy the frustration of putting a lot of intellect points into getting a high chance of succeeding on a skill check and then failing anyway (with that path now usually locked off). Do not worry however, by the time you have a full party of companions and a few level-ups under your belt you will never see another skill check in the game that you are not able to get a 100% success on.
<br>
<br>I feel like all of these problems would have been immediately obvious if the game had been play-tested. I do not understand how they are still in the game at release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7092044">Expand</a></span>

Hmmm I like every veteran of Planescape, waiting for this game long long time and at end I realize it&apos;s no a Torment I was waiting for. Power of old Torment was in absolute delighted story, magnificent characters (personal for me best was always Anna - romance with her was something absolute true  and her last word was for always written in my memory), wold with was something new (when You don&apos;t know nothing about this AD&amp;D setting) but it was very easy to get inside it and background stories about Sigil was brilliant.
<br>
<br>In Tides of Numenara main plot and background stories are few steps behind Baldurs Gate, quest are rather simple and world is I think too strange, without interesting background or this background is to philosophical without any emotions. Companions are no interesting, someone write that  Minsc and Boo from BG2 was more interesting and this is absolute true, they are far away from Morte or Anna, or from Gloria from Shadowrun:Dragonfall. For me Tyranny was a better game (but no perfect for sure), with brand new idea for main plot.
<br>
<br>So that&apos;s why only 5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7194130">Expand</a></span>

<br>- People who have let their elitism get to their head and consider Planescape Torment to be absolutely perfect and that any comparison is sacrilege.
<br>- People are those that rightfully blast the developers for failing to deliver on promises. But failure to deliver on promises should not factor into an analysis on whether a game is actually good or not and rating it lower based on that is outright _childish_. While I don&apos;t claim to be objective, these people have abandoned any attempt at objectivity to air their frustrations. Giving a game like this 0 is absolutely disgraceful and downright moronic, even with all its flaws.
<br>
<br>If you judge this game based solely on its own merit, beyond the drama, you will find a rare game with a very well thought out story, a unique and enchanting universe unlike almost any you&apos;ve ever seen. The combat system, while not the best, is still rather smooth. Unlike most RPGs it manages to not wear out its welcome and become annoying and repetitive, which has been my experience with numerous RPGs. RPGs where only specific enthusiasts manage to actually stay engaged in the combat system while everyone else rolls their eyes and sighs at having to kill yet another group of mooks, wasting more of your time. The combat system by itself is mediocre, but the devs carefully balanced a wide variety of encounters, environments, types of enemies and consumables to keep things interesting.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s plot is subtle and if you&apos;re more into heroic tales played straight you will not enjoy this game. If you don&apos;t like reading dialogue and descriptions, you will not enjoy this game. While the game has enough content, if you&apos;re expecting a game with lots of sidequests and a huge world to explore, then you will be disappointed.
<br>
<br>If you expect an indie RPG with a unique, enchanting plot that brings a breath of fresh air in the RPG scene, with tiny little secrets for you to discover as the universe opens itself up to you then you will enjoy this game. For all the complaints about its story, the story is similar in style to Planescape: Torment, it&apos;s just unique in its own right. A spiritual successor of Planescape could never be a sequel or an imitator, that goes against the very essence of Planescape.
<br>
<br>The game is flawed. It could use more follower development and interaction. It could use more development of your RPG character. It could be a bit longer and meatier. But it is still fundamentally good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7343964">Expand</a></span>

It is a pity that such a good writer cast didn&apos;t achieve something more memorable, but as it is the first attempt in a relatively new world, perhaps in the future they could create something better, since the background for stories exists.
<br>
<br>On the positive side we have, briefly, the interesting, although new, world, beautiful graphics and a different way of character development.
<br>
<br>On the negative side we have Sound, the GUI, dialogues without special depth and purpose , the meager items and not so impressive plot.
<br>
<br>Overall you can finish the game with all side quests in 30-40 hours, depending on how fast you read the dialogues....ehhhh.. how fast resolve the quests and Crisis.

<br>Yes. Fighting mechanics are terrible (in Comparison to others). But a trashmob fighting Simulator in CRPG-Style is not the Goal of this game.
<br>The Goal is to tell a story. To make people thinking about different point of views and bizzare thesis. The goal is to design a different world and make it alive in the brain of the gamer.
<br>This goals are all achieved. It is true. It&apos;s hard to get in and read text over text. But the reward for this is extraordinary. Why 9 instead of 10?
<br>The cutted stretchgoals and the fighting mechanics. no matter if it is a goal or not. Fighting could be a bit more fun and complex. This would make the game 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7007725">Expand</a></span>

Not that I&#x2019;m complaining. Like Planescape: Torment it managed to suck me in and kept me playing until late in the night. Solving quests and conflicts in ways that didn&#x2019;t necessarily have to end up in combat was cool and fun, and having even stuff that seemed like vendor trash being able to raise your stats was pretty neat and was a good excuse to read all the blurbs the writers had crafted.
<br>
<br>But while the older Fallout games, and inXile&#x2019;s recent Wasteland 2: Director&#x2019;s Cut games kept me busy for about 50 to 60 hours, I got about half of that out of Torment: Tides of Numenera. That doesn&#x2019;t make it a bad game, though. Still, even though I no doubt missed some stuff that might have kept me entertained longer, I feel as if the game wasn&apos;t as fleshed out as promised. For example, wasn&apos;t the Labyrinth supposed to be far more complex? And if I remember correctly, wasn&apos;t there supposed to be an underwater city after we had hit a stretch goal? Whatever the case was, the game left me wanting more and even if it isn&apos;t quite as grand as the original Torment, I&apos;d definitely recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6998170">Expand</a></span>

Long story short,if you don&apos;t like narrative driven games, Torment is probably not for you. However, if you are like me and like games with a lot of lore and story, Torment is a gem.</span>

<br>As for the negatives:
<br>- very dull companions - compared to Edwin, Dak&apos;kon or Tali, these characters are boring. There are better ones, like the little girl, or the boasting hero type, but overall, this is one of the biggest flaws of the game.
<br>- simplistic combat system, and terrible path-finding
<br>- bugs - I constantly lost actions, and attacks during combat, because they didn&apos;t trigger, or my character refused to perform them
<br>- uninspired magic-system - after Tyranny, this was a major step back
<br>- overall linearity - once you leave a hub-area, there is no way of ever going back
<br>- they over-wrote the game to the point of frustration. Every npc will dump text on you without much reason, I found myself to skip most of it
<br>- simplistic sounds, and low-grade voice acting
<br>
<br>And as for the positives:
<br>- even if the story starts out in a very familiar fashion (you awaken, without memories, your past self was a bad guy, and you are chased by shadows - where did I heard that before?), it still develops into something quite unique. The main villain was in fact interesting, and understandable.
<br>- despite taking notes from Shadowrun and Planescape, the world was magical and fun, I found myself reading booklets, and exposition - on the first walkthrough, anyway
<br>- excellent, unique leveling-up system, nice sense of progression
<br>- only quests lend you xp
<br>- the quests are interesting, none of the &quot;bring 10 wolf pelts for 100 gold&quot; type of stuff
<br>- every - and I mean every - situation have a peaceful solution to it. There is like one mandatory fight in it. You get free hand in being as peaceful, or as violent, as you want. Huge positive for me.
<br>- lack of shallow light/dark side morality system. Instead a pretty odd, but interesting and fun predisposition system is introduced, where colours (tides) represent the basic attitude towards life itself - do you live for knowledge, or justice, or power, etc. In this system you can take both positive and negative actions, and still maintain a path you want - like sacrificing someone for the greater needs, killing a ruthless murderer, and giving up a thief who stole food for himself will all lend you indigo tide.
<br>
<br>Tides of Numenera fell short on being a stellar, flawless game. But it reaches the level of Pillars of Eternity, or Shadowrun Dragonfall, which is a giant pat on the back in my book. And take off the nostalgia goggles, people, Planescape Torment wasn&apos;t flawless either.
<br>This game is a worthy successor, and I can&apos;t wait for the next game in the Numenera-world.
<br>
<br>8/10 Very Good!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7111349">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you want a game focused on story (with 1.2 million words of text), you&apos;re in the right place; If you want combat or to spend your time min-maxing a battle system you&apos;ll use extensively, look elsewhere. As a fan of Planescape: Torment and tabletop roleplaying in general, this was exactly what I wanted.
<br>
<br>Overall: An excellent example of Inifinity-engine style storytelling in the mold of Planescape: Torment. One of the biggest strengths of TTON is that it is without the excess weight of some elements that (while fun) don&apos;t contribute to this particular kind of narrative RPG; specifically, excess grinding and extra-story combat. On the downside, of course, some people will miss those things, and some will be further disappointed at the fact that this really is a specific story with a lot of beautiful text (ala PS:T), and not a free-form RPG like Baldur&apos;s Gate, where you can build a character of your choosing. However, the limited choices when it comes to character creation are still quite robust, and I didn&apos;t feel like the story was missing anything for not having, for example, more than three Focus paths to choose from.
<br>
<br>Major Pros:
<br>-Tight narrative that allows for MUCH more reactivity than I expected, making choices that felt thematically or logically correct actually have impacts (sometimes extremely significant impacts) to gameplay. Unlike BG/BGII or even PS:T, for example, sometimes a quest item is actually as useful as the person who asks you to retrieve it claims it to be...
<br>-Interesting characters with personal motivations beyond &quot;You seem trustworthy; allow me to join YOUR noble quest!&quot;
<br>-An interesting character with personal motivation that is EXACTLY: &quot;You seem trustworthy; allow me to join YOUR noble quest!&quot;
<br>
<br>Minor Pros:
<br>-Beautiful music and art
<br>-Background item descriptions blend into interactivity and actual bonuses/powers; be sure to examine all the Oddities carefully.
<br>
<br>Major Cons:
<br>-The final act was so tight that I&apos;m willing to bet anyone who doesn&apos;t play a heavy-Intellect/Lore/etc character, AND strive for finishing side-quests, will feel like it is lacking. The major narrative is strong and well-implemented, but I think it would be easy for someone playing a different kind of character to miss some things I found and enjoyed (though, I suppose, I could be wrong, depending on the usefulness of Smashing/Quick Fingers/etc as skills to find other ways around problems).
<br>
<br>Minor Cons:
<br>-Voice acting didn&apos;t hold up to the music and art; I was OK with it, but some characters were much weaker than others in this regard.
<br>-I was surprised there are only 4 character tiers (sort of the equivalent of levels, or level-brackets) in the game, as I was assuming it would have the baseline 6 from the tabletop game. I was certainly not under-powered at the end, but when I stopped advancing, I had to go and check to see if that was a bug.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7070906">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s what I hoped Pillars of Eternity would be.
<br>
<br>There is SO much to read and learn about the world, the game oozes with history, lore, personal stories, mystical beings and throws these at you at a overwhelming pace at first. But then you are able to set in and understand that this world is strange and complex and you are supposed to feel overwhelmed by all the quirky weird billion years old tech gadgets and multidimensional hivemind wizards. The quality of writing is magnificent and the quantity of it is simply immense (as can be expected for a Planescape Torment &quot;sequel&quot;).
<br>
<br>While the engine is dated, and graphics are not the focal point of a game that is so rich in story, the graphical design is really beautiful.
<br>
<br>The Numenera rule-set is quirky and different from what Im used to but I think that sits well with the quirky and different from what Im used to world that the game takes place in.
<br>
<br>Combat so far has been a bit boring, but that part honestly is the least of my worries in a story driven game like this.
<br>
<br>In ~7h of play I&apos;ve experienced 1 crash.. and I&apos;ve read some people are experiencing them more.
<br>
<br>I made a promise to my self to never pre-order / kickstart / indiegogo another product if this one falls flat on its face, but it doesn&apos;t. It delivers on what I wanted and more. Now I gotta get back to playing the damn thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6998692">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- the combat is terrible. No effort has been put into this to make it enjoyable.
<br>- there is WAAAYYY to much scripting and it is BOORINGG!!!
<br>- Character progression is redundant, pointless and non-fulfilling
<br>- World is not immersive
<br>- Gameplay is not fun
<br>
<br>I am stunned that the developers released this game and I don&apos;t think it will sell well.

If you want flashy cinematics, don&apos;t like text, and want lots of tactical combat you will probably be disappointed.  If you&apos;ve constructed some unrealistic fantasy of an ideal game or put the original Torment on a pedestal of perfection it won&apos;t match up.  If you take it on it&apos;s own terms it&apos;s great.  Strong points for me are first and foremost strong and interactive writing and an overall vibe that captures the spirit of the original for me.  You are not led from quest to quest, there are multiple approaches for solving problems, and failure can even be interesting (e.g. no need to save and reload until you get the &quot;good&quot; results.)  Character development is logical and opens up interesting options.  Combat is not necessary most of the time but works well when you use it; I appreciate not having to role-play a serial killer.  The interface is good, the sound and graphics are effective and appealing.  The lore is interesting without being overwhelming and your decisions have consequences, sometimes surprising, down the line.  I dinged it a bit for not having a central story line (or those of the henchmen) that grabbed me as much as the precursor (no Morte here...)  I liked the effort system but found it more effective for dialog than for combat, which does create a bit of a game system bias against fighting (basically, you invest points for higher success, which you need more in fights than you do in dialog for mechanical reasons).  Despite quibbles, highly rated and worth the wait for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=6997399">Expand</a></span>

As a fan of the tabletop RPG, T: ToN does capture the key things about the Ninth World: it&apos;s weird, fantastic, and mysterious. The writing is outstanding, but unless you have an massive vocabulary you may need a dictionary to make any sense of it. The scenery is alien and attractive, but I wish the assets were in HD so it looked nicer on my Retina monitor. The companions are colorful, but some are missing from what was promised. As a whole, the Kickstarter was handled pretty well, but InXile had to reduce content in order to make the launch date. They&apos;ve promised the rest of the content for free to backers, so hopefully all in good time.
<br>
<br>I played the entire game through and it never crashed once. In fact, I can imagine Brian Fargo telling his team, &quot;all I care about is that it doesn&apos;t crash. Then we can launch.&quot; But while it was stable on Mac, it still felt unpolished. It desperately needs some patches to clean it all up, especially combat which is the weakest point. Fortunately, you can solve nearly every situation without violence. Even if a fight doesn&apos;t go your way, death is just another story arc. The game designers realized that with quick save, death in an RPG is basically an inconvenience, so instead of having to reload the story continues. Usually.
<br>
<br>All in all, I imagine that six months from now when the game is fully patched it&apos;s going to be legendary.
<br>
<br>InExile, if you&apos;re reading, please...
<br>&#x2022; Complete the Kickstarter content
<br>&#x2022; Patch the game repeatedly
<br>&#x2022; HD graphical assets
<br>&#x2022; Review combat
<br>&#x2022; Make it so I can give my companions armor</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7086956">Expand</a></span>

It plays more like a particularly interactive choose your own adventure than a traditional RPG. Min/Maxing stats trivialised most encounters. Particularly mental stats as almost all combat can be avoided. If you really like planetscape torment its worth a play, but it doesn&apos;t reach anywhere near its level of perfection. If you&apos;re more a fan of RPGs in general I&apos;d give it a pass.

That is not what this game is about. It is all about detailed writing, reading through a lot of lore info and using imagination(some people forgot they have it and expect everything to be shown to them). Story is on similar level as in spiritual successor, shorter one but with many choices that close out other routes(I like it the same way I liked it for Tyranny, it is a good direction). On the negative side: cut content was little disappointing and I expected Sorrow to look like in story trailer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7084629">Expand</a></span>

El &quot;effort system&quot; es mucho m&#xE1;s parecido a los juegos de rol y mesa, donde dependiendo de tus habilidades tendr&#xE1;s un porcentaje de &#xE9;xito en las acciones que hagas.
<br>
<br>Lo &#xFA;nico malo que he encontrado en el juego es que despu&#xE9;s de tanto tiempo desde de su salida, a&#xFA;n mantiene algunos bugs molestos que no inciden en la trama principal, pero si afectan a algunas misiones laterales que impiden completarlas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7412497">Expand</a></span>

I had no business in kickstarter stuff, nor have I played the original Torment but I played all titles in NWN series and found out about this just this week.
<br>
<br>I like the text based gameplay, in fact I like it a bit too much. But my main gripe with it is that there are too much filler stuff in dialogues which makes me do things that I never have done during all these years of fantasy reading: skipping large portions of it. The problem is, there is too much of &quot;He said this while looking down on his ding dong. His hands were slowly grabbing and yet there were tears of regret coming out it already&quot;, and what I just made up is probably more exciting and in context of what it is supposed to be.
<br>
<br>Edit: Finished it. Left with a feeling that the game is uncomplete. The ending is weird.
<br>
<br>One thing I can definitely say is that combat is extremely lacking, scarce and shallow.
<br>
<br>The story is well thought but the implementation is lacking. The world feels artifical. Substance is somewhat lacking. But overall, not that bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7322210">Expand</a></span>

I thought, from a new players perspective, that it delivered pretty nicely. I thought the storyline took a little too long to get into but was great nonetheless. Combat was very nice and really brought all possible scenarios that a player could take advantage of to defeat the enemies. The level and skill system, as well as the different classes, was not explicitly explained to the best that could be but with experience one can affiliate themselves with the mechanics very nicely. As others may have mentioned, I thought there was a little too much text to explain some of the simplest of things but I guess that was more of an artist&apos;s point of view. Overall, it&apos;s a game that was worth getting this 2017.

<br>Sorry, couldn&apos;t help myself.
<br>First of all, I get the negative responses for this game, I really do. It can be quite exhausting and the combat is downright
<br>terrible. But If, somewhere in your heart, you have a soft spot for Planescape: Torment (The best RPG of all time imo)
<br>and/or enjoy reading AND games with an emphasis on storytelling so extreme that the dialogue itself can be qualified as gameplay, you owe it to yourself to play this game. Because it succeeds completely as a Spiritual Successor to Planescape and, even though it is not as good, it evokes he feeling you have/had while playing that game, especially for the first time, in a beautiful way. That is why, over the course of this entire game/book, a warm smile of wonder graced my face, which lasted to the very last letters of the closing credits. The atmosphere and story of this piece just come together and, if you are prone to mental cinema and posess the ability
<br>to really immerse yourself, grabs you by the.. you know ...and doesn&apos;t let you off the hook
<br>until you&apos;ve finished it. And that makes this game a truly memorable experience.
<br>The Arc Words &apos;What does one Life matter?&apos; will stick with you for a long time after you
<br>turned it off.
<br>If you want to break it down to one sentence:
<br>Torment: Tides of Numenera is ultimately a worthy &apos;sequel&apos; to Planescape and a, nothing if not sincere, love letter to all the people who truly appreciate the role playing aspect in the so
<br>called role playing games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torment-tides-of-numenera/user-reviews?user_review_id=7590769">Expand</a></span>
