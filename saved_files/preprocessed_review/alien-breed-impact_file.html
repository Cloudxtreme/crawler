<br>
<br>The graphics are generally pretty and detailed in a grey and blue sort of way.  The first three stages are extremely repetitive whilst the last two, the hydroponics level and the ghost ship do mix it up a bit.
<br>
<br>The sound is all over, there are really chilling alien noises mixed with the silly pew-pew of the laser gun.  The voice acting is generally good but only in the cut-scenes.
<br>
<br>The point where Alien Breed really falls down is it&apos;s game-play.  You&apos;ll probably find fighting the camera and map far more challenging than fighting the aliens.  If the character was moved slightly further up the map and zoomed out a bit more a lot of problems would be solved.  Redesigning the stages so a non-rotational camera could have been used would have been a huge plus.  Shooting aliens at the bottom of the screen and trying to find items and doors hidden behind walls is... annoying.
<br>
<br>The map will show you your objective in the HUD but no ship layout.  To see the ship layout you need to use your tablet but then the objective is only shown if it fits on the immediately visible piece of map.  This isn&apos;t helped by the controls opening the map with one key and closing it with another.  Did I mention annoying.  Yeah am sure I did.
<br>
<br>The initial stages, despite having repetitive graphics will then also see you running from one end of the ship to the other making for even more repetitive play.  This artificially lengthens the stages as the game designers contrive sillier and sillier reasons to need to run back through areas you&apos;ve already been through.  This wouldn&apos;t be so bad if you were constantly under attack but they are mostly long walks with nothing happening  you can only run for a limited period of time.
<br>
<br>Things get somewhat better later on.  The aliens start swarming from all corners making for a lot more action.  The stages are still back-and-forth but at least there&apos;s stuff to do.
<br>
<br>And now I come to the aliens  my next big gripe.  There are about 4 or 5 types of alien but they&apos;re practically indistinguishable.  I think they&apos;re all supposed to have special abilities and that would have been awesome if they used them and forced tactical play.  But they don&apos;t, they run straight lines towards the player and as they don&apos;t collide with each other usually form an easy to shoot pile.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s little satisfaction in shooting them as they don&apos;t throw out gouts of green alien blood, only the odd particle. They get knocked around easily by even weak weapons and this before dying with barely a whimper and a quick death animation.
<br>
<br>This sounds really negative and it is until later on when  for instance  wading through dozens of aliens in Hydroponics is a complete blast.  Then you don&apos;t notice the silly bullets, lack of blood or mind the quick deaths.
<br>
<br>Moving on: the last issue I have is with the story.  The main character is the chief engineer of the space ship The Leopold.  The Chief Engineer.  But he has no security rights and no understanding of engineering consoles  he breaks just about every one he touches.  Using a generic space marine character would have made more sense.  Like the Doom Guy.
<br>
<br>Also the Leopold has crashed into a giant derelict ship of unknown origin.  Except the name of the ship is written on the side.  In English.  And it&apos;s an Intex ship  just like the Leopold.  Surely someone would have kept a record of it somewhere.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to stop complaining now and recommended Alien Breed.  It may not be great but it is worth a couple of your dollars and few of your hours.  For all I&apos;ve said I did enjoy it but suspect I should have cranked up the difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-breed-impact/user-reviews?user_review_id=3523580">Expand</a></span>

The game is set aboard a spaceship and the single player campaign lasts around 8-9 hours. Although the game mainly involves walking through dark corridors and shooting at giant alien bugs, it manages to maintain a good sense of atmosphere and delivers well on the fun aspect. The player gets to use 5 different weapons, several items, and faces a healthy variety of enemies, which does well at minimizing what could potentially have been a repetitive game. The situations vary greatly. At times you might face one or two bugs at a time, and then at other times a whole wave would just burst out from all around you and force you to battle for your own survival. The fact that enemies could come from anywhere  doorways, vents, floor  creates a sense of tension and keeps the player ready for anything. Although it seems like the game is building towards some kind of plot, usually in the comic-book-style cutscenes, most of the things you do don&#x2019;t seem to have much relevance. For most of the time when outside battles you just go around the huge ship and activate various computer systems in order to gain access to the next area. It could feel repetitive at times, but the main focus of the game is mostly on tension and battles with the aliens, so I suppose it&#x2019;s not much of an issue really. There is also a chance to upgrade your weapons so to give yourself a bit of an edge in combat. Each weapon has 3 different upgrade options: rate of fire, reload time, and damage per shot. Now the interesting thing is that you can only ever have 1 upgrade active at a time, so the player will have to do some decision making and choose an upgrade that they feel is most suitable for each gun. This also opens a slight possibility for replay value. Without giving spoilers, I also want to mention that I was a bit disappointed with the final boss of the game. Its attacks kept repeating themselves over and over in a very repetitive pattern, and also for some strange reason at times when the boss is supposed to go under the floor it kept getting stuck upside down. However, this is only a mere 10-15 minutes of an otherwise very engaging and well-polished game. It&#x2019;s quite simple at its core, but the quality of the presentation that it delivers is very respectable. Now after having completed the game, there are two more parts that await me and it seems the plot is still building towards something. This is not really a stand alone game, but more like a chapter of a book or an episode of a TV show. So I am quite eager to try out second and third instalments in the series and see where this goes. Lastly to mention, the game also offers a co-op mode, but I am yet to try that out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-breed-impact/user-reviews?user_review_id=3018075">Expand</a></span>

The main reason of why this is happening is that we still better spend our time with other people. Therefore MMO&apos;s and offline titles with co-op mode are so popular today.
<br>
<br>The first thing that you mark in &quot;Alien Breed&quot; is that it looks very familiar, when you are an experienced player in this sort of games. The scenes are really like &quot;Shadowgrounds&quot;  with pipes, burning things here and there, electronic double doors and computers everywhere. The main difference is that the story of &quot;Alien Breed&quot; takes place on a spaceship, that had impacted into another ship and... different monsters begin to appear everywhere, killing everyone on their way. The plot&apos;s only purpose is to explain the appearance of new markers on the minimap. &quot;AB&quot; could be one game for ten bucks, but is separated into 3 episodes, each with its little part of story, and this is not so bad, because you don&apos;t need to pay the full price to understand the amount of your wish to play it (There is demo too). The first episode name is &quot;Impact&quot;.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is something between &quot;Shadowgrounds&quot; and &quot;Space Siege&quot;. We explore the interiors of the full-of-dead-people ship with almost no hope to find someone alive, sometimes floor and walls crashing  and scary beings start to attack from one or all directions simultaneously, then we grab some loot from lockers or &quot;human corpses&quot; and continue our journey. All the time we move from battle to battle, trying to hear enemies. In &quot;Dead Space&quot; sound was the main key to divine a fight, here it just sounds, someone always sniffs and &quot;coughs&quot; somewhere. The most interesting thing in this mess is that we must pay to gain ammo and upgrades from &quot;Intex terminals&quot;. Yeah, savior of the world &quot;has not enough money to buy a potion&quot;. What a delusion. But there is something in this end of the spaceship days. Enemies are tough, ammo ends very quickly, we saw this in &quot;Shadowgrounds&quot; once, and that was good, but again with the same monsters with just one upgrade per gun and absolutely same grey locations, this will kill even the biggest fan of isometric shoot-em-all horror games. Sometimes the game shows the power of &quot;Unreal Engine 3&quot;, painting great effects of electricity or a new style of environment like chambers with dark-green plants and alien cocoons in hydroponics, and sometimes it seems that a new part of the ship is &#x201C;a breath of fresh air&#x201D;. But there is almost no fun in killing brownish-gray aliens in brownish-gray environment.
<br>
<br>When solo campaign is boring and monotonous, co-op is... even worst. There are no boss-fights except big hordes of enemies, the final trial in each mission is to defend yourself against a horde of monsters for 30 seconds and then fast jump into the elevator. The only thing that can fix this and prevent yawning is your friend on the other side of the global network. I&apos;ve played many co-op games and surely can tell, that there are no reasons to play &quot;AB&quot; together. You can&apos;t interact with each other, can&apos;t exchange weapons and items, you can&apos;t even help your partner when he is down  he will stand up automatically. The two heroes are even nameless. The one thing that you can do is to try to cover your friend&apos;s back, shoot monsters on his 6 and survive while he raises up after being down. Nothing more.
<br>
<br>&quot;Alien Breed&quot; brings nothing new in genre, trying to scare you, but it&apos;s not scary, except the moments, where enemies start to rise from the floor under your character. I&apos;m sorry, i don&apos;t like to bind labels, because every game has it&apos;s fans and creating of any game is not so easy, but this game is boring, and there is no reason to play it more than once, even once.

<br>
<br>So, what about Alien Breed: Impact? We know it&apos;s a remake of a 20 years old shooter by the original team. Seems like a great start.
<br>
<br>However, the actual Alien Breed: Impact from 2010 is a game about painfully setting camera angles ; while exploring all the rooms and corridors of an heavily damaged spacecraft ; in order to gather as much as possible useful items from storage boxes and corpses (weapons, ammo, medikit, grenades) and also... money ! Money so you can buy more of these and upgrade your gear from Intex&apos;s deepspace-proof vending machines ; in order to [butter]cut your way through waves / spawns of [not really] challenging aliens ; so you can reach the next locked door you&apos;ll have to open or broken engine you&apos;ll have to start or fix... Sorry, I find all of this boring.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a question of technical ability : Unreal Engine is solid, and Team 17 has a track record. It&apos;s about choices.
<br>
<br>Sometimes, game design is like pastry : you have the ingredients, but you have to be precise of quantities, order of composition and cooking heat / time - otherwise you end up with nothing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-breed-impact/user-reviews?user_review_id=5321108">Expand</a></span>

I hesitated to get this game because of the lukewarm reviews, but when it went on sale, I figured I would give it a chance. This is a fun little game. Yes, it&apos;s just one in a big herd of similar top-down alien/zombie shooters, but it holds its own against the rest. It isn&apos;t as fast paced as some, but it does a good job of setting a suspenseful mood. I&apos;m eager to try AB 2 and 3 just based on what I&apos;ve played so far of 1. One of the nice features, that sadly not all top-down shooters have, is the ability to rotate your point of view. This is a personal preference and many will probably disagree, but I don&apos;t particularly like the Q and E keys to rotate the perspective, just as I don&apos;t like using the mouse wheel to change weapons, so I swapped them. Rotating with the mouse wheel is both a lot faster and it feels more natural and intuitive. After a few minutes, it feels as if you&apos;re just turning your head to look around. I did the same thing for Trapped Dead and it improved the gaming experience immensely. Another thing that some will love, but others will hate, is that you&apos;re &quot;closer&quot; to the character than in most other isometric shooters. It feels a bit more immersive, but it&apos;s also a bit more claustrophobic, which might be intentional to enhance the horror/suspense. Still, I prefer Trapped Dead&apos;s approach of letting the player zoom in and out to whatever level feels most comfortable. It&apos;s almost impossible not to compare Alien Breed to Alien Swarm, given that they have almost identical themes. Despite being free, Alien Swarm is slicker in look and in the feel of the controls (though I miss being able to rotate my view), but I can&apos;t really say that one overwhelmingly outclasses the other in enjoyability. My suggestion is: if you like the genre, get both (and probably AB 2 &amp; 3 also). With one being free and the other(s) at a paltry $2.50 on sale, why deprive yourself of a few hours of fun? You&apos;ll spend more just on pop corn at a bad movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-breed-impact/user-reviews?user_review_id=1911661">Expand</a></span>
