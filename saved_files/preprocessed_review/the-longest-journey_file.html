The protagonist is witty and cunning. The puzzles are challenging. And the world is immersive and interesting. This game brings back memories. Good memories.</span>

I&apos;m not really a fan of adventure games, but this game managed to keep me enthralled. The characters were amazing and the story was to. I have recommend this game to multiple people in hopes they&apos;ll play it, so I&apos;d recommend it to you to!</span>

The graphics may have aged a bit (in a technical sense, polygon-count etc) but the aesthetics and the art are still amazing and gorgeous. The story and the voice acting is the games biggest strength and easily beats most modern titles out of the wind. The dialog is extremely well written and almost all the characters seem authentic. The ending could have been a bit more satisfying, it was rather weak compared to all the other stuff the game had to offer. Still, easily the best adventure game out there, even after 14 years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=3855058">Expand</a></span>

In terms of story, the game excels and the world is equally incredible as it incorporates both sci-fi &amp; fantasy elements. The Longest Journey is imaginative in its way of creating a diverse and unique universe filled with lore and characters that remain memorable. April Ryan is fantastic as the game&apos;s leading protagonist. She is well written and stands out as a main character. The world is truly great from the moment the player enters the futuristic world of Earth, being set about 300 years into the future. Sci-fi alone is done so well in this game and so is the fantasy aspect inspired by classic medieval lore with a fantastical touch.
<br>
<br>While filled with great lore and characters, the adventure filled game play can seem slow at times due to April&apos;s walk speed and this requires a bit of patience. This may be a problem as it can make the game experience seem a tedious one. Nonetheless, despite this The Longest Journey features amazing voice acting and dialogue coupled with a very well written script. This game is a true classic and really is one of the greatest adventure games ever made; nothing since has really compared to the degree of detail evident in the game&apos;s story structure and lore. Scale-wise, it is a series filled with imaginative lore containing creatures and characters from different worlds and backgrounds. This all combines to make an outstanding story adventure. The Longest Journey is the first of the Dreamfall series and anyone interested in fantasy, or sci-fi with an emphasis on narrative should definitely experience this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=6918817">Expand</a></span>

Also the brilliant voice acting fills up for any deficiencies in the graphics department (which were not a problem to begin with). The two worlds concept has been done very well since each of the worlds (a technological world and a fantasy world)  has been crafted with amazing details.
<br>
<br>I was going to give this game a title of the quintessential adventure game&apos;, were it not for 2 glaring deficiencies :
<br>
<br>1. Some obtuse puzzles
<br>Some puzzles require completely unrelated objects to be combined and used together. And some puzzles require objects in distant locations (ie non intuitive object finding).
<br>
<br>2. The ending brings no overall closure to the overall story, Also, its kinda abrupt
<br>When you finish an epic game of &quot;saving the world&quot; (or two worlds in this case), you want more than just basic closure for the main character. Questions like what exactly happened to the world(s) and  what happened to the other characters afterwards are unanswered here (yeah i know, they are kinda explained in the sequel, but still)
<br>
<br>So there you go, if you guys don&apos;t have a problem with the two negatives that i have mentioned, this game would definitely be a 10/10 for you. Despite it, its a must have for the lovers of the adventure game genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=3299678">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Masterpiece! This game is over 10 years old and could teach nearly all modern developers how to tell a story. Sod next-gen physics and fancy graphics, this is engrossing. No game since Ico has had me actually caring for characters like this one has. Even if you don&apos;t like the genre (I myself am a racer/fps guy) this is a must buy.</span>

The highlight of the game is the way the story and voice-acting haul you into the game and create a compelling atmosphere to find out what happens next. Every character is well-developed and the art assets all converge in a convincing way to support the text. The story is one of the best in any adventure game. On the downside the graphic resolution is poor and is a major distraction. The character animations are laughably bad.  Moreover, the pacing of the game plays very very slow. Many of the puzzles are obtuse or simply inane.  If you read the user reviews the common theme of those who rate this game a 10 is &quot;great story&quot; and it&apos;s true. The story is great. The common theme for those who dislike this game are &quot;poor game&quot; and that too is true. The design of this game is below average. Personally, I played this game all the way to the end to see how it ended. But unlike those blinded by nostalgia I won&apos;t pretend this the super awesome game because it&apos;s not. It&apos;s a great story that covers up a rather poor game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=2089040">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles started off difficult, but became rather easy and common sense oriented after awhile. All of the art work and game design was very well done for an older point n&apos; click game. Overall if you are looking for a long adventure game with lots of puzzles, check it out just make sure to skip through much of the 10 min plus dialog (From every damn character! jeez!!). Make sure to save often, you do not want to have to re-sit through some of these story or dialog segments trust me! 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=1375392">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I don&apos;t mind old-school graphics, but they are from a cringe-worthy era of pre-rendered 3d  be warned.  The gameplay controls also have not-so-bad quirks.
<br>
<br>The story was vaguely interesting, and gripping at times, but extremely slow-paced, and long  there are definitely good bits here, but relative to other adventure games from Sierra/Lucasarts/Wadjet Eye or even Telltale...  I am just baffled by the ratings this gets.  There are many more important classic games to play through and ones that have stood up much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942377">Expand</a></span>

Now, I&apos;m an old-timer when it comes to point-n-click adventures. I&apos;ve played all the LucasArts classics and some other games that were mostly overlooked (e.g. Woodruff  the Shnibble of Azimuth) and I&apos;m used to difficult puzzles.  But TLJ takes it way too far. The puzzles are extremely cryptic and all over the place. Sometimes, they don&apos;t even make any sense. The distance between one part of a puzzle and the other part is way too big, there are often way too many items involved and, as said, making the connection between a combination of items (which is ridiculous in itself, item combination puzzles are inherently broken) and their use in the game is way too cryptic. I like difficult puzzles where the solution isn&apos;t absolutely obvious, but they still have to make sense. And in TLJ they often don&apos;t. That said, TLJ is a mediocre to good game at best. Even though I&apos;m only giving it a score of 6, I still think it is worth playing, considering that, by now, it&apos;s extremely cheap and you can sink (thanks to those cryptic puzzles) a lot of time into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960587">Expand</a></span>

About 60% of the dialogues is extra reading not needed to understand the story or the assignments, which is a pain because the store is rather boring, certainly not intriguently sophisticated or intelligent like Myst. Characters have a deep level of depth, but share out a lot of unneeded information. Puzzles are often unlogical and relay heavy on trial and error. The biggest problem however is the fact that the playstyle is slow to the extreme. Click item 1, walk map A (15secs) map B (20 sec), click item 2, walk map C (20secs) etc etc. Just trying out one idea might take you more than three minutes. If you add dozen lines of text, you can see that the game was created for the story, rather than the other way around. This is bad, because you tend to figure things out faster than the game let you play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=412709">Expand</a></span>

All characters are idiots, from the guy in the border house to the mechanic hiding out - worse is the crow.

After wasting an hour and getting some drama with the main characters ex getting abducted blah blah blah chick crap blah blah blah. She is set after him-I stopped playing here because of sheer boredom. I literally wasted 3 hours just to get there. The fighting is terrible, and there is like 10 fight scenes in the game thats going to last forever.My advice? Skip this game and pick up Oblivion, because that had a good story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=83423">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, after a while, it started to feel like a chore, as if I was playing it just to see what happened, not because it was still fun (it wasn&apos;t). The puzzles are often silly and arcane. The game is VERY slow-paced and honestly the plot could have been told in 15 hours instead of 40 hours. Much of the game consists of doing filler quests - finding items and solving strange puzzles. Also, the insanely slow pace with which characters move (even with the escape key) and sometimes forces you to watch them to stupid things, such as take out a pipe and smoke it, then put it back, becomes annoying after a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=4283194">Expand</a></span>

The story line is soo cool as well. So what if there are a few swear words, and that some people talk for a while - it helps you get to know the characters more, and besides you can skip the long convos! Longest Journey rules!!!!</span>

Sarah Hamilton who voiced April Ryan should be winning awards everywhere! Can&apos;t believe it won&apos;t be a book or film too eventually. The sum of the parts make more than the whole, so I would give this &quot;event&quot; a 12/10!</span>

Too bad the sequel was total crap.</span>

I would compare it to a very good book that you cannot seem to part from; one minute you&apos;re reading it and the next time you look up it&apos;s 3:30am. This game will suck you in and make it hard to stop playing. If you like a challenging game with a great story, humorous (and sometimes crude) dialogue, a good character line-up, long game-play time, and puzzles that make you exercise your brain then The Longest Journey should be on your to-buy list in the #1 slot. You will not be disappointed. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=406792">Expand</a></span>

LOTS AND LOTS OF DIALOGUE...just skip through it all and read the conversation log afterward, it goes faster. Not for the tender of ear, lots of cussing. Lots of nice mind bending puzzles. The music is rather nice too.. Fun game from Funcom, GOOD LUCK.</span>

I am a big fan of dialogue in games, and TLJ is often criticised for this in the same way as Broken Sword and the like. Some sequences could have been a little shorter (I got particularly impatient during the directionless storytelling-species segment) - so, I guess for some people this will be too much. I have one thing to say: You want to go shoot things, there are plenty of thriving genres out there that allow you to do just that. You want to enjoy a *story*, you want a classic adventure game - and with The Longest Journey, that is what you undoubtedly get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=369836">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re looking for shiny, fancy graphics, or a quick, mindless shoot-em-up, well, what are you doing on this page in the first place? If, however, you&apos;re looking for an intriguing story in a richly developed world, you need to play this game. First, the bad news: It&apos;s slow. Yes, the barely literate reviews saying it was slow to play are correct. The walking speed is irritating sometimes, and trial and error puzzles between screens can take a while. The graphics are also primitive, but, hey, it&apos;s from 2000. I only mention it because, once you&apos;ve played more recent games, it takes a while to adjust back. I missed a couple items because I&apos;m used to more recent games. Once I&apos;d played for a little while, though, I got my brain back into 2000 and it was all good.<br>The medium news: Language and Content. This isn&apos;t a game for kids. It&apos;s a mature adventure. (not the porn version of mature, which, let&apos;s face it, is an odd use for the word anyway) TLJ simply deals with adults on their level, which includes profanity, drugs, etc. It&apos;s not gratuitous, but it is worth noting. So don&apos;t let your kids play it.<br>The interface is fine. Nothing special, but nothing irritating either. Standard adventure fare here.<br>The good news: Everything else.  WoutT complained in his review that the game was made for the story, rather than the other way around. If you think this is a bad thing, then this isn&apos;t the game for you. If, however, you&apos;re looking for that oh-so-rare story-driven gameplay, then this is a gem not to be missed. There is lots of dialogue, written not just to advance the story, but to flesh out the world, making it an immersive and detailed place, rather than just a backdrop. Humor, drama, suspense, and even some action spread over the many hours of gameplay keep the story from becoming monotonous. There is a rich variety of characters, and while I&apos;d love to give examples, to show the variety, discovering them is too much of a joy to ruin. But with a &quot;realistic&quot; world and a fantasy world in one game, the characters never feel cloned or stale. A few are more obviously placed as quest-givers, but most have at least some backstory and all the main characters feel real and nuanced. The puzzles, as in any good adventure game, will have different reactions from different players. Some will find them obvious, some will be baffled constantly. Personally, (and I&apos;m not very good at adventure games, at least without the occasional hint) I did pretty well. They get easier as you learn how the developers thought, but they never get stale. On the occasions when I did check online (UHS hints is a godsend) I found myself smacking my forehead, because I really should have thought of the solution myself. There are few moments when you have to do something really inane to solve a puzzle, and just as few when it&apos;s all laid out for you. The gameplay is linear, but this was never meant to be sandbox. It&apos;s about the story, so it follows a relatively straight path. The Longest Journey is like an interactive novel with puzzles, so the linearity didn&apos;t bother me in the slightest. Frankly, with the size of the world(s) and the slow walking speed, knowing which puzzle to solve next was nice. The sound contributes nicely to the overall experience. I wasn&apos;t blown away by its brilliance, but it was always well-suited and effective.<br>Replayability is moderate to low, since it&apos;s an adventure game, but at 40+ hours for a single play-through, that&apos;s still pretty darn good.<br><br>I&apos;m not a big adventure game fan. I rarely play them and even more seldom enjoy them. So for me to rave about an adventure game means it really goes above and beyond. A mature story with well developed settings and characters, told with rich dialogue over plenty of play-time, The Longest Journey does what few games have even approached in the decade since it was released. Play this game.<br><br><br>P.S. It&apos;s hard to take an opinion seriously if the writing in a review is so poor that it becomes comedy. Saying that the game is not &quot;intriguently&quot; sophisticated doesn&apos;t make your case very well. There&apos;s even a spell checker available for posts.

Grim Fandando and Sanitarium among many others (Captain Blood, Botanicula, Machinarium, The Last Door, Myst, Riven, etc.) belong to the top. I should try playing it, but what can I do...?

I got stuck and checked the UHS hints a few times, but 95% of the time I could solve the puzzle on my own. For me the difficulty level was perfect. It is always clear what the next problem to solve is. The game does a good job of giving the player cues as to what is important, what needs to happen next, etc. So in this way the game design was really well done. There was a good combination of humor and drama that I also like. The only downside is that is is maybe a bit too long. It took me ~30 hours (yes, I am slow) to finish. Some editing might have improved the game somewhat. The main character is a teenage girl, maybe hard for some players to identify with, although she is a likeable character. I am sure this game was a graphics phenomenon in 1999 when it was released. In 2012 the low res graphics and primitive animations are a bit distracting, so this is the main reason I give the game an 8 instead of a 9 or 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861372">Expand</a></span>

This duality gives the game a lot of variety in its atmosphere, story, characters, dialogs and puzzles. Yet, the whole thing stays consistent, and is therefore really immersive, which is no less than a feat for a fantasy story. Story which is engrossing. Dialogs are funny, full of humanity and well interpreted by the voice actors, which gives characters a solid deepness. Graphisms (except for the archaic 3D of the characters) and art style are very, truely beautiful. Along with the music and sounds effects, they create incredible atmospheres. Most of the puzzles, while challenging enough, aren&apos;t as hard as in other adventure games: they make sens (and no too-small-to-be-seen item to pick up), which is yet another very good point to be added on one of the &quot;Longest&quot; list of qualities for a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=3618931">Expand</a></span>

Definitely a masterpiece which would stay in my heart forever. It has a few (minor) problems and unfortunately is not completely playable to modern gamers, but I&apos;ll try to review it as objectively as I can!
<br>
<br>Plot: without a doubt the strongest point of the game! The Longest Journey tells you about April Ryan, a teenager which got entwined in the complex story of Stark - the world of science and logic, the one we know, Arcadia - the world of magic and wonders which exists in parallel to ours, and The Balance - which is in between the two worlds. The balance between the two worlds gets corrupted, putting in danger both worlds. The story goes far beyond that, with some twists and turns, and is also quiet deep. A little complex at times, yet that&apos;s what makes it so interesting!
<br>
<br>Settings: The game takes place in the far future (23rd century if I&apos;m not mistaken). It therefore has sort of sci-fi settings, with a futuristic version of our world on one side and the magical world of Arcadia on the other. The characters have depth and some are even memorable. The futuristic version of our world is rather believable, and the world of Arcadia is very well-crafted and actually lets you explore a whole new world, including its folklore, tales, histories and different nationsspecies. The game&apos;s setting is very well thought and detailed, which adds a lot to the main story and make the game even more interesting! Add the amazing writing and the outstanding acting and you got yourself a Masterpiece.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: The Longest Journey has the classic point and click interface. You collect items, combine and use them in order to solve puzzle, and keep exploring and examining your surroundings, talking to the people around you... The puzzles are pretty original and interesting, not too ordinary and yet I found most of them quiet logical. I (almost) never found myself thinking &quot;damn, I would have never figured it out myself!&quot; (except for that rubber ducky puzzle in the biginning!)
<br>One little thing that annoyed me though, there wasn&apos;t always balance between puzzles and dialogues, where I think there should have been. You can, at times, find yourself talking with people, more and more, without messing with the inventory at all, while at other times there&apos;s almost no dialogue and many puzzles to solve.
<br>
<br>Graphics: The graphics are generally beautiful, the game uses 3d models which move over 2d backgrounds, and while the models are usually ugly the backgrounds are amazingly beautiful and nice to watch and observe. Even by simply checking the game&apos;s artworks you can see there was much though put in that. Still, the graphics are limited and the game runs in a pretty low resolution (like many games from the nineties)
<br>
<br>Sounds and music:TLJ features a beautiful, magical soundtrack. Still, unfortunately, I felt the game lacks music. The game&apos;s soundtrack lasts for about a hour, and was used in the game only occasionally for short bits. I really like music in video games, and therefore was sometimes disappointed with this aspect. It&apos;s nothing critical though, because there are great sound effects and background noises which always correspond greatly to your surroundings, the the sounds&amp;soundtrack are still done pretty well.
<br>
<br>Compatibility: This game is rather old, and I still managed to run it on 3 different computers, which were all modern compared to this game, with almost no problems at all. So you&apos;re still able to play it on modern machines even nowadays without much effort.
<br>
<br>Test of Time: Unfortunately, the game is not as approachable as it was on its release. Many modern gamers would stay away from it, as it greatly centers on dialogues and story. There&apos;s a lot of content which isn&apos;t even relevant to finishing the game. TLJ requires a lot of your time, attention and patience, and even I couldn&apos;t always stand it while playing it last week. It was different when I first played it, many years ago, but nowadays players don&apos;t have so much patience as before. Modern gamers are ususally looking for things they won&apos;t find in this game. Add the dated graphics which by today&apos;s standards are terrible, and you get a game which is unfortunately fully appreciated mainly by those who played it back when it was fresh and new, even though storywise it&apos;s a great classic!
<br>
<br>In short, this game is almost perfect, but is unfortunately not for the impatience or seekers of quick-paced adventures, as this one takes its time. If you only let it, it would tell you one of the most wonderful tales told in the video-gaming world in the last two decades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=4600100">Expand</a></span>

Yes it does have an interesting - though not terribly original - story and at least some of the characters are also interesting. Especially April is excellent. Also, the backgrounds are quite nice to look at and the ending is especially good (and completely unexpected).
<br>
<br>But this is were the good stuff ends. The puzzles in this game are downright terrible. Arguably the worst in any adventure game and I am not only referring to the now infamous inflatable ducky puzzle. Puzzles require leaps of logic and can mostly really only be solved through trial and error. Also, so often you really have no idea what you should be doing or that there is a puzzle there in the first place. It gets slightly better as the game progresses, but not much really.
<br>
<br>Then there is the length. The Longest Journey is indeed Long! Too long!! Mostly because the story is extremely stretched-out. Moreover, everything in this game is slow: the character animations are slow, the walking is slow and much of the speaking is slow as well. This, combined with the puzzles, makes the game just a chore to play.
<br>
<br>Finally there is the character models. Boy do they look HIDEOUS! Both in-game as well as in the cut-scenes characters look like drugged-out alien zombies. April herself is actually the worst offender. She even looks bad on the box art. Cannot imagine how somebody thought this was acceptable, even back in 1999.
<br>
<br>So there you have it. While this review may sound overly negative I would still recommend this game, but only for it&apos;s story - and for the sequel(s) that follow it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609090">Expand</a></span>

It is filled with great ideas, interesting well written characters, and a wonderfully immersive world for players to dive into. If you are a gamer who cares about a great story in your games, this is one not to miss.
<br>The game play, as you would expect, is of the classic point-and-click type, mainly focusing on talking to various characters, picking up and interacting with various objects, and using those objects in various combinations to solve a range of puzzles to progress the story. In truth, many of the puzzles in this game are obtuse to the point of being annoying, but there are plenty of walkthroughs around if you don&apos;t want to beat your head against them and want to simply enjoy the wonderful story.
<br>Given that the game was originally released in 1999, its graphics have aged quite badly, even through they were lauded at the time for being pretty cutting edge. Fortunately, point-and-click adventures do not depend heavily on fancy graphics to be playable, so its not a gamebreaking issue. The music and voice acting however, stand up very well, and once you get used to the dated graphics the game remains immensely enjoyable.
<br>Given the insignificant price you can get this game for these days, its well worth the investment if you love a good story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=4925181">Expand</a></span>

Much of the dialogue feels natural, the relations between the characters real, the world and lore fleshed out- as a story or film, I think I would have loved this game. I could talk for ages about the story potential and world building, more than what the character limit allows for sure.
<br>
<br>As a game however, it runs into a few of the issues common to click and point adventure games- frustratingly slow puzzles that require running back and forth over the map, or going through all your items to find out what will work, or having to run the character through the hints to a puzzle you&apos;ve already figured out but can&apos;t complete until she does, or just repeatedly spamming conversations with people until they give in and do as you asked. There were definitely a few times where a puzzle seemed forced in just for the sake of it and didn&apos;t add anything to the game but frustration. Some puzzles felt more intuitive and made sense in the context however, and I did enjoy the game despite the occasional frustration of trial and error puzzles. The game was also kind in that it tells you when an item can be used, by having it light up when hovered over something else, rather than have you madly bash all the items against each other and the environment until something sticks.
<br>
<br>I also, personally, did not like the main character much, or the reoccurring sidekick later on. April to me felt  like someone who wasn&apos;t considerate of others, had a habit of inane comments, and wasn&apos;t as fleshed out as some of the side characters. I realise part of this was because of design (the character needed to have something basic to say on random things clicked, or ask sometimes obvious or irritating questions to make sure that the player had all the info needed) and the fact the main character is an 18 year old art student who&apos;s personality is &apos;snarky&apos;. This is definitely more down to personal taste, although it did spoil the game for me sometimes when I felt so at odds against the main character, although this may be due to me being used to modern &apos;choice&apos; games where the main characters are the player, instead of individuals the player is following but needn&apos;t fully identify with.
<br>
<br>Still, this game has concepts and content ahead of it&apos;s time, and really blends the fantasy and sci-fi aspects together well, and as mentioned before, as a book or film (more likely a book) this would have done well. Making it into a game, however, didn&apos;t add anything to it. There was no part of the story that needed to have a game mechanic to really enjoy, and the puzzles often slowed the story down instead of enhance it. Also, while I&apos;m normally a person who fully engages in &apos;lore&apos; games and love world building, I found The Longest Journey&apos;s method of mandatory story telling rather tiring. You HAD to sit and listen to a tale carefully, or go study texts, in order to have any idea of what you were doing (even though the main character would still often act as if they hadn&apos;t heard the same information as you), or just spam esc, skip the conversation but sit through the unskippable animations, and read it in your journal later like a script. The voice acting was amazing and most of the dialogue well written, but at points (especially in acardia) you were lore dumped and it wasn&apos;t so much that you were seeking out this info for your own enjoyment, but that it was just that you had to exhaust every dialogue option possible for some puzzles to be solvable whether you knew the solution or not. I much prefer to seek and read info at my own pace and choosing instead of sitting and listening to a character explain the political climate and history of a different world because it&apos;s probably needed to progress the story. Probably- but it&apos;s easier to ask all the questions now, rather than learn you need to walk back through x number of areas to ask it because it turns out you did need to ask it.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game, certainly as a classic and just as a genuinely good game. It&apos;s dated, yes, but if you&apos;re going to play an older game graphics and mechanics are a thing you just accept won&apos;t be as good as some of the modern games. The story is amazing and the game world fascinating. However, I would recommend it with a little hand waggle, as it suffers as most click and point adventures do where most of the game can be tediously drawn out by unneeded puzzles and fetch quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-longest-journey/user-reviews?user_review_id=6685370">Expand</a></span>
