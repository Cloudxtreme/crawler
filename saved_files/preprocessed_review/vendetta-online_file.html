It has a strong focus on hands-on first-person piloting and combat, with a slew of other activities like trading, mining, crafting, racing, and various player-organized events mixed in, with a minimal focus on grinding and roleplay. It is a community-oriented game with a small, close-knit and dedicated community of players that is slowly but steadily growing. The learning curve starts out a little bit steep, but it doesn&apos;t take long to grow adjusted, and it is a very fun, rewarding, and addicting game when you do. It is under constant development as it has been since 2004, by a small team of developers, and gameplay aspects are added or changed periodically.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vendetta-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2686100">Expand</a></span>

There is no other gaming experience that has come close to reproducing the effect that Vendetta Online&apos;s multiplayer space twitch combat deftly inspires.  The company Guild Software also deserves applause for their dedication and vision in bringing this experience to users in the face of overwhelming odds, and for their honesty and innovation in maintaining and developing their remarkable end product.  I was fortunate enough to meet the lead developer, John Bergman, and this furthered my confidence that Vendetta Online will continue to grow and come into its own as the years continue.  As a subscribed user since the Alpha stages of June 2003, I highly recommend this product to anyone with an interest in coruscating and intuitive combat in a rich and believable world, or to anyone with an interest in games in general.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vendetta-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1736392">Expand</a></span>

<br>In the beginning you need a lot of patience because grinding the licenses until you have something remotely called &quot;decent&quot; takes a long time. You have bad ships, bad weapons and a lot of points for the next license level.
<br>
<br>Technically the game looks outdated compared to others of that type (EVE, Elite Dangerous, etc.) and it has severe problems when more than one ship is in a sector (for example you cannot shoot others because the hits don&apos;t register).
<br>
<br>But the worst part are other players. Usually there are none playing (which I can understand) and when there are players the chat is usually filled with topics like &quot;n*zis are good&quot;, &quot;g*ys are bad&quot; and lots of r*pe jokes. New players are routinely sent to the most dangerous places in the universe or just slaughtered at supposedly safe places.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vendetta-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=5532800">Expand</a></span>

There are only 4 developers who made and are improving this game! The game is progressing nicely and they have listened to our suggestions on the forums and continue to do so. This game will constantly evolve into the best real-time space game in the MMORPG genre if it keeps going the way it is. Jumpgate is the competitor to this game and that game doesn&apos;t offer much. EVE Online is not a twitch-based game so it doesn&apos;t compare, although the graphics are nice. The critics should re-review this game when Version 2 comes out later in 2007.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vendetta-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=396329">Expand</a></span>

The ships are customizable and there is new equipment available every time you earn a level. The first ship looks like a VWbus but it was explained to me that as a free ship it has to be ugly. When I got to level 1 combat I was able to buy a cooler looking ship. It doesn?t feel like a leveling treadmill because by level 5 you have access to a lot of ships and equipment. You can go higher in levels but you don?t have to. You can develop your character any way you want. I?m a trader who does some fighting on the side. I?m hoping to join a trade guild soon. The stations are all different and the sectors have special effects. In one area everything has a purplish glow because the nearby star is very dim. The asteroids ?rock!? some even spin slowly which is a nice touch. The server seems extremely stable which is very important to an on-line game. The developers seem to listen to our suggestions on the testing forum and are always giving us new stuff to try out. The players can develop their own ideas and you don?t have to stay on a scripted path. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vendetta-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=377237">Expand</a></span>

And those that are online are rarely helpful. In game chat is often overwhelmed with toxicity between players and there is never any moderation. The developers have focused the majority of their efforts and resources on mobile and VR development instead of content and fixing bugs. Customer support is pretty lackluster as well, often met with delayed responses ranging from vague to annoyed.
<br>
<br>A surprisingly long lasting game that has always had far more potential than it has ever been able to take advantage of. Since it was released the manpower keeping it afloat has steadily shrunk and development has been almost entirely focused on satisfying various contracts with other companies to keep the lights on rather than improving gameplay, solving long standing issues, or updating and adding new content.
<br>
<br>Getting access to content in game requires incredible amounts of mind-numbing grinding which gets old very quick and is not likely to keep the average gamer interested long enough to subscribe. Those that do end up playing have fairly solitary experiences due first and foremost to the vastness of the universe, and secondarily to the low player count.
<br>
<br>Visually the game is reminiscent of the 1990s, but it can easily be ignored if you get involved in pvp. In recent years mobile players have emerged as the majority of the player base, and with them has come an increase in latency issues that have been a struggle for the developers to address.
<br>
<br>Overall worth trying, but once you do you&apos;ll quickly see why more people haven&apos;t stuck around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vendetta-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=6765110">Expand</a></span>
