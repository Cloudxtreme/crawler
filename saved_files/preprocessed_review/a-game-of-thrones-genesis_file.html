What I received was a snooze-fest of a game.  My roommate also played the game and we are in full agreement it sucks on a massive scale.  First off I&apos;ve seen better graphics on my smart phone.  The character movements are extremely slow.  The first few missions make me feel like I am Bill Murray in Groundhog&apos;s Day.  Send envoys, send spies, send assassins and repeat... ZZZZzzzzzz.  My roommate suggested I wait for a professional review and game play footage before purchasing, damn I wish I would have listened to him.  I thought how bad could it be?  I wasn&apos;t expecting cutting edge graphics and I was fine with that as long as it had a cool storyline and decent game play.  I strongly suggest that you do not purchase this game.  The graphics are very poor, the characters are absolutely tiny even when fully zoomed in.  There is little sound effects or music during game play.  I can&apos;t believe I just blew $40 on this game.  The graphics somewhat remind me of Age of Empires II which came out almost 10 years ago.  The only upside to this game is that you may catch up on sleep.  If the sheer boredom of the game does not send you into unconsciousness the ridiculous load times will.  My roommate is a huge fan of the series of books that this game is supposedly based on and he is as disgusted with it as much as I am.  That being said don&apos;t expect good graphics, good story, or good game play.  Do expect less money in your pocket and a frown on your face.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1771989">Expand</a></span>

Cyanides own forums is teeming over with people who are literally pissed off at this game for not delivering what it promised.<br>Basically what it is, is a very shallow world, if we take the HvH mode. No location or city or town got any names assigned to them. Your own capital town is called Feudal home. Very rich, very immersive. The game itself bases around gathering 100 presige points, which you have many ways to get but many fewer ways to lose. Generally speaking a game is rather short, since 100 prestige points isn&apos;t hard to achieve. When you&apos;ve got them you won, game&apos;s over byebye cya next time. The only reason they label it &quot;Brute military force is not the only way to win&quot; is because brute military force can&apos;t win the game. By the time you get to tedious wars, the game is over. The game is really a capture the node game. Start with a base, send out envoys, noble ladies, spies and god knows what, and &quot;ally&quot; surrounding towns to gain income. You send out a peasant to manage the fields and 1-2 merchants to every town and gold mine to gain money. Essentially it&apos;s just a capture the node game dressed up and labelled as something creative. Unfortunately they failed to deliver. There are no hotkeys, no way to assign armies, the minimap is rubbish and the instructions and information is either wrong or contain typos. Unlike my review, their text should be flawless, the least to expect from a company. Nonetheless it&apos;s not. You can find &quot;loose&quot; instead of &quot;lose&quot; along with information that the minimap is on the left side while it&apos;s on the right. It could&apos;ve been done so much better. In fact with a lot of tweaking it&apos;s a promising concept, just drop all the focus on the neutrals and increase the diplomacy and underhanding with the other houses. Give it a decent combat system, not combat focused, but you should atleast be able to fight your way through a game if you&apos;d like that. Add more options. For heavens sake there&apos;s not even a way to change the victory requirements in HvH.<br>No spend your money elsewhere and don&apos;t let those &quot;I rank this game 8 because I&apos;ve never played any other strategy game and I think this is kind of good&quot; fool you. There&apos;s a flood of better Strategy games out there. Europa Universalis 3, The Total War series, Civilization etc etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769958">Expand</a></span>

The skirmish mode&apos;s victory conditions can&apos;t be altered so you will lose over and over again for no apparent reason often related to your kingdoms &quot;prestige&quot; stat...bah just don&apos;t buy it it&apos;s awful. Not only because it plays and looks bad but because the books deserve far far better. hopefully someone makes a total war nock off with the promised deep political system that cyanide would have us believe is in this game, now that would be worth $40.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769382">Expand</a></span>

<br>Note: You might like it if you enjoy slow-paced strategy games with a lot of repetetiveness and little combat, but if not then you&apos;d probably be better off not spending your 40 bucks on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769408">Expand</a></span>

One can appreciate a much different approach. However, despite my intrigue A Game of Thrones just doesn&apos;t intrigue. The game is not superficial with the a song of ice and fire universe. It&apos;s clearly more of a tribute to George R.R. Martins works. Rather than a glorified immersion, which only the books (so far) can deliver. The issue isn&apos;t so much in the gameplay, be it lacking in uniqueness. No the real issue is how technically ill-fated this product is. Obvious to anyone with moderate knowledge of game design, this RTS was not ready for release. Cyanide studio attempt to create a simplistic graphical game, only hindered their programming, and localization. A great percentage of games bought simply just didn&apos;t work on systems. Be it loading, single-player or Multi-player. Cyanide studio, shouldn&apos;t be happy with how porous their release was. They&apos;ve engineered buggy video games in the past, Loki and Blood Bowl. I can personally live with a few kinks here and there, but having a product, that doesn&apos;t function for many users across the spectrum of present technology is absurd. I can live in this DRM era that we gamers have been albeit at times reluctantly pushed into. I cannot live with non-functioning, irresponsible development. Thus we have A Game of Thrones, I do hope the issues are worked within the quagmire of code lies a different take on the RTS gen. I would&apos;ve liked to have tested this product for Cyanide before it&apos;s shoddy release. 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1780256">Expand</a></span>

Did they not look at any of the books? It would of been nice, you know to have names to the towns, castles, or mines. Please don&apos;t waste your hard earned money on this game...the owner of the GoT name really needs to find a software company that will do justice for the series, unfortunately I heard the same company is also working on a RPG GoT title.......oh say it ain&apos;t so. Next time I even think of running this game I need to remember I have Civ 5...........I had to change my rating after playing this abomination longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1771973">Expand</a></span>

Martin should feel personally violated that this hunk of excrement uses the same title as his books.  Oh wait, he contributed to this?  This does not look positive for him ever finishing the series...
<br>
<br>Overall the game sucked incredibly - I sure wish steam gave refunds!</span>

You simply do not have the information you need visible when you need it. Things happen with your units, and you&apos;re never notified. It&apos;s extremely frustrating when critical unit dies, and it isn&apos;t until late in the game when you happen to notice its not where you left it, and you have no idea what happened to it.<br><br>The combat is ridiculous. For such a slow-paced game, I feel that the combat is virtually uncontrollable and even large engagements are over far too quickly. No formations, no tactics, not even the ability to actually see what&apos;s going on during a fight. Mass up a bunch of army guys and throw them at an enemy target. Hope you win. Where is the fun in that? It takes so long to get to this point that it&apos;s even more disappointing that the end-game basically turns into a roll of the dice / mash fest.<br><br>Lastly, the bugs. Oh...the bugs. Units getting permanently stuck and refusing to move. Enemy armies walking right through each other without attacking. I love it when the entire land map flashes black--really immersive. And what is up with the levels reloading from the beginning after you beat them?<br><br>Also beware - Cyanide astroturf posters - paid posters - are on Steam on Metacritic trying to game the score and convince more suckers to buy. Don&apos;t be fooled by these scum - this game is rubbish shovelware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2295182">Expand</a></span>

I was immediately smacked in the face with reality upon loading this game for the first time. First, the opening cinematics wouldn&apos;t display and the PC would just hang a black screen. This turned out to be because the game couldn&apos;t handle 1900x1200 graphics, so I had to edit the config file to disable the cinematics just to get the game to load.
<br>
<br>Upon starting the game for the first time, I was filled with nostalgia as the games graphics and feel reminded me of the original Age of Empires game from the late 90&apos;s. The graphics aren&apos;t much more up to date than that.
<br>
<br>Ignoring the look of it though, I pressed on through a bit of the campaign and a few skirmish modes, hoping that the game play would reflect something more meaningful. Unfortunately, it did not.
<br>
<br>The &quot;political intrigue&quot; that was promised is nothing more than an annoying game of cat and mouse between your Envoy, Spy, Rogue, and Assassin characters. The entire political/underhanded sub plot to the game isn&apos;t anything new or exciting, it&apos;s just a tedious boredom.
<br>
<br>The &quot;armies&quot; are made up of generic looking units who follow the typical rock paper scissors approach to combat, and the combat itself doesn&apos;t feel very satisfying. Even after a massive battle between multiple units I was left feeling disappointed. Games such as Warcraft were able to capture the frenetic pace and feel of a large scale fight, while Game of Thrones was barely able to capture my attention to them.
<br>
<br>My love for the book and TV series drove me to continue playing, in hopes of finding a bright spot in the game. In the end though, I realized I had simply wasted $40 and a whole lot of time on a game that should have been relegated to the top shelves of Wal-Mart alongside the old $10 games.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t waste your money or your time on this. The game is an injustice to the world that George RR Martin built, and a sadly outdated addition to the RTS world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769670">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t think the game-play is broken in anyway. Maybe sad enough for large battle rts fans, but that&apos;s just how the game plays, different approaches to expand and maintain your zone of influence, doesn&apos;t mean the game-play is broken.</span>

The graphics certainly could have used more attention and it could have been better programmed (sluggish mouse, no sensitivity option). All that aside it is not your typical strategy game. Actual combat seems to be the worst way to win a match. The game wants you to win by all other means possible before you result to war aka actually how things get done. A.I. isn&apos;t the greatest but multiplayer potential is huge as you will have to be truly focused to see anything comin&apos; otherwise you&apos;ll get blindsided hard. If you need a game now (holding off till skyrim and SWTOR here) go ahead and get it if you love the franchise, otherwise wait till it drops to $20 bucks its well worth that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769630">Expand</a></span>

Not to sugar-coat anything, but give this game a fair chance.  For those who do not need to have their eyes blasted from their sockets by stunning HD graphics every time they log in, this is a fun, challenging game.  The real strengths are the multiple paths to victory; Prestige is everything, and while you gain it slowly, you can also lose it very quickly depending upon your actions (breaking pacts with other Major Houses actually have consequences, unlike so many RTS&apos;s).  You need a balanced approach; diplomacy abroad, marriages at home, eyes and ears on everything.  The game does a fine job of not telling you when you&apos;ve been duped: something I say &quot;bravo!&quot; to Cyanide for.  If someone pulls the rug from under one of your alliances, you not only don&apos;t get notified, but the game will continually feed you inaccurate POV information.  If one of your assassins gets bought out, you have no idea that the person he just &quot;killed&quot; for you is still alive and well; they vanished from the screen, so why give it another thought?  Now, there are things that could be better; AI tends to be a bit too direct at times, and gives up too easily on certain challenges when they just need to try a different approach.  Also, the sluggish mouse can make gameplay frustrating when you need to be keeping track of multiple things quickly.  The lack of hotkeys can slow-down players used to high-speed swarming, but sorry, you&apos;ll not be winning this game in the first 2 minutes.  The slow building process and only one spawn point are on purpose; you have to make hard choices about what to develop and when.  You can&apos;t have it all, no matter what you were told as children.  That said, the game is by no means sluggish; the full 8-player map of Westeroes has so far taken just around 30 minutes after 5 plays (3 wins, 2 losses).  So I say here what anyone should already know; READ up on what you are buying.  Understand the game before you get it and then don&apos;t be shocked that it isn&apos;t what you &quot;expected.&quot;  I don&apos;t think this will be wildly popular, but for those who are looking for something unique and are fans of the books, GoT:Genesis has more pros than cons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769664">Expand</a></span>

Personally I like this game because of how different it is. You have to use deception and a little more skill in order to win. I agree that the graphics are not what they could be but I think this game still has its own unique beauty to it. The one place that I believe this game is going to shine at is the multiplayer. Overall this game does have some issues that hopefully they will patch up in the future but if you go into it and play the game for what it is and not for what you wanted it to be you will enjoy it. Also pardon any spelling and grammer errors in this I typed it up in a hurry while at work because I could not stand all the negative reviews on a game that is not as bad as they make it look to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769773">Expand</a></span>

War generally only happens after scheming and plotting have been done, finding out you have been betrayed and theres a town right by you can be a serious shock. I played this game with my roommate last night and it seems to have some good multiplayer replay value. HOWEVER its not for you RTS junkies that need to kill kill kill nor is it for suped up action junkies. Its not all about war and more about diplomacy. People who enjoy board games (as I do) will be impressed by the prestige points system and how quickly a game can go (jesus christ how does he have the most amount of aliances)<br><br>worth the 40 bucks for me</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769478">Expand</a></span>

The AI isn&apos;t that great but if you have friends to play with then you can expect very fun skirmishes and intriguing plots. Graphics are generally good though it lacks in combat animations and it has quite long loading times. The Campaign is varied and the story is compelling. Overall I think this game will be really liked by those who don&apos;t really mind the slower game play of a Grand strategy game mixed with RTS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1770701">Expand</a></span>

I should also point out that I have never read the books, nor have I watched the series, so I have zero predetermined biased opinions of what I would expect from the game, and unlike most other strategy games Ive played, I actually found the story in this one to be rather interesting. There is little I can say that is bad about this game, you can see that tonnes and tonnes of thought went into the mechanics and to accommodate different playstyles, but with all this aside, there is something there I just cannot put my finger on. Balance is perfect between the different units, with most units having multiple functions. Here is where it lost another point for me though. There is just toooo much going on sometimes.. you need lots of units to be efficient, but then you end up having to directly control nearly all of those units individually to get what you want done, there was sooo many times that many of my guys would just be forgotten because I was too busy preparing a bribe on a wandering envoy while trying to assasinate a noble lady so I could influence village with my spy and to be efficient, you need to be doing this in 6 different areas all the while making sure no-one is using underhand tactics on yourself! A more automated option would be nice for some units (Rogues bribing nearby wandering envoys for example) akin to the assassins ambush would help to improve the illusion of life within the game. After a while I got bored because really I was only using one or two units to play trying to be sneaky with them when I *know* I could have been doing so much more.
<br>
<br>The other thing I found is once war has begun, it cannot end, a nice ebb and flow to the game would have been for the war &quot;timer&quot; to increase with the hostilities, and then have some way for it to decrease over time again taking you back to a peaceful era. I felt that you invested so much time and effort into the peace time units only to have them rendered absolutely useless in war left me disapointed and also left me thinking &quot;why didnt I just use all my resources on military and just kill stuff from the get go?&quot; The answer to that question by the way is because the peace time gameplay IS a lot of fun and very sneaky.. just that war can be initiated at ANY time, which makes peope who prefer to play that way losing out big time.
<br>
<br>With all this being said about Graphics etc etc bad etc etc.. no.. no they are not the best.. but the mechanics, and the gameplay, in the right hands, have the potential to open up a whole new genre of strategy games.. oh yeah.. and with a few animation tweaks, it would have been fine..
<br>
<br>So in the end, One point gone for bad animations, another gone for somehow making me bored by giving me toooo many things to do, and another point gone for repetitive sound effects.. theres only so many times you can listen to your Assassin say &quot;Im sorry&quot; before you feel like slapping him in chains for sympathising with the enemy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776528">Expand</a></span>

The true depth of this game will be found in multiplayer and if a strong base is found here the game will deliver its moneys worth. If like me you are not much of a multiplayer strategy gamer, it is a diversion that really is worth about $20 not the $40 its been charged at currently, If you like multiplayer RTS games then this could be the game for you as it is unlike most strategy games out there as going to war is the wrong way to win the game.....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-game-of-thrones-genesis/user-reviews?user_review_id=1816986">Expand</a></span>

If that gives you the impression that it&apos;s got deep strategy, I apologize, it&apos;s really not.  Repetitive and needlessly confusing is a better description.  It&apos;s got a terrible UI and hard to read font that make learning everything extremely difficult.  There is some lore there which is interesting enough, but if you&apos;re looking for lore, just read the books a fifth time.

Bad aspects are immense graphics in combat and combat in general with no opportunities to develop any type of specific tactic or strategy, but since the game is focusing on intrigues you mostly win or lose before combat even begins.</span>

The game doesnt really look like Westeros.. if you want a real strategy game based on song of ice and fire, play Westeros: Total War mod of M2:TW-Kingdoms. The alpha version is out and they are bringing something new to the previews every weekend!</span>
