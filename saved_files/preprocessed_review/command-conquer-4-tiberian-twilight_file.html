Since EA took over with Generals and Zero Hour (which was okay but had no cut-scenes) they have done nothing but ruin the game, When they released C&amp;C3 and Kanes Wrath I thought WOW they have actually hit themselves over the head and made it feel more original , which did well I was not so keen on RA3 really it was okay but not as good as RA2. With C&amp;C4 however i don&apos;t have a clue what they were thinking although a brave move I feel they have failed terribly this game totally ruins the concept of C&amp;C possibly one of the best RTS Sagas of all time I&apos;m very dissapointed with my purchase, But I am going to try and get used to it and see if I can enjoy it in anyway. Now for die hard C7C fan out there I would recommend not bothering honestly your missing nothing, As for EA they seriously need to rethink what they are doing bring back the old WestWood team and let them show you how its done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747426">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is so vastly different from any other C&amp;C game it might as well not be related at all. The idea of &quot;counter&quot; units takes a fairly basic element of previous games and dumbs it down to a level where all tactics are removed. And the story? all i can say is what story? Kane seems to have undergone a personality transplant, ignoring every goal he&apos;s ever worked for in the past in an effort to &quot;ascend&quot;, although what this ascension is nobody knows as the endings make absolutely no sense at all. Honestly if this is how EA are going to treat such a long running and massively popular series I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever buy another of their games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747402">Expand</a></span>

The idiot and boring storytelling, also the idiot and boring story, the missing base building and management, the missing resource management and also the missing of the money are killing this game. You have only 1 &quot;building&quot; (called &quot;Crawler&quot;) that can move like a big robot. You can choose from 3 Crawler types: Defensive, Attacking and Support. I think it&apos;s a total idiot idea, because you have nothing to defend. Only the Crawler maybe, but you can call another Crawler to the battlefield anytime if you want (in Singleplayer). After you deploy your Crawler, you can train/build your units for nothing. Yes, for nothing. There is no money in the game. Just click on the icon of the wanted unit and wait until it&apos;s ready. I think the developers wanted a game like Dawn of War 2. But hey, DoW2 is a real-time strategy with a huge tactical part (e.g. cover system). Where is this tactical part in C&amp;C4? Nowhere! The multiplayer/skirmish has the same problem. It wanted to be like in DoW2 or Company of Heroes&apos;s &quot;capture the big outposts to win&quot; mode. But it&apos;s not work in this game. After the amazing C&amp;C3, it&apos;s a big rubish. I can only say: don&apos;t buy this game, if you want a good strategy. If you are a masochist, maybe it&apos;s your game.

The game play is total **** You can make good game without base management (DoW II), but in this case its total garbage and Command and Conquer is 50% about base building. In compare to tiberian sun of even tiberian wars this game is total WtF.</span>

The acting is ludicrous and the story leaves giant holes in the plot. The complete lack of effort in making a true end to the series was lost and cannot be rebuilt. The game itself has positive elements, albeit experimental ones, but in the end it could have been a success as a separate gaming series. The kick in the face is that after all the waiting and great previous stories, we are left with a blemish on the name of an otherwise exemplary series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746924">Expand</a></span>

This sequel completely guts those elements, but you don&apos;t find that out until after you&apos;ve bought it. What a horrible, truly pathetic end to the series. It only even gets 1 point due to having Kain in it. Were it not for that, I&apos;d have rated it a 0.</span>

You don&apos;t have to manage ressources, base construction or anything like that, just your units, their placement and checking they target the good ennemies when you send them somewhere to defend an area.
<br>
<br>The cutscenes that make the game story are a complete failures in three points, most actors are bland and don&apos;t give a real life to their characters, and the dialogs are a total mess. Also their is the slight fact that they did not bother to try to make their . You&apos;re in 2077 ,laser and EM weapons have existed in your universe for more than 40 years (tiberian sun happened in 2034) and you still use the most basic of handguns to escape jail.
<br>
<br>The storyline completely went over the Scrin Invasion presented in the tiberium wars secret campaign and Kane&apos;s wrath ending to just focus on Kane ascending.
<br>
<br>In short, the changes in gameplay are an attempt to fix something that was never broken. The changes in the story are an attempt to make you forget there was 3 playable armies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872399">Expand</a></span>

It likely started as a different project, but the suits quickly realized the only way they&apos;d make their money back was to slap a more familiar name on the box. Sadly there is so much more wrong with this game it&apos;s hard to know where to start.
<br>
<br>Firstly, there is no base construction, which is kind of a big thing in Command &amp; Conquer. Some poor chap probably had the innocent idea of making an RTS/MOBA hybrid, but the way this was executed here is a disaster. The gameplay is simply not fun. At all. The controls are sloppy, you are limited to only several units at a time, and the horrible graphics don&apos;t help. In fact the graphics are so bad you can hardly distinguish between your own units. Fun fact: the graphics are actually worse than the previous game, Command &amp; Conquer 3, released three years earlier. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE EA?
<br>
<br>To top it all off, the levels are all dull and the story is downright boring. The campy video narration between each mission was the highlight of previous Command &amp; Conquer games. But not here. Like the rest of this game, the video clips look cheap and uninspired. Even the sexy girls are gone in this one. Guess they wouldn&apos;t go anywhere near this stinker. Kane is left facing off against a stereotypical angry old fat woman. That is pretty much the extent of the cast. I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. EA clearly spent more money buying off critics than they did on the making of this atrocity. There is a reason the entire dev team got fired shortly after releasing this game, and good riddance. You know you have problems when your product doesn&apos;t measure up to EA&apos;s standards. But it also means this pile of crap will not be receiving any more bug fixes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3418793">Expand</a></span>

It corrupts every single aspect of what is recognisable about Command and Conquer and has a twist ending that just does not work in any way, shape or form. They created a weird DotA clone with even less involvement than aforementioned game with none of the excitement or entertainment value of any of the previous games.
<br>
<br>This ending to the series was not earned, well designed or properly executed and just shows EA up for how disrespectful of the very people they are marketing their games to are. If you find anyone who actually thinks this is a worthy finish to the series, immediately force them to play through every previous game until they see sense.
<br>
<br>The only good thing I will say is that it provides a much needed variation on the standard &quot;which side will you choose?&quot; format, but even that is only a slightly positive thing to say, because it initially forces you into the position of a GDI member instead of fully exploring the possibilities of who you will side with and why?
<br>
<br>Oh, and to everyone saying that change needs to be embraced, you need to recognise the difference between change and the complete redesign of something to the point where it ceases to follow a format that, whilst not perfect was certainly not broken in any way shape or form, and is instead a DotA/Dawn of War 2 rip-off. Furthermore, they&apos;ve always been changing things here and there, but at the very core it has kept the same format of resource collection, force building and variation in unit types, with super weapons when you wanna be extra-nasty. Lastly: it&apos;s an old franchise which many people, including myself, would have grown up playing and are why we&apos;re hardcore gamers today. I was 6 when the first game came out and I played it way back then. People are going to be a little upset over a company saying &quot;we couldn&apos;t care less about a franchise that is the core reason you&apos;re a returning customer and help keep us fed, we just want to turn out an ineffectual finalisation to something we have blatant disregard for&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3481010">Expand</a></span>

After you do connect back you still have to play the same mission again.
<br>
<br>There is no balance in this game at all because you can win every situation if you just have a nod cyber commando, you can hack into any unit and steal it. After it is destroyed your commando will come out of the wreckage and you can hack into another unit and same goes on and on as long as you stay patient. I just uninstalled the game after seeing too much of this crap.
<br>
<br>This is not even suitable as alpha stage game and the game is broken and will screw up your windows desktop so be ready to put all your icons as they were after you quit the game unless you play full resolution. If you decide to change audio settings the game will crash and so will your windows 7 probably. This must be a joke. This is malware not a game. Not even a bloat ware it&apos;s a real malware that does more damage to your computer than any other crap out there. After playing this I have to restart my computer or try to do a few things to fix my Ethernet connection because the game screws it up so I can&apos;t use internet after playing it. Sounds lot like a malware to me. Take note that this never happens with any other game or software on my computer so my conclusion is to uninstall the &quot;product&quot;.  Please do not pay for this in any circumstances.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4517320">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, how do you mess up Command and Conquer SO badly? On top of all that, they&apos;ve made the unit designs look worse. The sleek and dangerous looking stealth tank from C&amp;C3 is now a blocky, over-sized mess. As I&apos;ve said, no more base building. Instead, you have one mobile command center that produces all of your units. Now if the units and their strategies were more sophisticated, this might have worked. But no. Instead all you have to do is produce a mix of units (which takes about 1 minute) and send them after the enemy. This is even more boring than it sounds.

Their &apos;play online&apos; only (even in single player) is a complete rip off. Whatever you do, don&apos;t buy this game! Don&apos;t reward EA&apos;s bad behavior by giving them your hard earned money. If it sells poorly enough, hopefully they&apos;ll get the message.</span>

The unit cap is so low that even the pc version feels like a limiting console release from 4 years ago, they did it better in C&amp;C3 than they did in 4 which surely says to me that EA seem to learn nothing from the community and decide to just completely ignore it except when it serves their purposes. The only thing that made me buy this game was to finally see a conclusion to the Tiberium universe&apos;s story and even then I&apos;m having to grin and bare each and every mission just to get to the next cutscene.

Thanks for nothing and thanks for ruining a great franchise with over 15 years in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746794">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is pathetic. Each campaign takes at *most* 5 hours to play through and is 7 missions long (after the 3 tutorial missions). Gameplay is as far away from C&amp;C as it could possibly be. It is Real Time Tactical, not RTS. They took gameplay points from multiple games and mashed them together without realizing what makes it work for those other games. The units are almost all rehashed from the rest of the series (event the Mammoth Mk II from Tiberian Sun). There are no actors that you can recognize in the game outside of Joe Kucan. This game smacks of least effort possible and feels like less than a quarter of a full game. Don&apos;t waste your money on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746867">Expand</a></span>

The skirmish mode, while rigid in some areas does allow for some new and interesting tactical decisions with a much greater emphasis on teamwork and larger battles. The crawler idea in itself in interesting and the option are relatively fresh to keep me interested in playing this. All I have to tell myself is that EA accidentally named this a CNC game instead of a brand new franchise. Taking it as a CNC, the game is riddled with faults. The fact that you have to be online to play is extremely frustrating if you&apos;re more of a single player person who&apos;s in it for the conclusion of the epic Tiberium arc, which, to be honest was a complete and utter let down. The campaigns for both side are horrendously short and fail to meet the standards set by CNC games past. Even Kane himself seem to only be pulling out a half arsed job. So much for an epic conclusion. In addition, the unlocking mechanic is brutal on newer players, who don&apos;t have the arsenal at their disposal to take on two other NPCs with essentially a Tier 1 unit spam, almost to the point of forcing co-op play. Indeed, for Skirmish mission, the lack of level matching means that a completely new player and his lvl 1 GDI offense crawler gets his ass handed to him by the lvl 20 Nod player. The fact that in Skirmish you can no longer be GDI vs GDI etc. is also a major ball ache. While I can appreciate what the devs were trying to pull off, something new and relatively innovative, they should have left the last of the Tiberium saga alone with the old mechanics. The story explains why all the tib is receding, but that doesn&apos;t mean you couldn&apos;t have used a RA3 style mechanic of having tib mines or something. The lack of a proper harvester in a CNC RTS game? Come on guys, seriously? If you&apos;re new to the franchise, I&apos;d suggest giving it a look and renting it, as there are some good ideas, but if you&apos;re a die hard, probably best to stay away. As a game: 7 As the ending to an epic story arc or a well established franchise: 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747088">Expand</a></span>

I loved Red Alert and Red Alert 2 for game play was amazing! Generals i continue to play to this date for it has what the other C&amp;Cs had and quite enjoyed building bases where ever I wanted. C&amp;C3 i enjoyed and had amazing graphics to go with the game and the fine addition of the Scrin to the game i liked and is my favorite team (GDI mammoth tanks are cool though). I started to get dissapointed in EA starting C&amp;C Red Alert 3, I thought the graphics were way too cartoony and everything was sized wrong and just out of wack. The gameplay of having coop for missions i didnt find interesting at all for where the stragey in that? You can have a weak player with a strong player and he never learn a thing. C&amp;C is a game of skill and cunning not a game of follow the leader. Then came C&amp;C4 now that was a total let down. Having to be online when espically i live in the county where high-speed net is slow so game is slow for me. Supreme Commander 2 a game that game out pretty much at the same time has far better graphics then this crap. The textures in C&amp;C4 are off and i could make most of these wannabe tanks in seconds on Maya. As a C&amp;C fan and as a animator i say the graphics really sucked but were slightly better then RA3 (that is all i can give the credits for it). I got better graphics playing Final Fantasy Crisis Core on my PSP then C&amp;C4. What a let down that is. Story line for campaigns was too short and pointless. Anyone who gives this above a 4 either hasn&apos;t played to many video games or done any animation. The game wasn&apos;t worth it and i seen free RTS game look better and have a better game flow. Level caps are fine for some games but C&amp;C was renown for not having the caps and just letting the players pick their style of gameplay. The new pick your command unit play thing limits the players to their playing styles and prevents them from expressing. They should have kept it with the orginal game play or gone down the road of Generals game play. All i can say is that i hope they make C&amp;C Generals 2 but without changing the gameplay. All they should do is update the graphics to be more current and add new units but keep the old. They should add new countries and Generals to the series such as Britian, Russia, and Canada for a change. Make it more like Red Alert style Generals where each country has something unique. Combine what worked in the previous games not combine different style of popular games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746997">Expand</a></span>

Mandatory online registration (even as single player, having paid your money) to play a game that has NOTHING to do with the CQ franchise (except the pointless &apos;movies&apos;). EA have reduced a strategic army-building-with-resources-and-defence to a run around the map with a squad (twelve units max, six typical... and this is CQ?) to some pointless sites, which you can neither defend nor retain--- because of course you&apos;re not allowed to build in CQ4 - or gather resources - or acquire an army - or combine defence, offence and air... or do anything like either a &apos;pseudo-real&apos; army (combined ops with multiple units) or the original CQ franchise. Never has a game so destroyed a franchise - just as well it was the final one in the &apos;series&apos;. EA has just lost my vote for RA3 (cartoon nonsense) and CQ4 (pointless squad rush - without the &apos;rational&apos; gameplay of DOW).

Only having the ability to command a handful of units, not being able to establish a real &apos;base&apos; and fighting AI that doesnt have to worry about command points and pumps out endless streams of units is just dumb.

I grew up on it. I was about in 5th grade when the original came out. I just feel an overwhelming need to scream this from my nearest mountain top: This game is garbage! This series basically gave a face to the entire RTS genre and then dissapeared into what would be the you and me equivalent of a brain fart. First of all, massive online multiplayer experiences are exactly what a gamer is running away from when he plays an RTS game. An RTS is a game that lets you snack whilst playing. A game that lets you half pay attention to a Family Guy episode, and half pay attention to it. You can dissapear into thought while playing an RTS. Mainly, you scheme, plan, hoard, and amass an army that will, when unleashed, dominate. This is a frustrating instinct to have going into CnC4, but not by any means an unreasonable one. They bred us to be like this. Then, in the last $%#^@ inning, they switch the batting order? No.... they start playing soccer? The game is called Tiberium Twighlight, but theres no........ Tiberium? wait, isn&apos;t this the game with the Tiberium? You have an MCV... a good old MCV, ah, wait.... is it getting up? and.... walking into battle? Who at EA actually had the power and inclination to sit down, focus on the series, and say to his inferiors, &quot;you know what this base-building, unit-generating, strategy-forming game needs? No bases, meaningless and endless units, and no strategy beyond click click click, with no economy, troop limits (my favorite! who doesn&apos;t like troop limits?) and no INCENTIVE to keep playing because your presence on the map can never get any bigger than the paltry limit so why would you command or conquer anything?&quot; If they told Romulus after he brained Remus that, yea, he could start the Roman Empire, but it would never be any bigger than 100 command points, would have no structures, would be born out of this awkwardly gigantic crawling headquarters that is made more vaulnerable by the fact that you have to bring it with you (like an Ipad!), the music would suck, the graphics wouldn;t be any better than the last game, nobody would ever have to economize anything, ever, Kane would somehow not have aged at all in 15 years, you&apos;d sometimes have to play as a class of units that basically just repairs stuff, and the lame single player story mode includes YOU (the player) having a GIRLFRIEND, well, then I reckon Romulus would have just dropped that blood-soaked rock and sauntered off, disinterested. This I sadly do, too. This game sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747196">Expand</a></span>

Every single concept in this game from the units and graphics down to the HUD display on this game are just a series of asbolute atrocities. For starters, the graphics and unit models in this game are appaling to look at. This game looks like it was designed to be played on Windows 98. Second off, EA has somehow arrived at the conclusion that C&amp;C fans are tired of mining resources, micromanaging, base building, and overall just having fun while playing a game. EA blatantly tries to steal the Dawn of War II playstyle (1 building that produces units) and then bungles that by forgetting one of the key components that every RTS should contain, resource management. There is 0 resource gathering. None. Zippo. You and your opponent just take turns spamming out as many units as you can (about 10 on the field at a time, maximum) and then just walk them over to the enemy base and let them shoot poorly animated projectiles until they die. More importantly, the Nod and GDI tech trees are almost identical. The only real difference in the two sides is the unit colors, because almost every vehicle or soldier on one side has a perfectly corresponding counterpart on the other. Words cannot describe what an atrocity this game is. The live acting cut scenes (every true C&amp;C fan has been wetting their pants watching the trailers with Kane ever since this game&apos;s launch date was announced) are pretty much the only thing that return unscathed. The bottom line I&apos;m trying to make here is that this game is bad. Not redeemable, not fawed, not a &quot;game with potential limited by some design errors&quot;, just B-A-D. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not a fan of RTS games and should be shot for suggesting this abortion of a title to you. All of this is not even taking into account the fact that the game has EA&apos;s classic paranoid DRM policy that requires you to be online while you play the game. That&apos;s right, if you don&apos;t have an internet connection, you aren&apos;t playing this game. Period. Anyone remember how well that worked out for Mercenaries 2, another title EA managed to crap all over with their anti pirating ideas? If this game was offered to me for half the price I would still turn it down. Anyone who supports what EA has done to this franchise is delusional, and more importantly, part of the problem that allows games like this to be created.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747216">Expand</a></span>

For me, the story of the C&amp;C (Tiberian Universe) has been one of the more involving and high draw factors for the series. Given that the acting tends to be on the soap opera side of the spectrum it would take a significant amount of effort from the developers to actually make me want to skip the cut scenes. Enter Command And Conquer 4, stage left. In the previous title(s) C&amp;C3 (and the expansion Kane&apos;s Wrath) the story arc builds towards a climax hinted at coming into it&apos;s full glory in the next (read: this) title. To be honest, NONE of the back story in the previous title(s) has ANYTHING to do with this game. At all. Where they could have picked up an actually interesting plot line and fleshed it out, building on and improving where it was leading towards, all that was accomplished was what seems like an afterthought to an already afterthought game. To say that this title makes the characters from the previous EA C&amp;C amazingly enthralling and exciting is just an example of how horribly bad the writers did on this title. They dump you into the middle of a series of events that are NEVER EXPLAINED, offer you questions that shouldn&apos;t have even been introduced in the first place, and COMPLETELY REMOVE any tie-in to the previous title. This game was marketed, presented, and wrapped with a single message given to us, the gamers and loyal fans of the series: This is the endgame for the Tiberian story line. We did not need much in terms of story. Nor did we demand anything but at least meeting the bar set by the last title in the series RELEASED BY EA GAMES. This game is not a Command And Conquer title as I view them, and I can not rate it above a 0 for the absolute failure on EA&apos;s part to even remotely represent the spirit of the franchise. Come on EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746940">Expand</a></span>

C&amp;C4 is a glorified capture the flag and does nothing for anyone who actually liked C&amp;C to begin with. I played C&amp;C from the start, and I say now with total certainty that this is no way to end it.This game is a horrible, shallow attempt at cloning concepts popular from DOW2 and similar titles. I will never legally purchase this game, not even if it was in the $5 bargin bin. I will always beleive the way C&amp;C should have ended is with a time travel experiment to stop the tiberium in the first place, and thus stopping the scrin AND forming the Red Alert Universe. Which was the orignal ending planned. It is a shame that EA feels like it had to ruin such an awesome series with such a poorly done attempt to gain the users of DOW2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746974">Expand</a></span>

I got into the hype on C&amp;C4 watching the game trailers. I sat there day after day watching the website count down to the release. I had the game preordered the minute I could apply on line. RTS is my favorite gaming genre and I have played every C&amp;C title since the original. Ever since EA took over the franchise from Westwood studios, all the games in this series have been lacking. Each ones seems to miss the original elements that made these RTS, C&amp;C, C&amp;C:Red Alert, different from the others. Generals was terrible, RA3 and C&amp;C3 seemed like EA hit copy + paste and re-skinned the units. Westwood took time on their games. Each one was new in multiple ways, from gameplay to graphics, story, etc. Even though the games changed they held the core values of what it was to be an RTS in the style that Westwood created. EA makes sports games, they copy + paste all of their work. Why they tried to make an RTS is beyond me. They lack the talent and technical skills to pull it off successfully. What&apos;s done is done, it&apos;s a terrible game and we are left with nothing new to play. I just hope the &quot;developers&quot; of this monstrosity realize that they failed and their game really, really &quot;sucks&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747067">Expand</a></span>

I can understand that the format was getting old (even though I personally still enjoyed it) and that some went so far as to consider it &apos;dated&apos; - I could even understand it if they had changed the &apos;old&apos; format in a way which was original and corresponded with the rest of the series. However, the way in which they have so blatantly ripped off Dawn of War and other RTS &apos;rivals&apos; is unbelievable. I don&apos;t even really think that those sort of games are rivals, most of the people I know into strategy games play both, and for different reasons! To make things worse, the only redeeming features that this game actually has are the ones robbed from these other games, which leaves not much to praise in C&amp;C4. I&apos;m sorry Ea, but you&apos;ve murdered and raped (in that order) a wonderful game.

When westwood created the original back in 1995, they revolutionised RTS. They layed the base core of what all RTS games needed. Tiberiun sun expanded on this, and EA again expanded further, whislt also angering its community with shoddy balancing and too many changes of what was considered the norm. Having to seemingly not listen to the community, despite saying they have, they then release Kanes Wrath, which was essentially, what C&amp;C should have been in terms of gameplay. Having once again displeased the community again with lack of patches and securom causing ALOT of system formats due to major issues with it, they now release C&amp;C 4, which is nothing like the previous games. Just because the game references tiberium and uses it in a majorly poor way, has Kane, and has old units (that look totally different), does not make a game deserve the Command and Conquer title. This game should have been scrapped at the start and make how the people wanted it. EA, a company so narrow minded it seems, that they only care about the money, not what the people actually want. I do feel sorry for Joe Kucan who is basically the star of the whole series being sent out in such a poor, poor way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746742">Expand</a></span>

Even as an RTS it literally forces you to grind for hours for you to get the units you want, twice, as NOD and GDI have seperate experience bars. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible.</span>

Are you too ***** cheap to have a collectors edition and color manual... maybe a paper cover for the DVD case. The game-play is terrible and not a part of the RTS genre. Its more of a sub-play mode that focus on tactics and small groups of units. It&apos;s ALWAYS fast paste with simple tactics and no real strategy. The combat looks like toy cars fighting one another. A lot of the units feel the same, they have no individual kick. What happened to tiberium covering the world, why is tiberium chunks collected from platforms? EA took ideas from other games with no understanding as to how they work within their game mechanics and created this crap of game with C&amp;C art. If I where to compare this game play as more like a Demigods game to supreme commander. The Missions are weak because of a lack of good story telling, EA really... 30 sec mission and character introductions? The leveling system is stupid for single player, missions are not designed around new abilities gained by the player because you can unlock units from multi-player and use them in any mission. Cant EA design missions that will teach us how to use each base type and unit formation? Both the managers and designers should be fired for this disgrace of a game! Maybe then they&apos;ll have some time to play a real RTS like Star Craft 2. I wish Blizzard had the IP for C&amp;C. They would had talent and business sense to make a great game that sells because its great. NOT WORTH BUYING, I hope all the good designers in EA wont support this poor equal brand anymore and leave Electronic Junk!!! and let the manager and share holders who call the shots, drowning in this sinking ship. Stop buying and destroying good IP!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746951">Expand</a></span>

EA took a mish-mash of styles from other games, bundled them all into this game (poorly) and slapped the Command and Conquer badge on it. In the process losing the entire formula that makes a typical C&amp;C game. * Want base building? - You&apos;re not finding it here! * Want resource harvesting? - Again, no such luck. * Want to be treated like a loyal customer rather than a potential pirate? - Nope, flat out of luck. The game requires that you log into EA&apos;s servers before it lets you even play single player. EA have basically used and abused the C&amp;C brand to try and push their attempt at something new. The end result, a failure of a game that lets down the C&amp;C fans, and isn&apos;t strong enough to stand on it&apos;s own right. Very disappointing for the final game in the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746999">Expand</a></span>

A lot of the strategy of the game is taken away when you can only build no more then 20 units, and don&apos;t have to worry about resources. Also, the stupid crawler/mcvs are overpowered and add a lot of pointless BS requirements to missions. I actually think the single player is broken becuase the missions really only have 1-2 ways of completing them successful, not multiple paths to victory like in old C&amp;C games. In addition, taking away the ability to build both offensive units, defensive units, support units and buildings at the same time make the actual planning and strategy of the game on a super low level. This game is a serious disappointment, I want Westwood studios back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747300">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t even bloody zoom in or out in this game, you can&apos;t build bases, you cant send your individual units into cover, you send an army straight at an enemy and sit there for a bit just watching them shoot eachother... The most notable mess-up I noticed was at the very beginning, after I started thinking &quot;This kinda sucks, when does base building and army massing and good graphics come in?&quot;; Escorting Kane to wherever-it-was and being faced with three Obelisks of Light and thinking &quot;I only have nine tanks... what the hell am I going to do?&quot;. Not only did I make it, I didn&apos;t lose a single bloody tank, whereas in the others, a single Obelisk is able to batter an army around. WHY EA didn&apos;t feel the need to Beta test this game to see how people would react is beyond me. It&apos;s a simple bloody thing to show someone something and ask for their opinion. At the very least they could have asked the makers of Dawn of War 2 for a bloody hint since they tried fairly hard to have the same form of gameplay. Worst waste of $50.00, and I mourn the loss of what was supposed to be an epic games triumphant conclusion, but hey, at least EA got their money, why should they care?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746698">Expand</a></span>

The game designers especially should be prevented from writing any further games yet this won&apos;t happen and they themselves will carry on believing that they&apos;re good at their job.

If you are happy deploying no more than twelve vehicles at a time, then this is the game for you. The story line is weak and leaves alot to be desired, but the options given to the player to choose their future is very reminiscent of the early C&amp;C titles. The handful of excellent features (such as the arsenal tab before every mission) are far outweighed by the tiny scope of the battles, the poor balance for the units, and the silly limitations placed upon the player by both command points and &quot;crawlers&quot;. It is a sad end to the C&amp;C series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=747416">Expand</a></span>

I hate EA and am going to boycott all their games due to their lack of interest (respect) in the people who played and loved the original C&amp;C game.</span>

I can understand that the format was getting old (even though I personally still enjoyed it) and that some went so far as to consider it &apos;dated&apos; - I could even understand it if they had changed the &apos;old&apos; format in a way which was original and corresponded with the rest of the series. However, the way in which they have so blatantly ripped off Dawn of War and other RTS &apos;rivals&apos; is unbelievable. I don&apos;t even really think that those sort of games are rivals, most of the people I know into strategy games play both, and for different reasons! To make things worse, the only redeeming features that this game actually has are the ones robbed from these other games, which leaves not much to praise in C&amp;C4. I&apos;m sorry Ea, but you&apos;ve murdered and raped (in that order) a wonderful game.

A small list of problems: - Animations *The Walker animations (you spin on the spot? but yet the mastedon correctly walks around) *Oversized and ugly air planes.... *Fat units. - The pacing of the combat feels too rushed..... everything fires at a thousand miles an hour or too slowly I&apos;ve a long time fan of the C&amp;C series, but this feels like it was made for small kids, the only saving grace is at least the acting and the cut scenes are better. Please get the management and original team who made C&amp;C 3 back and sort this game out with a patch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746861">Expand</a></span>

I invested about 5 or 6 hours into playing this game and honestly want my money back. The game is nothing a C&amp;C game should be, As a new franchise it could be quite respectable. However, the game is not a new franchise, it was advertised as a C&amp;C4 game and it failed miserably. The game has no economy, very simplistic strategy and no lasting consequences to poor decisions. The extent of the strategy in this game is how fast can you change your queue of units to build the unit that counters the units used to counter your units. Since there is no cost for building units, there is no value on any unit you build. The game is a C&amp;C game, and therefore there are certain elements people expect from the game, out of which non are present. The storyline is also a huge dissapointment, the missions are bland and simple and the storyline is just terrible. Kane has no evil left in him pretty much, he has just gone soft with age i guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746834">Expand</a></span>

Moving a hulking unit around to puke out a very limited number of units is not an RTS game. What were you thinking, we need money but we don&apos;t want to spend any to get it? How about a refund or give me a game worth $50.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746885">Expand</a></span>

Like they tried to breed Ground Control and Dawn of War together and failed. I will only be getting it once it is really cheap to play the SP. Rating it 5 because it still good in some peoples&apos; eyes but being a fan of the series as a whole... made me cry.</span>

I own every single CC game ever released, even the Red Alert counterparts, and all the expansions. Now, I wish my die-hard self would had died before CC4. Let&apos;s start by saying that I have spent triple the amount of time in the in game chat than playing the actual game. Half of that time has been helping the players with problems, be it graphical issues, connection issues, etc. This list goes on and on about issues. Second, the first couple days after release I would hop online every couple hours. I amassed some statistics that I will be compiling into a youtube video. ( I may use this for a Statistic project for a class in college) The first day of release, 89% of all messages into the chatbox were negative comments about the game. That total is the average of 5 different &quot;General Chat&quot; lobbies. Most of which had dozens of negative comments the second I joined. One room I asked who wanted their money back and 11 responded YES I want my money back, remember, that is one room, one incident. EA tried to fix something that wasn&apos;t broken. The result, yes, they broke it. They modified the game out of corporate greed thinking that original fans of CC will like and at the same time they could draw in fans of World in Conflict, Dawn of War II, etc. The result, CC fans are absolutely furious, as well as no additional fans being drawn in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746806">Expand</a></span>

We knew it would come one day, but never in such a large kick to the face. This game has nothing to do with any other C&amp;C release. The mechanics are a total guess work, with next to no relationship to any other branch of the C&amp;C world. Being a C&amp;C player from release day 1, i await each release on the edge of my seat. I am aware that there are different &quot;branches&quot; of C&amp;C, with Red Alert often being the most confusing, but still within it&apos;s design scope. This release and &quot;final&quot; chapter to the Tiberium series is just pure vomit. Tiberium Sun is the single best release for the Tiberium range. I bought Tiberium Twilight at 1:37pm AEST on Steam. I deleted it from Steam at 4:44pm AEST. Thank you EA you have destroyed and crippled the worlds most important founding gaming franchise.

That coupled with my friend&apos;s utter lack of satisfaction with the game led me to write this review. Mind you, I was introduced to C&amp;C back around the Red Alert era and I was instantly a fan. It was the, straight up, perfect balance between base building and offensive strategy. Every other game tries to make that one original masterpiece better by adding new things to it but it fails to notice the simplicity in mind when the game was made. If a game has too few components, lacking the basics, it soon becomes the lowest piece of garbage on the market. And if a game has several brilliant concepts and excellent ideas to it but not enough refining, *cough*Stormrise*cough*, then it fails as well. Now, when you take a game that sticks to the standard and tradition style of gameplay that it always had done in the past, a.k.a. unit production, build tabs, researching upgrades, and totally switch it over, you have to understand that there WILL be massive drawbacks. I usually end these on a good note, but just from my short 5 minutes of playing the game I have to say that I hate what EA has done to this franchise. You sorry people have twisted the masterpiece that Westwood held onto for so long and forever destroyed Command &amp; Conquer. I refuse to even say that there ever was a C&amp;C4. It&apos;s like what they did to the Alien series. Alien 3 was the final movie. It was to be a trilogy. Then some director says, &apos;Hey, what would happen if we did this...&apos; and makes some mock up piece of crap movie that, while has some decent moments, shouldn&apos;t have ever been made. In conclusion, C&amp;C4 has proven to be the worst example of what EA can truly do to a game. Battle for Middle Earth was fantastic and the second was even better. Then they came out with C&amp;C3 and I was enthralled. However, this game was as much of a put down to me as Ubisoft&apos;s Dark Messiah: Might and Magic and SEGA&apos;s Stormrise. EA has stooped to a level lower than I can describe. I will always judge EA&apos;s games as the worst thing and come to expect the worst out of them. This is unforgivable, as this series is more popular than all of Blizzard&apos;s games combined. Never have I wanted to see Westwood back in business more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746865">Expand</a></span>

My army is small man! Where is the Command in that? Moveable MCV? Ok, I can understand in Skirmish but.. Really? Just move it anywhere i want? Deploy zones? What am I playing, A board game? Must start here! Sigh. I expect a LOT more out of the final game for the Tiberium Series. A LOT more. This was very weak. Wish I could take my game back but all I would get is in-store credit for a used game that is already registered. Sorry EA, but your Fail Truck has arrived. Replay all the C&amp;C Games that involved Tiberium and you will see all that you Failed in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746898">Expand</a></span>

The last three C&amp;C games I played, all involved you, GDI or NOD, building your little base, and spamming out units to delightfully smash against each other until eventually you reached their base, destroyed it, and started another game. Oh, and you had to harvest these strange mutagenic crystals called tiberium for monies beacuse the countries could do cool things with them. It worked right? C&amp;C 4 didn&apos;t think so. A complete changeup to the system, you now build this MCV (Crawler) through which you can unlimitedly spam units until you reach a unit cap, thus equalling an effective stalemate unless you&apos;re vastly superior to the other person, have team mates, or your enemy spends half the time picking their nose. It&apos;s boring and unimaginative, Whopee, Rocks Paper Scissors units. No tiberium harvesting, no base, spamtastic, stalemates, not very fun. I don&apos;t know *why* this game is even labeled as command and conquer. The story is also sub-par compared to the other C&amp;C games, and tries way to hard to take itself seriously. There&apos;s no cute cheesy sci-fi fun. It&apos;s all gruff, boring, and blocky.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight/user-reviews?user_review_id=746965">Expand</a></span>

I have no qualms with normal rts multiplayer; in fact i quite enjoy it. however, when the system is based on spawning in an rts game with no resource management or base building, then i have a problem. I admit, dawn of war II had no base building, but its multiplayer was supposed to be smaller, and it still had resource gathering and micromanaging. this had nothing, no strategic depth, or even a workable game.
