It&apos;s still fun, but I expected more. However the MP will blast the hell out of you. Simply second to none.</span>

This game is also pretty realistic in that you can&apos;t just run around spraying and survive. You really have to think about where you run before you do. My only gripe is that the single player campaign is a little too short.</span>

But is the multiplayer overdone? In Modern Warfare, you get the feeling you have less ability to control your fate. You are not as agile, and can be mortally wounded more easily. In fact, the replay is needed because quite often you don&apos;t know what hit you. Including taking a bullet through a wall. Soldier movement is slow and weighted down. The arm movement while running is too pronounced. You get the perception that you are weighted down and do not have the nimbleness of Call of Duty II or III multiplayer. All shooting is standing up, no ability to jump down and shoot heavy arms. I found myself swithing games to to Call of Duty III after about one hour.

I find it particularly insulting when a developer fails to listen to gamers and simply sticks with conventional approach with scripted game play. For example, the surrounding environments seem inanimate with regards to the skyline, grass, and bushes. In addition, a player cannot randomly open doors, climb fences, or console with our fellow soldiers. It is apparent that the developers were attempting photorealism, but failed to recognize the true nature of realism. I realize the developers were striking a balance between high-end PC&apos;s and low-end PC&apos;s. Nevertheless, the high end PC&apos;s should be offered the option of differentiating their respective gaming rig over their mid or low end predecessors. I only hope that the developer, in the future, reconsiders their short-sighted approach to designing games and rather embarks on an epic journey to exceed our expectations. Contrary to popular belief, it is the details that distinguish a good game from a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=408514">Expand</a></span>

Good story telling, fun gameplay, and the various levels are very different in pace and tone, so that it doesn&apos;t get too stale. Highly recommended, if only for that. Multiplayer, on the other hand, leaves a bad taste in one&apos;s mouth. The maps are too small, there&apos;s no teamwork whatsoever, and you&apos;re better off shooting with an assault rifle than a sniper rifle at extreme range. Everything is deadly accurate at extreme range and kills in one or two shots. Furthermore, things like airstrikes and chopper support are awarded not by team related objectives but by kill streaks of a single player. Thus, it actively rewards fighting like a sissy, and punishes any who would do something risky to attempt to complete any of the objectives in the multiplayer objective modes. It essentially amounts to a whole lot of people camping, paying no attention to the various points to be captured, etc. Frustrating as hell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=409794">Expand</a></span>

Glad you could back up your own reasoning and not sound like an unreliable failure as a reviewer.) Anywho, this game deserves a 9, but due to his stupidity I bumped it up a notch. Its single player is short and didn&apos;t really captivate me enough for a second run through after my first. That&apos;s fine, though, as I&apos;ve come across less than a handful of singleplayer games in mygaming run that have felt rewarding at the finish. The multiplayer, however, is a gift from Infinity Ward to the soul (MY soul, at least). With so much depth and so many weapons/playstyles/gametypes to choose from, it has quenched my online thirst for owning n00bs (such as this idiot below me) since release day. A definite must have for anyone considering themselves a pc gamer, casual or otherwise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=422691">Expand</a></span>

Also, the seen where you are the president getting beaten and taking a ride through a part of a Middle Eastern city that&apos;s a terrorist stronghold is incredible, it&apos;s honestly like nothing I&apos;ve ever experienced or seen. Hordes of men shooting guns in the air, frightened citizens running for cover, then you get to the compound... well, maybe I&apos;ve already said too much.

Technically, he would be right as no game is worth $50. But, if you want a deep and dynamic game with visually stunning graphics and incredible sound, then this game takes the sting out of forking over your hard-earned money. First, the criticism: SP is a bit bland and linear. You are introduced to COD5&apos;s wide range of weaponary and game style, so it&apos;s worth checking out. The graphics (sorry XP users, you are missing too much here) are simply breathtaking. Personally, I feel it takes the cake over Crysis. COD4 brings us the same revolutionary sound as did it predecesors. It is lifelike and not-to-overbearing. The meat and potatoes from COD4, however, goes beyond it&apos;s glitter. it lies in the MP mode. Revamped from previous releases, COD4 allows a user to retain persistent stats and awarding upgrades along the way. The ONLY issue is that ranking up seems to be a bit too easy. You can earn challenge points along the way, accellerating your way to the top. The casual gamer will find this a perfect pace, but for COD4 diehard, we will all be 5-stars from this point on. Bottom line, don&apos;t dismiss the occassional critic whom basks in his/hers on glory of being able to sway a vote. Take it from a hard-core gaming veteran, this is THE game to own this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=405246">Expand</a></span>

It modernized the aging world war 2 template with &apos;just&apos; enough storytelling and presentation upgrades to make the air feel fresh again for a breath or two. It&apos;s still not all that memorable, and supremely short. Get it for the multiplayer. Which is hopefully still active.</span>

Sneaking around in Hardcore domination mode, without the annoying predator missiles and attack dogs added in later COD titles, this game is great - and it also has the best singleplayer campaign in any call of duty game. Too bad that later iterations of the series has not kept up to its legacy.</span>

<br>I normally play more realistic or story focused shooters, but with most CoD fans saying this is the best one in the series, I thought I&apos;d try it (single-player) with modest expectations.
<br>It was still a mild disappointment. Production values were fairly mediocre, not what I was expecting from a highly praised big-budget game.
<br>
<br>Graphics are ok, but nothing special, even for 2007 (inferior to Arma1, Stalker1 and Crysis which all came out the same year). Some level environments are quite nice, but most others are fairly bland and a bit too linear. Sound design is also nothing special, and lacks oomph.
<br>
<br>The story is ok, but the missions are a very mixed bag. Almost all of them suffer from rinse-and-repeat enemy AI waves. Its all scripted, and seems to be aimed at instant gratification console peasants of below average intelligence. The US infantry missions are just a tedious shooting gallery with a shallow narrative tacked on. No matter what instructions you get from your officer, chances are they are not practical for the situation in front of you. If you deviate from the script even slightly, like attempting to flank where your not supposed to, the mission gets stuck or you get punished. At least there are a few missions with more interesting mechanics (like firing canons from a plane). The only decent conventional mission was &#x201C;All gullied up&#x201D; - much more atmospheric and better paced. If only the other missions were as good. You only get to do a (highly scripted) sniper shot once in the game, and only at about 150m. The campaign is quite short at 4-8 hours. The only really good thing was the few jokes your squad make now and then.
<br>
<br>Open combat mechanics are not fun - arcade and bland. Almost every time you shoot an enemy a new one spawns right behind him, just around a corner. This creates the ludicrous consideration where you may not want to bother shooting someone to avoid dealing with the near infinite replacement enemy spawns. Weapons look nice and have great reload animations, but lack realistic power. Quite a few times the AI would ignore a bullet to the head or multiple rifle shots in the chest. Certain enemies are immune to damage if they are not &#x201C;supposed&#x201D; to die at that time - eg: hit a helicopter with anti-tank RPG and nothing happens. This punishes any player initiative. Enemies move without inertia. This makes aiming at them a pain. The AI will tend to just run at you mindlessly. Enemies throw grenades with machine-like accuracy and occasionally seem to be able to track your movement through walls. during training you are instructed to shoot through weak cover, but I encountered many weak surfaces that seemed to be just as effective as concrete. Friendlies are either invincible bullet sponges or get in your way  (example: grenade falls at your feet and AI is blocking the only door exit).
<br>
<br>Overall CoD4 is a fairly mediocre game (but not quite &#x201C;bad&#x201D;). How this became the No.1 FPS franchise seems to have little to do with merit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5956927">Expand</a></span>

While the game has some excellent set pieces and fun sequences it ultimately doesn&apos;t make up for the incredibly stupid A.I. and the extremely cheap deaths you will experience. The gameplay can easily descend into you picking off incredibly dumb enemies as they respawn and run to the same pre-determined  spot over and over, even as their dead bodies pile up to the ceiling while your allies fire inaccurately at them refusing to push forward. When you do push forward the game becomes very difficult as enemies really only pose a threat at close range when you get in the way of their precious pre-programmed spots as you can easily find yourself taking fire from several directions at once, this wouldn&apos;t be a problem if friendly NPCs supported you when you advance, but since they don&apos;t enjoy getting turned into Swiss cheese. Like I said there are some excellent sequences, but ultimately the game feels like a few very talented people trying to make up for the incompetence of several others, and that is how the game plays, some good sequences trying to make up for some awful gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4232721">Expand</a></span>

<br>Still, 6/10 just because I hear it was great back in the day. I would rate it 2 otherwise.</span>

Very good netcode too, i play almost perfectly even with 100-140 ping!</span>

The hardcore mp modes feel like the good old Rainbow six experience while the original modes feel a bit like how battlefield 1942 was for me. The only difference is... that its immensely better in all aspects! Introducing rewards that makes you WANT to play better, play more and play differently all the time to unlock nice equipment and stuff, graphics that look extremely good and still runs good on any medium spec machine built for or by a gamer, and generally a more than averagely good experience of working as a team. And not least, the single player campain is simply put one of the most exciting, varied and (for peace loving military buffs like me) the coolest experience of being in modern war ever.

I just poked my head around a corner as a horde of enemy ran from cover 400 yards away. ON THE RUN (and bear in mind the player cannot fire when running) these 4 guys all hit me with impunity. Later in the same level, I stood behind Griggs, the Automatic Rifleman, and watched over his shoulder as he emptied his M249 (the big, heavy machine gun that deals only in heavy death) at a static target from 10 YARDS AWAY. He missed with EVERY SHOT. Elsewhere in the game I just shrugged my shoulders at the numerous times I died at the hands of an NPC wielding a MAC-10. It would be ok, but he was 500 yards away and I had him in the optic of my sniper rifle. Other times I laughed as I got shot by a guy whose gun was pointed at something else, and chuckled at the amazingly non-realistic arcs the super-accurate barrage of grenades was flying in. Now OK, COD4 is amazing, its a brilliant game - but truthfully - the veteran mode is only for the truly patient. It does not make you feel skilful to beat it, because you know full well that the NPC&apos;s are always fully aware of where you are, even when hidden, and have perfect aim.

I was inspired by Mazarini&apos;s Play With Soul video to get this game so I bought it at the Steam christmas sale. Single player is pretty good, Multiplayer is addicting. Modern Warfare 2 was basically a re-skin of this game. You need to get this game.</span>

A very good shooter, but still just a shooter. It&apos;s not like STALKER where you have free roam in an entire world. It&apos;s not like HL2 where it adds physics and puzzles and stuff. It&apos;s just an ordinary shooter. One of the best I&apos;ve played in a while but still... just a shooter. If that is what you want, then this is a good choice. If you are hoping for something new, then this isn&apos;t it. It&apos;s just like the other COD games. A linear campaign. I preferred Sniper Elite where at least you get missions that you can do in your own way. I would only give this a 5 or 6 for being so short, but the multiplayer makes it worthy of a 7. PC Zone UK - had a review I agree with. Although there score is too high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=408143">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is lightening fast, and runs smooth as silk. Audio is exceptional, as were the others in the CoD series.

There is a lot of variety in the missions though (besides the enemy spam) and it&apos;s very cinematic. The multi-player is nearly flawless except for the maps seem to be too small for some of the longer range weapons. Sub-machine guns are the best choice in most situations and shotguns are horrible.

Yes, the singleplayer is scripted and short, but it has no lame filler and is full of visceral and intense action. There were times where the single player was a little silly, but overall the singleplayer was fun (which is the most important). The multiplayer varies on what you play. It can be very tactical if you play on hardcore servers running Search and Destroy mode (only 1 life per round with an objective to complete). Or it can be very arcade like in a normal free for all game. What few others have mentioned, but is really important, is that this game mods very well and can auto-install maps and such if you enable it in the options menu. Don&apos;t like the helos or certain perks? Fine, some mods ban the use them, and open up all weapons to the player regardless of rank. Team play is very good if you use the voice over IP, and you play with others who are tactically oriented. In conclusion, the singleplayer is good but lacks replay value. Multiplayer is very diverse and is sure to please any player from the old RVS fan to UT fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=411468">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is good rather than great, it&apos;s got more depth than a generic deathmatch but it&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t seen before. On the down side, you can tell it&apos;s built to work on consoles - the game holds your hand a bit too much, difficulty levels are fairly low and the environments don&apos;t have the sort of physics realism and detail that I&apos;d expect from a high-end PC game in this day and age. This does have the advantage of making the game work well on less recent kit, but it just didn&apos;t wow me like, say, HL2 did when that first came out. A very solid 9 and well worth anyone&apos;s money, but unlikely to become an all-time classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=408159">Expand</a></span>

The single player campaign is extremely well designed and unlike MW2/MW3/BO well paced. The levels are not just about mindless running and gunning but though if you prefer finishing them like that you are free to do so. The multiplayer is actually the place where COD brings out all of its shine. Its extremely immersive and full of exciting well designed levels with lots of guns and customization options. The most important thing about this game is that unlike its younger brothers (MW2/MW3/BO) it has support for dedicated servers which is the reason why this game has thousands of active servers even after so much time.<br><br>Does this game deserve to be rated with score 10? Probably not because there are certainly flaws which are not that obvious at first sight. However, if I don&apos;t rate it that way I will most probably be sorry for not doing that in a couple of years when all traces of decent games are erased in favor of pure money-grinding publishing politics (I fear that time has already come). That means that realistically this game deserves a strong 9 however by the power invested in my current voting rights I will give it a full 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2148814">Expand</a></span>

The singleplayer, although short, was loads of fun as well. I must have spent a couple hundred hours on this game&apos;s multiplayer.

The best parts about the game are the sounds (pretty good); however, the rest of this game is painfully average. Half-Life 2 which was released 2 or 3 years before this has similar graphics and much better level design and story. Another good point is that the game is length being short so I do not have to force my self to continue its repetitive gameplay. The bad parts of the game? well, first  the game is completely uninvolving or say not interactive and mostly because of its linear story and average level design. This game consists many levels in which you have to shoot tons of enemies. This makes game extremely repetitive. Also there are no interesting characters in this game and most time it just direct the player to a certain way with no intriguing or complex levels. Yet the game really does not have any story whatsoever. The online part is okay, although generally I do not like this kind of mindless shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=1823821">Expand</a></span>

Bad gameplay, bad multiplayer, bad-medium graphics, semi-good plot and OK sound. I can&apos;t say that graphics are bad/very bad because they&apos;re only on the other games like CoD MW2, MW3, BO, BO2, etc. Anyway, they&apos;re not so good, because this was out on 2007, and on this year Crysis was already out, which has much better graphics. Actually, I don&apos;t care about graphics, but, since I&apos;m reviewing a game, I have to rate them. The gameplay is very slow and boring, and it isn&apos;t competitive. The multiplayer is closed (I mean that you can&apos;t make your own scripts, maps, gametypes, etc., like on Quake 3), and there&apos;s not SDK, etc. (OF COURSE!). The singleplayer lasts just a bit. You can complete it in 4 hours. Semi-good plot, because it can be good, but it&apos;s not deep. 3.75, for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2830767">Expand</a></span>

If it&apos;s not some kiddies with ACOG snipers tryharding, it&apos;s really bad sounding and feeling guns. The dedicated server system is trash in comparison to Black Ops or World at War. You are also stuck with only three killstreaks, in comparison to the newer games. The maps aren&apos;t too bad, and the graphics are standard among Call of Duty games, but I just don&apos;t like the feel of the multiplayer.

To nitpick this game to death, allies always get into your way and absorb some of your bullets because they look like your enemies. Respawning enemies make the combat quite futile. There are a large number of mechanics that are used only one time, such as ONLY ONE mounted sniper rifle which is affected by wind. The game is determined to never calm down, making it even more frustrating trying to divine the developers&apos; will as the game tries to stomp on your free will.<br>The second worst aspect is the attack dogs that will tear your aorta out unless you press the melee attack button at precisely the right time, which I can never manage. You will be sent back to the last save point to keep an extra close watch out for the aorta-fiends.<br>The worst part is the fans, which all sound like &quot;y ar u runing intothe rooom sprayying bulets like that man? hav u no skil man???&quot;<br>Activision has since released about four copies in addition to all the competitors.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2332899">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is also extremely fun for when you finish the single player game. Over all the best first person shooter of 2007 besides Bioshock.</span>

The game keeps you wanting more as you fight your way through the (slightly short, finished in two sittings) epic story. Its a cinematic gameplay, that although doesn&apos;t sound great on paper allows the game to connect you with far more exciting events than many average shooters these days. For these reasons I will give it a 9/10 Multiplayer: Now for the real reason to buy this game, call of duty 4 has some of the greatest multiplayer i have seen in a long time (i play counter-strike and battlefield mainly to give you an idea). This is where the PC version really shines and the cons0oles really cant match. The online gameplay offers a lot of variety with about 20 different weapons, all with about 4 unlockable attachments and 5 different camouflages, about 5 game modes (with the option of hardcore mode on each), 15ish maps, and about 30 different perks, the game is very customisable and you can set up a class exactly how you want it. Ranking up has been set right at the right level, that it requires not too much gameplay to get to another rank and unlock new weapons, but it also doesnt take too little so you do actually have play for more than an hour to unlock a majority of the weapons. Any there is always the goal of getting gold weapons ahead of you. The gameplay itself has been put up against a big feet of achieving what they achieved in COD4 but they have managed to not only achieve this, but surpass it adding a new level of gameplay. This most definitely deserves a 10/10. I haven&apos;t enjoyed a game this much for years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=411370">Expand</a></span>

The only game I have ever experienced this level of addiction with was Counterstrike, before source. The story, the graphics, the way your scope shines gold and the amazing lighting... The graphics are breathtaking and the gameplay lives up to them. There are issues with multiplayer, not least a terrible server browser in the PC version and quite frankly stupid gameplay in the standard mode, but the former can be worked around and the latter is simply fixed by playing the game in hardcore mode (which removes the HUD and severely lowers maximum health.) As a whole, this game is by far the best shooter I have ever played (bear in mind this is my favourite genre, and strategic shooters only get a small amount of interest from me) and actually probably comes out on top as the best game I have ever played. Well, until FFXIII. If you like your shoot-em-ups and somehow don&apos;t have this one, get it.

I&apos;ve been spoiled by games that you actually &apos;interact with&apos; (not a new concept) but in COD4 everything is stuck to the ground. The maps look like basic geometry prettied up with decent textures and ok lighting but with static foliage and lack of physics in the details. This removes the believability of the game. However if you like to run and gun on rails this is about the best game for it, if you prefer to think and interact then get Crysis.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=405642">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are utterly spectacular, the singleplayer capaign is brilliant since evey level is unique in some way, shape, or form, the multiplayer is chaotic and very addicting, and the new story really gives this game a work out. Even if you have to have lower graphics to support the game, trust me, every second of the gameplay is worth it. Multiplayer&apos;s fantastic too with its huge array of game modes, upgradable and customizable weapons, and a seriously awesome ranking system. If you need a great way to spend $50 besides on the Orange Box (which is also very good), then get Call of Duty 4, one of the best FPS games ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=405663">Expand</a></span>

While the single-player mode quite short, the cinematic quality of the game adds a perspunique perspective that makes every moment of it worth playing. Single-player - Although short, this mode adds a new way to play an FPS. You play as various characters, but not all of the missions or about combat. You have your run of the mill &quot;go here, kill this&quot;, but you have your levels with zero combat, which may sound bad for a FPS, but adds a new way of story telling in this genre. From being carried off my enemy soliders to crawling out of a downed helicopter. The game is smooth, and doesnt shove in meaninglessly large areas just to expand the game length. 9/10 Multi-player - Upon entering your first multi-p[layer session, your options are fairly limited as to what you can come in as, but for a good reason. They have created an RPG-like setting with the online modes in which you get EXP (experiance points) from killing your enemies, and bonuses for each map depending on how well you performed. As you level up in ranks, more modes are unlocked, which eventually allow you to customize your class, weapon loadout, and your camo for each weapon. Other additions are that you can add traits to your classes including more powerful rounds, increased health, and increased accuracy. The levels load quickly and the respawn rate in incredibly quick. There are many modes that make this the perfect multi-player experiance. 10/10 Sound - Ultra-realistic sounds create a more in depth atmosphere which drags you into the game. The score is similar to other games in the genre, but it&apos;s the art direction that really adds a plus. Weapon fire volume depends on which weapon, ranging from ultra quiet silced weapons to the annoyingly loud machine guns. The music coes on when needed, the radio sound uality is perfect, and the sound effects leave you with nothing more but excitement. In the multi-player modes voices are added that actually would be heard in a real life setting, making the experiance more intense and realistic. 10/10 Graphics - While better graphics have been seen per model in games liek Gears of War and Rainbow Six: Vegas, this game does what it needs, and does it well. The details they put in are near perfect, allowing for customization of the qulaity depending on the build of your machine. I run this at the maximum quality my computer allows, and there is very little lag, allowin for it to stay fun, and still look amazing. Immense details in the distance also makes for a nice realism. 9/10 Overall, this game is enjoyable in many different levels. The cinematic video and sound quality, the balance of action and storytelling, and the game modes make this game able to play for hours on end. 9.5/10 overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=405792">Expand</a></span>
