Hearthstone folows the same formula WoW and the Diablo series, by providing flashy, happy graphics and glittering interfaces interfaces (remind you of a Casino?) for the player to do the same actions over and over in hopes of a payoff (remind you of a Casino?).
<br>
<br>In Diablo it&apos;s killing the same monsters in the same acts over and over in hopes of legendary. in WoW it&apos;s going to the raid casino every tuesday and in Hearthstone it&apos;s play games in order to buy decks to maybe get the right cards. The thing is that it is an empty, soul sucking, life wasting endeavor.... when you get all your best cards, legendaries or raid loot, what is there to do? What is the payoff?
<br>
<br>They just start the hamster wheel again by introducing better cards/loots/legendaries. Love yourself as a human being and avoid anything made by Activision/Blizzard, they are not game makers, they make 21st century slot machines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4050211">Expand</a></span>

Because Hearthstone is about as pay 2 win as you can get without placing a button that says. &quot;Click to win ($4.99)&quot;
<br>
<br>First the positives. Hearthstone is a functional game that has decent flow to it. It has minimal issues with bugs and runs well on older machines. The game does have a rather kitschy feel to it, as well as a sense of self-parody for the WoW mythos. The gameplay is smooth and the interface is easy to navigate.
<br>
<br>Hearthstone falls short in several areas, however. For example, players must either buy boosters or earn them at an extremely slow rate, made slower by the fact that in-game currency is only earned through victories. Players are started out with the same set of basic cards and must grind packs or buy them. There are daily quests, but they usually involve winning matches to gain extra gold. While it is possible to win with the basic set of cards, many of the pack cards far stronger and some are actually game breaking. Which makes a player who pays for packs far more likely to get ahead in the game. Discounting daily quests, booster packs can be obtained with gold for WINNING 30 matches. I emphasize that intentionally, as no gold is gained for a loss, essentially punishing the player who is learning or can&apos;t afford to buy cards. Exacerbating this problem is that matchmaking is quite poor, and so called &quot;Casual Matches&quot; are well populated with &quot;noob-stompers&quot; looking for easy gold which slows down the rate which gold and subsequently packs are acquired. Another problem with the game is there is a lack of balance. Priest and Hunter decks have access to cards that swing the game too much, IMO. (Mind Control and Unleash the Hounds being the most infamous.) Other classes also have cards of this type but not nearly as strong or numerous.
<br>
<br>In addition to this is the Arena mode which can be entered for 150 game gold. (Whereas a pack costs 100 gold.) But can be instead accessed with cash, You are given a choice of three random decks and them create a deck from card options given to you. Everything is RNG based. Then you take your deck and play other players must win as many games as you can (up to 9) before losing 3. The mode rewards you with booster packs, gold and dust depending on how well you did. If you did well you will get more, if you did poorly you will get little and possibly not get a pack. Again this feeds into the demand that players win in order to progress.
<br>
<br>There is also a way to craft cards using the aforementioned dust. Although it is not at all efficient, cards can be broken down using dust, but creating one of a certain rank requires the equivalent amount of dust from breaking down 8 cards of the same rank. Like everything in this game it is a slow process, crafted to exasperate the player and make the cash shop more appealing.
<br>
<br>Finally the game deserves criticism for doing little to instruct new players in basic deckbuilding strategies. And has a notably annoying &quot;response&quot; system that many players use to taunt their opponents. It can be disabled, but only for the duration of your current game and must be disabled every single time you play a game. There is also no function for players to trade cards which was omitted simply to push the P2W game system.
<br>
<br>Hearthstone is hardly the worst game out there right now. In fact it could be good, but the P2W model and the frustrations involved with CCG mechanics that are quite faithfully ported over from card games like Magic: the Gathering are front and center without any of the social benefits.  A potentially good, game but ruined by the P2W model. Only the most diehard CCG enthusiasts with money to burn will enjoy this game. For everyone else, it&apos;s more frustration than actual fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4205695">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Look forward to sitting on your stagnant deck, and if you&apos;re good at playing, you eventually hit the wall of people with better cards. Period. Further, because your available cards are based on the class you&apos;re playing as, every class plays the same strategy and there is a definite rock-paper-scissors balancing act going on between classes.
<br>
<br>The only reason this game isn&apos;t getting a lower rating is because the production is just so good. I tell everyone, if Magic the Gathering had made their computer games look and feel like Hearthstone, they would have been good games. Blizzard setup a great platform, but the game is crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4114768">Expand</a></span>

<br>Arena</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Games like this should be regulated like gambling. If a person under the age of 18 is not allowed to gamble, because their judgement is not considered mature yet, why is Blizzard developing a virtual casino for 9-13 year olds? Sure they will ask their parents or just buy prepaid cards to buy decks. Some will get seriously addicted, as they chase the next &quot;rush&quot; of random battles.
<br>
<br>Arena requires you to grind for hours and hours to get a free entry (150 gold to enter, 10 gold per 3 wins, at 50% win rate you need 90 games to get free entry. at 10 minutes per game that&apos;s 15 hours of grinding.
<br>
<br>Once you are in the arena, it becomes apparent just how broken it is - the &quot;random&quot; draft lets you stay and fight for long if you have a good deck. But you soon realize that weak decks get eliminated quickly, and you are left fighting players who are either using OP builds, or just have a bunch of OP orange cards in their decks (ex: Ragnaros).
<br>
<br>Introducing PVP is the driver of the pay to win system. Once you see how many people at low ranks have rare and legendary cards in their decks, the feeling of &quot;unfair&quot; will make you buy decks. Once you buy decks, you realize that because they give you cards for all 9 classes, and lots of common cards, you need A WHOLE LOAD of decks to get your favorite class on par with the rest of the players.
<br>
<br>Or you can build one of the rush decks and just overwhelm the enemy. Got frothing berserker? Got void horror? Got buzzard, hyena and unleash the hounds?
<br>
<br>After a while, this game made me sick to my stomach because of how such flashy and seemingly user friendly game exploits the human brain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4090102">Expand</a></span>

Decks are too small, no way to counterattack unless you&apos;re one of the few classes with Secrets (trap cards), it&apos;s a total crapshoot! If you enjoy games of little to no skill in a fun, casual, Warcraft theme, then this is definitely for you.
<br>
<br>Aside from giving the gameplay an absolute 0, the sound effects, music, graphics, and overall theme, however, are very delightful. For the few months that I played, it was definitely fun, until I realized how luck was everything. Still, outside of the gameplay, it&apos;s pleasant, but sadly, games without good gameplay get scores such as these, if not worse. If it ever comes to smartphones (and not just the iPad), I&apos;d vote it a 6 or 7 as a Mobile game, but for a PC game, it doesn&apos;t deserve the ridiculous praise people are giving it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4048463">Expand</a></span>

Then they add possibly the worst card collecting system in CCG history in which 5 very likely crap cards cost a total of 2 bucks (so each virtual card costs 40 cents ea.) OR you have to grind for AT LEAST 3 hours (Each pack costs 100. 10 gold every 3 wins. 30 wins for one deck. ~60 games assuming you&apos;re lucky enough to win half. 60 * about 10 minutes per game = 600 minutes. THAT&apos;S 10 HOURS FOLKS. You&apos;ve got daily quests which if you&apos;re lucky take off about 6 hours from the grind. Then they give people , legendaries meaning the win rate for a grinder drops down to 30%. Then you got the fact that some classes will hands down destroy your deck. They expect you to plan for everything and your mother in 30 cards.
<br>Bout the only thing going for this game are it&apos;s aesthetics. OOoooo shiny colors and explosions Ahhhh *watches as 2 flame strikes, 2 arcane explosions, (insert aoe and/or removal spell(s))*
<br>In terms of gameplay, there is none. Figuratively. Literally. You draw cards. You play what you can since the number of options in this game is extremely limited. You hope your opponent doesn&apos;t have that card. He does. You curse at the computer and a terrible chat system (maybe it was intentional) that doesn&apos;t allow any communication between you or your opponent between 6 generic phrases. The end. I understand how card games are supposed to be luck based but the main problem is this game is too luck based and too damn simplified. The main crux being there is absolutely no counter play. None. They picked up counter play and threw it out of a 10 story window. You got what you can do on your turn and then you watch as your opponent does what he does. If that happens to be the complete destruction of your side of the field from a card he just drew from the top of his deck; well too bad (justification from hearthstone fanatics: should&apos;ve planned for that). Magic allows you to choose what creature you want defending. Yu Gi Oh has trap cards. Even the damn Blizzard World of Warcraft card game had counter play. What&apos;s that you say? Secrets? You mean the &quot;trap&quot; cards only 3/9 of the classes have and that there are only 3 of? You can literally google &quot;Mage Traps Hearthstone&quot; and it&apos;ll show you the whopping list of 5 possible traps (2 of which are crap that a mage should never have) allowing you to easily sidestep these token cards.
<br>Which leads me to the next point. Hearthstone has 465 playable cards; about 30 of them are legendaries basically making them unaccesible for anyone but the lucky or the pay-to-win. Furthermore of these cards about 80 are useful. Why? It&apos;s the meta. All of the rest are useless. They&apos;re situational, inefficient, or just downright bad. One of the fun things typical card games do is allow you to experiment; in Hearthstone if you experiment you lose. That simple. Of course unless you go against someone else who doesn&apos;t get the meta.
<br>But back to the legendary issue. They are the meta breakers simply because they&apos;re rare. Rare and downright unbalanced; Now I do have to give Blizzard props, they tried to balance this. Unfortunately the way they tried to balance it is figuratively mentally retarded. They added removal cards. As in if you don&apos;t like a card you pick it out and say gtfo. Now I&apos;m all for arbitrary death but seriously...in an already luck base card game. Now as if getting lucky wasn&apos;t enough you can get really lucky or more likely unlikely as in that card you finally managed to get out and buffed for the win now gets destroyed cause the other guy top decks a &quot;kill-anything-you-feel-like-card&quot;. Well done except that took literally no skill. It also means that the luck based level of the game has now dropped down to the point that a 2 year old with the same cards as a professional player can now beat that player. Good job blizzard. All in all excellent work on the balance and luck issues. I do have to give it a one thought because the graphics are nice and the game is mind-numbingly simplistic. Also at least it wasn&apos;t Diablo 3 Blizzard. At least it wasn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Things to make it bearable: In ranked, before a match begins allow people to see what class they&apos;re up against and allow them to build a deck. Use a removal card to remove the removal cards from this game completely permanently. Nerf the legends. This isn&apos;t league. Set the cards so a random number generator doesn&apos;t determine whether you live or die.
<br>
<br>p.s. It&apos;s quite sad when the signature game mode (which you have to pay to play) is Arena Mode. When literally your entire deck is composed of RANDOM cards.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4049839">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The arena is the most fun game mode, but it&apos;s expensive to play and too random and luck based (depending on the cards you get draft from). Also, you can get ridiculous streaks like playing several times in a row against the same class and taking the second turn. The arena rewards have also been downgraded. It&apos;s very possible get crappy cards and dust as rewards even though performing reasonably well in the arena.
<br>
<br>Updated observations:
<br>
<br>- The overall balance is pretty bad and Blizzard does little to improve things. In arena and constructed certain classes are clearly better than others.
<br>- There are few truly viable strategies for each class.
<br>- At the beginning it&apos;s possible to play for a while with basic, common and rare cards, but eventually you&apos;ll hit the wall without epic and legendary cards.
<br>- Unless you invest real money, it takes forever to get the good legendary cards.
<br>- The more you play Hearthstone, the more you feel like it&apos;s another Blizzard grinding game.
<br>- It&apos;s a card game, but you cannot trade the cards with your friends. Absurd.
<br>- After a while it becomes obvious that the game lacks depth.
<br>- It&apos;s 2014 and there&apos;s no chat. All you have is six lousy premade emotes.
<br>- Statistics are practically non-existent, although they would be useful in this kind of game.
<br>- Certain UI bugs persist patch after patch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4043258">Expand</a></span>

<br>#01This is a TCG.
<br>You are ment to spend money in order to get cards. If you are not OK with that idea you will spend time getting wasted in the ranking plays by decks that compose mostly of epics and legendaries. Which will lead to you getting angry, irritated and feeling suffocated. And that will lead you to write a 0/10 review. I got to rank 14. That was at the end of the month. Now at the start of the month i see decks packed with 4~5 legendaries on ranks 20~18...
<br>
<br>#02 But why does the game system match F2P players that don&apos;t have any epics and legendaries in their decks against P2W players whose decks are packed with them?!
<br>Here comes out the awful truth. F2P players are just cannon fodder for the players that pay for the cards.
<br>I don&apos;t have any of those. Had to deal with an enemy that played Ragnaros, then on the next turn Ysera and in the end Grommash...Does that seem to you  like something to  be enjoyable for me if i don&apos;t have any epics on rares myself?
<br>
<br>#03 The only chance for me to get epics and legends is opening packs. Which cost gold. Which you get from daily quests...Sorry. Quest
<br>ONE FOR EACH DAY...Only 40~60 GOLD a DAY. On average a F2P player will squeeze out 2 packs every 3 days.That clearly hits you in the face about Blizzards intentions.
<br>#04 Arena. Probably the best instalment of Hearthstone. Watched all TotalBiscuit&apos;s arena episodes. Played it once myself. Got a **** draft. Ended 5-3. From what i saw it&apos;s 45% that you get a great draft, 45% that you get a great hand and follow up and 10% that you won&apos;t make any stupid mistake. It&apos;s a great gambleSo addictive. And the 2$ entry fee isn&apos;t that high right? Just think about it. If every day hundreds of thousands people play several times 2$...AWESOME
<br>#05 Why P2P? If you haven&apos;t figured it out by now then lol. Because if you really want to compete then you have to pay money, silly!
<br>
<br>I told my friend that I&apos;m gonna give this a 0/10. He told me not do it. Give it something betwen 1~3 but not 0. I seem to enjoy it...His words unfortunately confirmed me in my judgement. I don&apos;t enjoy it.
<br>Secondly a 0/10 is controversial and will lure more people to reading a review like this. This game clearly does not deserve an 88 from critics...Yeah I&apos;m gonna bet on that one. I&apos;m a little afraid of stagnation in Hearthstone. How will this game evolve. Are they considering inserting discard cards? That would ruin the game.
<br>In the end this game is clearly intended for people who are ready to throw money at it. It will be a great game for those people. Especially arena runs. You will buy cards, construct decks that are most popular in the top circles. Test them out on ranked. Disenchant unwanted cards, make golden ones. The  illustrations are beautiful. The mechanics is original. The cards have many combinations to test out. Lot&apos;s of fun. great but not a 9/10...Blizzard keeps nerfing some cards. Defias got nerfed. Didn&apos;t see any rogues on Fight Night(am at S03e03). Shaman totem doesn&apos;t heal the hero anymore...That makes sense...
<br>
<br>.I want to to uninstall it...But maybe I&apos;ll just keep with doing dailies. Just to get a kick out of opening &quot;Expert packs&quot;. One every second, third day...In the end for me Hearthstone is a game i enjoy watching being played like TotalBiscuit&apos;s videos or Fight Night.
<br>BUT IF YOU ARE A F2P THEN STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM IT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106862">Expand</a></span>

Hearthstone certainly looks pretty enough, given how Blizzard has a fairly deep art talent pool for its games and most mechanics seem to work well, with only a few bugs that I am sure will be worked out soon. The very basic mechanics are covered in a 5 game tutorial that gives a quick &quot;This does that&quot; explanation via game play. There are fun animations for summoning and attacks and for other actions on the board that can really be entertaining as well. and there are several kinds of decks you can build and a decent practice mode.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately any entertainment value is destroyed by several factors. All deck types have their own unique Hero ability and set of basic cards, while no one class has any clear advantage on the other 8, each class has gimmicky cards that can make any strategy for attack or defense suddenly impossible to beat or impossible to lose against.  While there is no perfect deck type which is a plus, any strategy into building a deck only usually makes a deck good against one or two other types of deck and easily defeated by many others
<br>New players do get a decent set of basic cards but the card draw system is a complete mess. You gain additional mana crystals each turn that let you summon more powerful creatures and spells but the deck draw system is far to fond of pulling cards you can&apos;t use long before you could actually use them, regardless of how many cards have that cost in your deck. Out of the 30 maximum cards in a deck i tested 30 games with 24 cards with a mana cost of 4 or less and 3 cards of 5 mana and 3 above that, of the 30 games played I got the 5+ cards either with the Initial draw, after the mulligan option of discarding some or all of a starting hand for different cards, (which is a nice feature even if it doesn&apos;t seem to help alot) or within the first 4 turns. One of those three options occurred during every one of those 30 tests. Often I would get the same cards i discarded with the mulligan back into the starting hand again.
<br>I would not call this pay to win, pay to catch up with players in the Beta for amount of cards? Yes. It is possible to buy more cards either directly for cash or with gold earned in game.  You can also get cards by doing well in the arena mode, which is where you build a deck out of random sets of 3 cards untill you have 30. the better you do in arena the better your reward, be it gold, cards or dust. Dust is a crafting material that you gain for disenchanting spare cards from your latter deck as you can only have 2 of each kind of a card in ladder deck. Dust is used to make any card you want, with some cards costing more than others. While this is a good feature to let players pick certain cards, you gain miniscule amounts of dust for disenchanting most cards. Gold earned in game is also earned at low rates, 10 for the first 3 wins of the day and 40 for completeing a mission. It costs 100 gold for 1 pack at the card shop and 150 gold to try your hand at arena mode without paying the $2.00 real money entry fee. So largely its 2 days of playing for a deck of cards or 3 days for an arena attempt. Its also about 2 dollars for a pack of cards as well, with various bundles for more packs for more money available.
<br>I cannot recommend spending any money on this game, as they are obviously hoping that you will either spend more money buying packs and attempting the arena  enough times that they will make more money off you than they would for a retail game like Diablo or Starcraft. All in all, the gimmicky nature of the decks and the poor randomization for drawing cards from your deck make Hearthstone the fastest way to have a bad time short of a sudden injury.

<br>In constructed, almost everyone is net-decking some kind of low-budget cheesy rush or legendary heavy control because this game has no depth, so you will have to face same decks over and over again if you want to climb up the ladder, also, you get almost nothing upon losing, only some slight exp gain which is required to unlock foil cards/hero portraits.
<br>
<br>The arena is absurdly unbalanced, totally dominated by AoE heavy Mages who have bunch of board clear spells to win, some say it&apos;s fun but I found it toxic after playing like a month, not even competitive thanks to RNG hell.
<br>
<br>Please remind that The Blizzard already stated they won&apos;t be touching much balancing issue after the release, which means this game is as good as dead.
<br>
<br>If you want to try you luck, just play some online-poker, and never pay a dime into this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4052655">Expand</a></span>

All of the cards are recognizable from the WoW source material that they are drawn from. The UI is convenient. It doesn&apos;t do any stupid crap like having cards sidewaysor upside down like certain other games(No idea why they do that, quite stupid for a video game where 2 players are not sharing the same monitor). It even allows you to disenchant unwanted cards to build up a dust supply to eventually craft what you do want, something other games don&apos;t have. This is a real game seller. Those other crappy card games just expect you to lottery until you get what you want, to hell with copies or cards you don&apos;t want piling up.

<br>But on the other hand, you have a game that is being treated very poorly by its developer&apos;s. Not only is the balance in the game non existent because it focuses on a meta instead(Blizzard openly admits this)... but It&apos;s now over run with bots that they still refuse to do anything about. Bots are farming this game day and night now, so don&apos;t be surprised when you fight the same exact bot decks again and again. The bots have even infested the forum now, creating a slew of garbage spam threads every single night that persist until they&apos;re pushed off the next morning by real posters. Blizzard couldn&apos;t care less about these issues. They don&apos;t even use their own forum most of the time, opting instead to go to social networking sites such as Twitter or Facebook. That means that instead of caring about the users they have, they care only about drawing more in, which is the overall feel of the game. It&apos;s one big cash grab of a product, probably made solely to draw in revenue which they&apos;re now no doubt using on Heroes of the Storm instead of using it to improve Hearthstone.
<br>
<br>The competitive play for the game is in shambles because of it&apos;s non existent balance. Every player with a class runs the same exact build because, when you run a meta, that&apos;s how it works. They all run what is best, to hell with anything else. If you come into this expecting a balanced game... you&apos;re going to be gravely disappointed. Half of the cards in this game are garbage no one uses or has any reason to use, while a small fraction are best and auto slotted into every deck. Many players like myself(1k+ posts) have spent all year trying to talk Blizzard into fixing this game, including all problems I&apos;ve pointed out here, and we&apos;ve only gotten deaf ears turned to us. As usual with Blizzard games, the months roll by and little to no problems are actually addressed. They take the game down for entire days to apply no patches, or patch with 1 or 2 lines in the patch log that didn&apos;t fix anything people were trying to get them to look at for months on end.
<br>
<br>The biggest thing they did for the game this year was add Naxx, which basically just hands out a slew of cards very cheaply to anyone that wants them. Naxx is an all around bust in my opinion. It&apos;s too cheap to enter, too easy to beat, then has no reason to even replay it once you got all the cards. The only difficulty even in this &quot;adventure&quot; is Heroic Mode, which makes the bosses impossibly difficult without tailor made decks to beat them. And what&apos;s your reward for all the trouble? Nothing. You get nothing for beating every boss on Heroic except a card back no one cares about. It needed a middle ground, instead of having a &quot;too easy&quot; mode that hands out all the cards, and a &quot;too hard&quot; mode that gives you nothing for your trouble. Bust. Just a bust. Replayability would have helped, but there is none for it. After doing all of Naxx, I finally decided to retire. I&apos;ve waited long enough for Blizzard to do something with this title, anything other than treating it like a lottery machine.
<br>
<br>I should point out the embarrassing Kel Thuzad voice acting. What used to be an evil Lich is now a clown cracking jokes for bored children at a birthday party. That sets the overall tone and disappointing nature of the game perfectly.
<br>
<br>But like all controversial games with nothing but biased fanboy or hater reviews; it&apos;s both over rated and under rated. Speaking from an objective point of view, it&apos;s not a bad game, it just isn&apos;t as great as it easily could have been if Blizzard cared at all about it. I&apos;d like to point out that despite what a lot of ignorant people say, it is not P2W either. You can competitive with cheap decks; it&apos;s been proven time and time again. The debate about this has been beaten to death, with threads made nearly every day trying to convince you one way or the other. I&apos;ve been competitive myself and never put in more than 10$. So I can&apos;t really thumbs this up or down; I&apos;m just going to leave it up to you as I retire. In summery Hearthstone is a decent enough card game, but it&apos;s easy to be disappointed when you look at all the wasted potential.

<br>
<br>Perhaps if they hadn&apos;t been so filled with greed and hubris this would have been a real contender with the other F2P titles on the market, but right now it&apos;s not competing and doesn&apos;t deserve a good review.
<br>They can do better.
<br>
<br>Alongside the financial model issues is the heavy reliance on RNG in their card design, a problem which alongside the cost was noted by many of my friends on the actual CCG&apos;s release.
<br>
<br>Overall due to the fact there are many documented bugs and flaws, and the fact they&apos;ve had an active cash shop for months now while still being a &quot;beta&quot; product, I cannot in good conscience give this any higher than a 3, worth some time if you don&apos;t take it seriously, but a monumental let down in terms of potential... YgoPro etc won&apos;t be quaking in their boots from this &quot;official&quot; release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4032608">Expand</a></span>

The most funny thing is whilst you spend real money to acquire these cards, remember they are always blizzard&apos;s property, you basically renting ****ing virtual cards, so pathetic. NOW I&apos;m not saying to bring these features into the game, games should NOT be Pay2Win or about making money it should be something that you pay once for a product that is truly yours which you can indulge in to have fun and escape reality, get it blizzard? Game&apos;s should = FUN, however Blizzard&apos;s Formula is: Money Milking + Grinding + Fake Reward system (Virtual items), they treat people like addicted rats with a reward system. Yes it is a F2P game, if you don&apos;t mind Grinding for hours and hours to earn the same cards as it would cost &#xA3;34.99 then yes It&apos;s FREE. This game is so simplistic in nature and development it should only have a Retail price of around &#xA3;20 with no P2W module and gold grinding could be made easier with 5 daily quests as appose to 1 but that wouldn&#x2019;t be enough &#x201C;Money Whoring&#x201D; for Blizzard. Sh!t Game with the wrong intentions, end of story. Is Blizzard even run by the same people before World of Warcraft??</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4034757">Expand</a></span>

The game is fairly casual there&apos;s no real pressure to win other than you can accumulate gold. I find it relaxing to just play without stressing out. One of the negative things is the fact that you can pay to dominate. Buying the $50 card pack will make your decks ridiculously good. Also, like any card game luck has to do with how well you do which can get annoying or make you laugh hysterically when you get just the right cards to wreck your opponent.

It is extremely fun though, even losing is enjoyable to me and I can&apos;t wait for Blizzard to start expanding upon the game.
<br>
<br>For what it is now, I give it a 10/10 for being a well balanced and extremely fun game with enough depth to last for quite a while.</span>

Most of your opponents will be players who pay a lot, and that means a HUGE advantage against the non-paying gamers. Skip this game if you want to avoid a headache.</span>

The only mechanic this game has is **** you I destroy all minions&quot; cards, which are hilarious. It could be fun for a minute, but the problem there is the bussiness model. You can&apos;t even buy decks or cards you actually want. You need to roll a dice (casino!) and count for the best, but most probably you will open hundreds of packs before you will be able to build an actual working deck. And then all there is gameplay-wise is top-decking counting to get &quot;that&quot; one or two **** you cards&quot; the opponent can do nothing about. I think any other card game out there is better than this, unfortunately.

<br>I was a bit sceptical. I mean - we&apos;re talking about Blizzard - the company that butchered and ruined WoW and Diablo series just for some extra money, but maybe they changed their ways?
<br>
<br>It actually it is free, so anyone can test it.
<br>The beginnings were quite fine. Couple of battles that teach us basic mechanics, everything looks nice, gameplay is smooth. Then we get access to training battles, we get to unlock new classes (each comes with some class-specific cards), we unlock more basic cards and try to build our own decks.
<br>
<br>First few hours were really enjoyable. I was having fun, playing against AI, playing some battles vs other players. I&apos;ve completed some &quot;tasks&quot; or &quot;quests&quot; and got some extra cards.
<br>
<br>Then I tried playing training vs expert AI. Turns out it means that AI just uses better cards. I was beaten several times, all those rare/epic cards make a ton of difference. Then I&apos;ve tried unlocking all the basic cards for all the classes. That was a big mistake.
<br>
<br>It seems like matchmaker rather than looking at your win/loss ratio checks the level of your characters. Try unlocking all the basic cards (which means leveling all the characters till lvl 10) and suddenly you&apos;re fcked. I&apos;ve done all those leveling against AI then I played 10 games versus other players.
<br>
<br>First day of playing I went 6-1. Not bad.
<br>Second day (after some leveling) I went 0-10. Yes, 10 losses. 9 of those games I&apos;ve faced opponents who had max ~5 basic cards (out of 30). Better cards give MASSIVE advantage. I&apos;ve even tried looking for some builds that include just basic cards, but I didn&apos;t make any difference. Last fight was quite ok: playing against a guy that only used basic cards - just like me. Close fight, going head to head for 8 rounds. Then he pops 2 legendary cards and I&apos;m done.
<br>
<br>Long story short: I need better cards if I want to have any chance of winning vs other players.
<br>How do you get them?
<br>
<br>1. Spend $$
<br>2. Play the single player campaing - which costs $$ to unlock
<br>3. Grind gold (virtual currency) to buy extra packs

<br>You can get gold by: winning vs other players (10 gold per 3 wins).
<br>Completing daily quests: 40-60 gold per quest. 2 quests per day.
<br>
<br>Single pack costs 100 gold. It contains 5 cards, usually 1-2 rare cards in a pack.
<br>
<br>You can&apos;t complete quests playing vs AI.
<br>
<br>I can either pay money or grind for weeks, months while getting beaten by everyone because matchmaker sucks.
<br>
<br>F*** this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4886817">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s very well presented in typical interface and graphics quality expected from such a large publisher. However, after quite a few hours of play, having built up tactics and got a good feel for the game, you realise the depth is lacking. 30 card decks with 2 card limits and only limited card pools to choose from leave a sour taste in the mouth every time you lose (and it will be frequently) to the very high weighting luck has in this card game. The character powers add some depth to the gameplay, but at the end of the day you&apos;ll play people using almost the same cards and win or lose on luck. The mechanics are quite restricted too, so I&apos;m not sure that they can make a card base large enough to add the required variation to at least mask this element.
<br>Those getting higher into the rankings will also realise that free to play gets you so far. The number of players using high %s of rares, even low in rankings, is very surprising and will limit the fun for the casual player.
<br>It&apos;s certainly fun for a quick game here or there, and it&apos;s a shiny, we&apos;ll presented blizzard package, but if you&apos;re looking for some depth to your skill base in a card game, look elsewhere, as ultimately this is half built game mechanics with CCG-esc pay for power rankings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4456962">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Hearthstone is quite addictive, however while the game looks good at the start, unfortunately it becomes terribly dull terribly quickly. Gameplay is based almost entirely on randomness and luck (card draw and random results), with skill a very small factor in the occasional game. There are countless technical issues which the developers seem unwilling or unable to address effectively.</span>

<br>Almost every game breaking card has RNG mechanic in it, which means that luck decides many outcomes of the matches right from the start. This game is no longer the same fun &amp; entertaining card game it used to be.
<br>
<br>Hear me out and please don&apos;t waste your money on this garbage.</span>

                                        <span>Its a shame how a game with such little development in the cards themselves gets so much popularity, ive played it for a bit to give it a chance but it just can&apos;t even come close to a lot of other card games. If you like hearthstone for the card aspect, please do yourself a favor and just give some others a chance. Trust me you&apos;ll enjoy them a lot more if you get into them.</span>

<br>There you go, that is primarily the game in a nutshell at the competitive and productive level.
<br>
<br>Want to be creative?
<br>You will lose 90% of your games and make no progress when even winning gives you the equivalent gold of a lump of coal, so you need to win a LOT to have enough &quot;coal&quot; aka gold of value for anything (think an entire coal mining enterprise for a deck would be about right).
<br>
<br>Want to not buy a **** of decks?
<br>Even if you carbon copy the best freebie decks, you will still lose a lot of the time to other people who carbon copied the other best decks, but also have better cards then you, and keep in mind you are just copying a deck like tons of other players, why not just have a bot play the game for you. I mean honestly what the **** is the point?
<br>
<br>So are you prepared to lose a lot since you didn&apos;t buy cards then? Are you prepared to lose a lot since you didn&apos;t completely copy a competitive deck then? Unless you are insane of course not.

<br>But since many of the quests are like this &quot;Win 2 matches with  hero X or X in PvP&quot; sometimes its just impossible. The quote &quot;Worthy opponent&quot; that you get everytime you get an enemy is the biggest joke of all when going for quests like this with a hero on level 0.

Each new expansion Blizzard brings to keep the &quot;meta&quot; more stronger and unbalance between the classes, so it is impossible you get out of this situation without using the similiar overpowered classes. This new course from Adventure of Explorer&apos;s and TGT brings the idea that will never balance the cards and modes, an example of that if you play a 10 paladin mana card you can deal 30 damage in one turn if you get lucky otherwise it deal around 15 damage(check Anyfin Can Happen) this is absurd because you don&apos;t have the correct tools or space in your deck to counter that. Finishing my review of this game I would like to compare Hearthstone to a Casino but if you are young and like new adventurer with RNG you can play the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=5874931">Expand</a></span>

It is run by people exploiting its absolutely rubbish mechanics in attempts to the con the user into more spending, all those u-tube videos do is manipulate kids into buying a game that hasn&apos;t cost any real development at all, and it only offers them with a lack of fair play in return. The game is redundant when most classes can kill you before you can even drop a card, because the malicious computer provides the user with a lack of cards to drop on their turn, yet mysteriously your opponent will always have the perfect card to play. It is a rock paper scissor approach and it doesn&apos;t matter your investment, because this game relies mostly on the luck that  a computer selects something for you to play on your turns. So the game adds more abilities to draw even more cards and copy duplicate cards, but taht doesn&apos;t even matter if the cards don&apos;t come up due to the luck of the draw. Some class are so imbalanced away from other classes played, that it clearly favors them with cheaper abilities too press those Iwin buttons with.. The grammar on the cards was written by people who don&apos;t speak using grammar as every card was made to be exploited away from that grammar contained on their descriptions. The game uses P2P protocols where it constantly disconnects you, and it is one of the worse game on the planet for this occurrence. The game has frequent bugs in the mechanics where players gain stuff they shouldn&apos;t have making more and more of stuff they never needed more of and the deck that supposedly only contained a max of 2 or a single legend. It is a game that you need to invest to compete playing. As in you need to psychically spend currency buying stuff and even upon purchasing you are still a victim to its poor design and its lack of fair play.
<br>
<br>A design that wants to be played as quickly as possible in as few turns as possible, why, because time is money. So it only offers 30 hp that is dead by turn 4 ,as you are only given a selection of unplayable cards prior to that turn you are dead in having nothing significant to counter your opponent even though you have filled you deck appropriately with plenty of cards on the starting turns. The design has an appalling layout, it hasn&apos;t put cards into rows to be hot keyed. It doesn&apos;t provide the user with their own strategic choice of starting selection. It doesn&apos;t allow the user to make as much game currency as they can acquire per day from playing, instead it limits them, because they won&apos;t spend. It doesn&apos;t provide the tavern tourney all week, because that often makes game currency quicker than other matched modes. It disconnects only from playing this game, in matches that you can instantly relog, but you have lost your game that there was no protection offered. It doesn&apos;t group players fairly, it groups them with players well outside their psychical level.. It forces starts for many turns  away from the mathematical odd of a coin flip 50/50 or non start for as many turns as up to 10, and it groups with the same player as many as 4 time sin a row, and the same class for many attempts  frequently again as many as 10 times. It has worse loss streaks then provided win streaks, they are not balanced, up to the point the assumption is you are grouped against robots and the computer has simply worked out a strategy to your deck.
<br>
<br>This is monkey made game was  typical pyramid scheme. It was designed to exploit the user into spending, it doesn&apos;t give a hoot about anything else, because if a million people spend buying some of this game&apos;s crap and they have too, in having the same features you are grouped against, it has made millions. It uses crap connection protocols when it runs from same servers hosting much better games that offer far superior multiplayer. It basically took the concept from a world famous epic game and churned out total garbage in attempt to exploit that fan base.
<br>
<br>Avoid this abysmal game at all costs. It is simply heinous. These games should be stopped, and its reign of corruption ended. It seems the common tactic of the industry today is screw the user into spending more on crap that is redundant. It is all across the console industry today with DC packs, it is all across the internet with these freemiums and there is nothing epic coming out of the industry apart from these exploitively redundant hacks. For the love of this planet anybody else with a hint of reasoning should absolutely avoid. These type of games are simply not worth it, do not be conned otherwise by the lies fed by those people exploiting that concept of you buying more to always get less because there is always more to buy when it is never enough. It is absolutely sickening.

<br>
<br>yes, sound and graphics are very nice, but arent they similar to those of a slot machine? the sound uppon choosing a match triggers something on the back of each player, its a one huge slot machine in a huge disguise.
<br>
<br>all the good review of this game are consequences of the followed:
<br>kids or not intellectual enough who played against other players and realized they have to buy many packs/play many games until they will get rare/epic/legendary cards to win.
<br>they don&apos;t realize what&apos;s hiding behind the intention of this game, obviously money.
<br>try not to buy any packs and win someone who bought 10+ packs, its nearly impossible, you must have either 60% luck which gives the other player no luck and or fight against someone&apos;s stupid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=5533240">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>The game is as pay 2 win as it gets. Cards are more expensive than some physical card games and are untradeable and heck, adventures and skins are more expensive than some paid games out there. That really pisses me off because hearthstone is based on the Warcraft franchise and warcraft III was an amazing game. Such a shame that Blizzard has fallen to such low money-grabbing practices.</span>

Its just one big money grab that shamelessly promotes its other games while consistently ripping you off. The fact that activision is involved raises suspicions but when you play and constantly get the shaft you  know its a huge scam. 25 dollars to play just one of its multiple &quot;add ons&quot; and when youre done with that you get a legendary so 25 for a legendary. Ive gotten about 20 packs from grinding and ive only gotten one atrocious legendary. Plus look up the pros they all use the same legendaries so its not even a complex game in any right its pretty much pay us until you get 1 of these 3 legendaries then maaaaaybe you can enjoy the game but by that time itll be a huge bore anyways. I only recommend this for people who dont mind funnelling money into a below average game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=5357261">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The main problem is the card decks and the element of luck in every game you play, for example you can play the same deck against the same opponent and the first time you can beat them without them even hitting you once, then you can reload and they will destroy you by move 8, you retry and destroy them by move 8. This has nothing to do with playing the cards you are dealt, since if luck isn&apos;t on your side you can end up with 4 cards that need 8 crystals and the opponent will have a zerg rush waiting to kick your ass.
<br>
<br>It gets a 3 because it is a well crafted game like anything Blizzard make, but as for the gameplay mechanics it gets a big fat 0 since it isn&apos;t even a game that you can be good at, you just sit there and hope that *this* time your cards will come out in the right order and you can&apos;t actually be a GOOD Hearthstone player, just someone hedging his or her bets that the deck you&apos;ve built is going to beat the odds so you don&apos;t need to be lucky to win it.
<br>
<br>Which also means if you want to be good at Hearthstone you just need to buy the cards you need to win and play a lot, since there is no actual skill involved to become a good player, just the bare basics of gameplay where you don&apos;t make really stupid decisions. Get the basic elements of play down (don&apos;t use a group damage spell when the enemy has no minions, don&apos;t be stupid.) and you will win, and the reverse of that if you have a **** deck and luck isn&apos;t on your side you will fail.
<br>
<br>I really wouldn&apos;t mind any of the luck element if the skill element could make up for bad luck, but it doesn&apos;t. You can be a brilliant strategist but you will lose against a lucky retard rolling his face across the keys and summoning a murloc zerg while you hold 2 core hounds you can&apos;t use for 3 turns. You might as well just download a higher/lower card game app on a tablet, because that&apos;s basically what Hearthstone is, just a random number generator with nice graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4586590">Expand</a></span>

The cards in Hearthstone are as in any Blizzard game could be of common, rare, epic and legendary quality. Cards could be obtained through buying card packs - for game currency (100 gold ) or real currency. Game currency could be obtained via daily quests - 40/60 gold + 30 wins would provide additional 100 gold ( first 1000 gold could be earned through onetime &quot;achievements&quot; ). Which means around of 1 pack per day or via fight on arena which provide you with 2 packs per day at least for additional 12 games. Which translates into 2-4 hours of play everyday.  On average one in five packs would be epic card and one in 20 packs would be random legendary card. However, since many cards are belongs to specific class a chance of obtaining specific card is very low so deck&apos;s building strategy revolves around random cards or you could transform cards into &quot;Arcane dust&quot; at very low conversion rate e.g. one specific common card costs 40 points while result of conversion of common card is only 5 points, one pack in average converted to 40 points, in order to buy specific rare card required 100 points, in order to buy specific epic card you would need 400 points e.g. 10 packs while  legendary card is equal to 160 packs.  So in order to built some average deck you would need to spend about 160 hours of game&apos;s play during 40 days or pay to Blizzard about 200$.  Now would you be willing to participate in tournament where are fundamental advantage could be bought via real money ?
<br>Gameplay itself isn&apos;t bad except couple of severe bugs for Mac client which probably already fixed, the expansion Naxxramas isn&apos;t bad either, although all 5 wings on Normal mode could be eliminated in a couple of hours , however cards from Naxxramas quite useful so expansion is also part of marketing strategy , in terms of money it&apos;s a really good deal since it&apos;s provides specific valuable cards for a low price. The game is theme is all about World of Warcraft universe and some cards provides nostalgic value to fan&apos;s of &quot;wrath of the lich king&quot; expansion. If you are looking for a long term time investment and rewarding competitive gaming you will find this game as a huge disappointment. Surely as any card game results of every match could be quite random so if you are lover of carefully crafted strategies and well deserved rewards you should stay away  from  this game as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4943931">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Initially solid foundation was undermined by greed, slow response to problems (patches take 6 months to arrive), incompenent direction and lack of focus and dubious design decisions. It seems that the developers more and more satisfied with themselves, while the quality of the game plummets. Meanwhile, the cost of the game is being silently increases by non-obvious means (no more adventures that are replaced by more expensive pack expansions, power inflation in effort to force players to buy the new OP cards, card rotation, etc).
<br>
<br>Advice to new players - stay away! The golden age of Hearthstone is gone and will not return. The game is worse and worse with each expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=7152123">Expand</a></span>

Instead of adding more deck slots (for all my Hunter decks I cannot keep track of) and the ability to add a card back for each deck, as well as giving me 1000 free packs (classic, btw) a day just for considering the notion of their game being fun, they take the time to animate a picture, put voiceacting on it, add some particles, throw in a card back, and expect me to pay $10 for it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s unbelievable how greedy Blizzard has become now and I don&apos;t want to spend another dime on them anymore.

<br>If you did not start playing this game back in the beta you are going to have a very difficult time earning your cards in this game.
<br>I admit the game has it&apos;s fun, but as a new player it&apos;s very difficult to win unless you throw the buck. And the funny thing is that even throwing the buck wouldn&apos;t ensure you win, because the packs are totally random and you can easily get up to 60 packs with no legendary (that is about 60-70$). And even if you do get the legendary, it can be a horrible one. So unless you actually overflow them with $$$ you will likely not be on par with most of the active players.
<br>All in all this game has a spectacular, but also evil design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=5401475">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>ps:i really hope it wont get high prizepool tournaments,the game doesn&apos;t deserve it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=6527679">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Sesame Street of card games is what Hearthstone is. Popular for the same reason Call of Duty is that it appeals to the biggest market (casuals) and makes a game even from rng or random cards, but that is where it stops. Unlike other card games you can trade, you can talk to your opponent actually understand them, you can play moves on their turns as a control method and you have a method of ramping your deck up to play the cards you want. Hearthstone has none of these and this is where you have to decide if you want to keep losing to people who pay money or join the pay2win club. Once you make it to this point you can decide for yourself of you can invest in a paper card game where you have everything Hearthstone has to offer by x1000.
<br>
<br>There is a reason why paper card game players are not fond of Hearthstone, it could dumb down the whole genre of trading card games, and to the fact that it masquerades as a trading card game when it isn&apos;t. The artwork is pretty disappointing as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=6674149">Expand</a></span>

<br>Hearthstone is slot machine hidden behind the title of a card game. Look at the remarkable resemblance to a slot machine for the queuing animation https://youtu.be/dEinLIA45rE?t=3194 .They pamper you with daily quests, lively animation and music and seasonal rewards but it&apos;s all a facade to get you hooked from the start. As time passes, you cease to play this game for fun. It becomes some machine you grind gold out of or some crucible that you put yourself through every season for the title of legend or rank 5. Most of the long-term players share such sentiments. They log on, farm their quests, play a few games, get infuriated and log off. It all sounds so counter-intuitive. As you new player, all you longed for was a competitive collection. But it takes years or hundreds of dollars to gain such. As a veteran, you grow more weary of the game every day and remain in perpetual hope that the next DLC will change something but it never does. There is only torment and despair to be found here
<br>
<br>Hearthstone is an addiction not a game. Save yourself the trouble of being shackled to this game and look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=6688987">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Recent updates make this game even more unbalanced and unfair. I uninstalled it probably 3 times in the past month, basically I kept forgetting how bad this game is.
<br>
<br>Positive aspects:
<br>1. Golden cards have cute animation;
<br>2. It&apos;s free (almost)
<br>3. Tavern Brawl, which is only available 4 days a week and it gets boring after 3-4 games(had to put in positive, cause I got nothing else for you)
<br>
<br>Negative aspects:
<br>1. I can&apos;t decide if this is more pay to win or more luck to win. Anyway, if you want to spend over $1000 on this game then this is probably not a negative point, BUT then comes luck, which you can&apos;t buy. If you want your strategy to work 1 out of 5 times, then sure, you can play.
<br>2. Clearly unbalanced heroes, just check the stats. They struggle every update to balance the game, but they simply make it worse.
<br>3. Unbalanced cards, if you want to install this game because it&apos;s free, think again. You can&apos;t possibly win without spending money or spending 3 years grinding... i think getting some education like bachelor degree or master will be a better idea than grinding this game.
<br>4. New updates make the game more pay to win and more luck dependent. Didn&apos;t get the right card on time, you lost.
<br>5. Clearly a monitored gambling system for basically everything in the game, especially the Arena. Their AI will decide how much money they want to take from you by giving you bad heroes(up, some heroes are trash) and give you bad cards, or &quot;good&quot; cards that don&apos;t combine with each other. Same comes with ranked game, they know what opponent to give you and what cards to put at the end of your deck. It&apos;s simple, just basic programming. Win 5 games, lose 3, win 2, lose 3 and so on...
<br>6. Bugs, server disconnects and troll players are constantly present.
<br>7. Obsolete rewarding system.
<br>
<br>Some people think about installing the game back after they balance it more or make some drastic changes. This is not gonna happen. This is simply a gambling addiction, a super hard advertised game meant to transform you in that guy you see playing the slots at 3 AM.
<br>
<br>Note: 70% of the positive reviews were bought with the cash they made from the poor addicts.
<br>
<br>Cheers!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=7493029">Expand</a></span>

Seems likes they made this changes only because blizzcon is close and they didn&apos;t want to make their biggest tournament of this game looks like a total joke.

I have lost countless times to some idiots who cant othwerwise play but because they have 3 legendary cards in their desks, witch all are only obtainable by buying expansions, I lose to them. So its good but really unfair.</span>

Also, for some reason both Blizzard and their audience think that this is a TCG and treat is as such. I like to treat it as a videogame, because that&apos;s exactly what it is. They don&apos;t print cards, you can&apos;t trade cards and you shouldn&apos;t spend hundreds of dollars for virtual cards that are designed to be bad on purpose.</span>

<br>First things first - this review is being written by not native english speaker, so please pay no attention to mistakes. I have been playing Hs for over a year and have over 3k games won. The game mechanics is great, there are dozens and dozens of cards and every four or so months there is a new card expanssion, which is great because it makes (or should make) game less repetetive.
<br>So, why only 3 stars? - if you are someone that thinks over starting new adventure with HS... don&apos;t. Just don&apos;t. In Hs there is no such thing like matching opponent of similar game count, which means that right from begining you may be spared against enemy with 30x times more games played and thus over 30x times more cards - i can tell via my own experience when as i had about 120 games won i have played against dude with rank 7 and over 4k won games. Another thing - cards cards, cards. You think you will get what you want/need? Think twice. You won&apos;t. after year of playing i am still using decks of my own creations which are &quot;outside of meta&quot; making me win 2-3 games out of 10 played. Is losing bad? Normally i pay no attention if i am winning or losing... but here comes HS punishes. If you don&apos;t win - you get no gold. There is absolutely no reward for losing a game no matter how hard and mental exhusting it woult me. now, what can be bought bu gold - card packs and arena entrances. To get a card pack you have to win 30 times. yes 30. Each game can easily take 10 min or even more. Now, recall me saying that i win 2-3 game out of 10. Yes, collecting 100 gold sometimes takes me from dawn till dusk.
<br>Another thing - i said that new card expansions makes game less repetetive. In the end, it doesn&apos;t. As you are playing ranked and see, let&apos;s say - a warrior, in current meta you can be 95% sure that this would be pirate agro face warrior. almost no exceptions.
<br>But hey! there is an option to use real life money! It will bring you nowhere to. I know. From, once again, real life experince. I have spent **** load of money on HS hoping that i would get better cards. I dind&apos;t, and here i am. almost crying with each game being played as i stuggle to collect 150 games to play on arena - the only, lemme reapet - ONLY fun thing in HS, which is making deck of random cards and fighting against another oponent with random cards - so you can be sure that you will never use same cards and play against same kind deck twice.
<br>So, summarizing, HS is a GREAT GAME with wonderful system, nicely made rng, bah! even a lore and advnture system... but it is a shut &quot;society&quot; if you would join it now, prepare on devastation and completely lack of support for new players.
<br>I highly disrecommend starting playing this game for anyone that is not a masochist, for i have no idea why i keep playing this game and keep wondering over quiting playing this game for good. I think that i will just wait till next expansion and see, if thing would get at least little less &quot;unplayable&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=7070853">Expand</a></span>
