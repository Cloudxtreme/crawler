<br>
<br>I personally will say although the puzzles weren&apos;t overly challenging, I really enjoyed that Pewter Games gave you the option for hints which for someone not savvy on adventure games I was quite thankful.
<br>
<br>If you want a simple, pleasant, and charming experience that feels like you&apos;re playing a classic Disney movie you should definitely check out the Little Acre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-little-acre/user-reviews?user_review_id=6881632">Expand</a></span>

<br>A charming, but Rushed Experience.
<br>The little Acre is a point and click adventure game where you play as both Aidan and his Daughter Lilly
<br>Aiden Wakes up, and the game instantly does a great job of setting the tone for the game and giving you an idea of what it will be like by forcing you to get dressed without leaving the bed so that you don&#x2019;t wake Lilly..
<br>Usually adventure games have stupid puzzles that don&#x2019;t make sense like mixing a toaster with a bathtub to end your suffering... here thankfully every single puzzle makes sense&#x2026; which could lead veterans of this genre to feel the game is too simple&#x2026;
<br>But it was a nice change of pace, and I enjoyed the simplicity of these logic puzzles&#x2026;
<br>The art style and animation is hands down the greatest peart of this experience and is ultimately its saving grace..
<br>The entire game is done in an old-school hand drawn Disney style&#x2026; and the way the characters interacted with different items in the game, their facial expressions&#x2026; everything about the animation made me smile way more than I had any hopes of it doing&#x2026;
<br>Unfortunately the animation was all that kept me going&#x2026; and the gameplay was enjoyably simple enough to not make progression feel like a chore&#x2026; even offering hints and solutions making this a very friendly game for all ages to enjoy&#x2026; but the overall feel of this game is little below average
<br>thanks to the voice acting and the story delivery&#x2026;
<br>Aiden wakes up and wonders where his father is&#x2026;
<br>You have to unlock his shed, where you find this machine that takes you to the land of chibi formed characters&#x2026;
<br>Shortly after Lily makes breakfast for herself as her dad is gone and goes on a search for him... ending up in this same land&#x2026;
<br>All of this is fine&#x2026; it&#x2019;s a great plot&#x2026; but its laughably rushed&#x2026;
<br>There&#x2019;s no character development&#x2026; no reason to care about anything going on&#x2026;
<br>It feels like a story board with no meat between plot points&#x2026;
<br>The delivery is literally
<br>Where are you? Found you.
<br>It&#x2019;s that fast.
<br>No conflict, no build up&#x2026;
<br>Its question and instant answer for 2 hours.
<br>And the voice acting here isn&#x2019;t necessarily bad... but it doesn&#x2019;t fit the characters&#x2026;
<br>The evil dude just sounds like makiplyer telling a ghost story&#x2026; and Lilly and Aiden sound more like brother and sister than father and daughter&#x2026;
<br>You can tell that no effort went into finding fights for the vision of these characters... almost like they were randomly assigned to people and they took whatever they got&#x2026;
<br>While The Little Acre tells a rushed story and doesn&#x2019;t offer too engaging of a gameplay experience&#x2026;
<br>The charm of the animation is great enough to make this game worth the 2 hour run-through&#x2026;
<br>I give the little acre

                                        <span>Five Word Review: Short, cutesy adventure worth playing.
<br>Favorite Thing: Gotta be those hand-drawn visuals!
<br>Least Favorite Thing: The game switches between characters too frequently.
