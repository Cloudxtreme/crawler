It&apos;s also some what frustrating to have so many rooms and not really take full advantage of them as you&apos;re busy trying to beat the clock.
<br>
<br>All that aside, the game is FANTASTIC and extremely well done.  It truly is the *REAL* spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper unlike Dungeons II which for some reason was given this title.  Others have commented about the incomplete nature of the game and while this is true, the developers are for sure working on wrapping it up and fixing the issues.  I am also hoping to see some relief regarding the fact that the campaigns are timer focused.
<br>
<br>All in all the game is worth it and it&apos;s a lot of fun to play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5243480">Expand</a></span>

Everything that made you love DK2? It&apos;s here. The new additions take away none of the fun but add heaps of replayability giving you a variety of options to pursue: do you want to start with beasts and push hard for an early rush? Do you want to take it slow and  and train up your normal minions for a traditional DK army? Do you wan to focus on teching with cultists. moving towards a powerful ritual or construct? Do you want to turtle up with defenses and potions?
<br>
<br>If you like DK1&amp;2 or Evil Genius or other management games (theme hospital?) you will love this game. Be warned it&apos;s still not fully finished (lacking many tooltips, not a lot of documentation, frame rate drops and general engine sluggishness.) But the campaign is working well, you&apos;ll certainly be getting your money&apos;s worth. Hopefully development continues to move in a positive direction.
<br>
<br>I was an early alpha backer and I have to say I&apos;m glad I was. Looking back they&apos;ve come a long way. I wish Subterannian good luck wrapping out the development cycle. New Features are coming down the pipe (survival mode. map editor) once the game is feature complete it&apos;s going to be a real bargain at current price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5283885">Expand</a></span>

<br>True successor to DK franchise + A LOT of features which were missing in DK 2 are now implemented (also great ideas).
<br>I bought the game in December, so I missed bugs present at release.
<br>Anyhow: buy the game! Developers are still polishing it and adding new content</span>

<br>The developers are active in updating the game, and I expect it to improve with time, but it is unacceptable to release a game so unfinished that you can&apos;t get through two hours of gameplay without it crashing. The minions act about as confused and scared as I was playing this game. Underneath the crashes and bugs, there is a glimpse of promise, but it is not worth my time and yours right now. I hope that War for the Overworld gets fixed, but I won&apos;t be returning to it until it does.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5162395">Expand</a></span>

Sadly however, the game has been released long before its due time, and as such is filled with placeholder items, niggly interface bugs and occasional game breaking issues. First person minion view (possession) and the entire multiplayer mode are both horribly broken.    Please note the time of writing of this review.  If you are reading this in a few months from now, it may be worth investigating if the issues mentioned herein have been resolved.
<br>
<br>War for the Overworld is ostensibly the most lauded spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series, and with good reason: it has been lovingly designed by some of its must staunch fans who have worked together to build this game from the ground.  Not only that, but it has received a verbal endorsement from Dungeon Keeper designer Peter Molyneux himself!
<br>
<br>Starting up War for the Overworld for the first time leads the user to a very functional lobby.  The options menu is well laid out and almost all options are neatly described in layman&apos;s terms via tool-tips.  The omission of any function to change keyboard bindings was noted.
<br>
<br>The campaign mode was the only acceptably functional game mode at the time of writing.  The levels are nicely designed with great variation and interesting nooks and crannies to explore as you expand your dungeon, wealth and army of minions.  Each room performs specific functions and how you design your dungeon will affect how efficient it becomes, although it is sometimes difficult to discern exactly what the room actually does.  Traps, doors and constructs facilitate other means to reinforce your stronghold, each having unique mechanics to allow the player to devise their own devious death delivery systems to would-be trespassers.
<br>
<br>The narrator/adviser will ensure that you don&apos;t to too far astray by pointing out strategic goals, highlighting rooms of interest and introducing the player to new creatures as they make their debut.  My personal opinion that was while the advice was good, the game did rather hand hold a little too much.  In some cases the adviser was responsible for me losing a level due to moving the map and focusing on something at a critical moment.   The game is fun to play in spite of its bugs, but the problems do feel like a let down when compared to the highly polished Dungeon Keeper  2.
<br>
<br>The bugs are quirky but difficult to overlook.  There are problems with selecting some of the options using the on-screen HUD, object names have placeholder tags, descriptions of the functions of many rooms are woefully lacking, imps keep dying in the same place like lemmings and the &apos;wards&apos; to control them don&apos;t work terribly well. Furthermore there are occasional game breaking bugs which will cause you to reload.  Some of these will recur on reload, forcing you to restart the level.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>Captures the Dungeon Keeper look and feel.
<br>Exciting creatures, rooms and traps.
<br>Nice level design with fantastic narration.
<br>Witty and sarcastic commentary.
<br>Some new game mechanics that really add depth to the game.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>A large number of bugs, place-holders, graphical glitches and odd animations.
<br>Interface problems get in the way of gameplay.
<br>No option to change keyboard bindings.
<br>Multiplayer mode very much incomplete.
<br>First person minion mode virtually unusable.
<br>Creature pathfinding is poor.
<br>A little too much hand-holding.  Can impede gameplay at times.
<br>Feedback to the player is lacking in places.  Imps die like lemmings with no alerts to the player.
<br>
<br>It is difficult to imagine how a project like this managed to go so horribly wrong at its final stages of development. The design and ideas in this game are remarkably good throughout, but the game was simply never quite given those finishing touches. War for the Overworld has the potential to be a great game, but is let down by countless bugs which should have been quashed during the beta stage.  It is likely that these bugs will be fixed in the coming months. While I have had a great deal of enjoyment playing War for the Overworld, I can not recommend consumers to spend their hard earned cash on what is essentially an unfinished product that has no guarantee of completion.
<br>
<br>About me:  I am and avid gamer and Dungeon Keeper fan.  I have supported War for the Overworld from a fairly early stage which should be taken into account when reading this review.  I refrained from engaging in the beta process in order to save the experience for the final product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5156239">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have to hit it on some stability issues that have caused a couple problems but the game is enjoyable enough that when I do get a crash it&apos;s not a chore to catch back up. To be 100% fair on this score the devs are VERY quick to address these issues. What&apos;s broken now likely won&apos;t be by next week.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t hesitate for a minute recommending this game to a friend or anyone else for that matter. The only reason it&apos;s a 7 is I&apos;ve played this game to death in the Dungeon Keeper series and, again, no new ground here. If you haven&apos;t, it&apos;s an 8 easy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5161883">Expand</a></span>

Despite not being technically polished to a 100%, its still fun and immersive gameplay. Voice-over and sound make for a great dungeon atmosphere. The Developer is extremely active and communicative. 9/10 with a potential change to 10 points when all remaining issues are fixed.</span>

<br>Pros:
<br>-Same voice actor from the original Dungeon Keeper and Keeper 2, Mr. Richard Ridings, who does a great job!
<br>-Looks like a Dungeon Keeper game
<br>-Gameplay generally feels like a Dungeon Keeper game
<br>-Play the &quot;bad guy&quot;
<br>-Dig out a dungeon and stock rooms to attract creatures and then attack the enemy
<br>-Torture Chamber is fully operational
<br>-Devs are patching bugs and paying attention to player requests
<br>
<br>Cons (at the time of this review):
<br>-Some features are not available yet (sandbox mode &amp; multiplayer)
<br>-Creature path finding can be somewhat haphazard
<br>-Rooms and creatures do not have enough detail about what they do (still calls things &quot;prop x&quot;)
<br>-Possession can be difficult to control and once in possession mode no clear explanation about the controls
<br>-Memory Leak? Game tends to slow down a lot over the course of playing and occasionally crashes (devs stated they are looking into solving this problem)
<br>
<br>8/10 Due to missing advertised features at the time of release.
<br>
<br>War for the Overworld is a refreshing change in the standard RTS genre given that you build a dungeon and attack the &quot;good guys&quot;. As many know, WftO is the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keepers 1 and 2. This is the game I have been looking for since finishing DK 1&amp;2 in 2000 (15 years!). I am sincerely happy that EA has allowed Subterranean Games to create this clear clone of the Dungeon Keeper franchise.
<br>
<br>Do not get me wrong, War for the Overworld is not just a facelift for Dungeon Keeper 2. It does have it&apos;s own story if you are a plot addict like me. However, the look and gameplay feels just like DK2 on the surface, but is a bit buggy with path finding which I expect will get ironed out. If you have been looking for another Dungeon Keeper look no further and pick this game up since it is what we wished that &quot;Dungeons&quot; was or &quot;Overlord 1&amp;2&quot; were. It is certainly worth the $30 USD (half of what EA would charge if they made it, and it would not be as good) even though it does have some flaws as detailed above. I expect that these flaws will be polished away with a bit of time since these devs are extremely devoted to supporting their product and are enthusiasts themselves for the Dungeon Keeper series.
<br>
<br>Buyer with a low-end system beware (i.e. less than 8 GB RAM and less than a Quad Core processor running at 2.0 GHz) as this game is somewhat CPU and definitely memory intensive which manifests itself particularly during battles. I know this because I recently had to upgrade my system to run smoothly (I was capped at 3.25GB RAM and it bottlenecked my Quad Core AMD Phenom II @3.2GHz processor). If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, either upgrade or expect slow downs, stability issues, crashing, and even unplayability during gameplay, and don&apos;t downvote simply because your PC cannot handle it (I see this too often).
<br>
<br>All these things being said, I cannot recommend this game enough. WftO is exactly as advertised with regard to being the spiritual successor to DK 1&amp;2. I played this game when it was in early access and enjoyed it then and now even more. This is the only game that I have ever been happy with after purchasing in early access, and I have purchased a fair few.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5167738">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay is great, recalls old DK. Recently developers introduced third major patch which introduced map editor. Game goes in good direction and deserves better reputation.</span>

<br>Is this game the Dungeon Keeper we&apos;ve been waiting for? (Not the Mobile one we dare not speak of)
<br>
<br>Well I would say &apos;Kind of&apos;. Its more like Dungeon Keeper 2 and its release was pretty badly bugged which disappointed me and I am rating this as it was released as it was pushed out the door a bit too early.
<br>
<br>The levels have been unlocked and I found the levels pretty fun. The narrator is the same narrator from the original dungeon keeper and I will give him credit he did really well and made me grin and laugh a bit I don&apos;t believe his commentary was as good as in Dungeon Keeper 1.
<br>
<br>Now if you asked me mechanics, design and tone wise. I will say flat out &apos;This is Dungeon Keeper&apos; without any doubt what-so-ever. So.... why did I say &apos;Kinda&apos;? Its because its not Dungeon Keeper 1 that we believed, its very very much like Dungeon Keeper 2.
<br>
<br>There is 1 level in particular I got very frustrated with on that game which is a minor nitpick because there is multiplayer matches which is more or less what people go to now-a-days.
<br>
<br>This game feels like a 7/10 to me. A great game but not solid because it was released in a buggy state (Most bugs have been resolved at this point but I still feel to mention it)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5832343">Expand</a></span>

<br>Idiotic game. Till then, it was tricky, lvl 12 is impossible. Enemy has unlimited units, used the kuros spell or whatever its called, beat 2, 3rd is unkillable. Even when I got close, game lagged out and crashed (on a Nvidia 960 and 4770k oc&apos;ed with 12gig ram)
<br>dont bother playing this rubbish. Absolute waste of space</span>

<br>To everyone complaining about bugs, I&apos;ve yet to run into any. Maybe upgrade to windows 10 and have decent hardware, but the graphics are great, the game is performant, and I&apos;ve yet to run into a bug and I&apos;ve been playing since early access.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-for-the-overworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=5880325">Expand</a></span>
