<br>
<br>This does not look like a &quot;NextGen&quot; game.. I think EA has sabotaged the PC version in favor of the new consoles  if this is true  EA really is the Cancer of this industry...</span>

Moreover, amount of cars is VERY small and I&apos;m expecting a huge amount of car-packs-DLCs. Thank you, EA. When the game starts the first time, you have to listen to all the annoying tutorials, and, what is more annoying, you can&apos;t skip them!! Gameplay is nothing new, just a compilation of HP and MW2012. I&apos;m disappointed. Again. 3 out of 10 for beutiful graphics, all the thanks to DICE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801890">Expand</a></span>

The famous FPS lock is just ridiculous. I have 2 GeForces running in SLI and the game (maxed out in settings) only able to load ONE of them for about 30-40%. So everything feels FAR from smooth (and I was somewhat expected some smoothness from AAA project released in 2013). There are no any anti-aliasing settings in-game, so the game looks extremely jaggy. Constant disconnects from the host are just killing me. In summary: do anything with the AllDrive system but remove the FPS lock, let me choose better anti-aliasing, do something about host migrations and the score would be in 7-9 range.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3801961">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also, if you&apos;re interested as to why this game even HAS positive reviews, look at the users&apos; other reviews  they either don&apos;t HAVE any other reviews, or its for some other EA game.

<br>I not sure if the game it self is any &quot;fun&quot; but its not worth the time and money which is apparent after 5 minuets of gameplay.

<br>I think TotalBiscuit said it best  &quot;Avoid like the plague&quot;</span>

<br>
<br>This game is broken on launch for PC. Capped FPS is 30, if you unlock via console the game speeds up based on the increase.
<br>
<br>i.e. 60hz  2x the speed. Poor UI design, unskippable cut-scenes, a disgrace and a disaster. The reviews for this game are FAKE!</span>

<br>NFS Rivals is Cons:
<br>
<br>Main (press Esc) No Pause?!
<br>No Reste Racer???! Where?? (Level 1)
<br>No Skip Videos and Tutorial
<br>Fake Hard drive space  30GB?? is Real HDD  9GB?!
<br>I DON&apos;T LIKE GHOST GAMES.

This is for 2 reasons. First off you wont be able to leave your computer unless you&apos;re in a hideout or  ready to throw away your bounty, because even if you&apos;re not in a pursuit trying to escape from the cops, they will still try to take you out if they drive by you, even when you&apos;re not moving. Secondly, you are not able to mark a route to either a hideout (to bank your money), or a garage to fix your vehicle while you&apos;re in a pursuit. This is really damn annoying because the cops can wreck you hella fast, and you can do nothing but hope that your drive by a garage to fix your vehicle. You can see the nearest garage on your map, however you cannot see what road to take in order to get down there.
<br>When this has been said, i find most of the reviewers in here to be crybabies and give the game a way lower score than it deserves for stupid reasons. This game have some problems of course, like any other game, specially when they&apos;re from EA. I wouldn&apos;t pay the release price for this game either, but i picked the game up for &#x20AC;8 and i find it to be worth my money for sure.
<br>This game reminds me a lot about Hot Pursuit in many ways; Controls, Racer+Cop Campaign, and the landscape in general. Only this games also have Car upgrades which was one of the only things i REALLY missed in Hot Pursuit.
<br>Not the best Racing Game ever, but indeed very decent - A well deserved 7/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=4987424">Expand</a></span>

<br>Where can I start with the cons;
<br>1.No creativity whatsoever,a poorly designed map that tries its best to inforce false Openworld.
<br>2.New Gen ....My ass,Creating a game with nothing special,No PAUSE MENU,What does that mean!Are we no supposed to have a break!So stupid,Only to find that after a while your&apos;e busted with reset speedpoints.The gameplay is horrible trash,I fell so good after finishing that game.
<br>3.Cars list!Its **** up!Only 24 cars in racer and another 20 in cop..Appreciate the new inclusion of new latest cars and Ferrari,But that&apos;s the only good thing I can think..Leave that Customization,It&apos;s nothing good..A few gadgets are good and few tech....But nothing like Create YOUR OWN PERSONAL CAR!
<br>4.Flaws and bugs:As reported,its a 30fps **** on high end PC it does not run without stuttering
<br>(GTX  680)..It is supposed to be a racing game that does not Support GAMEPADS or WHELLS!WE are compelled to play with Keyboard that too with semi-customisable controls..*&amp;^*&amp;^ you!!!
<br>
<br>VERDICT: People trying to sell this game are SMART WHORES! Denting your Pockets.....C&apos;mon seriously its not even worth more than 1/1000000000.......of its price!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3924870">Expand</a></span>

PC gamer gets the game read port with very poor cap of 30 FPS, Very limited graphics settings, NO SLI,  no option of adjusting the controls, and a controller rumble that is annoying and can&apos;t be turned off, and last but not least directX error that pops out out of nowhere like BIGFOOT. Now some of these problem can be fixed with command lines but it will take a toll on multiplayer, EA as a company is a joke. I could say much more negative stuff but I&apos;m done.

<br>You know, I&apos;d really like to complain about the idiotic 30 FPS limit and the horrible decision to lock the simulation to the FPS and all that but I can&apos;t, because that would require me to actually be able to play the game for a reasonable amount of time.
<br>Which I can&apos;t because it crashes every couple of minutes and usually so hard that I have to hard reset my machine. (running an i7  GTX 660 Ti, nothing out of the ordinary)
<br>
<br>What I did see of the game seemed pretty fun, though. Nice driving, nice graphics. Nothing spectacular (I&apos;d even say that Most Wanted actually looked better at times) but it&apos;s reasonable. Can&apos;t complain about the UI either as I&apos;m using the 360 controller to play but I can imagine M+K users to be somewhat annoyed by it.
<br>
<br>Also, the AllDrive idea seems pretty intriguing. Not that I actually experienced it as the game never ran long enough for me to engage with other players, but I can see the potential.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say I&apos;ll really enjoy this game once it is fixed (rumor has it they&apos;ll patch the 30 FPS limiter out as well). Problem is that I want to play it now and I can&apos;t (three days after release). And even if I could I wouldn&apos;t enjoy it to the full extend because of the unnecessary limitations.
<br>
<br>Verdict: A solid 8 for the actual game, -2 for the state it is in (can&apos;t play at all, crashes the entire machine), -3 for the incredibly moronic idea to put a 30 FPS limiter into a friggin&apos; racing game on the PC.
<br>
<br>Fix this nonsense, EA, and we&apos;re looking at a pretty nice game here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805417">Expand</a></span>

<br>FPS locked at 30, completely unoptimized PC Version ,Not able to pause the game when offline (witch brings me to frustration all the time)
<br>

This game looks nice and cars look just fantastic! Anyway, good graphics is not important if gameplay sucks. Do not buy if you already own good old Undercover, Most Wanted (good old version, not the new  and other NFS games.</span>

Aside from NFS Undercover, this game is one of the worst I&apos;ve played in the series. The FPS is locked at 30 so dense areas slow-down the game, no AA, and no other controller support, making this a very bad PC port. The cut scenes are annoying and cannot skip them.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Let me get this clear, I do not like the Frostbite engine! It looks great in certain environments, but it doesn&apos;t work well with racing games and has many glitches as seen from NFS: The Run and is still present Rivals. NFS: Hot Pursuit and NFS: Most Wanted&apos;s engine was much better looking and ran better for a racing game.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is bland, the gameplay is ok, but the map is very boring after awhile which is my next issue: The map. The map (Redview County) in this game is extremely disappointing compared to Fairhaven (Most Wanted) and Seacrest County (Hot Pursuit) from the last 2 NFS titles. EA kept praising that the Redview County map in Rivals was to be a similar and better experience to what was in Hot Pursuit&apos;s Seacrest County. Let me tell ya, it is not! Except for driving down Interstate 4, Sun Valley Run, and the town on the coast (I think it&apos;s Gullwing Beach) the Redview County map is BORING and lifeless. Nothing but woods, desert, and rock cliffs, and no gimmicks or landmarks that gives a &quot;believable&quot; and lively world to drive in. There are no &quot;places&quot; to see in the map compared to Seacrest County that had many landmarks, gimmicks, and eye-popping sights on any road in the game. Seacrest County also was a MUCH LARGER map that made every road an exciting variety. Many of the road paths/ mappings in Redview County doesn&apos;t make any sense (T-junctions everywhere and loops back to the same roads!). Overall the map is too dark/ bland and lifeless and not as bright and eye-popping as the last few NFS titles.
<br>
<br>The cars: The car variety and list is very limited compared to HP or even last year&apos;s MW. The Ferrari license is great, but mad it was wasted on this game. The cop cars are nice, but there is very little overlap on the car lists between cops and racers. I don&apos;t care for customization as for these cars look amazing as is so anyone&apos;s opinion on the customization options.
<br>
<br>The gameplay: 6 players in the open world is useless. The online experience is only as good as the players that are thrown into your session. It just seems very cheaply done. Some of the players will either help your career or actually hurt your progress (Which can be frustrating) and is not how a game should play. I don&apos;t like having constant online connections (The single player option is not what they describe it to be, you still need to be online). I miss my online lobbies and menus to set-up races and events (Like in HP 2010), it was a better structure to play with friends and this game&apos;s career progression lacks structure where your thrown into an open world with painfully easy objectives that repeat over-and-over again without any variables in the events (Such as certain cops chasing you, choice of cars, etc.). Everything just gets really old quickly. Also, why can&apos;t I pause my single player game?! Don&apos;t get me started with how many times I have lost my speed points because of that.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game was really disappointing in many ways. The graphics are &quot;ok&quot;, the map is smaller, not well-designed, and unexciting compared to HP and MW&apos;s maps. The car list is disappointing with the exception of the Ferraris. The gameplay is repetitive and boring with no new gimmicks.
<br>
<br>I was so disappointed with Rivals I actually bought NFS Hot Pursuit (2010) for my PC and that game looks better, runs better, and having way more fun with that than Rivals! If your new to NFS, this maybe a fun game for you, but stay away from the PC version. If your an NFS fan that played the last 3-4 years of NFS games, you will be disappointed like I was. Go pick-up Hot Pursuit (2010) instead, Seacrest County is way more exciting and a better online experience.
<br>
<br>My Score is a 3 (2 points for the Ferrari License, and 1 point for having cops).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3848508">Expand</a></span>

Well, there are actually some good things about the game (obviously not much) but overall the game is like an insincere product produced by Ghost.
<br>
<br>The game actually do have story and characters (yes the dump cut-scenes that I could not skip even I wish to). It&apos;s about a racer name Zenphyr (not sure if the spelling is correct) having reckless driving activity and a cop who wish to bust the racer. I think the story is actually a main concept of the game (if not why name the game &quot;Rivals&quot;?), but the story is executed badly. It&apos;s just like some story background you see in NFS14 and there&apos;s nothing strong related to both sides. I can&apos;t feel the &quot;Rivals&quot; in the game.
<br>
<br>Talking about the gameplay, it really annoys me sometimes. When I was racing and I want to answer the phone or go to the toilet, the game simply can&apos;t. It only opens a map when you click Esc and it&apos;s really inconvenient when you cannot pause the game. There&apos;re numerous bugs in the game like you automatically crash for the second time without reasons after you crashed once. Also, when you&apos;re in a pursuit, if you think you earn enough, you can simply drive to a safehouse and bank it even you have not escaped (I wonder if it&apos;s a bug or the game setting). There&apos;re also some stupid problems like when you successfully escape a pursuit and you drive a bit slower, the cops will be back with a really high speed. Seriously?
<br>
<br>The cars are probably the best thing about the game. The reappearance of Ferrari is actually good. There&apos;re more new cars which I could try. Unfortunately, the bad thing is that I simply cannot drive all the cars. There&apos;re some cars that I would like to drive but unfortunately they&apos;re on the other side so I cannot use them in the side I want to play, which I hate. Not only that, I don&apos;t understand why the cars know how to sweat. You can simply just see water droplets on your car in a sunny day. What?
<br>
<br>The control is the worst nightmare for me in the game. The feel is like you want the car to drift when you brake but it do not. The car drifts when you don&apos;t want to. I rather want a easy-drift control like NFS14 or unrealistic-cornering like NFS9, but not the NFS16 style.
<br>
<br>The map is simply just boring. It&apos;s just like importing NFS14 into the game with the roads changed. Meanwhile the graphics are not spectacular. Graphics are not a main problem for me but I find graphics in NFS14 more appealing. The only good thing I can think of about the map is that there are new weather changes.
<br>
<br>If I have to find the worst thing of the game, it will be the concept of the game. It&apos;s basically nothing new when compared to NFS14. Same map structure, Cops and racers, Sports cars and exotic cars...... The idea is almost the same. The main difference should be speedpoints, which I could simply ram into a safehouse and bank it during pursuit. Speedpoints are nowhere near pink slips in NFS4, so don&apos;t compare both two.
<br>
<br>Again, as a NFS fanboy since NFS2, I&apos;m not saying this game is rubbish. It still has some excitement I can get from NFS14 when I was driving in highway with an Aventador. However, if this game is supposed to be a better version of NFS14, I would say EA have failed. Don&apos;t tell me this game is going back to the roots of NFS because the older NFS (NFS2-6) are still memorable to me and I still feel excitement when I look at some videos in Youtube, but definitely not this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878968">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have played through both story lines and think NFS:R could be an awesome game were it not for the No Wheel Support issue.
<br>The graphics and cars are great with minimal lag issues. Physics are totally arcade but many people like that. It is quicker to drift a tight hairpin at 220 kph than to brake and corner like a simulator. Unrealistic but fun all the same.
<br>You will finish the story and even unlock the Platinum trophy pretty quickly. The real fun is PVP  taking down other Players, especially hunting in a pack with friends. Although you will search a bit as there are only 6 people allowed per session, but you can quick travel to any event/base once you have located your prey on the world map.
<br>I would give this game an 7 if there was Wheel support, so until then it gets a 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3885744">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps he received a different version of the game I did.  Perhaps the creators are bribing him somehow.  Perhaps he is simply an idiot.
<br>
<br>This game has no pause button.  In the abstract, that sounds like it wouldn&apos;t be too big of a problem.  In reality, it is a huge problem.
<br>
<br>I was just playing it five minutes ago, and a song came up on the soundtrack I liked.  The engine noises are really loud in this game, so I wanted to turn down sound effects so I could hear it better.   I hit start to go to the audio menu, and the overlay came up just in time for me to slam into a wall.  So much for that race.  There&apos;s also no &quot;restart race&quot; button, as far as I can tell, so if I wanted to do it again I&apos;d have to drive back to the starting point.  How many times in a racing game, or in any video game, have you made a minor error that required you to restart the stage?  Imagine that each time you did, you had to drive all the way back.
<br>
<br>The graphics are unimpressive.  If you look at the promotional screenshots, you&apos;ll be very impressed.  Some of them look as good as professionally produced real-life photographs.  These screenshots are lies.  I am running the game on maximum settings, and it looks like a late-generation PS3 game.  I am not a technical person, so I can&apos;t speak to the 30FPS issue that other reviewers are complaining about, but the game feels jerky and I see a lot of anti-aliasing problems.    The city the game takes place in is boring.  It&apos;s just a generic California city.  There&apos;s nothing fun or amazing to see, or at least, I haven&apos;t seen it.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is mediocre.  I haven&apos;t found a song I like; it&apos;s simply an undifferentiated mass of generic techno and rock.  I say this as someone who enjoys techno and rock, and listens to quite a lot of it in his spare time.  This stuff is no good.
<br>
<br>Possibly the worst part of the game is the cars.  They all feel the same, and they&apos;re no fun to drive.  What makes a car &quot;fun to drive&quot; is an interesting question, and unfortunately it&apos;s one I don&apos;t have an easy answer to, but I can tell you that I don&apos;t see a difference between one car or another.  Everything seems to drive like a Honda Civic.  Civics aren&apos;t bad cars; but they&apos;re certainly not exciting.
<br>
<br>The entire game is built around a multiplayer experience.  Unless you unplug your computer&apos;s ethernet cable, you&apos;ll be placed in an open-world with 8 or so other players.  (This, coincidentally, is why you can&apos;t have a pause menu.)  Multiplayer racing with friends is fun and exciting.  Head to head races, where you test your skills against other players, are challenging and suspenseful.  Driving around a small city with a bunch of people you can&apos;t communicate with, who are mostly ignoring you as they try to work their way through what is essentially a single-player game, is no more thrilling a daily freeway commute to work.  Unless you&apos;re unfortunate enough to come across a griefer who likes to ram you.  Then it&apos;s even less fun.
<br>
<br>I am not a big racing game player, and this is actually the second modern racing game I&apos;ve purchased.  The first is Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, which you can buy in a pack with Burnout Paradise for about 7$ on Amazon this week.
<br>
<br>It is a final, damning indictment of this game that Hot Pursuit, a three year old title, and one that can be purchased for less than 20% of the price of this game, is better than it in any way.  Before I fired up Rivals a few minutes ago, I was playing some Hot Pursuit.  I was driving an F1, a five million dollar sports car that FEELS like a five million dollar sports car, as opposed to Rivals&apos; blocky, boring sedans.  I was driving along a beautiful coastline, stopping to look out and enjoy the view.  I was speeding through turns and blasting nitro, and listening to excellent music (Travis McCoy&apos;s Superbad 11:34, in case you were curious.)  I had a huge smile on my face, and I honestly can&apos;t remember the last time I was having so much fun with a game.
<br>
<br>Go buy Hot Pursuit, and give this piece of trash a pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3828494">Expand</a></span>

Out of all the genres which require consistently high FPS, racing games are right up there with &quot;twitch&quot; FPS. This game is hard-coded (locked) at 30fps and the &quot;fix&quot; to run at 60Hz is basically to speed everything up 2x so it ends up unplayable. It looks a joke. Almost like the devs are going out of their way to mock fans of the franchise. It really does redefine the word &quot;pitiful&quot;. The last PC game I can remember being locked at 30fps was made in 1996...
<br>
<br>Low FPS aside, you&apos;ve also got surprisingly poor GFX filled with aliasing (&quot;jaggies&quot;), blurry textures, lengthy unskippable cut scenes (people actually want to PLAY racing games, not sit and watch some weak B-movie backstory). If this is &quot;next gen&quot;, then I prefer &quot;last gen&quot; games which were actually fun to play. In years to come this game will be remembered for being the &quot;new benchmark&quot; in disastrous consolized PC ports.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3818606">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Next comes the tutorial. An unskippable tutorial with unskippable cutscenes that tell me things a five yeat old could have figured out by himself. Except for the Keyboard controls, of course, &quot;Page up&quot;?? Are you f**ing kidding me? Btw. in the tutorial videos it is constantly referred to as &quot;the button&quot;. I don&apos;t know if I should call that cheap or annoying. Probably both.
<br>
<br>Anyway, back to the game. Car handling feels good, except for the fact that the tires where apparently stolen off of a Prius or something. If I wanted crazy drifing I would play Dirt or something.
<br>
<br>So lets head to the garage and install better tires. Oh I can&apos;t, i can only buy a &quot;handling&quot; upgrade. Seriously? This may sound nitpickingish, but why for heavens sake can&apos;t I buy new tires or a new engine? I could do that in Street Rod I, 25 years ago! But apparently the guys at EA want do destroy the immersion as much as possible. To drive the point home they also included EMP weapons and more such nonsene as well as ridiculous amounts of nitrio.
<br>
<br>One thing they chose to give more realism is car strength. So the police can get you really quickly, especially with the help of all the crazy toys. I guess this makes sense, given the multiplayer nature of the game, but being a single player fan myself I find it rather annoying.
<br>
<br>Well I guess I&apos;ll leave it here: Rivals is not a bad game, but it does nothing new and some things rather badly so I don&apos;t see a reason you should pay full price for it. Wait a bit or just stick with any NFS game you already enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3819661">Expand</a></span>

<br>whats the point of having open world but no wheel support that u cant cruise around? there is no story in the game u jus race 4 or 5 times and a minute of some retard talking and tellin that cops are getting madder and **** like that come man mobile racing games do bettter job than you guys.
<br>graphics somewhat good but ur locked to 30fps and and their explanation is that people doesn&apos;t have fast computers? they did the same **** for fifa 14, by using older engine. if people dont have fast computers they can lower the settings and still can enjoy the high fps smoothness not 30 fps bull****.
<br>fifa 14 runs at 130 fps on my laptop it has gt650m gpu like thats pretty much lowest u can get it i7 3630qm processor so people dont have slow computers u guys have slow programmers and minds.
<br>
<br>i have been buyin nfs series each time hoping that they did good job but no last 4 games were garbage i wont buy again doesnt even worth to pirate this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3994864">Expand</a></span>

It is that bad, but not from a &quot;fun&quot; standpoint.  Getting into the game is fun, the world is decently sized and there&apos;s enough mayhem to be had.  However, the implementation on PC is very buggy.  Not only do you get a lack of options as many reviews have pointed out, you get a game that somehow breaks DirectX, causes shutdowns, &quot;Not enough RAM&quot; crashes, etc.  I&apos;ve crashed on average once an hour.
<br>
<br>The kicker is the frame rate, but NOT how everyone is complaining about it.  The game locks the speed of the game to the frame rate.  This causes silly issues if you want a higher framerate.  However, IF YOU DROP BELOW 30FPS YOU SLOW DOWN, BUT THE CLOCK DOES NOT!  I&apos;m playing on a 650M OC&apos;ed, with 2GB&apos;s video RAM, 8GB general RAM, and an i7 Ivy Bridge Quad mobile processor, and the game falls below 30fps on minimum options. It&apos;s ridiculous.
<br>
<br>In addition, the P2P online play is buggy  even directly connections across fast fiber have opponents bouncing around and in different places depending on the player.
<br>
<br>Other quibbles: unskippable, obscenely self-important cutscenes.  Ridiculous menu design that has you scrolling for days, panning across maps with the arrow keys (no mouse) with no zoom.  No organization in &quot;easy drive&quot; menus.
<br>
<br>Crazy rubber banding and AI design  sometimes the racers turbo away at 200+ mph when you have a car that drivers 140, and other times you literally have the ENTIRE pack of racers in a hot pursuit stop and wait for you to catch up (they don&apos;t even speed up as you approach, you can ram them at full speed...).
<br>
<br>Ridiculous physics problems  I&apos;ve been stuck in a rock and had to restart.
<br>
<br>Known bugs such as &quot;not having the correct number of cars in a hot pursuit, leading to automatic failure of event,&quot; with official solution by EA being &quot;restart the even until the correct number of cars appears.&quot;
<br>
<br>Another fun one  if you miss a jump in a pursuit, the game respawns cars back on the side you jumped from at 0mph, but the AI keeps trying (in vain of course, see 0mph issue) and eventually the game spawns the computer car on the other side.  Never for you though!  Insane!
<br>
<br>And then there are faulty helicopters that drop spikes on police, EMPs and other weapons that just decide to fail for no reason, roadblock cars that MOVE INTO THE WAY OF POLICE, roadblocks that don&apos;t have any cars...
<br>
<br>I usually don&apos;t do all caps: this is an exception.
<br>Good concept, terrible PC implementation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3890804">Expand</a></span>

I usually dont wish ill of any hard worker, but Ghost deserved the layoffs, if you don&apos;t know the number 1 rule of developing, &quot;Make sure you main mechanic works&quot;, then you have failed and should not be allowed to continue developing in this industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986696">Expand</a></span>

Let me start off by saying that whatever technical issues the game had when it was first released seem to have been fixed now. It barely skips a beat on my system: X64 OS, i7 processor, 16 GB RAM and GTX570 graphics card. Other complaints are (now) equally unfounded as you CAN skip most of the annoying cutscenes and immature story (by pressing A on the controller or Enter on the keyboard) and Events CAN be restarted.
<br>
<br>The writing is probably the biggest downside in an otherwise class act and the &apos;sexy&apos; female instructor voice is getting a bit old. However, everything else -- from the slick menus to the environmental effects -- has obviously had considerable thought and effort applied to it. All of the little touches -- like the realistic accumulation of dirt on the vehicles -- clearly show how much pride Ghost Games has taken in their work.
<br>
<br>The graphics and gameplay are where this title really shines, although it doesn&#x2019;t look much on the 360. I didn&apos;t care for Hot Pursuit (2010) and Most Wanted (2012) but this game is closer to Burnout Paradise (2009) than any other since and -- for me -- that&apos;s a huge plus. In fact, in many ways it actually improves on the original formula as you would expect. The learning curve is relatively steep but it&apos;s a highly intelligent and rewarding game for those willing to put the effort in. It doesn&apos;t all gel straight away. You have to play it a while to &apos;get it&apos; and appreciate its nuances. I had mixed feelings in the first hour or so but now I have to stop myself playing to go to bed. That&apos;s the sign of a good game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=4155529">Expand</a></span>

<br>-30 fps lock

<br>
<br>Play it on a console if you can, because it&apos;s capped at 30 fps. In my opinion, that&apos;s the only thing holding it back from being the best PC racing game to come out in years. Gameplay is incredibly addictive, story is okay and could be better, cops are aggressively fun, cars rule.</span>

<br>
<br>If you read the hordes of trolling reviews (not recommended), you&apos;ll see almost every last one of them mentions the same two things  and do not talk about the gameplay, story, multiplayer, or even graphics at all. If you are the kind of person that can make a decision based SOLELY on an FPS cap and unskippable cut-scenes, then you don&apos;t want this game, stop reading here.
<br>
<br>For the 5 of you still reading, Need for Speed Rivals is basically Hot Pursuit 4  it draws as much as possible from the 2010 game while thankfully avoiding last year&apos;s disaster. This means that like the 2010 title, it&apos;s all fun and no substance. Most of the same types of events are here  race, interceptor, hot pursuit, etc.
<br>
<br>However, the focus of Rivals isn&apos;t what&apos;s the same, but rather what&apos;s different. The mere presence of cut-scenes MUST mean there&apos;s a story, right? Well... no. There is no story. There are no characters, no rival gangs, no crooked cops, and none of the awesome story from Most Wanted (2005) or Carbon. Just a narrator giving background information about a feud between cops and racers that is never seen in game.
<br>
<br>The funny thing about this game is it has no multiplayer. It also has no singleplayer. When you start a game while on the internet, you are connected to a room with up to 5 other people. While you are progressing as a cop or racer, so are the other players  as well as AI cops and racers. Basically, every player in the room is playing a 1 player game at the same time. If player 3 starts a race, that race also exists for the other players  any cop, human or AI can bust not only player 3, but also their opponents. Your race checkpoints might take you right though another racer&apos;s interceptor, and you might wind up helping or hindering other players and vice-versa. I have personally shutdown every racer in a hot pursuit event without actually busting any of them myself, because another player and two AI cops got them all for me. Also, I once crashed head on into a racer during a rapid response while they were in an interceptor. The crash both wrecked me and busted him, costing both our events.
<br>
<br>This concept is awesome, and it works quite well. But it has two main flaws  first, AI are not allowed to repair. If you&apos;re chasing a group of racers  or being chased by a group of cops, there is little reason to bust/wreck anyone but the human first, as they are the only ones that can refill their health and items. Most Need for Speed titles let the AI do things players cannot (*cough*rubberbanding*cough*) but this title does the reverse. The other flaw is that in each &apos;room&apos;, one player is the &apos;host&apos;. When that player quits, the room is reset and any objectives you completed must be done again. UGH.
<br>
<br>Overall, Need for Speed Rivals is a very fun game, but it&apos;s not too deep. You will be entertained, but don&apos;t expect longevity from this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3844459">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>NFS Rivals DO NOT HAVE:
<br>[&#x2013;] technical problems (v1.1.0)
<br>[&#x2013;] bad or unoptimized graphics (GTX 670, 1080p on Ultra  no lags)
<br>[&#x2013;] bad UI or annoying cut-scenes like in Most Wanted 2012
<br>[+] destructible environment (it&apos;s not needed thou)
<br>[+] cities and vast open world
<br>
<br>NFS Rivals DO have:
<br>[&#x2013;] pretty long tutorial (something like 15 minutes) with unskippable intro cut-scene
<br>[+] no need for mouse
<br>[+] challenging gameplay (no &quot;press X to win&quot;, but also not really hard)
<br>
<br>Game is adrenaline fast: very high speed, limited non-regenerating HP, most time in pursuit by cops, open world with no finish lines (there are ones, but they do not end pursuits), gambling scores (higher heat level  higher money income and more cops; BUT you get money only if you manage to get to one of your garages  otherwise you get NOTHING) and NO PAUSE (at all!! you can&apos;t open map and look for best root, you can&apos;t stop and relax a little, you can only drive forward hoping to get to garage or gas station before your HP gets to zero). It&apos;s the core of this game.
<br>
<br>Concerning other details (as they are not really important)... Mid-sized open world with dynamic daytime and vast variations of zones (plains, canyons, dense forests with narrow roads, snowy mountains, wide highway etc). Zones are pretty short so they&apos;re changing very rapidly. Roads are no straight even of highways and traffic present too, but can&apos;t say it&apos;s too hard driving. As for races they are hard enough: you can lightly get 1st on easy race, but on medium and hard it will be challenging enough: to get 1st the first time you ride particular route is very fortunate.
<br>
<br>What else?.. Tuning is simple: you buy cars and weapons (emp, shockwave, turbo, jamming etc), standard upgrades (acceleration, top speed etc) plus customization for each one. Car are not numerous (it&apos;s a plus!) and different enough. Career progression (you choose tasks among &quot;races&quot;, &quot;pursuits&quot; and &quot;freeride&quot;) and EXPing are really nice. To be short  just enough for arcade racing game.
<br>
<br>And last, but not least: cop career is also fun and with different gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3835597">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game presents an any of new cars with reasonably good handling. All cars ar fully customizable from performance hardware to outlooks. The races are good and enjoyable, added with a new feature of instant head-to-head challenge mode, that allows you to randomly challenge any passer-by racer. The game puts an end to the old lobby based multiplayer system allowing the players to challenge each other in a head-to-head battle or group race directly by spotting each-other in-game. The game takes alot from its ancestors: Hot Pursuit (2010) and Most Wanted (2012) by clubbing up the best of both games. What still lacks is the presence of a strong story, which just like its predecessors it lacks to copme up with. One last and very important thing  Being capped on 30 FPS is just a NOOB&apos;s excuse to dislike such a marvellous game, because any simulation below 24 FPS is considered jerky or laggy above 24 fps, the smoothness just rises. So please think logically before offending unreasonably.

For those of you wondering, the cars no longer have that overly-heavy handling like in Hot Pursuit (2010) and Most Wanted (2012), and drifting is still the name of the game. Even though this is primarily a multiplayer game, when you play against the AI, it can put up a good fight and through some curve balls at you. Also, the different areas of the game world are clearly inspired by previous games in the NFS series, going all the way back to NFS3. Very nostalgic and fun!

                                        <span>This installment of Need for Speed is exactly what you are looking for if you are a fan of the franchise.  It stays true and consistent with its dynamic gameplay seen in preceding NFS games while delivering a surprisingly interesting backstory of racers and cops.  If you enjoyed Most Wanted (by Criterion), this game is a worthy successor  and definitely a must for fans of racing games.</span>

<br>
<br>Graphics are lovely, controls are arcadey as ever  it&apos;s basically a revamped Hot Pursuit (the one before the horrible Most Wanted and The Run)  no bad thing at all...
<br>
<br>It is what it is  fun, glossy, disposable  a perfect little arcade racer to get you through the festive season... just don&apos;t expect it to last much longer after that!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3838310">Expand</a></span>

Being able to race other players with the press of a single button is awesome, and the presence of player cops will always keep you on your toes (haven&apos;t tried the cop career yet, though I imagine it&apos;s a blast taking everyone&apos;s speed points).
<br>
<br>Only negative is the game isn&apos;t amazingly optimized for the PC. I have a few hiccups while running it (though, for comparison, I have none at all while running Battlefield 4).
<br>
<br>This game was a great buy with the $10 off code from McDonald&apos;s for Origin. There is plenty of content and replay value to be worth $40 over and over again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797709">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The unskippable cut scenes that everyone are referring to are in the first few minutes of the game.. after the first 10-15 minutes you can skip cut scenes to your hearts content. In other words, people who have been citing that as a reason for low scores has played 10 minutes or less before ranting here.
<br>
<br>I like this game.. it&apos;s a good arcade racer. The scenery is beautiful and varied ranging from coastal areas to snowy mountains and deserts. The handling is awesome and it really feels like you&apos;re going fast. Music is still a downside for me and I would love to see some sort of user-created playlists or support for your own mp3s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3800638">Expand</a></span>

<br>Is that it? REALLY? These developers, they&apos;ve been much better, long time ago.
<br>
<br>Today we live on a very ironic time, you can use 4 joysticks, but even a racing game allows play with 2.

Gameplay showed some innovations, and the all drive system showed its power connecting me and my fellows. It&apos;s certainly not perfect, because of some minor issues such as gamepad control not changeable, 30fps lock, some disconnections, etc. Customization is not as advertised, relatively shallow and lack of real customization. I am not saying body kits, but the decals are as is, not customizable, and feels not pretty at all. But all in all a legit game, well worth the 50 dollars price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3798607">Expand</a></span>

I will put my name on the line, for what it&apos;s worth, to defend this game, because this game is easily the best NFS title since Most Wanted 2005, and it is being unfairly criticized because of some minor issues that a handful of people are experiencing. I am running the game on a gtx 580 with the latest nvidia drivers (331.85)  and I have had almost no graphical issues whatsoever. The graphics are EXCELLENT, this is the first title on PC that deserves the next-gen qualification. Every single little facet of the game is a TOTAL improvement over previous titles whose foundations this game is built on. It takes features from Most Wanted 2012 and Hot Pursuit and the Run which felt good in theory but embarassingly piss poor in execution, and gives them the proper treatment  they always deserved. The handling and the sound and the environments, which were all generic and not varied enough, and to the point where it felt the developer was treating the audience like a bunch of 10 year old kids, have all been given the proper thought and care for detail that is the most basic requirement for a game to be immersive and thereby great. All the features, from the trinity mission structure, to the scoring and resource system, to the balance of vehicular combat and open-world online play integration, EVERYTHING has been thoroughly thought out, tested and executed flawlessly. This marks the return of the series to form and relevance, the first time since its highs in 2005, and I can honestly say this game will keep me very satisfied until the anticipated next title in this lineage. TL;DR: Objectively, inarguably, the BEST, most FUN, most FLUID and ADDICTIVE NFS title since the days of Underground and Most Wanted. If you have even the remotest desire to relive those experience, but this game now. It is hands down the most professionally crafted game on PC since Arkham City and Skyrim.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3803229">Expand</a></span>

Fps lock to 30, Vehicle Debris still messed up,etc. but the graphics amazing with the frostbite 3, the dynamic weathering system *nerdgasm*. but it still needs development, until then i&apos;d give this game a 7</span>

<br>When i first installed the game it looked very poor and the pop up was unbelievably terrible (unplayable)  after installing what i needed from the above list, the game ran very well with no pop up and better graphics quality.
<br>
<br>My system is an i7 2nd gen  16mb ram  asus gtx560ti 433cores 1.28gpu (mediocre) directx 11 compatible. And the game runs very well.
<br>
<br>The 30fps is an issue because it makes the game hard on the eyes and after playing grid2 the 30 fps rate was a deal breaker for me. It does detract from the enjoyment a lot.
<br>
<br>A lot of the scores are unfair on this page, because I believe most of the problems people are getting with this game are because they have not set up their computer properly to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-rivals/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866040">Expand</a></span>

It stays true and consistent with its dynamic gameplay seen in preceding NFS games while delivering a surprisingly interesting backstory of racers and cops. If you enjoyed Most Wanted (by Criterion), this game is a worthy successor and definitely a must for fans of racing games.</span>
