The story puts you in the middle of a world rebuilt after a war that nearly destroyed everything. The people of this new world once again find themselves in a conflict, this time against the leaders of the old world who escaped into hiding after losing the war.
<br>
<br>The story is pretty good and would make for an interesting reboot with a modern look. As a real-time strategy, it&apos;s actually pretty fun. The voice acting is decent and the game looks good for a 2001 release, but definitely outdated by todays standards. The game utilizes a 3D map, which is a nice change for RTS games released around the same time. The controls are different than I expected for an RTS. I usually like to micromanage my units, but with Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising you don&apos;t have that ability. There are an array of different units you can create, each with their own abilities and shortcomings, Unlike more popularly known titles such as the Command and Conquer games, in Antaeus Rising you have the ability to individually upgrade units with armor, shields and so on.
<br>
<br>All in all, while it might be a bit dated, it is a decent RTS and is worth picking up if you are into old school Real Time Strategy games. Personally, I would like to see this on a reboot list at some point in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hostile-waters-antaeus-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=5390450">Expand</a></span>

As for graphics, they will obviously be ugly compared to those of more modern games, but, hey, this game was made in 2001, so give it a break. It was great at the time. Now for the gameplay. What a wonderful combination of real-time strategy and third-person shooter elements! Yes, it has the action, but you really need think, and start being strategic. And I love the resource management. The sound and music were excellent as well. What pains me is that there was no multiplayer. If it had multiplayer, then it would be a great game perfected. Unfortunately, the game only has a story mode, so once you beat the game, that&apos;s it. But it takes about 20-30 hours to complete, and a second playthrough is worth it, so that&apos;s like 40-60 hours. In conclusion, this is the best game nobody plays. I hope one day, someone will remake this game, solve all its issues and I&apos;ll buy it on day one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hostile-waters-antaeus-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=2776308">Expand</a></span>
