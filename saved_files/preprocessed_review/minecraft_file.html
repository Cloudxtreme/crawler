Minecraft is certainly a revolutionary game having rocketed the procedurally-generated voxel based world to a place in history.  However, it hasn&apos;t progressed past its first steps.  The game, if you can even call it that, hasn&apos;t really developed into anything lasting even though its been in development for almost 2 years with more feedback prior to official release than probably any other game.<br><br>It doesn&apos;t take very long with the game to encounter any one of its numerous faults: buggy features (even with a revisit, the mine carts have numerous problems), incomplete features (achievements are basically filler and the nether was a waste of development time), a complete lack of multiplayer server browsing, stupid AI, and to top it all off the game is essentially over within a few hours - you can obtain all of the items and see all of the sites and enemies in one sitting.  This all assumes that your computer will even run the game as many systems encounter memory leaks that guarantee crashing with just a few minutes of play.  It upsets me that the critics completely overlooked these many short comings as though the game is perfect.  The worst part is that many of these problems have existed for months and there is still no indication that they&apos;ll be fixed anytime soon.  Without providing the proper feedback, Minecraft may never actually get the serious attention it requires to earn the grade it has received.  There is just so much potential in a voxel engine and Minecraft hasn&apos;t even begun to tap it.  It&apos;s just a matter of time before someone else comes along with a better product because Minecraft simply doesn&apos;t deliver.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1973688">Expand</a></span>

The ending is poorly done an innovative compared to the other concepts in the game. After these newer updates, minecraft has become seemingly random. It started as a creativity game, but started getting odd RPG elements like leveling, dragon bosses, fortresses, and enchanting. All of which seem prehistoric compared to modern games. If you are looking for enjoyment, it is in the building. That is where this game soars. It&apos;s awesome to build castles and mines, but I wish it hadn&apos;t strayed so much. I blame Notch&apos;s laziness. Notch slowed his updates to a crawl once he got rich and started vacationing most of the time. Minecon&apos;s high ticket price makes me think that it was for-profit and it make it harder to respect the MineCraft game/company. So, overall, MineCraft ended up as a messy, unfinished game with strange elements, but being creative can lead to lots of fun. You just have to come up with the creativity yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1973748">Expand</a></span>

Not only does &quot;Virtual Legos&quot; come without a manuel, it also is way over priced. I do not believe that minecraft is worth more than $5.

With this knowledge, i can really say it: alpha 1.2.6 was the best part of Minecraft, and it would deserve 10. But since then, adding incomplete stuff and ruining it&apos;s point have ruined it&apos;s final score, too. But, even therefore there&apos;s so many stupid and incomplete stuff (NPC&apos;s, villages, etc. etc.) I love it. I love it the damn outta it. It really is not a game; you can not say &quot;Minecraft has bored me, I am leaving&quot;. You just open it sometimes and play. It&apos;s not like &quot;I like it&quot; or &quot;I don&apos;t like it&quot;, since it&apos;s YOUR game. You decide what are you doing in your fantastic, randomly generated world and your own decision is, what you&apos;ll build, and what will you see. You can build, you can discover or you can kill everything in sight. Whatever you choose, it&apos;s your game and even if you don&apos;t like building, you can for example go and look for dungeons, and vice versa. It can never make you bored as if you&apos;ll get bored of something, you can always make something different. The point of my score (9 out of 10) is just because of Notch&apos;s decision to make it more RPG like than sandbox like. Yeah, you still can ignore villages and strongholds and keep building, but still it makes me feel like I&apos;m playing incomplete Diablo clone than 100% complete, full and enjoyable sandbox game. I enjoyed 1.2.6 alpha more, but 1.0.0 release is still, by far, the most enjoyable game... ever made? Maybe. That&apos;s because the possibilities are endless. If I&apos;ll ever get bored of this game... I&apos;ll do something else in my beautiful world. Funny, how 9 out of 10 game is more enjoyable than games I&apos;ve rated 10. And I feel really bad of having incomplete game as the release version. But now... back to my mine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1950003">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer experience allows you to play online with your friends to go on more adventures in this blocky world, or just to create epic structures. The 3 modes that you can play on are survival, creative (unlimited resources, and items), and hardcore (basically survival, but if you die your world is deleted without any recovery). The amount of mods for this game and neat texture packs will have you scouring the internet for the ones you love, making the game even more personal to you without any extra charge.

I stuck with the game a while as these elements were said to be improving as the game neared release. Roll on to a few versions near before release and still the gameplay was primitive but some new features had crept in and the final version started to sound like it had promise from what was being told, I started to gain more interest in the game again which I had left alone for months. A few weeks back and the final 1.0 is announced so I try to log into minecraft (bear in mind the login name still persists in its entry box of both my windows PC and linux notebook so I know they are correct and I have the details written down and kept somewhere safe) and I get an error message - login failed. I have since tried to get the game to work again - lost password, lost account, hack request, etc have no effect on the main site and it looks like my account has vanished, my emails to mojang go unanswered for weeks, I even tried an attempt to tweet the developer but no answer. Sorry but I cannot rate a game higher than 0 that is not playable in any shape or form, and for them to lose/wipe my account details after having paid is shocking and it looks like it will go unresolved. If you pay for the game I hope you dont have this happen to you, but I know for one I wont being giving mojang any more of my cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1986864">Expand</a></span>

<br>It can also be hysterically frightening in a panicky kind of way, when you&apos;ve just mined a bunch of high value ores down in a deep and dark cave and suddenly run into a bunch of monsters.
<br>It&apos;s very hyped at the moment, but coming from someone who bought it earlier this year I think it deserves all the attention it&apos;s currently getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1392434">Expand</a></span>

I have been checking up with Minecraft since its alpha stages, back when the only player modes were some weird survival and creative, and zombies dropped feathers.  People like to root for the underdog, and I understand.  So, of course, people root for Notch.  But if you separate yourself from the emotions and the novelty, you realize that Minecraft is vastly unfinished upon release.  Promises made by Notch, for example, included various game modes like capture the flag, and a fully-functioning NPC village, among others I won&apos;t even bother listing.  Yes, I play this game.  I do like it to some degree, which is why I&apos;m giving it a 4 out of 10.  But the reality is that, when you compare it to everything on the market, nay, just compare it to other indie games, and you realize just how hard Notch dropped the ball on this one.  The graphics are atrocious, and the term &quot;retro graphics&quot; don&apos;t justify it.  Chrono Trigger is &quot;retro&quot; and still a beautiful game, so calling something retro to justify it being plain and ugly is awful.  The music is serene, but nice.  The combat is unvaried and unfortunately dull when it comes to the majority of the game, but the brewing/potion system and enchanting added a little to the game.  Shame your only two real weapons are swords and bows.
<br>
<br>The strength in Minecraft&apos;s programming comes from Jeb and, guess what, people other than Team Mojang.  It&apos;s the mods and add-ons that aren&apos;t from Team Mojang that make this game actually fun and entertaining, and people tend to forget that.  If you mod the heck out of it, great, fantastic, good game.  But stand-alone it&apos;s an incredibly monotonous, uninspired simulator.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2362663">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game, if you can call it that, relies on the user to make their own fun that, while interesting for the first few hours, will quickly become boring and tedious.

The AI is really bad and the NPCs merely exist (they don&apos;t talk, interact with you or even run when attacked).  The game has been in beta development for years and is still bug ridden after the &quot;official release&quot; this year.  It&apos;s sold well but once you play, you&apos;ll see how much the developer has dropped the ball with giving meaningful updates and listening to the community.  It takes me 15 minutes to log into MY OWN server due to Minecrafts central server having issues with validation.  Anyone else trying to log in has the same problems.  The game gets very boring to play by yourself (but once again, good luck getting other players on your server).  The end dimension is very pointless and you can tell that there wasn&apos;t much effort put into coming up with it, as with most of their other updates...just read the update history and you&apos;ll see:  Mooshroom cows for example.<br><br>Don&apos;t buy this and get Terraria instead.  You can usually get it for under $3 on Steam (it goes on sale all the time) and it&apos;s a much better made (and less buggy) game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2060684">Expand</a></span>

The building and mining is incredibly boring. The &quot;exploration&quot; is an absolute waste of time. The entire game is the same thing with slightly different textures. What a waste of money.</span>

This game is an excellent example of wasted potential.  It became popular as a building/Lego game with small combat elements to keep you on your toes.  Now it&apos;s a game about swinging pixelated swords at  things until they fall over.  The world is so cluttered with &apos;dungeons&apos; now that it&apos;s impossible to dig for five minutes without breaking into another spider pit.  The height limit hasn&apos;t been raised since pre-alpha, so you won&apos;t be building anything taller than the London Tower or digging anything deeper than your swimming pool.  The multiplayer is buggy, incomplete, and lacks the tools for proper moderation.  This game is so incomplete that there is literally no one that plays this game vanilla.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1950298">Expand</a></span>

There are far better actually complete games (that have only been around for as long as the Beta&apos;s) you can spend your money on. Look at games around or under the &#xC2;&#xA3;17 mark, check it&apos;s metacritic score is more then 50 and buy it. I can pretty much guarantee it will be a far better *game* then this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1972149">Expand</a></span>

The combat is boring and repetitive. The few amounts of weapons and armor are all the same, they just have a different color. The AI... they suck. Get close to them, you loose health. You just spam attack from a distance and kill them. You block them in a hole, they can&apos;t get out. Then you have the NPCs.... THEY DO NOTHING! You can&apos;t talk to them, can&apos;t trade items with them, you can&apos;t do anything with them! The dungeons? All the same. Filled with the same boring AI inside them. The only enjoyable element of this game is building structures alone or with friends.... WHICH YOU CAN DO FOR FREE ON MINECRAFT CLASSIC! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Its not worth 30 bucks, its no better then any other free java game on the web.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1973760">Expand</a></span>

I mean for starters you can&apos;t give this game a perfect score when it has 70&apos;s graphics yet it came out last year.</span>

It haven&apos;t lost its touch, and there is something for everyone, no matter what your age.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4792815">Expand</a></span>

<br>Although i do not enjoy the Single-Player Mode,since it kinda bored easily when you alone on the world,the multiplayer,shows how great this game was,it was like Life-Consumer xD
<br>The graphics through,its not really bad,but i think you can know the blocks easily,its charming textures that reminds how good the game graphic was.
<br>Thats all for my review,so my last verdict about the review is,Better play with friends and also,the game makes its better if the people show their creativity rather than none.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3141966">Expand</a></span>

Technic is one of them (mod pack) Adds so many new things to the game that makes it awesome. I don&apos;t know how people can give this below a 6. The graphics are supposed to be like that. Why do you think they allow texture packs? Anywhere from 1x1 to 512x512.</span>

But all the mods, maps, texture packs etc etc is what makes the game have a huge re-playability. But vanilla could get boring fastly, so try some mods and maps. Could be really fun. Oh and multiplayer with a few friends always makes more fun.</span>

The only limits in this game are the limits of your own imagination.  Graphically, in Vanillia, it&apos;s hard to rate.  The simple blocky graphics are charming and endearing to some (myself included) whereas super ugly to others.  But if you find the vanillia graphics ugly, download and install one of the plethora of user made texture packs.  I guess it is easy to criticize the simple combat mechanices, but again, this game is what you make of it.  Most Minecraft hardcores don&apos;t play the game to have a fight, we play the game to build and socialize (if playing on a server).  Any review is going to be 100% biased based on the users personal experience with the game.  What I&apos;m trying to get across is don&apos;t listen to any of these reviews.  If you&apos;re interested, buy the game and play it for yourself, and create your own experience.  This game is a breath of fresh air in today&apos;s gaming industry, and I can wholeheartedly recommend that you at least give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2794488">Expand</a></span>

Building can go on for centuries. You never truely run out of things to do. You may run out of creative things to create in the time you play. But all and all i think this game deserves what it has. Its a very nice game.</span>

Fun for all ages, this game is both a realistic and creativity-challenging game with good fictional content and also good graphics. I enjoy this game and have finished it too.</span>

It was a game that lost its point and turned from a simple peaceful farming game into a tolkin RPG  with farming element.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2910933">Expand</a></span>

An incredible idea that was executed flawlessly, Minecraft is the best of its genre and can easily rival major titles. Minecraft proves that while simplicity might be requisite in an indie game, it can be used to make something much greater. It takes a massive world, a player, and produces an infinite number of solutions.  Exploration is always overlooked in video games. Developers focus on things like mechanics, challenge, variety, interactivity, and visuals, but don&apos;t realize that if given an environment that allows players to freely conquer each of those aspects, their work is done. All a player needs is tools and the internet, because someone will gain enough interest in a game to learn everything about it, and the resulting cascade is a devoted fan base.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3431188">Expand</a></span>

If other game was developed by hundreds of people, this one, has been developed by a single person, Notch. His game is completely awesome. There are some bugs/glitches, though, but it will be fixed soon. It&apos;s really worth buying it.</span>

There is a great community for the game that have produces almost countless add-ons, mods and texture packs.</span>

<br>Introduction:
<br>This is my very first structured review where my review will not be in paragraph form, so this may be slightly lacking in quality of writing, and I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this review.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>Gameplay is the essence of MineCraft, without MineCraft&#x2019;s signature gameplay, it would be nothing.  MineCraft&#x2019;s gameplay is original and interesting in almost every way.  The point of MineCraft is to survive in an infinite world that is peaceful and serene by day, and hostile and evil by night.  A player starts by beating down trees with their bare hands in order to start their way towards building their first shelter to survive their first Zombie, Skeleton, and Creeper filled night.  From this point on there is almost no structure to MineCraft, you can do what YOU want, set YOUR own goals, do you want to upgrade your tools to the next tier, add that nice new expansion to your house that you wanted, or start brewing potions to take on one of the game&#x2019;s two bosses.  But once you have built the ultimate house, filled your inventory with diamond tools and armor, defeated every boss and pillaged every dungeon, the game is not over.  Once you feel as though the standard MineCraft formula is getting a little slow, you can go online to get mods that continue to change and revolutionize the game.  From simple additions that add more enemies to the game, or a mod that changes the game almost completely.  MineCraft&#x2019;s gameplay is truly never ending so long as it&#x2019;s community continues to support it.
<br>
<br>Music/Sounds:
<br>MineCraft&#x2019;s music and sound are so in line, so perfectly fitting to the situation that they appear in, C418 has set the mood to MineCraft perfectly.  With Subwoofer Lullaby playing in the background as you peruse the landscapes, or hearing Dry Hands as you carefully lurk throughout a cave, the song capitalizing on your fear that something might be following you.  The soundtrack truly makes itself at home in this game, and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine any music fitting better.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>These don&#x2019;t really matter, but they are something to talk about.  The graphics in this game are not meant to look modern or beautiful.  Whether it was for style or for the ease of making a building system, the fact that everything is made of cubes or rectangular prisms really gives the game feeling.  You wouldn&#x2019;t think so, but sometimes you can see some pretty beautiful vistas as you explore throughout this game.  The retro feeling low resolution textures really give the game a retro type feeling, while the game still uses modern day gaming conventions.
<br>
<br>Technological:
<br>Technologically, MineCraft is not too advanced, but it is nothing to be trifled.  MineCraft is well optimized so it can be run on non high-end computers to keep the audience wider.  Although MineCraft is nothing special from a technological standpoint, it still makes up for this in the same way retro games did, by having great music and gameplay.
<br>
<br>Verdict:
<br>
<br>MineCraft is a very good game, placing as the sixth most sold PC game of all time, with good reason.  The way it has the retro feeling graphics, the modern day gaming conventions, the  pure creativity that allows for seemingly anything to be created, the modern soundtrack that fits in with the game like two parts of a jigsaw puzzle, and the fact that the game&#x2019;s fanbase has been able to watch the game blossom and grow since the alpha.  MineCraft truly is a one of a kind game, except for the 4 or 6 games that seem all too inspired by it.

With heavy fantasy elements and, despite the blocky nature, an extremely immersive game that does stand out in the crowd. Music is light and chip-tune, but once you&apos;ve been listening to the same music for hours it starts to not only put you to sleep, but gets annoying. Music discs offer good alternatives and all of the songs appealed to me. But you can mute the music, problem solved. Combat, although just a small part of the game, is just click the right mouse button until the thing dies. However combat isn&apos;t a focus, whereas exploration, creation, and imagination are rewarded and focused on. Solo, Minecraft gets stale after a considerably long while, but with friends your enjoyment extends nearly limitless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177118">Expand</a></span>

But I&apos;m not going to make this statement without backing it up. I first started playing minecraft after a friend showed it to me. Back then, it&apos;s freedom, pixelated beauty, and atmosphere of mystery and exploration drew me like a magnet. It was a beacon  a lighthouse illuminating the horrid state of the games I was playing. I bought the game almost immediately after and right away fell in love. As I was then a newcomer, the community welcomed me. More so than any  mainstream multiplier-capable game I&apos;ve ever played. Instead of rejecting me, treating me like something to be laughed at, I was assisted by other players. Minecraft drew my attention to other great indie games. Far better that the mainstream shooters could ever hope to be. I looked back on the games I had once played with scorn and (mainly) regret. I&apos;ve found games in the Indie community that can out match any game run by a large company. Some of these games include Kerbal Space Program, Ace Of Spades Classic, Terraria, and much more. I see minecraft as not only a game, but the prominent and most well-known game among the indie game community. I&apos;m sick and tired of on-rail games. They&apos;re a thing of the past. Steam has the greenlight service for a reason. I&apos;m among the group of gamers who are tired of games in which  the only people that have freedom are the creators, and in which the players are penalized for not adhering to the game&apos;s brutal story line of the game. And what if I don&apos;t want to fight in an endless and arbitrary war? On-rail games often depict an extraordinary world, yet confine the players to a battlefield often no bigger than that of an airport- and those are the biggest maps I&apos;ve seen. They offer no degree of freedom, individuality, or creativeness. Minecraft and some other games I&apos;ve seen in the indie community can often, in my opinion, be classified as art. That is much much more than could be said about some shooters. And when you hate and just can&apos;t stand minecraft&apos;s pixelated textures, get  or make a texture pack. If you get bored of the game play, install a mod or make your own. Minecraft, after all, is only limited by your imagination.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190573">Expand</a></span>

All round this game is really fun with minor bugs that are usually fixed but the game gets boring after a couple maps and that is where the community comes in they make interesting mods, maps and texture packs for you to play with.

When you first start out, it&apos;s just a simple building game. In your survival world you build incredibly boring houses and finding a diamond makes you feel accomplished. But once you find out about the community of this game you realize what it truly has to offer. From adventure maps to bukkit servers, you can pretty much do anything in this game. The customization is incredible. This game pretty much offers INFINITE gameplay, and every time is unique. Frequent updates make it easier to make maps for, consequently making maps better. You can attempt to create an incredibly sophisticate redstone computer, or just download someone else&apos;s.  The possibilities are endless. Mojang may not be able to create another gem like this, but they already have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201531">Expand</a></span>

The closest thing you can get to  &quot;quests&quot; are achievements. So, how did the developers make this game fun? They created a world that tested the player. Games that are made to be beaten are never fun. Games like Minecraft that capitalize on the EXPERIENCE are the games that succeed. Minecraft molds a simple, yet authentic world that exploratory and creative gamers everywhere crave. If the player has these traits (as most should), Minecraft offers your wet dream, come true. It opens doors that other games feared to open, fearing bad publicity. It sucks you in and won&apos;t let you out until
<br>
<br>With all this, however, the game is not perfect. Lighting errors. Shifty boat/mine cart travel. Lag. Exploits. Filler achievements. (Open inventory. Really? A four-year-old can press the E button). These things can take you out of this gorgeous world and into a mediocre one. Also, certain aspects of the game are hard to grasp by simpler players who also want to explore and create. Not many gamers will &quot;get&quot; how to make some of the game&apos;s items or blocks. And don&apos;t even get me started on redstone wiring...
<br>
<br>However, I am nitpicking by pointing out the lows of this game; it&apos;s very awesome (and I don&apos;t just mean &quot;cool&quot;, I mean &quot;it puts me in awe&quot;). There&apos;s literally no end to this game. It does not tell you what you need to do; rather, YOU tell IT what to do. You can change the world, man! If you think that a mountain is in your way, you can blow it to kingdom come with your TNT! If you decide that your house just isn&apos;t big enough, you can expand it in any direction! You can literally go to Hell and back! You can RIDE PIGS! You can build the stairway to heaven! You can go as far as you want! THERE IS NO END TO MINECRAFT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3603672">Expand</a></span>

<br>Secondly, it&apos;s beautiful game. Not talking about graphics, but style. Rain, snow, night - everything is really well-made.
<br>And thirdly, feel of discovery is awesome.
<br>Its a great game and you should at least try it.</span>

If you are a creative person who does not follow the directions that came with Lego sets, you will spend countless hours perfecting your builds.  The successful Minecraft players are the ones that can think for themselves, which is in short supply these days.  Even if you are not a very creative person you might find the social aspect of servers, which open up the possibility to explore and help other people with their builds rewarding.  The default graphics are nothing special, but the game does have built-in option to change textures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3383310">Expand</a></span>

Add steel! make the nether more inclusive! add more tools and weapons! make the armor look less boring! do something more! it is alive purely by modders! fix that!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3397861">Expand</a></span>

<br>Design: 4 /5 (constantly in-development, but no improvement to rudimentary core mechanics)
<br>Polish: 3 /5 (&quot;stylized&quot; if simplistic graphics, buggy and finicky at times, generally poorly optimized)
<br>Value: 5 /5 (a toolset of unlimited potential that re-defines the sandbox genre at a very fair price)
<br>
<br>---Review---
<br>Agency and freedom are two things that I value highly in games, and on both of those counts Minecraft is a brilliant and innovative success. The number of Minecraft-inspired, voxel-based sandbox clones is all the more impressive if you take into account how the original game came out of nowhere. However, despite its dominating position, one could definitely see how another game might be able to do what Minecraft does but better.
<br>
<br>This is because Minecraft simply hasn&apos;t improved significantly since its early Beta stages. Although the continuous development process is a good thing in and of itself, the quality of the updates to the game thereby churned out is inconsistent at best. While detours into the lackadaisical might have been more understandable when Notch- the game&apos;s original creator- was solely responsible for development, the game continues to receive updates that seem directionless and poorly conceived. At best new features seem random and disconnected from the rest of the game, and at worst they amount to little more than introducing simplified versions of popular community mods into the vanilla game.
<br>
<br>I suspect that Mojang is simply too afraid to tinker with even the minor details of the core experience as it existed from the game&apos;s beginning, and thus they believe that piling more underdeveloped content on is the way to ensure the game&apos;s longevity. The result is a fun game that hasn&apos;t reached its full potential and that probably won&apos;t do so until Mojang ventures to introduce some complexity into the game&apos;s core systems, instead of relying on the emergent depth of gameplay that Notch fortunately happened upon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439429">Expand</a></span>

Anyone who though a game needs a story to be good just got proven wrong. Great soundtrack smooth graphics, great A.I and one of the best multiplayer experiences ever. Buy this game.</span>

<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t want to buy this game, I got talked into it and I must say its some of the best money I have spent in gaming recently.
<br>
<br>Updates are frequent, but what really makes this game amazing is the modding community.</span>

The final boss, the Ender Dragon, is very easy, though Minecraft is mostly for the creative aspect.  This game really hits its mark when it comes to the online community.  Thousands of servers are populated to play hundreds of mini-games in Minecraft, with more games being created all the time.  The mods expand the single player and multiplayer survival to unthinkable lengths.  Mods add so many things to the game, such as blocks, enemies, and even quests.

Theres hundreds of things to do in Mincraft build a house, kill zombies and other monsters roaming around the world or go exploring in giant caves or go into creative mode and let your imagination run free theres so much to do and thats just the single player. multi players is the best part of Mincraft in my opinion and theres so many servers and so many games in those servers. spleef, hunger games, TNT run just to name a few to sum up this game i say its its computer legos, it gives you the power to do anything you want that barley any games are doing now in days. get this game  if you have a pc its worth the 20 bucks</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3618830">Expand</a></span>

<br>The uniquness of servers makes this game fun, for example making a faction and trying to maintain it with other players while defending it from rivalry factions or attacking rivalry factions.
<br>
<br>Or creative servers where you build as free as you can.
<br>
<br>The ability to play with MODS which change the game like for example, Biblio Craft it adds furniture to the game. Or Mo&apos; Creatures, adding tons of animals to the game. There are tons of mods for everyone&apos;s liking&apos;s and can change the game completely.

The way they add new things all the time, for free of charge.  Is so generous of the Swedish company.  Its a very creative game.  Anyone who would play Minecraft would know that its a game of a 1000 games.  Anyone can play it young or old.  There are plenty of servers. Many blocks and mods to keep you building.  Also Minecraft has survival to survive the night and defeat the wither and the EnderDragon.  It has to be the indie game that changed the gaming industry for a long time.  The mechanics arent much, but its easy to learn.  If you don&apos;t like the small blocky graphics there are resource packs that change the sounds and textures.  It can go from around 3x3 per block/item, to 5012x5012!  Its a great game to keep your kids away from shooting and violent games.  Its very cheap and you dont need much to play the game.  It runs on Mac, Windows, Linux.  You need at least 2gbs of RAM and around a few MegaBytes of space.  I highly recomend the game, its fun to bring friends and family closer. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4028786">Expand</a></span>
