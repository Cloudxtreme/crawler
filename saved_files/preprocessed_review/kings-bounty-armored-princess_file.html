As a translation from Russian, the humour and interesting plot transfer perfectly into English.

The game features a number of quality of life and balance changes, the biggest of which is a fast travel system (as the content in armored princess is organized into continents, approximately 1 chapter per continent), the ability to fly on the world map (acquired about half way through the game), and a reward for allowing drastically lower level enemies flee. Unfortunately the difficulty curve is just as punishing, if not more so than the first game. If your playing normal or above difficulty expect the game to become unplayable before you get the second of 8 stones. Even if you struggle through certain units and spells can allow the enemies to cripple you financially even if you beat them (spells like armageddon and geyser in particular). Another annoying aspect of the game is the balance, or lack there of between the classes and spell schools. Distortion magic has the vast majority of the most useful spells, including both buffs, movement spells, and damage spells (geyser) that trivializes the other two schools. Similarly of the three classes the mage is vastly underpowered do to the unfortunately poor scaling of spell damage (and a lack of talents that are generally usefull). The items in the game are also problematic, far more items than in the original game are parts of item sets that give additional bonuses by wearing all the items in the set. Unfortunately the random item spawns for sale makes completing sets relatively rare (in beating the game 3 times on Easy I have yet to see all the peices of the princess or virgin set in one play through). Finally a certain item related to the plot line which you basically need to obtain to beat the game unfortunately forces you to use the new Lizardman units. Chosing units is one of my favorite parts of king&apos;s bounty and I strongly disliked having my choices basically taken away from me. While I am a big fan of King&apos;s Bounty and have put in quite a bit of time with armored princess if I could I would go back and stop myself from buying it for 45$, the lack of balance and the limited new resources (most the art/engine is simply recycled from the first game) makes this game a solid buy for fans at a 20-25$ price point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-armored-princess/user-reviews?user_review_id=741450">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty settings are also true to their namesakes as well. Easy will appeal to casual players, Normal should be just challenging enough for most players, us veterans are truly challenged by Hard, and Impossible may very well be impossible, I&apos;ll find out on my next play-through. It is worth noting that the items and units that will be available to you change on every play through - this means you can&apos;t know what to expect on each play-through exactly, but my experience has been that you can&apos;t truly be screwed over by this factor as some have stated - it simply means you may need to vary your tactics and switch up your armies as the game progresses to adapt to changing circumstances. All the same, I found that even on Hard there&apos;s no fight that you can&apos;t win with thoughtfulness and fight-appropriate unit selection. Some may find the storyline dry due to its almost entirely text-based nature, though frankly I rather appreciated the writing for what it was - even translated the dialogue is witty and engaging. Even at full price on Steam, I felt I got every penny&apos;s worth out of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-armored-princess/user-reviews?user_review_id=742715">Expand</a></span>

The genius of the game is that the limited numbers of units force the player to gradually change their armies throughout the game: from generally human-filled armies to mixes of dragons, lizards, demons, and elves. Thus the game never grows stale: certain units will complement each other, and part of the fun is seeing which five units can cause the most damage at a particular point in the game. A drawback to AP is--in my view--the randomization, which (though it encourages replayability) also means you can get extremely punishing opponents early in the game. (I nearly gave up on my Paladin around level 12 or 14; but after the early 20&apos;s, the game got a *lot* easier.) So: a completely gorgeous, addictive game that could have used a few more good ideas (having to constantly restock armies requires more micromanagement than I enjoy).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-armored-princess/user-reviews?user_review_id=743171">Expand</a></span>

Armoured princess is even BETTER than King&apos;s Bounty. It&apos;s as if they took the first game, race tuned it, and let it go. Anyone who loves strategy should play this game. I&apos;ve been playing nothing else for the last 2 weeks. I&apos;m having a blast; every time you replay all the artifacts and troops are redistributed so you have to develop new strategies- you cannot play the same way twice, if you do you&apos;ll get ground down to nothing. The graphics are colourful, the game has never crashed in two weeks of continuous play, there are new elements of gameplay (Spoiler: Anybody like the idea of flying across the lands??) and there is an entire new creature set - the lizardmen. My Christmas came early !!!!! Thank you, King&apos;s Bounty developers... (PS Also give eleven legacy a try - another great underdog...same kind of thing, also very clever...)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-armored-princess/user-reviews?user_review_id=740930">Expand</a></span>

Nevertheless, strip off the fluff and you are left with game play that is in essence the same as before. The question then becomes &quot;how much of that can you handle before you get bored&quot;. In many ways this is a better game than KB: TL from both a technical and a game play perspective. The talent trees make more sense. No glitching on Windows 7 64 bit.  But the story of this game is also more serious in tone and much of the fun of the original game came from it&apos;s irreverent attitude.  Armored Princess has more spit and polish but fundamentally doesn&apos;t try to reinvigorate the franchise. If you loved KB:TL and wanted more the same, that&apos;s the good news.  But if you were hoping to see where the developers would go next, it&apos;s a bit of a disappointment.  I can&apos;t help but agree with the one Critic Review that says that this is great game if you are fan of the genre but that everyone else can pass it up.  That makes rating the game difficult.  If you love the stuff it&apos;s worth a 10.  But if it&apos;s not your cup of tea it&apos;s worth nothing.  As someone who enjoys it, but only for a change of pace, I&apos;m giving it a seven.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-armored-princess/user-reviews?user_review_id=1595833">Expand</a></span>

Mediocre soundtrack, generic story and repetitive battles since you can only win them by using your pet dragon. You will always be the underdog and Armored Princess is pretty much a survival mode before you can activate your dragon. The game does look nice but feels like a grind.</span>

Be warned that it can be a rather difficult game, but that simply makes it all the more rewarding. Combat is very smooth and balanced. Many improvements from The Legend, but many of my favourite features were also removed.</span>

Completely</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Real-time Heroes of Might &amp; Magic clone with less focus on castle defense and more RPG elements. Very derivative but has a long main quest with a large world map. More exploration and plot-heavy than HoMM, but not much else is original about it. Armored Princess has a lot of new features so I&apos;d recommend just getting this one over the original since they&apos;re almost the same game. Completely average and muddled with uneven difficulty, this might be worth picking up if you&apos;re a fan of HoMM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-armored-princess/user-reviews?user_review_id=2820248">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you can sacrifice the caste building and resource collecting from HOMAM games in exchange for WASTELY SUPERIOR tactical battles with a lot of challenge, King&apos;s Bounty games are what you are looking for.
