You have to pay for at least one additional month before you can use the free month that comes with the box. It becomes a very expensive ($75) risk to take on a game so many people find horrible.</span>

You have so many options to choose from as far as building your character and once you do chose you can always change again. Example you can switch from Proxy Master to Arbalest very easily! Be warned you must go through the ability tree and find out what you would like to be so your character is more powerfull in your chosen ability tree. Yes, the game is addicting. If you dont like conflict please go with a non hostile server! as PVP is always on the hostile servers!! The game is not bug free but you tell me which online game isnt?! Right? Anyway, there are several live events going on that carry the story forward such as Morpheus&apos;s Assasination. Vampires and Werewolfs runnin around tryin to kick ur arse! Also, Niobe will jack in once in a while and give you special tips about future events or even special missions! There are so many things to do in The Matrix Online but beware once you reach level 50 all youll want to do is gank people and wait for the next event, maybe recruit some more people to your faction OR start another character in another server. In any event, the exciting thing about the game is that they are still adding on more abilities and activities to do. This game has drastically improved since the BETA and i expect more exciting stuff from it. The Devs are very receptive to the bugs that are reported to them and are diligent to fixing them and to add more content. I cant believe the new Citadel Coder ability, its sick! Last event Redpills had to fight these huge monsters made out of flies it was just chaos in MegaCity. I wonder if they are going to collect all of the live events and make a movie out of it?? Hmmmmm!! and a side note i dont blame anyone for tryng to make a lil extra money. This is America where the dollar is the God most people Trust.

I was in the beta test for the last week of it, and I can honestly say that this game is something NEW to the MMORPG genre and DIFFERENT and believe it or not quite FUN. If you are expecting some standard run of the mill MMORPG like EQ or WOW gameplay experience this is not for you. Mxo has a team of live actors in the game role playing as the major characters and moving the story along - which is absolutley awesome. I am totally compelled by the fact that this game is telling a continuing story and that it dovetails right from the end of the third film. Having 20 people paid to be live actors in the game and letting me participate in the story is just fantastic. It&apos;s like being able to jump into a live tv show and join in. The dev team has shown their commitment to this game and more importantly the community many times and frankly, I&apos;ve found the MxO community to be the best, most mature group of people out of any of the MMORPG&apos;s I&apos;ve played. Even if you don&apos;t like the Matrix fiction that much I still reccomend this game because the gameplay stands on its own. I&apos;ve encountered very little problems with the game so far and nothing outside of what you would expect for the launch of a new MMORPG title. You should get into this game NOW before you miss out on the unfolding story.

I like to consider myself a casual game player but this game has me so hooked I seem to be playing it more than I could have anticipated. Does this make me hardcore? I definitely give this game a solid 10, since it is the best game I&apos;ve ever played of this type and it is not all about dragons and dungeons which is kind of played out and aimed at kiddes. This just seems more adult. Anyway, the game is cool. Definitely worth buying and trying out for while. This was the first game I preordered in my life and I have to say that I&apos;m glad I did it.

Night clubs are the place to hang out and listen to RFZ. It does have it&apos;s problem like most MMPs in early stages of being released, but makes up for it in story content.</span>
