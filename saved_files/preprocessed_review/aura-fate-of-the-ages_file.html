For the annoying points, you spend the first 2-3 hours of play trying to solve puzzles that simply cannot be because the order is wrong, and doing a lot of screen scraping to make sure you find everything. I use &quot;puzzle&quot; in quotes as the definition of puzzles here is to find one obscure item, plug it into another that may or may not make sense, and then move along to start on the next obscure item. There is no real coherent reason why most puzzles are even there, which brings me to the last point, the story or lack of. It is such a light story that you never really feel part of anything at all. Again like Myst, I felt I glided through the game, separate to it, not acting as a character in the game. A fine game for for Myst heads, for the rest of us, well, there&apos;s a reason why this genre of puzzle/adventure games are niche (and probably extinct) at this stage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aura-fate-of-the-ages/user-reviews?user_review_id=2564222">Expand</a></span>

The story is weak and the storytelling is worse, but the puzzle adventure aspects are superbly done and make up for those shortcomings.</span>
