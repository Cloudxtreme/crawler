<br>If this isn&apos;t enough to warrant never touching it, you&apos;ll be pleased to know that the gameplay consists of one of the most shallow SRPG systems ever created. The parts where the rangers fight in a mech are basically 10 minute long QTEs (with one type of QTE, (namely &quot;stop the slider&quot;), a crafting system that heavily depends on RNG (in a game where you can&apos;t replay levels, so if you don&apos;t get the component you need you&apos;re forced to give up or save scum) and plenty of bugs.

<br>
<br>I recommend this game to all who love that kind of game.Its a bit like Deadpool.Deadpool was about the jokes, not the genereic plot, the weak visuals.Its about fun.If you search for fun(and understand the references!!!), youll find it here.If you search for good voiceacting, epic story and visuals search the shelves for AAA Titles.For my taste the game is BY FAR the game that produced the most fun for me in 2015!My last years fav game was This war of mine, i rated it 8(my highest rate ever).Chroma Squad is for me on the same level with simliar weaknesses.Ill rate it with an 8!Buy it if you like that kind of game!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chroma-squad/user-reviews?user_review_id=5283883">Expand</a></span>

Over the years, I&#x2019;ve played many games based on these Rangers of Power. Which why when I heard about Behold Studio&#x2019;s Kickstarter for Chroma Squad, a turn based strategy game inspired by Power Rangers, I was excited. Sadly I didn&#x2019;t kickstart it because I wasn&#x2019;t backing anything on there yet. Still have only backed four things. Anyway, as a someone who had recently started watching Super Sentai and Kamen Rider, the shows for the footage behind Power Rangers and Masked Rider, I was absolutely going to play this game. Luck for me we get a review code.
<br>
<br>Chroma Squad is about a group of stunt actors who got fed up with working for an incompetent director. In a fit of fed-up-withness (its a word now) they quit and decided to start their own studio. Luckily one of the actors&#x2019; uncle had an unused warehouse that&#x2019;s perfect for a studio. Inside the warehouse also just happens to be an extremely large brain in a jar that is connected to a computer with a text to speech function. Strange. Now they have to raise money for better costumes, studio equipment, and prop weapons. You can only use buckets and pretend they are magically helmets for so long. The dialog is pretty funny. The actors constantly break character.  Just what is this giant brain in a jar? Where did it come from? Why do some of these monster have some amazing costumes on a low budget show?
<br>
<br>After naming all five of the actors and choosing what color each role is going to to be you can start your show. That&#x2019;s right you can choose the leader not to be red, and you can also have orange, purple, and brown &#x201C;rangers&#x201D;. Something that I&#x2019;ve always wanted, and Orange Ranger. Or maybe you want an all female group. For each of the five actors there are five roles; Leader, Assist, Techie, Assault, and Scout. Each mission is an episode of the tv show. There&#x2019;s only 5 or 6 episodes per season. After the season premiere you can choose which episode you want to play next. In the mission select you get a brief synopsis of the episode like you would any actual tv show. The mission select will also let you know if the episode features a special guest and/or a giant robot fight. Giant robots in this cause is made out of cardboard. The special guests I assume are named after either kickstarter backers or developers.  The only other episode you can&#x2019;t choose from besides the first episode of the season is of course the season finale. Each mission has director instructions of special things that you need to do to get a fan boost. These instructions could be things like kill the minions before the boss or attack boss each turn or finish boss with finisher. Between missions you can also hire marketing companies to give you fan and income buffs. The marketing company buffs only last 1 or 3 episodes.
<br>
<br>The combat is pretty simple. Each actor gets a turn to move a certain number of squares based off their movement stat. After they move they can either attack or move again or set up for a teamwork move, very similar to X-Com. Each role has a different ability. The Assist actor is your healer of the group, your Techie is the one to lower an enemy stats, and so on. There is somewhat of a skill tree but you don&#x2019;t have to drop any skill points the next tier of abilities unlocks after each season. That means you can change which abilities are active whenever you&#x2019;d like, as long as it&#x2019;s not during a mission and it&#x2019;s within the same tier. After using an ability there is a cooldown period.  Some weapons are role specific like the axe can only be used by the Assault role, while other weapons like your basic pistol or sword any one can use. Each person can only carry one weapon, so it&#x2019;s best to have a role specific weapon on each character because it tends to have the stat boosted needed for that role.
<br>
<br>Combat in the giant robot is even easier. There is no movement part of the turn. You click the basic attack button again and again until you either miss, choose to defend, or use a special attack. There is a accuracy percent of your next basic attack that you use to determine when to defend. Each consecutive attack raise your combo. The higher your combo the higher your defence will be when you do click defend or if you have a healing ability. If your health drops below 0 you start using the fans that you gained during the episode as a secondary health. When its the enemy&#x2019;s turn to attack a bar appears at the bottom of the screen and you have to time your mouse click to maximize the guard.
<br>
<br>I had a lot of fun playing Chroma Squad. I would highly recommend this to any fan of Power Rangers and Super Sentai. Chroma Squad is $14.99 on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chroma-squad/user-reviews?user_review_id=5314192">Expand</a></span>

The teamwork mechanic is a simple concept that opens a lot of choices and suits well with the game genre and setting. Each character has a different role on the team and can be customizable from the name, looks, traits, abilities and equipment, making room for multiple play-styles and different tactics which make the game fell fresh and new as it proceeds. Fans of Sentai (A.K.A. Power Rangers-like shows) will be pleased to see that transforming into your Power Suit and gigantic Mech Battles actually play a role in the game.
<br>
<br>Aesthetically the game makes use of Pixel Art with vibrant colors that suits with the lighthearted tone of Chroma Squad. The sound design is spot on with a great Sentai themed main song and a happy chiptune music that fuses together with the game&#x2019;s vibe. The bosses are really interesting both in abilities and design and also very silly (like the giant pigeon with macho arms) but the minions do start to get a little repetitive specially as they get recycled as stronger versions with a different color scheme.
<br>
<br>The plot is not very forward thriving but it does have some intrigue right from the start and it is a fun setup for the rest of the game. You will most certainly have some good laughs with Chroma Squad as long as you are ready to read through the characters&#x2019; dialogues. Although the game is very smartly written, it may sometimes become boresome as the scripted events drag on. As mentioned the game has a very lighthearted tone and it doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously which is actually connected to the main story.
<br>
<br>&#x2022; Final thoughts
<br>
<br>Chroma Squad is a game that excels in the strategic battle gameplay with great, fun core mechanics and offers other pleasant side activities like the Mech Battles, Crafting and Studio Management which make the game flow fell fresh and non-repetitive. The direction of the story may seem a little odd sometimes as the silly, lighthearted, &#x201C;not taking itself too serious&#x201D; plot develops but it is a game that I recommend, specially for those who enjoy a really good squad strategy turn-based game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chroma-squad/user-reviews?user_review_id=7234753">Expand</a></span>
