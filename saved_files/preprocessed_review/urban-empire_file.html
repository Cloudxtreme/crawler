The game economy is completely unbalanced. The infrastructure, like electricity, for example, has no positive net value in the long run and costs way too much. You end up spending way more money on infrastructure upkeep than you get back from benefactors (like industry) in return so the game forces you to increase taxes which kills city growth. The game also has issues with zone density. Increasing the density of a zone should not cost any money or have any upkeep, but the game developers decided that rezoning a district from light density to medium density should completely wipe out whatever funds you have saved up, with an upkeep so high that by the time the area develops with medium density and money is flowing again, you&apos;re in the hole 3 or 4 thousand (which is a lot in this game), and you&apos;re not making a whole lot more than before the rezoning. So the incentive to increase city density (which should be really fun to do), isn&apos;t there. In fact, it&apos;s the opposite. You avoid rezoning to higher densities, and that to me defeats the purpose of a city building game. I do not recommend this game unless the developers fix these disastrous game-play issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/urban-empire/user-reviews?user_review_id=6941751">Expand</a></span>

This is a political/economical city management/&quot;tycoonish&quot; game.
<br>IMHO: The most important thing in developing a game like this, is game mechanics. Looks like they went for graphics instead. Because the graphics are very good for example. But the game mechanics are terrible. This voting and council system was a very good idea! But for god sake... the votes and the council itself are working like an idiot.
<br>For example: Sometimes even if you have a lot of money, they don&apos;t want to build anything. They vote no to train station, no to new district, no to everything. My first (and probably the last) try in this game was 2.2 hour. In this more than 2 hours i was able to build: 2 district, a police station, a clinic, and gas lamps. Nothing else. I progressed to almost 1900 but i doesn&apos;t feel any &quot;accomplishment&quot;. Tho voting and council are working very badly and seemingly (other reviews) random. No real simulation or common sense at all. This is the part where this game fails big time. Not mentioned the sometimes inexplicable childish manifestations in game. I&apos;m very sad.. not expected this. And for last but not least: Very overpriced!
<br>If you are fan of the tycoons, manager, simulation, games: Not recommended to buy at all (at any price)!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/urban-empire/user-reviews?user_review_id=6933495">Expand</a></span>

I have played 3 games now, trying to work out various strategies and can say this:
<br>1)	This appears to be based on some designers idea of how politics work. Choices you make may or may not do what you think they do, and there is no information denoting what the overall effect might be. I don&#x2019;t need the game to let me min/max, but I would like to at least understand who supports various initiatives, and what they are likely to vote for. It feels like there is some formula, but it is very unclear what that is. This makes every decision very frustrating.
<br>2)	When information is presented, it is done in an awkward and confusing manner. For example there are lots of stats about each district available, but none of them cover &#x201C;what does this district need?&#x201D; or &#x201C;How do I address problem X?&#x201D; So even when there is info available, it is still frustrating just trying to make sense of it.
<br>3)	The engine designer must have done the UI also because the way things like bonuses are presented is horrible. &#x201C;Sales Bonus! Demand -10%!&#x201D;. Even if the engine calculated a bonus as -10% for something, why in the world would you present it like that. Its just backwards.
<br>4)	Citizen desires, which they call The Wheel of Life are presented as offsets to the current era target. So you have a hard time understanding how much better you need to make things. They should just show it as &#x201C;11/15&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;-4&#x201D;. Even then, once you learn to understand what it means, how to solve that issue is unclear.
<br>As I said, this game could be really good and after playing it a few times I can see where they were going with it. But the developer just did a very bad job of putting it into action in a way that makes sense to most people. Sure you can learn how to read their numbers, but I should have to work at learning the strategy, NOT at figuring out how to read their statistics.
<br>This is a $10 game with more polish than you would expect from that price range and a big publisher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/urban-empire/user-reviews?user_review_id=6932192">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Personally, i didn&apos;t have any technical issues but there&apos;s some reports in the Forums you might wanna check out. The overall gameplay is fine but feels lacking in some aspects and now and then it&apos;s not exactly clear how some things play together until you&apos;ve done some trial and error. However, overall it still makes for a good and unique game.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a city builder, there are better options available. If you&apos;re looking for something you have to work into and quite time intensive, but is quite rewarding this might be for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/urban-empire/user-reviews?user_review_id=6933617">Expand</a></span>

This makes it a very realistic game, and fun once you get the hang of it.

<br>I really believe that those who gave this game a low score should take another look.  It definitely takes several plays to figure it out.

<br>Obviously, it really lacks polish on some aspects that were largely reviewed by other criticisms (lack of explanations, uselessness of infrastructures, weird taxation system, shortage of data sets ...) but overall, I was positively surprised by the mechanics and delighted to see my economy flourish.
<br>
<br>I believe the game tries to paint an accurate picture of the life of a mayor having to lead a city, with multiple statistics at hand without knowing exactly what investment will modify citizen needs. Another thing most reviewers apparently dismissed was to spread large investments as institutions on multiple districts. I continued to create districts at a fast pace and ended up covering the entire map around the middle of the IV era and I can tell you money flowed (I ended up the game with a capital of 76M and a monthly net income of 1450k), the key is having your city grow by creating new districts (without any infrastructure, at least before the last era).
<br>
<br>10 is maybe not an accurate note but I did put it to offset the abusive 0-2 scores. The game is worth a solid 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/urban-empire/user-reviews?user_review_id=6965874">Expand</a></span>
