Secondly, FIFA soccer is perhaps the most overrated football video game series ever. Compared with its much smaller counterpart (PES 2013), FIFA 13 plays a much more authentic looking game of football.....but only in midfield. As soon as we get to the gameplay in and around the danger zones, FIFA 13 shows itself to be really lacking in &apos;explosive power&apos;. Unless the AI sets the situation up for the gamer, strikers require far too long to take the ball under control and get decent efforts on goal away or even allowing them to set decent efforts up. Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise as the &apos;tactical defending&apos; is almost equally slow to react and generally unwieldy and cumbersome. Sticking with the defending, once again, FIFA defenders seem to think that defending when the ball is past the final three yard towards the goal is unnecessary. Thus a great deal of cheap goals are conceded from within the 3-4 yard range simply due to ultra sloppy defensive AI. It should also be said that the quality of goals scored in FIFA are of a low standard and do not come even close to the satisfaction of scoring a typical screamer in PES 2013. FIFA 13 is a decent enough game, with many advantages over its only other rival, Pro Evolution Soccer. However, these advantages are either off the field (presentation, game modes etc), or in the less glorious 75% of the field. In the final third, FIFA 13 plays a cumbersome, often frustrating, and rather limited game of football, sorely lacking the high tempo exciting and fluid action of PES 2013. The most interesting thing of all for me with the FIFA series is its huge popularity. Can the masses really be so wrong in such huge numbers? YES THEY CAN!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2719915">Expand</a></span>

Stay away. Even if you&apos;re a die hard football fan like me. It will cause a lot of broken gamepads and keyboards, and not because its difficulty but because of its stupidity. Not only is it full of  bugs but it&apos;s also scripted, yeah the thing people around the internet call &quot;Momentum&quot;, which causes you to lose matches even if you play as hard and as good as you can, by simply making your players mistake every first touch, making every tackle useless by sending the ball to your opponent, by making opponents&apos; keeper unbeatable, and 100% sure goals miss, hitting the post most of the time or go wide. Once I had a game that finished 1-1 with 19 shots on goal from my team and only one against, which incredibly went in... bad luck right? No, because it happens all the time, no matter how good the players you take the shot with are. This game is so frustrating it will take you to the point of breaking the dvd. There&apos;s absolutely no reason for you to get a broken and completely unrealistic game unless you want to destroy your mental health. I have always been a Fifa gamer since 98 but I lost every hope that EA will ever make a decent football game again because all they care about is money. So this will probably be the last Fifa I&apos;ll ever try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2775667">Expand</a></span>

Never again EA, never again and please leave PC platform, we don&apos;t need arcade games and buggy software like Origin because I trust in steam and I like to buy on sale (every weekend, every christmas, every summer...) on Steam for just 10$. This is what Digital delivery means ... aaaahhhh EA is a joke. Just on marketing they are very good, they are good only in MKTG. The TV spot with Messi and many other top players around the world is very cool but is the game is a fail please don&apos;t spend money to pay Messi give an honest price to a game that is a fail and probably next time u&apos;ll gain more. U spend a lot of money in everything EA and i don&apos;t believe that your crap has selled 4,5ML copies is 1 week this is a big lie, check again... 4,5ML copies,,, lol. &quot;User score&quot; speak itself, my vote is 2 because i like to play with full manual controls and this game is designed for kids that like to play full assisted. Everything is scripted, zero creativity, PES 2013 is way better, it&apos;s not perfect but at least we can use the word football if we talk about PES ... ops this is soccer, OMG ...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2691674">Expand</a></span>

The game has countless issues, both online and offline, it has tons of bugs (that will probably never be fixed because EA has proved beyond all doubts that they don&apos;t care).
<br>
<br>The gameplay is so broken, the game speed is laughable and ridiculously high, the passing system sucks, the UT servers are down very often, the new first touch controls are a joke. Everything about this game sucks. EVERYTHING.
<br>
<br>And EA simply don&apos;t care because they sold their 7 million copies. A zero is perhaps too much for this game, I wish I could give it a negative review number.
<br>
<br>I want my money back. Just go see what&apos;s happening in the EA&apos;s official forum, 90% of the people writing there are just mad an the game and EA.

Absolutely reeks of it. Problems started from before the worldwide release of the game and are still continuing now. I&apos;ll list what I can remember in rough order.
<br>
<br>1. The webapp was released on 19th of September (after teasing us with the 18th) and within 24hrs was taken down again after thousands of people found an exploit allowing them an endless amount of free packs. This was the same exploit used in fifa12 a year earlier. EA took down the webapp and banned a lot of players. During this time there were of lot of claims that people had been banned unjustly and also that some had got away without a ban by transferring players/coins to another account.
<br>
<br>2. Shortly after the webapp was back online people discovered that they could not search the market due to a continuous &quot;oops&quot; error. Many were unable to login at all, never mind search the market.
<br>
<br>3. A major bug in the webapp preventing the proper club establishment being displayed was noticed by a lot of users upon the webapps launch. This has still not been fixed some 2 weeks later.
<br>
<br>4. Console users had the opportunity to buy an EA Season Pass allowing them exclusive early access to the actual fifa 13 game as well as discounts on packs. Many people paid for the early access but many were unable to log into the game.
<br>
<br>5. Upon the release of the game people in Australia discovered they were deceived by the marketing as they were not able to buy the game until a day after the advertised release. Some who have bought the retail game can play, yet those who pre-ordered could not log into the game or webapp.
<br>
<br>6. Fifa Points. This has been quite a fiasco. Normally you buy fifa points then spend them on packs but in fifa13  it&apos;s possible to buy points and not be able to spend them on packs at all.
<br>
<br>7. Trade Pile. Searching without an oops error seems to have improved a lot. However, there are mysterious things going on in everyone trade piles. Cards going missing for days, invisible cards taking up space, sold cards not showing up, coins going missing, bought/sold players stuck in transaction for days......
<br>
<br>8. Cheating. Both on the webapp and the PC cheating is rife on fifa13. On the PC people can apparently play 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, winning every single game and earning more coins than anybody else. People are using trainers to cheat their way through tournaments without even having to play collecting all the winners proceeds along the way. The same exploit was used throughout fifa 12 and no attempt was made to fix it then, or even now.
<br>
<br>9. Connection problems. As if EA didn&apos;t know how big their game was going to be they still can&apos;t manage a game that only requires two computers to connect to one another. Many people are having numerour connection problems, from not being able to access the webapp to not being able to play a single game without disconnecting during or at the end, resulting in lost coins and a DNF penalty.
<br>
<br>10. Ea Customer Service. There is none. Ea were voted worst company in the world last year (above all the crooked banks!). Their online suppoort chat consists of people replying from a script with no power to actually take action. They will disconnect from you if you start citing your rights and the law. Their phone service is better but last year it was abused to steal peoples accounts. They tweet advertisements all day long but do not keep people updated on how progress with fixing the game is going.
<br>
<br>Good news is if you don&apos;t play online and don&apos;t already own fifa 12 then it&apos;s the best football game out there. For everybody else I recommend you stay well clear!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2660569">Expand</a></span>

Most of the bugs had been fixed, Impact Engine now acts much better and the gameplay is completely closer to the reality than its predecessor. To be precise, its the game have I played approx. 200 hours up to the present and the multiplayer experience I will never forget.</span>

<br>This is an opinion but I feel like they made the matchmaking too competitive because of the seasons ranking in H2H and FUT making me feel like I have to try every single game. Therefore i cannot use teams that I would like to use in feel like I will play against RM or FCB. But they did improve a little compared to past FIFA game which is why I am giving it a decent review. The first touch system is better than the unrealistic aspects of the past games. However there are some touches I feel they knock the ball way too far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806627">Expand</a></span>

Some games I would completely dominate yet somehow lose (got to love those 45 minute and 90 minute goals) and others were just purely comical (drew 5-5 with my goalkeeper somehow missing a back pass, letting it roll into his own net for the 5th goal).
<br>
<br>Career mode is extremely repetitive, with the same scripted events occurring over and over. The graphics are poor (look at the fans..!) and the commentary dull and hey you guessed it...repetitive.
<br>
<br>If you can get past the cheating AI, extremely unbalanced and frustrating online gameplay and poor console port aspects...then you deserve some kind of award.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2943375">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What game are you playing? Perhaps it&apos;s the online version that people here are so opposed to, as I only play single player career; but I&apos;ve been playing FIFA since Fifa International Soccer, the first game, back in about 1993, and I&apos;ve been gaming since 1978. And this is easily, hands down, the best soccer game ever made.
<br>
<br>Those who are complaining about horrible gameplay simply don&apos;t watch or play much real soccer; this game is A LOT harder than earlier interations. It&apos;s basically a sea change in game play. If you try to play it like earlier versions of FIFA, you&apos;ll just flame out.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve got a level 26 player and am at benfica right now, having been bought and sold about seven times in my first seven seasons.There is just so much right about this game with respect to player movement, shooting improvements, difficulty of gaining yardage from &quot;trick moves&quot;, goalkeeper skill. You can even turn on handballs as an option, finally.
<br>
<br>As a straight up single-player soccer game -- I don&apos;t give a darn about juvenile card swapping games and one-upmanship -- I&apos;d have rated it an eight or nine out of 10. But I feel compelled to give it a 10 because of the merciless kicking it seems to be taking here over small issues that have little to do with core gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2741003">Expand</a></span>

The game is good looking, the new control system is a nice idea, the models and movements have been improved. Now the bad parts. The game is badly designed, with no added thought to improving AI. The rubberbanding is comical at times, with the AI cheating so horrendously it stops being immersive. On world class or higher, the AI will score when it wants to. There is no way to defend the goals because their player movement is simply better than your teammates, to a completely ridiculous extent. Faster, stronger, insane reflexes, they can cancel a change in direction halfway into the motion to wrongfoot your player- something which is impossible for a human player to do- there are no buttons for it! On the other hand, your teammates make poor runs, often running into their marker so you cannot make the pass. They tend to fall over opposition players and have turning circles like a Harrier jump jet.
<br>
<br>The game to game experience feel rehearsed, with no excitement on unpredictability. In the end  you will find most of your games will be played in the same manner, and the goals you concede will be identical. I am not buying another FIFA title for a long time, this is the third time i have been frustrated by EA and their undeniably talentless staff. I would love to see a great football game, but this is nowhere near. Save your money for another game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2830041">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately fifa designers are just trying to create a story and they do not create a real challenge . if you really want to win in this game you must forget that you play football , just pretend that you are playing some thing else , and tell your mind to get over any thing that does not make sense because this game is saturated with those kind of things , and do not activate hand ball because you will get so many penalties at so funny times . this game is a failure by all means</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=2925105">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The interface is so ugly, like it was not in the correct resolution. The weekly automatic updates are good, but have some bugs. The graphics are a &quot;normal good&quot;, and the gameplay is normal too.
<br>
<br>i play it regularly, because i like soccer games.</span>

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s talk about bugs?  I don&apos;t say that a game must be bug free,  but it should at least try to fix them, thing that EA don&apos;t do, the bugs are there since the beggining, and EA don&apos;t do ANYTHING to fix them.
<br>
<br>What say about the  carrer mode? Well, unrealistic trasnfers values and negotiations, and a happy player having 3 years of contratc remaing, and want to renew the contract for just one year earning more and if you don&apos;t do that the player will request a transfer. This happens A LOT.

<br>Well, what to say about the EA Servers? To fully play this game, you have to be Online, both you AND  the EA servers, you can&apos;&apos;t use ALL the things that you earned if the servers are down, wich happens  A LOT.
<br>
<br>Overall? A very good engine, way better than PES, but the lack of respect with the customers, wich is a trademark from EA, make the game a  waste of time and money </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=3299085">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m talking about single player modes, as I&apos;m not interested in multiplayer game at all. My score reflects only a single player experience
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not expecting a game to be easy, I like challenge, especially in a football game, but the game has to be enjoyable. And F13 is far from that. It&apos;s one of the most frustrating experiences in a game world ever. If I pick one of the biggest teams on the continent, with players valued millions of euros in real world, I&apos;d like to feel that I&apos;m indeed controlling a really strong team. That I have immediate advantages over a poor opponent. But there&apos;s no such feeling in this game. FIFA &apos;world&apos; seems to be using some kind of level scaling, like Skyrim, because no matter how good team you pick, how close to level 99 your players are and how skiled you are in controlling a pad, you will struggle with likes of Stoke or Almeria or whatever. Your Piques, Ramoses and Luizs will be outrun by poor team&apos;s attackers, your Messis, Ronaldos and Robbens will be outrun by poor team&apos;s defenders. 60 level team will make pinpoint precision long passes and exchange ball better than Barca in their best years. And watch yourself in the last 15 minutes of the game if you&apos;re winning by 1 or 2 goals  you will experience pressing like you&apos;ve never seen on live TV, unless you watch ice hockey match and one team plays with a player advantage.
<br>
<br>Reaction your opponent AI presents is unhumanly  they can react to your action a fraction of a second after you press the button. At the same time, your defenders AI is utterly stupid. There&apos;s barely any move on the pitch except the player you control. AI doesn&apos;t move your player towards the ball in the air, doesn&apos;t assist you in defence. You would imagine you could position a player manually, but auto switching doesn&apos;t work correctly and manual switching when ball is in the air is practically impossible. Your players also won&apos;t move towards a loose ball after eg a tackle (it sometimes looks like all players &apos;wait&apos; until the tackle/collision animation is finished). Passing on assisted and semi modes don&apos;t work and at least 1/3 simple short passes (not to mention long through balls) end up bouncing of opponent&apos;s legs. Your attackers barely move off the ball. And even if they move and make a nice run, AI defenders will outrun them anyway, as mentioned earlier, or they will be caught offside as most often there&apos;s a huge delay between you pressing a button and AI making a pass (again, it has to do with animations)
<br>
<br>If that&apos;s not enough, imagine referees ending matches during your attacking move in opponent&apos;s penalty box. This however should be easily fixable in a patch. As to all other complaints, it seems like a broken engine so it would need a total revamp, which is impossible at this stage.
<br>
<br>If I bought the game on Origin, I would definitely apply for a refund. Waste of money. And since PES14, although significantly better than PES13, also suffers from unpolished engine and bugs, there&apos;s no football game to enjoy this year</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599681">Expand</a></span>

One of the most played (if not the most  mode is the Ultimate Team. You purchase players assemble a team with good chemistry, play in the online season or tournament. Sounds attractive,doesn&apos;t it  When it comes to the onfield gameplay it will frustrate the heck out of those who wanted some reality or those who play good football. A large part of the community is filled with players who don&apos;t respect their opponents and use pacy teams. Thats the mantra of the game.    Assemble a team full of pacy players and what get your results. Even if you make it to the top division with a good enough team of not so pacy players, after playing matches continuously you will end up with either of these,a) Frustrated mood and swearing after each game or b) Your own pacy team. No matter how much you dominate the proceedings in the match you are gonna end up conceding more goals than you have scored. Possession doesn&apos;t matter as long you have three pacy attackers up front. I would end up passing with more than 65  possession most of the time but still lose or draw most of the games.    You can either pass the ball 20 times and score a goal or send a lobbed though ball to your pacy strikers up front. The latter is seen more often. When you have the ball, your opponent need not worry as just sitting deep  and pressing the opponent does the job of defending. The attack lacks the innovation to break the defence when they land the bus in front of the goal. As soon as you lose the ball you find that all your defence is helpless against the pacy forwards. The best way of scoring in FIFA 2013 is counterattacking with pace. Even if you play well, your goalie or your defenders commit mistakes at the wrong position which leads to goals. You will think of changing your players for better results but believe me that it doesn&apos;t help. I won the online Seasons Division 1 several times undefeated, and also experienced several relegation battles and I&apos;ve realised it often that  pace is beginning and end of the game-play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=3047412">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>FIFA 13 graphics are awsome, cariere options werent changed much but much needed loan and buy option is new and available. I like new celebrations, dribblings and ball control. Also mini games and old arena are fun to practice.
<br>
<br>Now like every othere games this game also have bugs. My back line player automaticly moves away from my teammates, there are very unbalanced referery decisions. Any team can win becouse of 3 penaltys in row in one single match becouse of handball, and I mean a lot of handball. The game crashes in different date times like end season and sometimes when the loan is finnished and i wanna play for player. There is also this fairplay problem when sometimes players get injured and AI doesnt kick the ball out of play which is usually done in real life soccer. It&apos;s however different when there are playing none AI players. Problem with name and number indicators are still here, like in Fifa 12. Sometimes names of players are shown, sometimes they aren&apos;t.
<br>I also hate there are teams missing like Shakhtar and some important world known international teams.
<br>
<br>Graphics YES, Gameplay YES, A lot of bugs YES</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=3156892">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s why I could not enjoy the game up to the last level. But I expect that the next version could be more gorgeous than it. It is one of the best game for me in this year. This game bought many of my valuable times. So it proves worthy indeed. I am still playing. Waiting for the next version FIFA 14!!</span>

<br>I was surprised to see the actual skill levels of David Beckham, like in speed, dribbling etc, on FIFA 13. FIFA 09 made me play Beckham, very unusually. In fact, I was avoiding the opposition playing England, and when I was controlling Beckham, that day. FIFA 09 made Beckham very helpless dribbling, and he ran, like I have typed many a time, like the Porsche 911 Turbo. The opposing players didn&apos;t seem to want to run after him, when he was right winger, and he just stopped outside the box, waited for me to find the green button, and scored. It seems, his acceleration had the opposition flummoxed. It seems FIFA felt he could, on the actual football pitch, accelerate and decelerate in a manner that was confusing to the opposing players, like the 911 Porsche Turbo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-soccer-13/user-reviews?user_review_id=3615692">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The AI when the scores are equal is acceptable, but after they concede a goal, they go into super saiyan mode and beat the **** out of you. If you are good enough, you score another and automatically win the game. Unless, last 10-15 minutes. Your stamina is dead but guess what, they run like freaking dogs. I mean, it&apos;s inevitable. Even if you defend like a god, there is a strong chance that your AI will ignore an attacker, or you concede a corner. If you concede a **** corner, think of scoring the winning goal in last 2-3 minutes. You can&apos;t even hold the ball and play the boring passing game because of the stupid random-ass first touch engine. And this happens even when playing versus humans. What the **** man?
<br>
<br>Another funny thing is, if you fall behind by two goals against great teams like Manchester United, or Real Madrid, prepared to get raped. Every shot they fire becomes a goal. Javier Hernandez, no **** problem, shoots like Nakamura. It happened to me a couple of times when doing career with Fulham in legendary.
<br>
<br>Oh, by the way, the referees suck! Every foul = a yellow card. Meh.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a decent game with good gameplay and ****ty AI. It&apos;s funny that the only improvement between 12 and this is; the stupid annoying touch glitches are gone.

I mean while playing career mode, when one season is finished, It will just start crashing after July 30, 2013, and would not start the next season. EA is not doing any thing to fix this issue. Beware while purchasing it. Thanks</span>
