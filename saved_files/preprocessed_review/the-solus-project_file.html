Food and water are abundant, a solution to cold weather (aka night) is to take a good 10-hour nap, and during lengthy thunderstorms lightning will consistently hit you for 20% of your health regardless of cover. Although there are only a handful of patrolling enemies, traps are plentiful but, again, simplistic and only hidden by darkness.
<br>
<br>The hero&apos;s greatest enemy is the game designer. Although the game is set in the 22nd century, one of the two most useful pieces of human technology available to the player is a metal tube covered in some alien roots and soaked in rocket fuel. This creates a torch that heats the player, lights up the surroundings and burns forever (seriously, it&apos;s permanent. It never requires more alien roots or fuel). The other useful piece of technology is a personal teleporter, borrowed in its entirety from Unreal Tournament. Apart from that there&apos;s no long range optics, no radar or local map, nothing that would be fitting for an interstellar planetary explorer. At least there&apos;s a PDA which can scan objects in the world, providing helpful hints like &quot;Rock, heavy, multi-purpose&quot; (useful for putting on buttons) and &quot;metal tube, tool, very good!&quot; (two required across the entire playthrough) and translate alien writings on the walls.
<br>
<br>However, all of that could be forgiven for a good plot or decent exploration. The Solus Project has neither. The plot is extremely straightforward and, regrettably, disconnected from the gameplay. No matter how many tablets you decipher, the protagonist never acknowledges that in his/her reports and acts as if he/she never knew what was going to happen. The exploration is tedious and mostly useful for artifacts (+1% to some resistance) and vanity items, having no real influence on the survival part.
<br>
<br>As a first attempt at making a game, The Solus Project is quite decent. But even in that price category there are better, much more polished and interesting games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-solus-project/user-reviews?user_review_id=6493592">Expand</a></span>

Go to finish the game and the story.. but, 1 missing Tower part! It&apos;s not in the initial island and how I came back? the game crash when I go back.. I tryied so many solutions of errors.. nothing. Send to the producer on facebook an message, only readed and don&apos;t giving a **** for gamers.

<br>From great to unbalanced
<br>The Solus Project is a first person survival game set on a deserted alien planet, youre goal is to survive the environment and send a signal back home to earth and save the human race
<br>a lot at stake, a lot of incentive to pull this off&#x2026;
<br>The first half of the game was great...
<br>at first this is a mix of casual walking simulator mixed with survival exploration gathering food and water bottles to make sure your character doesn&#x2019;t die of hunger or thirst, you also have to deal with the harsh environment... trying not to die of hyperthermia
<br>the opening moments are mysterious and intriguing.. Finding hidden caves with secrets that once collected improve you stats and chance of survival...
<br>items to increase your health and inventory size
<br>There&#x2019;s very light crafting with you only having to craft 1 torch that burns forever and the occasional tool down the line in story
<br>This sets up what is initially a really enjoyable and casual survival experience&#x2026;
<br>surviving isn&#x2019;t annoying.. You have an infinite light source, you&#x2019;ll occasionally have to catch a plant on fire to stay warm, sleep when you&#x2019;re deprived... eat and drink every once in a while...
<br>none of which happens that often at all&#x2026;
<br>And there are refill stations scattered around&#x2026;
<br>so this feels mostly like an adventure game with survival aspects attached to it..
<br>Exploring this alien planet, picking up documents of other explorers around, throwing switches and finding items to progress them game
<br>no real enemies here except for one hide and seek like section giving you a sense that maybe you&#x2019;re not as alone on this planet as you might have thought..
<br>And the occasional meteor showers shaking the ground around you, really immersing you into this world&#x2026;.
<br>There is the occasional annoyance I was having with the game like its awful AutoSaving... though there are save posts around the world to save yourself and the face that death can come pretty often as youre trying to figure the game out and the load times of this game are painfully slow&#x2026;
<br>But still I was having a lot of fun... I could look past these flows for the great survival adventure this game was
<br>and then the game decides to not be so linear anymore, get lazy with its puzzles by just forcing you to find keys over and over&#x2026;
<br>And halfway through when you get back to the surface after an underground section it broke for me&#x2026;
<br>I don&#x2019;t mean the game crashed or started getting buggy...
<br>No...
<br>The game wasn&#x2019;t balanced in a way to make this section reasonably playable...
<br>staying warm hasn&#x2019;t been an issue all game and then all of a sudden it is&#x2026;
<br>youre on a part of the planet that gets really cold, is surrounded by water, and there are 0 plants to catch on fire to stay warm&#x2026;
<br>so while collecting 4 keys, it started to get dark, the winds were picking up and because of the developers forgetting to balance this level out with items to burn I got caught in a hyperthermia death cycle
<br>I couldn&#x2019;t leave my little key island without swimming through the water and just dying the moment I got out
<br>I can&#x2019;t possibly call this game a great survival experience with something like this overlooked..
<br>Cold hasn&#x2019;t been a problem all game and when it is there&#x2019;s nothing to be burned...
<br>After searching my problem I found that plenty of others have had this issue in the same spot since the game came out on pc a year and a half ago and the developers still haven&#x2019;t fixed it
<br>that being said I still believe this is a really solid experience, and if you plan to go in after watching this review.. Collect those bushes and hold onto them for this potential game stopping moment
<br>I give The Solus Project
<br>a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-solus-project/user-reviews?user_review_id=7529407">Expand</a></span>
