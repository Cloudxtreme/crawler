<br>
<br>I just completed it and... well, I&apos;m speechless. First I had a little bit of fear in me that this game is gonna be like some indie titles in which the art design is stellar, but everything else - especially the gameplay is shallow. But boy, I was so wrong.
<br>
<br>When I started I didn&apos;t really understand what this game is about, but after 2 or 3 levels I got it and I also got the hang of the gameplay and I started to have so much fun with it. Through this roughly 6 hour journey I grown to love the main characters, Dusty and Piper. It was so much fun to go on an adventure with them.
<br>
<br>And hey, I loved the gameplay too! It was very refreshing and original with a lot of well implemented, creative ideas. In each and every section of the game I had to do a little bit different things, so the gameplay never felt boring or repetitive, and the game also had just the right amount of puzzle and combat scenarios.
<br>
<br>The music was so touching and uplifting, the art design was fantastic all the way through, and these combined together with the often fun, but sometimes emotional story brought the inner child of me to the surface (sorry, English isn&apos;t my native language).
<br>
<br>So yeah, this game had a strong emotional effect on me, and [SPOILER STARTS ]the section near the end where Piper sang to lure away the darkness [SPOILER ENDS] was one of the most magical experiences I&apos;ve ever had in gaming.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s definitely one of the best games of 2017, I highly reccommend it to anyone.
<br>
<br>If I really have to say something negative, these are purely technical (except the last one, but that wasn&apos;t really a problem anyway).
<br>
<br>There is a place in the game where if I travel through (via loading screen), the game freezes. It happaned twice (don&apos;t worry, it not always happens, you can complete the game).
<br>
<br>3 times the framerate heavily dropped down for a moment on my powerful PC (EVGA GTX 1080 FTW2, i5-6600K 4.5GHz, GSkill Ripjaws 2x8GB 3200MHz). But I think it&apos;s just some kind of bug in the code, not an optimization issue.
<br>
<br>There was one time where I had to kick an object to a moving platform, and the object got stuck in the air (not on the moving platform). A checkpoint restart fixed it.
<br>
<br>The first roughly two levels (intro level and town maybe) wasn&apos;t that special for me, but obviously because I haven&apos;t really understand back then what&apos;s this game is really all about. But after that I quickly started to love it once I understood the point of the gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/figment/user-reviews?user_review_id=7536185">Expand</a></span>

Disclaimer: I received a copy of the game for review purposes. Like all of my reviews, however, this has no effect on my thoughts and experiences with the game.
<br>
<br>Figment is an audio-visual themed puzzle game that puts you in the role of Dusty, the mind&#x2019;s courage. The entire game takes place within the mind and it&#x2019;s world&#x2019;s and characters use this theme throughout.
<br>
<br>Dusty sets out on his journey with his overly optimistic companion, piper, after his scrapbook is stolen. Dusty&#x2019;s journey takes him to various parts of the mind. The right side of the brain, where creativity is controlled. The left side of the brain, where logic comes into play. Finally, the conscious mind, where you&#x2019;ll find a harsh and ever changing landscape.
<br>
<br>In each area you&#x2019;ll be tasked with defeating nightmares. These nightmares sing while battling them and each song is excellently done. The songs vary depending on the nightmare as well so it&#x2019;s varied in genre. I personally liked the fear of death&#x2019;s songs the most, since his were rock/metal based. They all were excellent though and very catchy. The ambient music was also very good. There are often instruments as trees and hearing them was also enjoyable. All in all, the music mixed with the ambient sounds was quite eargasmic.
<br>
<br>The game&#x2019;s gameplay mostly revolves around solving various types of puzzles. These puzzles are very well designed and are the perfect mix between easy and challenging. The game definitely makes your brain work and the puzzles are often very fun to solve as well.
<br>
<br>I also really liked the colorful artwork that was used throughout. Each area you visit is well designed and you could feel that a lot of work went into making them unique. The game often felt like playing a fairy tale in truth. It was a mixture between lighthearted and dark and it was highly entertaining.
<br>
<br>The game does feature some combat and it often kicked in at perfect moments. This way the puzzles never become monotonous or repetitive. I will admit that the combat system isn&#x2019;t the game&#x2019;s focus so it&#x2019;s a bit on the basic side. It does it&#x2019;s job well in the end though.
<br>
<br>Overall, Figment is an amazing audio-visual experience. It&#x2019;s gorgeous art style mixed with the excellent music throughout creates a torrent of enjoyment. Listening to everything on a surround sound system was pretty amazing and I highly recommend it with headphones. The game&#x2019;s story was pretty good too but it&#x2019;s world, mixed with the music and art is really what makes it worth playing. I highly recommend this one folks, it&#x2019;s pretty epic.
<br>
<br>Thanks for taking the time to read my review folks. I&#x2019;ll be back with my next review soon, until then, happy gaming folks!
