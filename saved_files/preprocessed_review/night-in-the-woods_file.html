I wouldn&apos;t call Night in the Woods a traditional game, it flows something more like say a Tell-tale game where it focuses on characters and themes such as anxiety, self-wroth and may more self-reflecting ideas. However, this does come at the cost of the gameplay as there isn&apos;t much of it there to be quite honest; if this kind of thing isn&apos;t something you enjoy as a player I&apos;d avoid NITWs.
<br>
<br>Otherwise, if you do enjoy charmingly written characters, a memorable soundtrack, loving to search around for little bits of character details or just love being in a plain wonderful setting for a story then Night in the Woods is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7095228">Expand</a></span>

<br>Night In The Woods is a story focused adventure game which takes place with a cat named Mae, who is a collage drop out and going to live with her parents. She catches up to her normal friends, Gregg, Angus, and Bea. For the first 3-4 days, everything is normal, but then things started to get strange and it&apos;s Mae&apos;s job to figure out what is going on. It sounds simple, yes, but it&apos;s actually nicely written and the dialog is well thought out. It&apos;s a bit slow at first, but it&apos;s a good thing since it gives more time for character development and build up the setting. It even does a good job on balancing humor to the seriousness of the story.
<br>
<br>The characters are amazingly written. Mae: A collage drop out cat that is having a hard life. Gregg: The Homosexual fox that only does and plays by his own rules. Angus: The Homosexual bear that is smart and had a hard childhood. Bea: A crocodile who is a goth who had her mother die from cancer.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise, it&apos;s just going from point A to B, while you interact with things. It even throws Mini-games into the gameplay as well, and most turned out quite fun.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is catchy, and beautifully put together. Crazy that this is made by 3 people!
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend this game enough. It&apos;s not perfect (no game is), but it&apos;s the best story adventure game we have gotten in quite some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7188127">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Night in the woods has one of the strongest and most mature stories I&apos;ve seen in quite a long time, it has a lot of different themes that I can really relate to and it does have a good mystery. The characters are lovable and relatable, the main character is a very flawed person but you do feel sorry for her and you don&apos;t want to see her in pain, the other characters are funny, sarcastic and they also have a lot of moments where you do feel for them and near the end I was almost in tears.
<br>
<br>The gameplay has surprisingly a lot of variety, it&apos;s mostly walking around and talk to different people but the game has a lot of mini-games, which makes the game a little more unique.
<br>But the gameplay is probably the weakest part of the game, but that&apos;s okay because the story did carry the entire experience and it&apos;s refreshing sometimes.
<br>
<br>I do believe it&apos;s worth paying 20 bucks to play this game, it took me 8 hours and it does have some replay value so I do recommend it, it&apos;s for now my favourite story of 2017.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7296328">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack is really good too, but what I feel is lacking is the story.  On the first few days in Possum springs it feels like the game would mostly be about the relationships with other people in town, and about Mae herself, but then the whole cult thing happens, and it feels really rushed. This game builds up a good story, but then falls down to literally explaining everything that was happening through one dialog, meant to put an end to the cult story, however, nothing really gets resolved, the mystery remains, and soon after the game just ends abruptly. I feel like if the whole game would be more like the first part of it, where you are just hanging out with people it would be a much better game.
<br>
<br>Unsatisfied with the ending I went online to check out other people are making out of it, and I found a tweet from the developer, explaining the whole thing as a political statement and nothing more. This made me even more frustrated because that is a really bad thing to do - the game&apos;s story should make sense in the context of the game itself, and in that case, we are getting a usual cliche open ending, that is so much common in indie titles that its starting to get old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7179968">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I did not personally find the pace to be an issue and felt as though everything worked well. It does lack gameplay aspects so if you are looking for an exciting game to test your skills with, look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a game that rewards exploration and has a ton of replay value this is it.
<br>
<br>My one complaint with the game (and the reason that I couldn&apos;t give it 10/10) is the ending it feels rushed and out of the blue with some parts being downright confusing. Only after a few playthroughs did I come to a satisfying conclusion regarding the meaning of the ending and how it relates to the story but overall it is a game well worth playing, a personal favorite and one that I solidly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7389870">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What I appreciated the most in my 8 1/2-hour playthrough was how the raw realism in the script, the setting and the narrative (including its main theme) blended so well with the cute, papercraft-resembling visuals and cozy musical score. ------------------------
<br>
<br>The main character and her little group of friends were far from the cool, faux-witty and jaded hipsters I expected, and soon I wanted to see what would happen next, to see if I could get them to laugh or get a chance to make them feel better. The dialogue sequences were full of cute jokes, funny pastiches on &quot;woke&quot; lingo, flirting and some tense cringey moments that felt natural without being devoid of the writer&apos;s personal touch.-----------------------
<br>
<br>This game is strong and has no real substitutes. I wish it was scarier at times and offered a slightly more elaborate ending, but I was satisfied with and slightly shaken by my journey. This game is serious, heavy and topical, but it doesn&apos;t *try* to be, and that means it is worth playing a few times to understand how it accomplishes something many game creators fail at.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=6983850">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pacing wise, it starts out slow, but had enough to keep me going until the end (where it gets better and better).
<br>It does feel a lot like Life is Strange, but feels less involved.</span>

The character designs, music, and background art was one of my absolute favorites. Despite that, the story was unbearable. It seemed to have no purpose other than &quot;we&apos;re young and we hate everything&quot;, which may be relatable to some individuals. But if you don&apos;t necessarily identify with a shoplifting, knife wielding, wanna-be rebel who constantly refers to themselves as &quot;trash&quot; and is a jobless college dropout looking for ghosts and vandalizing graves... this isn&apos;t for you.
<br>
<br>In addition, the plot was extremely confusing and at times had forced subplots (such as the cult) which were completely out of place. The dream sequence and having to walk back-and-forth constantly was tedious and felt like fluff. This can also be applied to the dialogue, where there were constant fillers of &quot;...&quot; and choppy sentences with the overuse of &quot;like&quot; and &quot;ugh&quot;.  With that said, none of the characters were likable or relatable, and were generally the same in terms of speech pattern and behavior. The game also did not provide the freedom of exploring or making choices.
<br>Overall, this would have been much better if it was a movie rather than a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7275061">Expand</a></span>

<br>People are praising this story because the characters are realistic and relatable, but that&apos;s exactly why I don&apos;t like it. Real life is mundane, banal, and boring, and so are the real life worries that the characters have in this game. The writers are very presumptuous and opinionated about how they think life should be and they use their boring and uninteresting characters as a mouthpiece. It comes off as whiny to me.
<br>
<br>The mystery/supernatural element is the only interesting thing about this game, and it takes a while to come to fruition.
<br>
<br>Not my cup of tea. I play games for larger than life characters facing epic challenges. If you&apos;re into visual novels you may enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7379563">Expand</a></span>

The story is interesting but not complicated, and the characters are very likeable. I loved the whole feel and had fun pottering around this world for a bit. The controls are few and very basic so not much to learn and won&apos;t stretch your brain. Some of the dialogue was a bit excessive, and I admittedly lost patience a couple of times. The dream sequences are nice although there are a lot of them and they&apos;re almost identical, the soundtrack suited them perfectly. All in all this game was a good ride, presented well and not overly challenging. It has a brilliant sense of humour, and I very much enjoyed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/night-in-the-woods/user-reviews?user_review_id=7518146">Expand</a></span>
