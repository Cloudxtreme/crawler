I bought premium days for it just to try it out. Thank God I only paid for 3 days.
<br>As soon as my first day of premium was finished I would get disconnected from every single match. The problem magically disappeared as soon as my final premium day was over. As in the very first match that I was no longer in premium the problem was gone. I did nothing what so ever to fix it, it just went away as soon as my premium was up.
<br>They utterly refused to give any refund or to add 2 days of premium to the account. They say that that is their policy and that the problem was on my end.
<br>Is it possible that the problem was on my end? Sure. But it was odd that the problem went away directly after the premium days were used up.
<br>I am not telling you how to spend your hard earned cash. If you want to spend it on this company then by all means do so, but I will never again spend a single penny with this company again in any way shape or form.
<br>Besides that War Thunder is a much more realistic game (and better in my opinion, even with the crappy name)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4333304">Expand</a></span>

The controls suck and no matter what i did it just did not work. I even tried a joystick.
<br>
<br>The subpar game engine is just not suitable for flight games, which usually takes place on really big maps. However in WoWP you get unrealistic sense of speed (everything is way too slow), tiny maps, compressed service ceiling.
<br>
<br>The flight physics are just abysmal. Drag, gravity, momentum? Warplanes never heard of that. The physics are as unrealistic as it can get, even Arcade games like Crimson Skies (2000!) or Blazing Angels have far more believable flight physics at least for Arcade standards.
<br>
<br>Flying an aircraft in WoWP feels like forcing a brick through thick jelly. While the bad flight physics are one reason for this, the game engine has also significant input lag due to serverside controls. You&apos;re basically pressing a button, the command gets send to the server, gets send back and only then your aircraft starts to move. While this is only a matter of milliseconds, the delay is always noticable and makes quick reactions impossible. Also no support for TrackIR.
<br>
<br>In terms of graphical fidelity this game is average at best. But, just like WoT, the engine isn&apos;t able to give you a stable amount of FPS. Once you&apos;re engaged in a huge dogfight, the framerate is going all over the place. This again is due to the lack of real multicore support of the game engine itself. Quite frankly this is inacceptable for the year of 2013.
<br>
<br>The sound effects are hideous aswell. Nothing in this game sounds even remotely like its real life counterpart. Aircraft engines sound like lawnmowers, machineguns and cannons seem to resemble BB guns.
<br>
<br>Remember when I said that this game is an insult for historical military aviation? The selection of aircraft is te biggest reason for this. Half of the techtrees are blueprints and prototypes, which never saw combat in WWII. This is just terrible for a game that claims to be &quot;dedicated to World War II military aircraft&quot;. Famous planes like the Fw 190, Hawker Hurricane or P-47 Thunderbolt are still missing.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise WoWP also has almost nothing to offer. Only one gamemode which evolves into a huge furball sooner or later. There is not much room to maneuver due to the incredibly small maps. The hitpoint system is just stupid and makes no sense whatsoever in aerial combat, since more often than not victory is determined by bigger healthbars and bigger damage output and not by your individual flying skills.
<br>
<br>A 0 out of 10. There is room for certain improvements but quite frankly this game already took a wrong direction from the very beginning. Fans of historical military aviation should avoid this game at its current state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=5399861">Expand</a></span>

You can play this if you want to spend your time in misery.</span>

If you want to play a free game with airplanes, good gameplay, good graphics etc then just download the War Thunder because it is so much better than this at every aspect.</span>

<br>They should not match planes up with higher tier planes as you do not have a ghosts chance in hell of even getting one kill this way and should make grouped players only play against other groups. this way they would still have to fly the plane instead of just ganking for kills.
<br>Don&apos;t fly American planes as they seem to think they could only fire about 100 rounds without the guns overheating and misfiring.
<br>Maybe if they rethink the way they match planes up and the way they fire I will give this game another go but not until then.
<br>Oh yea and if you want to play this game be prepared to spend money on it as it is a pay to win game not really FTP.
<br>Have fun and I will just go back to my flight sims for good air play instead of wasting time on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3901275">Expand</a></span>

Saying that, I want to make it perfectly clear that Wargaming has only itself to blame for the mess this game is compared to their flagship product. They did not listen to constructive feedback or criticisms of the game during the beta stage. Most of the matchmaking and balance issues did not get addressed at all.
<br>
<br>Just like in beta, once you get to level 2 you are boned. While still flying biplanes you wind up getting thrown against WW2 planes that outclass you in every possible way and can almost instagib you in one burst. A few games of this in a row and it gets old fast, plus you get massively reduced experience and credits from a loss and/or from being cannon-fodder for tricked out planes 2 levels higher than you. It&apos;s worse than World of Tanks by a mile in this regard.
<br>
<br>Even worse is the ramming. You actually get a kill for committing suicide and ramming people. That said, ramming is rampant in WoWP. It&apos;s also extremely difficult to avoid someone who is deliberately trying to ram you do to the crappy flight physics and over-sized plane models. This was a big problem in beta, an extreme source of frustration and it hasn&apos;t been fixed.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played the release version of this game and I&apos;ve played War Thunder from Gaijin. That being said, I want to make the following points from an objective standpoint and not as a &quot;fanboi&quot;.
<br>
<br>Simply put, this game is inferior to War Thunder in every possible way. To start, visually, War Thunder blows this game out of the water, and it plays much smoother with much more stable frame rates. The maps in War Thunder and the plane models are gorgeous, especially if you have a powerful video card. The sound is also very well done as are the controls.
<br>
<br>The controls in Arcade mode in War Thunder are more responsive than in WoWP and the flight physics are superior. Furballs are much more hectic (and fun) and you can pull off some extremely impressive moves with your plane if you are a good pilot.
<br>
<br>Instead of using a &quot;hit point system&quot; like World of Warplanes, you have much more realistic damage models. It&apos;s possible with a lucky shot to hit the enemy pilot and knock them out. You can still fly a severely damaged plane, and the plane handles as you would expect if you had one wing shot to pieces and a damaged engine.
<br>
<br>There are many more planes, and, unlike World of Warplanes, most of them actually saw combat. They weren&apos;t just prototypes or blueprints. More importantly, they are actually rendered much more &quot;in scale&quot; in War Thunder than they are in WoWP.
<br>
<br>If you are in a low level plane, you actually stand a chance against a higher level opponent. I&apos;ve shot down level 5 planes with a level 1 biplane (I-153).
<br>
<br>Also, the variety of game modes in War Thunder is better. There is much more variety in the maps. It is also nice to be able to play more than one plane in a single match.
<br>
<br>I still like and platy World of Tanks, but Wargaming came late and a dollar short to the aerial wargaming scene. War Thunder is a more refined and superior product. Maybe WoWP will improve in time but, at the moment, they are definitely out of their league compared to what Gaijin managed with War Thunder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3844860">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The subpar game engine is just not suitable for flight games, which usually takes place on really big maps.  However in WoWP you get unrealistic sense of speed (everything is way too slow), tiny maps, compressed service ceiling.
<br>
<br>The flight physics are just abysmal. Drag, gravity, momentum? Warplanes never heard of that. The physics are as unrealistic as it can get, even Arcade games like Crimson Skies (2000!) or Blazing Angels have far more believable flight physics  at least for Arcade standards.
<br>
<br>Flying an aircraft in WoWP feels like forcing a brick through thick jelly. While the bad flight physics are one reason for this, the game engine has also significant input lag due to serverside controls. You&apos;re basically pressing a button, the command gets send to the server, gets send back and only then your aircraft starts to move. While this is only a matter of milliseconds, the delay is always noticable and makes quick reactions impossible. Also no support for TrackIR.
<br>
<br>In terms of graphical fidelity this game is average at best. But, just like WoT, the engine isn&apos;t able to give you a stable amount of FPS. Once you&apos;re engaged in a huge dogfight, the framerate is going all over the place. This again is due to the lack of real multicore support of the game engine itself. Quite frankly this is inacceptable for the year of 2013.
<br>
<br>The sound effects are hideous aswell. Nothing in this game sounds even remotely like its real life counterpart. Aircraft engines sound like lawnmowers, machineguns and cannons seem to resemble BB guns.
<br>
<br>Remember when I said that this game is an insult for historical military aviation? The selection of aircraft is te biggest reason for this. Half of the techtrees are blueprints and prototypes, which never saw combat in WWII. This is just terrible for a game that claims to be &quot;dedicated to World War II military aircraft&quot;. Famous planes like the Fw 190, Hawker Hurricane or P-47 Thunderbolt are still missing.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise WoWP also has almost nothing to offer. Only one gamemode which evolves into a huge furball sooner or later. There is not much room to maneuver due to the incredibly small maps. The hitpoint system is just stupid and makes no sense whatsoever in aerial combat, since more often than not victory is determined by bigger healthbars and bigger damage output and not by your individual flying skills.
<br>
<br>A 4 out of 10. There is room for certain improvements but quite frankly this game already took a wrong direction from the very beginning. Fans of historical military aviation should avoid this game at its current state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3808546">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have a top of the line machine, yet I cannot run this game on even the BASIC graphics settings without MASSIVE framerate issues. Latency on both servers constantly fluctuates and that is IF you can even connect and STAY connected. I constantly have problems with the in-game planes as well, being right up against enemies and STILL missing (server problems)
<br>
<br>Include the fact that the developers ONLY show up to punish people badmouthing the game and it&apos;s creators and NOT to assist ANYONE  well, it just goes downhill from there. The concept is amazing and well executed but the rest of the problems this game faces makes it not even worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3817103">Expand</a></span>

<br>I logged in today, 29-09-2015 for the first time in maybe 2 years, and it has not improved at all, in fact, it has gotten worse with a capped population of 510 at 14:53 pm, if you compare that to the thousands playing wot and wows, My bet is that wargaming would do better erasing the game and apologizing for this fiasco.
<br>
<br>For the wargaming guys reading this, Dont try to improve it anymore, its not gonna get better, it bombed. Make a new one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=5516821">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>They pay internet hipsters to play their game so it will seem legit if they could get real celebrities I&apos;m sure they would just like they pay &quot;gamers&quot; to play in their fake competitions the whole premise of their game design is that the more you pay the more ahead you get so giving a couple of kids the key to the treasure chest that holds all the cheats is obviously fake.
<br>
<br>You would think that games like these would go away simply because they are so appalling bad but they don&apos;t which in turn just tells us about a certain segment of people and their poor attitudes most recently and clearly displayed by Microsoft as they picked up these clowns for Xbox but then it has always been a trickster box so all should feel right at home.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3813614">Expand</a></span>

And thing I like the most is that it is really fun and intense dogfight here. And you personally can destroy 4-5 enemy planes and change the result of the battle. Not like in some other projects where you can change nothing. Just on my way to top-tiers planes right now and it&apos;s cool.</span>

                                        <span>I&apos;m having a lot more fun in War Thunder rather than this. After grinding to ME-410 in WoWP, the game just stops being fun and becomes a grind. There&apos;s a very small number of very small maps. Yes, WoWP is addictive, but War Thunder is so much more fun.
<br>
<br>Save yourself frustration and play War Thunder instead of this.</span>

The game has very fast and frantic gameplay, with good emphasis on tactics. You may get into a dogfight with an enemy plane that out-turns you, while luring him into a descending tail chase at slower and slower speed, until you reach your optimum altitude and slam on the engine boost, leaving him in your dust as you set up for an attack run once he gets far enough away. The population issue is still noticeable, but there are now fairly competent bots as of update 1.9 that help to fill matches.

I&apos;ve logged over 3000 battles over 100s of hours. I feel I&apos;m well qualified to make an assessment of the game.
<br>
<br>World of Warplanes(wowp) is a free-to-play, world war II, flight sim. (Keep reading!) Unlike so many other free-to-play titles, this one IS NOT &quot;pay-to-win&quot;. There is no way to gain ANY advantage over other players through real money! It is extremely fair and well-balanced.
<br>
<br>Many complain that the flight physics are inaccurate. This is true, but they don&apos;t hold the game back. They have been dumbed-down to increase accessibility for non-flight-sim-enthusiasts. This is not to say they are non-existent. It&apos;s still possible to stall, climb too high, dive too fast, et cetera. WoWp makes flying fun &amp; easy. Don&apos;t be fooled into thinking gameplay is easy though...
<br>
<br>Another common complaint is the balance of planes. Many claim some planes are significantly better than others. This is true, but most people overlook an important point: For every advantage a plane has, it has a weakness as well. Also, many of the core players (those playing 2-3 hours daily) are aircraft &amp; flight enthusiasts. These guys are going to stomp you... regardless of the plane they fly.
<br>
<br>Complaints that are misunderstood, are the framerate and lag problems. The game&apos;s minimum requirements are actually far lower than they should be. On low-end machines, the game has all sorts of problems. AMD dual-core processors can actually cause endless disconnection issues. (Strange but true!) WoWp&apos;s framerate is highly dependent on BOTH the CPU &amp; video card. Having a low framerate is essentially the same as having internet lag. Either one will render the game unplayable.
<br>
<br>Another misconception is the variety of planes available. Many complain that certain aircraft are not in WoWp. Well, these planes are on the way. The developers decided to release planes in groups, and over time. (Most likely due to them advancing the release date.) They decided to leave out dedicated, high-altitude bombers though.
<br>
<br>The last (and most important) reason WoWp gets so much hate is the &quot;War Thunder&quot; players. They hate WoWp because it isn&apos;t exactly like War Thunder. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s fair. Sure, comparing the games is fair, but hating one or the other because they are not identical is just silly. There are positive and negative aspects of War Thunder that have nothing to do with WoWp at all.
<br>
<br>Taken as a whole, WoWp is a great game. It&apos;s free. It&apos;s easy to pick up and play. Fighting is fast and intense. Spending money on the game won&apos;t make you better. Servers go down for only 15-20 minutes every 24 hours. The graphics are mind-blowing, even on the lowest settings!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warplanes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3895810">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Graphics have been improved Drastically in the last 1-2 Updates
<br>the real problem with WOWP is they just don&apos;t get it this game is a hybrid between WT Arcade and Realistic but they put it to much Arcade after a while you get bored and want something with more Skill and Less RNG. The WT Arcade mode is awful and it plays like every plane is on Crack.
<br>
<br>But if you come from WOWP you can get into realistic battles without many problems
<br>this is because the Arcade model of WOWP is pretty hard to master and is not as arcady like in WT.
<br>My point is WOWP is fun but to Arcady for most even the Hardcore WOWP fans like me
<br>
<br>But if they take the RNG from the bullets and stop Autoaim it would be a huge improvement for the
<br>Veteran players.
<br>
<br>An other problem is Queue time ! it takes to long in the NA server up to 2-4 min
<br>if they had the same system like in WT  were you can just allow to play on all servers this would make the game much more fun.
<br>
<br>Today is update day and lots of  new planes have been added (P38 line) and graphics have been improved even more.
<br>
<br>I want to go to WG HQ and Slap the hell out of the WOWP devs
<br>they have a strong fanbase who love the game but WOWP seems to be let behind like
<br>retarded son.
<br>

<br>Essentially unfinished, this game provides somewhat moderate gameplay, and lacks the variety that World of Tanks throws at you.
<br>Although not a bad game, this does not reach the standard that the audience should like to see accomplished.
