But people said the game was good, and I decided to really give it a try. Sure enough, by the time I was about 1/3 through it, I absolutely could not stop playing the game. It&apos;s been said this game is much like kotor, since you can control the fate of your character through your choices, pursue a &quot;good/bad&quot; path, and take on missions in a rather non-linear fashion. However, when I played kotor, I don&apos;t think I experienced anything close to the enjoymjent and involvement I felt with this game. The game&apos;s real-time combat system, plentiful cinematics, intriguing storyline made me feel as if I&apos;d just finished watching a great movie. I wanted more, and I can&apos;t remember the last time any game has ever made me do that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=415133">Expand</a></span>

First, speaking of the good parts of the game. It is a role playing, third person, shooter with multiple interesting classes and the ability to defy physics with many abilities. The core game play is solid (even though I wish they would have included a reload element... like they did in me2,) The storyline is gripping, the cinematic are damned good, the character progression is very nice, as well. There are some plot holes and lots of other elements but simply put, its great! There is a wide variety of items and modificiations in the game, which add to the enjoy-ability for those who like loot finding. HOWEVER! There are several complaints that I have, which prevents me from giving it a perfect score... The main complaint is the mako exploration and side planet geometry. Its very obvious they did not put any time or effort into the height maps they used for the side mission planet. They were sloppily done with lots of jagged edges and some dips in the geometry that the mako has difficulty getting out of... Not to mention trying not to bounce around like a bumper car ride gone horribly wrong!... They could have used the blur tool on photoshop, to eliminate half of the geometry issues. The second complaint is the inventory system, I cannot select multiple items to disassemble, hell even a full tier would have been NICE! instead, I must go through my full inventory, of 150 items, and manually break the items into omnigel or sell them manually. This process is tedious and detracts from the overall gameplay experience. On top of this, they introduced a &quot;tier&quot; system, for loot. After about tier 5, for weapon mods and armor mods, they started to combine many of the effects of two mods, but made them less potent. Its fine and all, make them more powerful as you level up... once you hit level 40 the gear is all the same tier, for the last 20 levels. At which point you already have max omnigel and max credits... and max inventory constantly hounding you to clear space... There are a lot of elements that make this a great game, and some very major annoyances. Worth a 60 dollar price tag... its down to about 10, right now. Pick it up when you get a chance, especially if you like sci-fi shooters combined with rpg elements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849707">Expand</a></span>

Its combat system will require some time to get comfortable with, while the inventory management is acceptable, though obviously corny and at times annoying. On the contrary, the RPG customization looks well-realised, providing a good amount of classes, items and abilities. The galaxy map is single-handedly intriguing, surrounded by the empty void of the dark space. The planets graphical rendering may look dull; however, the chemistry of music and simple barren plains adds to the feeling of a far more plausible space exploration. Beyond that, Mass Effect tells an original and, much to my astonishment, unsettling story. It mesmerises with its brilliant vision of a universe ruled by a hierarchy of different races, humanity not being, for the first time, one of them. The rising evil depicted throughout the plot will force the player to beg for questions over the relativity of humanity attitude towards the universe. Eventually, this is a thorough-to-master game, at least to grasp its very sci-fi/rpg essence. Nevertheless, it does worth trying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2304417">Expand</a></span>

After reading all of the other user reviews, I think you either love or hate this game based on whether you are interested in story and adventure (love) or technical excellence and action (hate).  This is a story-driven game with a lot of locations to explore and a lot of backstory that is revealed gradually through dialog and journal entries as the game goes on.
<br>
<br>To give you some idea of why I like this game, the last few games I really loved were the Thief series, Deus Ex, and Dreamfall.  Here&apos;s a quick summary of what I think is good and bad about Mass Effect:
<br>
<br>GOOD:  Deep story.  Many characters to interact with if you choose, but only a few that you are forced to interact with to move the game along.  Mini-game lock-pick system that is challenging but not frustrating.  Tons of optional side quests, so you can skip them if you just want to cut to the chase, or do them if you&apos;re enjoying yourself and want to prolong the experience.  Pretty good voice acting, in my opinion.  Good third-person camera movement.  Graphics were good, not excellent, for 2008.
<br>
<br>BAD:  A bit glitchy; locked up on me three times during 50+ hours of gameplay.  Some frame-rate lag, even with my 2012 graphics card.  Less than perfect lip-syncing (but not terrible for a 2008 game).  Most of the RPG elements such as level-ups and experience points are incidental to the actual game experience; you could blast your way through without paying any attention to your character&apos;s develop and not really miss much.
<br>
<br>Personally, I liked the &quot;good&quot; and wasn&apos;t bothered by the &quot;bad,&quot; so I liked Mass Effect a lot and look forward to playing ME2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2514366">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a mix of RPG, Action (not the best though) and dialogue. Starting with the good things about this game. The epic storyline is truly worth going through and hopefully the trailer didn&apos;t spoil too much. Your character doesn&apos;t say a sentence that you don&apos;t choose. Bioware uses it&apos;s notoriously perfect dialogue wheel. During some very original missions you will be making hard choices that effect the story. The characters are a gold mine for Bioware. The RPG elements are there some may be exaggerated, but still fun. There are a lot of tweaks for weapons and armors. You can fully characterize your Shepard with looks, classes, even his scars and history. Mass Effect is an unpolished diamond and isn&apos;t perfect. There are three issues in the game. Auto-Save will rarely happen and it&apos;s a discipline to keep quick saving, make sure you holster your weapon and revive your squad mates or you won&apos;t be able to quick save. Another issue comes from long exploring and the tank Mako missions those could get really boring, but it&apos;s possible drive trough combat as long as the shield holds. Usually players will consider the combat the biggest problem, but remember when this game was made combat didn&apos;t get great as this. Your squad mates will be useful especially cause of their abilities. And with the RPG element combat gets interesting. However the AI can sometimes crash, talking about crashing there is a popular overheating bug for weapons at certain locations. If you manage to get trough the combat issues you will enjoy the wast galactic adventure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2553616">Expand</a></span>

I played this game on damn near max on a2.3ghz Dual Core with a NVIDIA 7600 and was fine, no graphical issues, the game looked and ran great. 2)This is possibly my favorite game ever. The story was simple yes, but it still grabs you. The interaction makes you a part of it, and the fact that it is a rare game that gives you that &quot;command decision&quot; (those of you who have beat it know what I am talking about) as well as a few other twists and turns dependent on who you are and what you&apos;ve done really gives you an interactive story feel. Bio ware didnt fail imo but the weapons and armor do feel a little old very soon with repatitve models and little to no difference in upgrades until about the end of the game. 3)While I give kudose for attempting at replayability, even going a drastically differernt path still feels too familiar and makes it difficult to play, even though I really want to (ie playing through with the higher gear or playing through as a bioic with assult rifle ) I criticise because thats part of the job of crticing a game but ultimately it is a great game, and its opne or two minor downfalls are really the only reason its not a perfect 10 and I wish metacritic had a better/more accurate rating system so I could go as far as 9.5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=424916">Expand</a></span>

The actual plot is a bit generic at times (great ending, though!) but the characters, dialogue and back-story is top notch, with some very interesting stuff. The secondary quests and explorable worlds have a very generic design (identical designs for many bases!), there&apos;s nowhere near the attention to detail that games like oblivion and GTA show in designing large explorable areas. I never had a problem with it crashing.

It&apos;s a modern, refined, squad-based Deus Ex, complete with a riveting, painstakingly realized world and narrative. Where it pales in comparison to Deus Ex is in its openness, or rather lack thereof: while the game world often gives the illusion of wide, unfettered space, you can&apos;t actually explore much of it, and what you can explore is fairly linearly designed. Still, the thrilling synergy of FPS and RPG makes the first playthrough a blast. The slick interface, snappy dialogue, well-paced and epic storyline, and frequent cinematic flourishes culminate in an engrossing experience. Bioware are masters of the linear action-RPG. It&apos;s time for them to push their boundaries, quite literally, and take a page from Bethesda in designing an open game world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=414097">Expand</a></span>

The decisions were never easy to make and are made all the more important by the fact that your choices will stick with you for ME2 and ME3, which is an absolutely fantastic idea. The difficulty levels were also superb, I found that there were a few moments that would get me sufficiently frustrated, forcing me to work out a better way through the level, maximising the use of my squad, but not so frustrated that it made me turn off the game.<br><br>All in all, Mass Effect is a game well worth playing, especially for the fact that you carry on your save file to ME2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2269678">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is solid and the story is fantastic. It&apos;s not everyday where you come across a game like this so if you have the money I would say go out and buy this. I&apos;ve played this both on PC and Xbox 360, I enjoyed it more on PC because of its accessibility, better graphics and much better controls with mouse and keyboard as opposed to a controller. Bioware went all out on this game. Typically its about an 18 hour game if you explore, if you rush you could beat this easily in about 12 hours. I&apos;ve had a few run &amp; gun sessions on boring, hot summer days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1711414">Expand</a></span>

<br>Nit-picks: interior cells are mostly copy-pasted for the many side missions, planet worlds could have been more lively. Other than at the Citadel you hardly meet people other than bad guys of one sort or another. The inventory is a mess, should have some sort of sorting option. The controls of the vehicle are a bit whacko. So this is why I give 9 points, otherwise it would be one of the very few 10&apos;s I would ever give to a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1629617">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Excellent plot in foundation and execution
<br>-Well written team of companions

<br>-Plot provides thought provoking commentary about current issues
<br>-Great musical score

<br>
<br>-Combat is a bit clunky--guns have unlimited &quot;ammo&quot; but overheat if fired a certain number of times
<br>-Cover system is very rudimentary and difficult to use practically

<br>Pros
<br>+Great Dynamic story that keeps changing depending on what role, what decisions and actions you make in the game.
<br>+Multiple Scenarios, Paths and Endings which leads to multiple playthroughs and thus replay value
<br>+Class based gameplay system which allows you to have a different experience each time you play as a different class.
<br>+Character customization lets you create your own character in their own appearance, etc
<br>+A great mixture of RPG and FPS elements packaged into one game
<br>+Fantastic voice acting and a lot of voice over scenes
<br>+A great morality system that also plays in what bonuses you would get (i.e. discounts, certain decision options)
<br>+Leveling system has quite a depth that ranges from learning unique class abilities to weapon mastery
<br>+Save files are interchangeable between Steam and Origin.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Some minor glitches could occur such as falling into the floor or certain scenes not being playable from time to time but nothing game breaking and does not happen often or repeatedly
<br>-Some of the visual designs look a bit outdated and last gen style (PS2/GCN/Xbox era)
<br>-Some of the side missions lead you to similar to same looking areas and structures
<br>-Some of the planets are so barren and empty with nothing but fetch quests or extra grinding for weapons and money.
<br>-Pinnacle Station DLC is not available for standalone purchases of Mass Effect 1. Only available for Trilogy purchasers.
<br>-Bring Down the Sky DLC has to be downloaded separately and installed unlike the description in the store page where it says its available already.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=4439318">Expand</a></span>

The game features great characters, a very interesting and quite original sci-fi setting and smart dialogue system. The combat, which has no re-loadable weapons but instead an overheating-system (featured on heavy machine guns in many other shooters) was refreshing.</span>

<br>The universe in which ME plays off is deep and rich, lore hunters will love collecting all the Codex entries scattered throughout the game as they are all well written and really serve to immerse the player.
<br>
<br>The main quests are fun and dynamic. Fast paced and action packed you get real bang for your buck from these. The optional side quests get recycled many times over and feel very generic. By the end of the game it becomes tedious to drive around in the Mako and clear yet another rogue installation but the quests thankfully are short.
<br>
<br>Lots of Armour and weapons to pick-up and customize to your liking with a slew of upgrades to experiment with for maximum damage and surviveability</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=4408364">Expand</a></span>

Once you get used to the somewhat rigid controls, and once the story gets going, it&apos;s a thrilling game that you won&apos;t be able to put down. Getting to explore Shepard&apos;s relationships with his crewmates lets you really get to know them as distinct individuals. The histories of each planet were also wonderful to read. As with most games I love, the soundtrack leaves nothing to be desired. I&apos;ve always felt music was just as important to any game or movie as the story, and Mass Effect&apos;s hits all the right notes. All fans of sci-fi should find this as brilliant as I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2539194">Expand</a></span>

Every character has a deep history and a valid reason to be where they are and do what they are doing. There are numerous ethical choices throughout the game that define your character, but also how the story will play out. Where as in the KOTOR you are forced to be either the ultimate good or the ultimate evil, here you can be any shade of gray in-between. Classes you are allowed to play are vastly different and NPCs bring along variety of strengths and weaknesses. The only real negative in the game are the vehicle levels, as they are very long, tedious and don&apos;t bring anything new to the table.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>- deep, character driven story where your actions throughout the game affect outcomes and behaviors of others.
<br>- you are allowed to play as ultimate good or ultimate evil, but also as many shades of gray in-between
<br>- high replay value
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>- vehicle levels are long, boring and repetitive</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2235404">Expand</a></span>

The reason why I&apos;m only giving this an 8 out of 10 is because of the annoying Inventory system and because all the sidequests are too boring and have very similar map layouts, which takes a lot of fun out of the game, unfortunately.</span>

As one would expect from Bioware, the game puts you into an expansive world full of lore and interesting characters. Honestly, that is the game&apos;s strongest point. While not impressive, the 3rd-person shooter gameplay is fun (though far less polished than ME2 and ME3) and there is a big galaxy to explore, full of uncharted pirate bases and treasures guarded by monsters. While the inventory system is somewhat unwieldy and managing gear becomes more of a chore later in the game, it does provide one with plenty of options and opportunity to specialize gear for specific play styles, missions, and enemy types. The game&apos;s biggest flaw is its infamous vehicle sections, which are often a huge pain, but this is a small part of the game and one need not spend much time on these sections if they are bothered too much. All in all, this is a great space RPG which is well worth the time and money. If you spend time exploring the galaxy and doing side-quests, you can easily get 80 hours out of this game--not bad for the $10-20 it costs these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540704">Expand</a></span>

When Mass Effect launched it brought us a visually stunning sci-fi action role-playing game that was unlike any other experience. I really enjoy how the original has more RPG elements than later titles, with more story line choices and customization, and squadmates have an inventory. The weapon/armor choices and upgrades are the best the series has to offer. The only thing that sets the original back from the second and third is the combat. Mass Effect&apos;s battles don&apos;t feel as smooth, especially aiming and the use of skills. Also, having unlimited ammo actually makes the game feel less realistic. It is although important to mention that the first is the most challenging in my opinion, where I found myself dying even on normal difficulty. Overall if you skipped Mass Effect 1 for any reason or think that it may not be as good as the others, do yourself a favor and play this game because to this day it is amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2604030">Expand</a></span>

Moving around is painfully slow, the dialogues are too long and most side missions are dumb as hell from the opening sentence. The inventory is so unpleasant that I don&apos;t look at it any more. Giving it a 6 because of the effort put into the game. It works. But it&apos;s so much behind Fallout.</span>

<br>
<br>Mass Effect is a mediocre third person shooter with little character customization that offers 2 ways of playing the game. Shoot everything and shoot everything with space magic. Bare bones, if you add a typical HOT pop-a-mole combat philisophy implemented in this game, that doesn&apos;t even tries to cover (pathetic pun intended) itself.
<br>
<br>One thing bugs me after my second playthrough. This game looks half-baked, or aborted in an early production phaze. There are parts of the game, where it seems that there was a creative spark somewhere, someone had a vision of a great s-f/space opera game, that wouldn&apos;t just make money, but will offer all s-f tropes and classics from all over in one place for everyone to enjoy. Then the writing started, art-direction department attempted to do something with style, aaaand... few weeks later they had to say &quot;eh - &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; it&quot;. And left the game with few interesting places to visit, few Codex (in-game lore encyclopedia) entries and a whole lot of filler content probably made by unexperienced interns. I do believe that most of the content in the game is a work of unexperienced hacks, just look at the Mako part of the game. I don&apos;t believe it would be passable even for a student. It boils down to disattachment between the lore part of the game, and the actual gameplay. The lore, places and characters are giving you a premise of varied experiences, but at the end of the game it all boils down to TPS action in a terribly designed locations. C&amp;C boil down to occasional speech check (and since no one will play without these skills maxed out, everyone will get that option) that will end all filler quests non-violently with absolutely cringe-worthy dialogue lines. Just listen to the final dialogue with Saren. I couldn&apos;t help myself but laugh while listening to it. It&apos;s like taken straight from a terrible 10 years old s-f writer on the Internet. Just terrible.
<br>
<br>For a buck it&apos;s worth checking out. Just prepare for some cringe-fest and a lot of autism-inducing activities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=6005267">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll find yourself missing some of the diversity present in the first game with the alien races, and giving yourself the option to save or sacrifice major characters makes this a worthwhile experience.  The dialogue is well written and the voice work is some of the best in video games.  Definitely worth playing if you can find it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=4557333">Expand</a></span>

It truly is an epic science-fiction story which will provide you with many &quot;aha-effects&quot; if you are familiar with the popular science-fiction TV shows and movies.
<br>
<br>Playing this game I am often reminded of Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Starship Troopers, Farscape and even Stargate to a certain extent, because the gateway-like conduit/relays are reminiscent of Stargates, or perhaps the jump gates from Babylon 5. The universe of the game is diverse, it is a story about co-existence, but also problems between humanity and alien races who have tried to establish a status quo on a huge, city-like space station called the Citadel.
<br>
<br>You start out with a character creation screen - and I do recommend you play the female Shepard, because the voice acting is so much better, and it simply is visually more appealing - and craft your own character just the way you like it. From here on out you&apos;re making decisions, forging relationships, decide whether you want to use diplomacy or force, and based on your chosen path the methods by which you achieve the mission goals (and the difficulty with which the game unfolds) the outcome might be different. You should also choose wisely who of your squad members you take on a mission, because sometimes having a higher tech ability might be more useful than combat strength. The customization option in terms of armor, weapon loadout and add-ons are also mindboggling. Make sure you keep your squad in good shape!
<br>
<br>I can honestly say that I&apos;ve never before felt this connection to a virtual group of people in a single player experience, nor has it ever been that hard in a game to make a choice between who lives, who dies, who gets hurt by your choice, and who will become a close friend. The excellent voice acting (Lance Henricksen and Dwight Schultz to name only a couple of famous actors) does much to create immersion. The side quests in this first installment are a little repetitive, granted, but the story arch makes up for it, never mind the epic end-battle which truly happens on a cinematic scale and quality.
<br>
<br>If you like sci-fi, RPGs and action-adventure games that give you a lot of freedom given a linear story line (and take one or the other cliche), this is for you. And given the fact that you can continue using your character throughout the sequels, do start with this first episode of the trilogy. You will feel far more connected and familiar playing with a Shepard having already over 40 hours under their belt when embarking on the next journey.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=4464784">Expand</a></span>

<br>Last year during Christmas holidays, I introduced my brother (a university student) to the game.  He finished the trilogy in record time (was completely addicted).

<br>
<br>The game seems like a fusion of Dragon Age, KOToR and Neverwinter Nights all wrapped up together in a wonderful package. If you liked any of those games, you will undoubtedly like this!
<br>
<br>You follow the path of Shepard (male or female depending on your preference) in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from the ominous Reapers. Along the way you recruit companions, fall in love and make tough decisions. It also allows for a little exploration in form of the many sidequests.
<br>
<br>You get to select from a multitude of different classes and level-up and outfit the characters however you want. It also features a squad ordering system (although basic) to position your squad tactically. The combat is in the form of an over-the-shoulder third person, cover-based shooter. It works well here when combined with your squads various strengths and weaknesses.
<br>
<br>All-in-all, a very good game that I would recommend to everyone interested in the format.

Although it&apos;s graphic is not as beautiful as the following MEs but the complex character evolution is the best in the series. Lot of people hate Mako quests but I have no problem with them.

The Mass Effect universe seems vast to start off with, and an overload of new characters, species and back-stories in the first part of the game can make you feel like it&apos;s going to take a lifetime to remember all the races, politics and history, but eventually you learn the important parts and the rest fall into place. Unfortunately, the poor interface takes so long to learn and get used to, it takes a while before you really feel in control of your character and their abilities and really start to enjoy the game.<br>I&apos;m looking forward to playing part 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2421601">Expand</a></span>

The complexity of it all made me not interested, but he gave me to let me play. I turned it on, was amazed by the character creation, then got in-game. I instantly compared the species and story to other science fiction, and my first impression was that it was it was a poor original adaptation of Star Wars. Boy was I wrong. By the end of the game I shat my pants by the vast, epic feeling of needing to protect the galaxy from domination. Amazing story (to be expected from Bioware), cutting edge graphics (for 2008), and intuitive gameplay. The chat wheel was revolutionary for the gaming industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977027">Expand</a></span>

I have to admit that when the game first game out I thought it was stupid for only being released on the XBox.  It was not until much later, when the PC port came out, that I picket it up at Direct2Drive.  From the second I started playing it I knew there was something special to be had here.  I was gripped by the story almost instantly, being a huge Sci-Fi nerd and all.  This is a great series, cannot wait to see how it ends.<br><br>That said, on to the review.  Personally I never had many problems with ME1 during my first couple of play throughs, but as I did more the game seemed to degrade in quality.  More weird crap would start happening and such.<br><br>You play as Commander Shepard, a soldier in the Alliance Navy.  You are stationed on the MSV Normandy, a frigate class spec ops ship recently constructed.  The Normandy was a dual venture between the Turians, an alien race in Mass Effect, and Humanity.  The result was a ship that cost about as much as a fleet to develop and build but that also has some very cool tech built into it.<br><br>You are on a dry run mission to test out the Normandy&apos;s stealth systems along with a Turian Specter called Nihlus.  He is a guest aboard the ship sent by the Council, a governmental organization that governs the galaxy from a super station known as the Citadel.  The Specters are said to be the right hand of the Council, they are a paramilitary organization that answer only to the Council but that have no oversight either.  It is up to each Specter to complete their missions using their best judgement.<br><br>The test run is interrupted, however, when a distress single from Eden Prime is intercepted.  Eden Prime is Humanity&apos;s more successful colony out in Deep Space.  It is seen as a tourist spot and is also a symbol of Humanity&apos;s will to explore and colonize worlds.  They claim they are under attack by an unknown race.  Captain Anderson, who leads the crew of the Normandy, orders them to set course to Eden Prime at top speed.<br><br>When they get there they find that the colony is in ruins and a massive ship is parked on the surface.  From the few video recordings sent from the colony before contact is lost we determine that the ones attacking Eden Prime are the Geth, a race of artificial intelligence created by the Quarians.  They have not been seen in Citadel space for nearly three hundred years.<br><br>Nihlus jumps out of the ship ahead of Shepard and his small team after the Normandy enters the atmosphere.  Shepard&apos;s mission is to find out what the Geth are after and why they have attacked the colony.<br><br>The story and universe of Mass Effects is super expansive and could be called a living thing.  It is always expanding and it gives you a feeling that it actually exists.  The development of the game is top notch and the dialog is very good.  Sonically Mass Effect also hits a home run.<br><br>The only reason I did not rate this a 10 is because of those few bugs I have encountered and plus the many bugs other people have been plagued with.<br><br>ME1 is a true TPS RPG game with a massive array of weaponry, armor, and support items as well as mods to apply to those weapons.  There are some weapons that are not accessible until you play in a New Game+.  In your first game you can only get up to level 8 or 9 gear, but in your next play through, if you use a completed save to start from, you get access to up to level 10 gear as well as having new enemies placed into the world to make things a bit more difficult.<br><br>Mass Effect is truly a masterpiece and no self respecting Sci-Fi RPG fan would not have this in their collection.<br><br>There are two DLCs for this game: Bringing Down the Sky and Pinnacle Station.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1976172">Expand</a></span>

On the one hand the conversation events, dialog, character and creature design, interior environmental design, its ambitious decision making ideas, some game play and RPG ideas are great and work well together but on the other hand the overall story becomes predictable, too much of the sci fi is cliche, the lack of tutorials means you dont understand how the game works (even after finishing it), the shooting mechanics are crappy, the loot system clunky and the third quarter of the game becomes tiresome and repetitive. Mass Effect could also learn a lot of a game like Zelda Ocarina of Time for game pacing as there are large long sequences where the player finds themselves trapped in a non combat RPG environment for hours and hours rather then rewarding the player with new areas and action to break up the monotony. I found myself several times wanting to quit Mass Effect while playing and even found myself forcing myself to finish it. I dont want to seem over handed with my criticism as half of Mass Effect is good, but everything the game doe right, is then bogged down by issues. Mass Effect is a must play because of its superb sequel but as it stands by itself is only good, not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697780">Expand</a></span>

Overall if you are a PC gamer, this is one great game you shouldn&apos;t miss.</span>

It has mediocre combat mechanics, boring and small sidequests, empty planets, a vehicle that as a necessary evil cannot be hurt even if thrown 1000 feet down from a mountain range and into a crater filled with natural spires and the game itself is as dumped down as you can get for &quot;console&quot; use. However these &quot;problems&quot; are as far as the negative criticism can go. The space opera that Bioware has created is for the most part an excellent piece of making something from nothing. From this point on the game &quot;sucks&quot; you in. The characters for the most part are interesting and the conversations between them realistic. It helps that your own character talks and acts (though the female protagonist is notably better than the male one) with enough believability for you to not feel detract from the experience. Musical score is excellent, visuals are sharp though they perform a little unreliably and the low res textures show their ugly face in a lot of places (like characters cloths and bodies). Its too bad that the game lasts only 20-25 hours and another good 10 or so with the sidequests counted in but its enough to satisfy. Overall the game can use a lot of improvements here and there but its a testament to the rest of the work done with this game that it feels as such. Dragon Age origins on the other hand....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=741899">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a great game with a few flaws. The biggest flaw is the publisher. EA Games has completely stopped supporting this game. If you install it from scratch now, you can no longer get the (free to PC players) bring down the sky DLC as the webpage to download it no longer exists.  You can&apos;t even add the cd-key of the game to EA&apos;s Origin service without help from a support representative, as the page to do so will tell you the registration was successful but then not add the game to your library. As for flaws in the game itself, skipping conversations is hard to do without accidentally picking a dialogue option sometimes because the skip key is the same key used to select an option. Also there is way too much loot in the game for the low inventory limit you have. You will tire of the &quot;you are getting close to the 150 item limit&quot; message very quickly. Other than that, the game is pretty short for a RPG but it&apos;s enjoyable, and the dialogue system adds to replay value because of the different options you get depending on whether your character leans toward good (paragon) or evil (renegade). And you&apos;ll definitely want to play this game just to get to its sequels if you haven&apos;t played it already!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2264745">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fine, pretty standard cover shooting but with the ability to use squad powers as well as your own. Overall I felt the story was pretty compelling and my second time through I had the patience and the interest to read through most of the codex and dialogue options. Missions become a little repetitive and the side quests are pretty much clones of each other even going as far as whole buildings having the same layout even if they were built lightyears apart. Overall though I was always having fun except when trying to manage the poor inventory system. If you&apos;re into your sci-fi and your shooters, this is a must.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=2846402">Expand</a></span>

Using cover is almost always a disadvantage since the terrible AI will almost always bum rush you in large numbers.  Staying OUT of cover is an advantage in these situations as you have more camera control and are able to protect yourself from their suicide rushes.  This reduces the vast majority of encounters to simply running around wildly.  Additionally, while Mass Effect boasts a number of character classes to choose from, there is some overlap between abilities with certain classes, making the game seem more varied than it really is.<br><br>Environments, outside of the main story missions, are almost entirely identical.  Mass Effect allows you to explore a wide variety of planets, but the terrain differs little and often only in color pallet.  While exploring or doing side missions, you come across many structures with identical layout and rooms.  Side missions are plentiful, but differ little in structure.  Go here, kill this, find that, come home.  There is little incentive to explore the galaxy and partake in content outside the main story line.  The morality system, if you want to call it that, changes little beyond Shepard&apos;s responses.  Acting like an avatar of virtue and justice versus an impatient killing machine carries no serious ramifications nor does it alter the course of the narrative in any meaningful way beyond a few encounters in the main storyline.  Mass Effect&apos;s interface is another weak point.  The menu system was obviously designed for consoles.  No effort was made to create a more streamlined and user friendly interface for the PC port.  When shopping, there is no way to compare what you currently have equipped with what you are looking to buy.  The game requires you to exit the shop, open your inventory, memorize the stats of the item in question, talk to the shop owner again, click through his dialogue, open his inventory, and scroll through the list until you find the item you were trying to compare.  The story is good but you&apos;ll get the feeling you&apos;ve heard it somewhere before.  The characters in your party are generally interesting each with their own unique backgrounds.  Some of the most fun I had with this game was wandering around the ship and getting as much background info out of the various characters that I could, even if a couple of them are somewhat flat.  The universe is well fleshed out and there is a lot of interesting glossary material to read through for those interested in lore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1648884">Expand</a></span>

The save system serves to elevate the tension - compare this to Bioshock&apos;s Vita Chambers. Consolitis shows up in the limited and half-finished side mission worlds but otherwise the interface really looks and plays like a PC game.

The combat is fun (especially using the sniper rifle :3 ) but some of the abilities of your men and confusing to use and I couldn&apos;t figure out how to use the upgrades. Plus the item system was a bit confusing and annoying as well. In short, most of the RPG elements need stripping out and thought through again. Lucky really that you can for the most part ignore them. It&apos;s also worth nothing that the side quests are incredibly dull, but considering the playtime it&apos;s hardly a massive loss. I love this game, and you should play it, if only so you can get with an alien.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=83573">Expand</a></span>

Granted, it is a Bioware title so you can be assured of some good degree of quality but unfortunately, as with Mass Effect--Bioware&apos;s homebrew game universe--the quality and depth of the game play has become progressively shallow in Bioware&apos;s RPG games of late. Having said that, Mass Effect is an excellent game for those who enjoyed the Kotor games as Mass Effect mimics the style, narratives, and mechanics in many ways. On the downside, the overall campaign is fairly short and somewhat predictable even the first time through, leaving replay ability to suffer. This is further compounded by the shallow character system and mostly linear nature of the campaign and campaign options. Graphics, sound, and overall ambiance are what you would expect from a Bioware title and the game is truly a visual treat from start to finish. Equipment and character customization is a little tedious and woefully underdone for a game pronounced as an &quot;RPG&quot; but fits the bill for the style of the game offered. In all, if you&apos;re looking for an RPG with depth and engaging character development, look elsewhere. If you want an action-centric RPG-lite in a sci-fi and Star Wars like setting, this game was made for you. Once you&apos;ve played it, If you think Mass Effect feels like an RPG designed for a casual console gamer, you&apos;d be right--a mild learning curve, generally low difficulty factor, shallow game mechanics, and tons of action and eye-candy; these all describe Bioware&apos;s Mass Effect succinctly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=416232">Expand</a></span>

The characters are not annoying, but not terribly complex either. Why a 3 then? Video Driver Lockups. Now I have a Core 2 quad core cpu (2.5GHZ), 3GB ram and a GeForce GTX 260. We are not talking low end system here. I updated drivers and direct x. I turned down the settings on the card and the game to minimums and still got lock ups. Sometimes I would play for 3 hours and have no lockups, sometimes I&apos;d play for 10 minutes before locking up. I finished the games main story arc, but gave up on trying to run ANY side missions. I got sick of rebooting. Let me explain. See when we lock up we don&apos;t just crash, oh no. We get into a loop and trash the video. Then we constantly (every say 5 seconds) request focus to the window. This has the effect of preventing you from being able to use the task manager to shutdown the game. Or the windows menu. Or anything else. The only way is to hard boot. That is hit the power button. Now if your lucky, like me, your computer will notify windows and shutdown properly...if not then good luck on not messing something up. Over all I&apos;d say take a miss on this just because of the crashes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=421123">Expand</a></span>

The scope and imagination in this game is top-notch in sci-fi genre. However, similar to many other games, it suffers from many design failures including repetitive combat, reused environments, inconvenient user interface (inventory system is so bad), and technical problems (crash, freeze and long elevator loading). This game&apos;s story and character design is quite like Knights of the old republic. There are many twists in the plot line and you can choose two different moral paths. However, I personally feel its real-time combat system is better than KotOR at least it&apos;s not that boring while the down side is you can not directly control your squad members. I give it 8 out 10 since mass effect 2 did a better job on the overall game design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1783553">Expand</a></span>

No other Game has ever made me feel like the Mass Effect Trilogy. One of the best games of all time, no, one of the best pieces of entertainment of all time.

I have a habit of trailing the trend, and this allows me to use effectively get the best bang out of every buck I spend on games as I usually end up picking out games with the very best reviews.
<br>
<br>Originally, I was very skeptical of Mass Effect. I&apos;ve played Bioware games before, and they usually left me with a terrible impression. Mass Effect, on the other hand, was surprisingly incredible.
<br>
<br>Mass Effect is actually a trilogy game if you didn&apos;t already know that, but what you may not know is that, it is meant to be played all 3 in succession. If you&apos;re going to buy ME, you better be prepared to buy the complete set, because they&apos;re all interwoven so well, that if you only buy one or two, you&apos;ll always feel like you&apos;re missing something.
<br>
<br>And it is exactly that, that makes ME trilogy so attractive.
<br>
<br>It reminds me of the old &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books I enjoyed so much when I was young.
<br>
<br>Your regular choices regularly affect everything and everyone around you, just as you would in the real world. And once you&apos;ve chosen, you can consequently see your choices being played out through the trilogy.
<br>
<br>Unlike games like Skyrim, while you&apos;re free to pursue whatever activities you so prefer. The game doesn&apos;t presume a specific personality or allow you to presume as one. So while the freedom is there, and while there are literally hundreds of NPCs for you to meet, and thousands more dialogue to hear..at best, it only feels like a television show just being played out with you on the passive receiving end.
<br>
<br>The feeling is different, even different from Deus Ex. In Deus Ex, while you have choices of different responses and actions, they ultimately come off only as techniques of persuasions but the same personality is being still used.
<br>
<br>In ME, like in the real world, you will encounter really tough situational questions. Even while your personality will naturally reflect your usual responses, but there will still be the odd time where you will wonder what it would be like to be an &quot;alpha&quot; male? Or whether there is a way to change your superior&apos;s bad impression of your character? Or you want to learn a few techniques in reading in-between the lines? You know, the useful day-to-day conversation skills that you never learn anywhere else (short of countless social blunders)! Those dangerous words and actions that you&apos;ve always wanted to say, but couldn&apos;t for fear of irreparable damage to your self image and relationships.
<br>
<br>ME&apos;s good like that, and that&apos;s why I think it stands out above the rest.
<br>
<br>Granted, the massive freedom, for say Skyrim, allows the game to have massive replay value, whereas a game like Mass Effect, you&apos;ll probably only play through it once, twice at best.
<br>
<br>But, based on the combined quality of material presented, good graphics, voice acting, seamless gameplay, and most importantly, the interactive story, is well worth the price tag of being played through even just once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=3103788">Expand</a></span>

Battles appear out of nowhere, and you get killed 1000 times, before magically, you don&apos;t. Very console like. The save system is insane, you can only save when you&apos;re NOT in an action sequence. Which means you start a battle, and cannot save during it, which means you make no progress. The storyline is decent, the voicing decent, and the overall Sci Fi feel is nice. But the action is simply terrible. It is NOT a shooter, nor a real RPG. Its like an interactive movie, which is cool, but it is grueling to get through scene after scene. The most disappointing part, is that beside Bioware releasing a game with massive technical problems and bugs, they delete posts on their forums from frustrated users asking for help. Sounds like a shenanigans to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=413651">Expand</a></span>

If only this game had better gameplay. Defiantly a favorite of mine. I would give it a ten in terms of how fun it is for me.

Everything from your characters appearance (face), to the armor you&apos;re wearing to what weapons you use an what upgrades they have installed.  The graphics are pretty good for the most part. It&apos;s no Crysis (1), but this is a port after all so I doubt an Xbox or PS3 could handle anything more than this game puts out.  This game is four years old now, and the sheer size of the universe that you&apos;re playing in,which is huge,  it&apos;s bound to have some repetitive textures, especially on relatively insignificant planets. However, for the most part, they&apos;re still pretty good and the scenery is great.<br>The music is really good and draws you in to the story more as it&apos;s scripted to come on at specific times during action sequences and whatnot.  And if you really want to know more about the game than is presented during gameplay, open up your codex and there&apos;s a lot of backstory. The bad: There really isn&apos;t much. One problem I&apos;ve had with the game was the NPC&apos;s audio. During interaction with them, their speech would occasionally cut out (music and ambient sounds still play). Which kind of sucks for the story, however, enabling subtitles remedies that. Perhaps it was just my soundcard not playing well with the game (Creative X-Fi extreme music). However since Creative&apos;s last update for the card, I haven&apos;t come across this issue. Another issue I&apos;ve found, however VERY infrequently, is getting stuck. There&apos;s an area that looks explorable, yet, you go there, and you get stuck. You have to reload the game. However, this is VERY infrequent. Other thoughts: The combat system is somewhat simplistic. It&apos;s semi FPSish except you can &quot;pause&quot; the action and command your squad to attack specific targets with specific attacks (weapons, biotic or tech attacks). Other than that, it&apos;s just like an FPS duck for cover, point and click, throw grenade, melee attack, etc. I don&apos;t see how people have issues with popping out of cover to shoot. It does it automatically, however, you have to be at the edge of what ever you&apos;re hiding behind for it to work. As far as I can tell, there aren&apos;t really any hitboxes in the game. Meaning headshots don&apos;t do any more or less damage than body or appendage hits.  The next issue is the inventory system. It doesn&apos;t alphabetically organize and group together identical items. Kind of a pain. However, you can carry a whole helluva lot of stuff (150 items IIRC). For what it&apos;s worth, I haven&apos;t had this game crash ever. Not once. I&apos;ve played it on an old 2.6GHz 939 dual core AMD system with 2 9600 GSO&apos;s, to an overclocked AM3 rig with 2 4870&apos;s, to an i7 (8core) with a 5870 using Windows XP and Windows 7 64 bit --runs flawlessly. People that have had the crashes most likely have a virus and don&apos;t know it, or their overclock is unstable.  This is a PORTED game and as such, I&apos;ve personally found ported games to crash frequently when your overclock is unstable.  Final thoughts: All in all Mass Effect is a excellent game. Don&apos;t expect it to be like a traditional RPG --it&apos;s not. It&apos;s not an FPS either.  However, the story is what makes this game. It&apos;s fresh, diverse, and totally engrossing. It gives you the freedom to act how you&apos;d like and change the fate of the story. This game is the first of three, and what decisions you make in this game will affect some things in the second one, and from what I&apos;ve read, will significantly impact the third.  PS:The people that gave this game a 0 because of the DRM are idiots. That&apos;s NOT a review of the game. It&apos;s them whining and complaining about EA digital rights management (DRM). Should&apos;ve bought it on Steam, and you can install it as many times as you like. PPS: Even if you do have the retail copy, and you use your 3 installs, simply call or get on live chat with EA support and they&apos;ll unblock it. And they&apos;re so good about it, if you ask for the Bring down the sky key they&apos;ll give it to you FOR FREE!<br><br>GREAT GAME BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782055">Expand</a></span>

Story telling is amazing with deep characters around you and trust me, you will love them all. Graphics are ok, level design is perfect and combat system is average. Soundtrack and voice overs are great too! Bioware really took care about this one and I am grateful for it. Really great RPG</span>

                                        <span>Great game and a well deserved 10, the soundtrack makes me come back and play it again and again.  The story line was quite quick but the game makes up with lots of side quests...if the side quests had more meaning then there would be something then it would be a real 10.</span>
