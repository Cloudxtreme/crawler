Google for yourself, Kenneth Lindenbaum busted for writing fake reviews on metacritic and steam pretending to be a user.</span>

Denying that COOP isn&apos;t broken and other crap. Movie based title game... what the hell did I expect...

Some of the minor characters feel like they&apos;re phoning it in, but the two leads are most important and they did a great job.
<br>
<br>It feels like Trek.  The ability to choose non-lethal combat in appropriate scenarios is a great choice.  Phasers have a &apos;stun&apos; settings for a reason!  The tricorder is well designed and very useful, though it almost falls into Batman Arkham Asylum territory because you want to keep it on at almost all times to find objects you can interact with, but that means you can&apos;t have your weapon out. (Why not tricorder in one hand, phaser in the other?)
<br>
<br>The story is serviceable.  Nothing amazing, but not bad.  This could easily be the plot of an episode of a new Trek TV series.
<br>
<br>The Enterprise looks great.  I didn&apos;t like the design of the new 1701 at first, but it&apos;s growing on me, and it looks as it should in this game.
<br>
<br>Cons:  The shooting controls are awful.  Shooting anything at close range is near impossible because you wind up shooting behind the target that&apos;s right in front of you.  Wonky perspective.
<br>
<br>The cover mechanics only work when they want to.  I keep wishing they had been able to copy the Mass Effect controls and cover mechanic, but this feels like a really cheap imitation of that.
<br>
<br>The game can devolve into a cluster**** when you&apos;re in combat shooting and being shot at (while wrestling with the controls), trying to listen to someone give you critical information while everything is exploding, and there are prompts telling you new interactions all at the same time.  Often times, one of those things will be missed and you&apos;ll die.  One time it got to the point where the best way to advance was to just run head first into danger and get to the other side before I died instead of listening to the hints/prompts.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is good at times, but not often enough.  It goes from slightly fun to immensely frustrating like a never-ending rollercoaster.  Absolutely not worth full retail price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123297">Expand</a></span>

Over the shoulder, cover based, shooter means this game equals Gears of Trek except for the fact that the shooting mechanics are absolutely atrocious and the A.I. is possibly some of the dumbest seen since Aliens Colonial Marines (ok, maybe not THAT bad but close). I&apos;ve read lots of people trying to compare the game to Mass Effect. I suppose that comparison would be valid except, unlike Mass Effect, this game lacks a compelling narrative, character dialog, deep environment interactions, and RPG elements.
<br>
<br>The story, so far, has been trite. Nothing more than a poor excuse to push players along to each scripted area of waist high walls and explosions. The cover mechanics are nearly as broken as the shooting mechanics and while the non-lethal takedowns are a great addition, most players will just forget about them and kill everything.
<br>
<br>Graphically, the fact that this is a shoddy port of the console versions is clear from the start. The graphics themselves look decidedly dated even at high resolutions. The rendering of Chris Pine as Kirk is decent but Zachary Quinto as Spock? Let&apos;s just say the game&apos;s rendition of Spock looks as though he is a Vulcan with Down&apos;s Syndrome. Meanwhile, textures glitch out and low resolution textures are covered by bloom. Gameplay bugs are all over the place abound while coop (a major selling point) is broken. The fact that the devs themselves have been caught trying to inflate the score should be quite telling.
<br>
<br>This is a far, far cry from Roddenberry&apos;s Star Trek, which, despite its cheesiness, always had an undercurrent of moral and/or philosophical discussion. This, much like J.J. Abrams&apos; reboot, is just a bombastic show of special effects that doesn&apos;t even try to engage the viewer/player. I&apos;m sad I wasted my time with this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3124108">Expand</a></span>

Generally speaking, &quot;Star Trek the Video Game&quot; was a fun title to play with a friend, but it is far too short (~10 hours) to warrant its $50 price tag.
<br>
<br>I understand the comparisons made to franchises like &quot;Mass Effect&quot; (e.g. cover-based, over-the-shoulder, third-person combat, smartly concealing their loading screens within elevator rides), but I think the game has enough variety to describe it as a compilation of elements from several titles. Most things were derivative in nature, except for the complementary design of the co-op system. During missions, there are instances where each player has their own distinct tasks to perform, and these moments were more akin to co-op titles like &quot;Hunted: The Demon Forge&quot;, where the game requires collaboration to complete tasks. I bought this game intending to play it with a friend, so I will limit my comments to the co-op adventure, although my experience with similar games usually includes frustration with the AI partners during solo play.
<br>
<br>Some of the &quot;puzzles&quot; that required players to navigate the environment were inspired, and we really didn&apos;t experience the number of bugs being described in other reviews, so perhaps some of these were fixed in a subsequent patch. Placing the events of the game before the second movie would seem to provide more opportunities for creativity, as opposed to merely animating what audiences viewed in theaters, and I felt this was a better way of using a video game to advertise a movie. The overall story arc was fine, but it just needed more fleshing out; a game at this price should be at least 30 hours or more, and it really should be well-polished. Neither of these are true, and so I agree with many of the criticisms that have been levied on this title. If the game had been priced at under $30, and we had been able to play it on release day, I probably would have had more positive things to state.
<br>
<br>More specifically, the lip-syncing was slightly off at times, probably due to fewer muscles being simulated in the face (compared to titles from Bioware). Including the voices of the actual movie cast was certainly a plus, but the voice direction could have been a bit sharper. Some characters were well-rendered, while others (like Chekov) looked acceptable during distant cut scenes, but up-close seemed as if they had contracted some unknown illness. A couple of the checkpoints were set at moments where the characters had a lot of dialogue, so if your team needed to repeat a task, you both had to endure the several minutes of dialogue and movement to retry the event.
<br>
<br>Now that the co-op experience is functional, I don&apos;t think it is fair to give this game a score of zero. If you wait for the price to come down below $30, and have someone you enjoy playing co-op games in mind, I think you&apos;ll enjoy &quot;Star Trek the Video Game&quot;. Again, I&apos;d list it with titles like &quot;Hunted: The Demon Forge&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings: War in the North&quot;, or &quot;Transformers: The War for Cybertron&quot; when trying to rate the fun of the co-op experience. None of these games are perfect, but these days there are few high-quality games that focus on a lengthy co-op campaign, and I wish that would change. The game is notably short, but I suppose the players could switch characters and try different strategies (e.g. stealth), assume alternate roles in hacking puzzles, and vary the choice of weapons and upgrades to make a second play-through almost as interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123704">Expand</a></span>

Now  if you rate your own  game a 10 out of 10 just because you made it while no one else is able to play the co op and the game is just pure  why even bother making it? I hope, from the ground of my heart, that Namco Bandai games goes bankrupt. Shame on all of you over at Bandai.</span>

They also indirectly referred to users who gave low reviews as &quot;trolls&quot; on their Twitter account. Trolls, indeed, Kenneth. This level of corporate corruption and scarcely disguised propaganda is beyond brazen.

<br>The actual product is so far away from what was promised... it&apos;s like you pre-ordered a Porsche and they delivered an AMC Pacer.
<br>
<br>But what bothers me far more than the buggy final product is the extent that they&apos;ve gone to try and cover it up. No early review copies (always a red-flag; movies that don&apos;t have review screenings are the same. It means they KNOW it&apos;s a stinker). And *FAKED* metacritic &quot;User&quot; reviews? That&apos;s too far.
<br>
<br>We expected a game that had some bugs. Let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s a movie license. Those are never quality goods, but can still be fun. That&apos;s fine. But instead of owning up to the shortcomings, they Streisand it all out of proportion. They =could= have just said &quot;Look, co-op doesn&apos;t work. Do you still want us to release it now, or keep working on it?&quot; Forewarned, and most people would probably be fine with it.
<br>
<br>But no. They lie. And cheat. They want to STEAL your hard-earned dollars and pretend everything is rosy. It is completely unacceptable!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3125583">Expand</a></span>

<br>Star Trek Video game devs are going out of their way to not answering any of the user questions and making their game APPEAR as if it&apos;s a great game.

<br>- Star Trek devs going to sites like Metacritic and giving their game a high score
<br>- Lying on Steam forums that the Co-op works just fine, in the midst of people raging that it doesn&apos;t.
<br>- Not releasing a reviewer copy of this game until after the game is released, obviously shows that the devs know their game is  and don&apos;t want anyone knowing that until they have already bought it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3125709">Expand</a></span>

Sure, the actual models are OK, specially Spock and Kirk that looks the business, but the textures, FX and animation are rubbish. With V-sync off, the game was running at over two hundred frames per second! This is not because the game is well optimised, it&apos;s because the graphics are so basic. Not only am I disappointed that they didn&apos;t use DX11 features for the PC version, but they didn&apos;t even take advantage of DX9. Doom 3 had flashier visuals than this!
<br>
<br>The game is also full of glitches like the ability to walk through people, buttons which  don&apos;t work but then they mysteriously do and the AI simply loses it half the time and starts going around in circles as if chasing its own tail. It&apos;s actually quite funny!
<br>
<br>The story is neither here or there but the execution can sometimes be jarring.  A good example of this (no spoilers) was when  the crew of a space station gets sucked into space, killing all of them, and none of the main characters seem to care or even notice. Instead, we are presented with a cut scene where we learn that Kirk would like to get into the hot Vulcan girl&apos;s pants. That&apos;s a way to deal with watching people die.
<br>
<br>The combat is cover based, so no surprises there. It is quite easy but then it gets to one of the first game bosses where it suddenly becomes far too difficult because of the cheap attacks. After that, it&apos;s back to laid back game play.
<br>
<br>As a conclusion, this is a bad, bad game. It doesn&apos;t help that it&apos;s a rushed port with all the console stuff still there. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3127129">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As a Star Trek fan, I give the game an 8. I can see it having a somewhat lower rating if you are new to the series or have no nostalgia for the universe.
<br>
<br>Pros: The voice acting is good, at least of the two main characters. The dynamic with Kirk, Spock, and Bones has some humourous moments. The textures are really good, with the Enterprise interior looking great. There is a nice range of weapons to choose from. Interesting tricorder scanning mode that adds a collectible element to the game. Many portions of missions offer a non-lethal option to try and fulfill, which can be challenging at times. Tie-in with the second movie.
<br>
<br>Cons: Weapon and tricorder upgrades could have been expanded, possibly with different upgrades depending on weapon type. Game could have been longer. The AI of the enemy is a little weak, at least when it comes to hiding and ambushing you (You can normally shoot an enemy trying to hide because his butt sticks out of the obstacle it is using to hide). The AI of your partner could have been better, but he does the job more or less.
<br>
<br>Honestly, I did not experience any of the bugs people have been talking about on here, nor did I care about Co-Op working. The game is decent to good, not garbage or crap like the vast majority of people here state. Granted, with the price tag, they could have fleshed out the game more, but hey, game so often get released incomplete or lacking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3178037">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The A.I is brain-dead. If you want to do something stealthy then don&apos;t count on it because your A.I will run in at full speed whether it is Spock or Kirk.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s glitchy! I&apos;ve had to restart levels because I&apos;ve ended up walking in space, bosses have died too soon and as a result interrupted a cut scene, the AI will just stop what they&apos;re doing sometimes and expect you to do the whole level on your own.
<br>
<br>The controls are just clunky. It&apos;s hard to jump from pillar to pillar, your partner will stand in front of a door and refuse to move, your character will sometimes refuse to move in the right direction... just bad. Why couldn&apos;t they fix this before release?
<br>
<br>Now don&apos;t get me wrong: this game has got some redeeming features.
<br>
<br>The characters may look ghostly but the environments are pretty damn awesome. They are beautiful on my PC and I have stopped moving to look around in awe.
<br>
<br>The voice actors are all here too which is a nice touch although the friendship between Spock and Kirk is a little... well it doesn&apos;t feel right. Would it have felt better if the characters were based off of original Kirk and Spock and voiced by Shatner and Nimoy? Some part of me wants to wish so but I know it wouldn&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>This game is disappointing and bad. As a life-long fan of Star Trek: TOS I can safely say I want Scotty to beam me up because this game was a waste of money.
<br>
<br>Ps.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve not tried Co-Op just yet so I do not think it would be fair to comment on that aspect of the game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3130086">Expand</a></span>

<br>rated low for no reason, except that it&apos;s a Star Trek game.
<br>The reviews around 6 and 7 are correct, no matter if you&apos;re a
<br>fan or not. My look at it will be like a copy from other gamers,
<br>but a score is a score. Review is for PC version.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>+Original voice actors: if you&apos;re doing a film tie-in, this is
<br>a big plus. Many games just use imitations, hoping on-one will
<br>notice, but we do. Two leads have the most work, but other
<br>crew is all there. If you&apos;ve seen the movie, you&apos;ll know it
<br>it&apos;s original when you hear Chekov...
<br>+Story: it&apos;s nothing ground-breaking, but the story is there,
<br>it moves you forward and it&apos;s not bad. If not for the tie-in, it
<br>would make a great pilot for TV series
<br>+Pacing: you mainly just shoot at enemies, but the game throws a
<br>few surprises, like Enterprise shooting on fleeing enemy, dodging sun
<br>eruptions (or something), dodging space debris...
<br>+Collectibles: They give a nice side-information about the objects
<br>and people in the game. You collect audio logs, information on enemies,
<br>guns, stuff on the planet you&apos;re on...
<br>
<br>MIDDLE POINT:
<br>/Shooting and cover: Shooting is done fairly good, you get
<br>few guns along the way. You can only carry two, phaser and
<br>rifle, but you can easily do anything with a phaser. The rifles
<br>look different but they all shoot the same neon lights.
<br>/Tricorder and XP: you use it to hack doors, turning on machines and locating
<br>collectibles, you can even see enemies through the walls. For this you get XP,
<br>which you can use to &apos;&apos;buy&apos;&apos; some improvements for your guns or
<br>tricorder (like more energy for guns, increased tricorder range, pointing
<br>on collectibles when you&apos;re in range...) But if you&apos;re a collector, you find yourself
<br>using it a bit too much; you walk in a room and scan, few steps forward and scan...
<br>Improvements are few and even fewer are usable, you have a set of 7 skills with
<br>3 improvements each, but you can only use one of those three, so that means
<br>7 at once.
<br>/Enemies: You shoot lizard aliens and occasionaly a robot. They&apos;re not any different from
<br>any other lizard aliens in other games. There are a few variants (brute, grunt, sniper...), but
<br>not a big challenge. They&apos;re funny, because they hide behind a crate and they have a head or
<br>a tail sticking out, because they&apos;re just too big.
<br>/Graphics: Star Trek world was never known for rich textures. Everything is polished and
<br>reflective. The characters and the spaceships are passable, enemies are not so detailed,
<br>and the planet levels are weak.
<br>/Bugs: I don&apos;t understand how some failed reviewers rate this game as broken
<br>or buggy. Sure, it has bugs but even &apos;&apos;better&apos;&apos; games have more bugs. To me it happened
<br>only twice, one AI-controled Spock got stuck in space and once i fell through the floor
<br>because I was jumping where I shouldn&apos;t. AI does a good job, there&apos;s one point where you
<br>transport yourself with a gun, and AI performs excellent on his own.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>-Secondary Objectives: They are in the lines: move through
one section without alerting enemies to your presence or
don&apos;t kill starfleet personel. You get a commendation for
doing them, but nothing else, no XP, no screenshots from the
movie set... Wasted potential.
-Few unfriendly checkpoints and weak guide: By unfriendly I mean saving
before a cutscene, because you can&apos;t skip them during the game. Skippable are
only at the start and at the end of the level. Guide is not of much use, because the
levels are fairly linear and it only shows you where to go, not how to get there.
There are a few point in the game where you have a chasm and you don&apos;t know
if you have to jump over it or is there a switch.
-Hacking: Too much of it. You must hack every important door
with a game where you match sound waves or where you must find
two matching sound waves. You can even hack enemy
turrets and mines with a snake like game where you guide a line to a goal
where you must not hit the wall.
-No CO/OP on one computer, at least I didn&apos;t find it.

Notable Mention: Humor, nice addition and unexpected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135464">Expand</a></span>

No huge Spock, no Spock running to the wall, no character hanging on invisible walls. And as I do not give a damn about MP and coop I do not care if it is working or not. Maybe I am lucky. Or maybe some players are unlucky. Who knows.
<br>Now to the game. It is exactly what I expected to be. An action game set in the restarted ST universe with characters voiceacted by film actors. Nothing more nothing less. It is accompanied by an interesting story and a decent graphics. I actually like the graphics. At least it has sharp textures and no low resolution ugly ones as ME3 does. And for me it even plays better than ME. Hell you can not even jump in ME, not to mention climb or swim. And your companions are there only as a cannonfodder. Here you can at least ask your teammate to do something. Oh and have I mentioned the space battle minigame? I have read many people who dislike it. I for one found it o.k. Especially the strategy mode, where you select enemy weakspots and then attack with all you have. Again, how many space battles have you seen in ME? Right, there are none.
<br>So all in all it is a decent game. It could be better, but it could be worse, but I am having fun and that is what matters, The only problem I have is the price. It is simply too overpriced. Wait till the price drops to half or when the game is in a Steam sale for even lower price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135421">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A bad game, is not a rare coinsurance. They are pretty easy to spot. It&apos;s been widely accepted, Star Trek The Video game is not only buggy, antiquated, and in some regards, non-functional but it&apos;s an obvious attempt to capitalize on the IP&apos;s popularity among long time fans of the series.
<br>
<br>I do not own the game. If you&apos;re reading this; you don&apos;t need me to tell you, that this game is not worth your money. You should already know by now.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m writing this because of the un-ethical practices by the developers to influence the consumer base with fake reviews. Because of lead developers (Kenneth) arguing on Steam, posing as a normal guy, who loves the game. Because of refusing to provide pre-release review copies and yet, still insisting on charging full price for the release.
<br>
<br>These are the kind of business practices that the gaming community, on a whole, are trying to document.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s up to the gamer, to punish these kinds of developers and publishers of poorly made games, by voting with your collective wallets.
<br>
<br>But this is not a matter of Star Trek simply being a bad game.
<br>
<br>A bad game is bad enough; but when a company goes beyond marketing, and attempts to run a deliberate campaign to deceive the ill-informed consumer, we must hold them accountable by getting online documenting why we&apos;re upset, and contacting those at fault; in addition to not paying for something that is merely a scheme to get your money...
<br>
<br>The gaming community is smarter than these people take us for.
<br>
<br>Do not let yourself be comfortable with these kinds of practices. It is our responsibility to enforce a standard; please, for your fellow gamers, do not buy this game you are condoning the worst of the gaming industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3131913">Expand</a></span>

Normally these type of tie-ins are poor attempts to make money off the back of the new film but it is not the case here! I must say, the new Star Trek film looks great and I can&apos;t wait to see it.
<br>
<br>The game doesn&apos;t do anything out of the ordinary, this is a simple 3rd person linear action/adventure game. This is no Mass Effect, there are no choices and everything is pre-destined. But that only makes it a shallow game, not a rubbish game. It is an enjoyable romp with quality voice acting and a great opening sequence. The enterprise looks great and so do the player models, however, graphics are not quite up to scratch. Graphically, this has console port written all over it so don&apos;t be expecting anything mind blowing. Controls are okay, I am using a mouse and keyboard and I have to say they have ported it very well. Although, it is a lot easier playing with a Xbox controller.
<br>
<br>All in all the game is coop orientated but I have played half the game on my own and the A.I controlled Kirk was fine and showed great awareness during coop parts. I have completed the game with a coop friend and we ran into no trouble at all. We are not Star Trek fans by any stretch on the imagination but we have both agreed that this is a enjoyable game but not worth full price admission. At say... &#xA3;15  &#xA3;20, I&apos;d probably say buy it, but priced at &#xA3;30, it&apos;s just to hard to recommend when there are better games on the market that include a competitive multiplayer to sweeten the deal.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s worth a play through and I am sure Star Trek fans will love it. It is not difficult unless you are playing on the hard difficulty but this is due to clumsy shooting mechanics more than anything. However, it is nice to have a console port that has been optimised to a good quality (unlike 007 Legends and Assassin Creed 3) for PC and the added coop option is great if you have close friends that enjoy some casual coop gaming.

Star Trek is an above-average licensed game with solid, albeit uninspired gameplay. Once the AI pathfinding and miscellaneous glitches are fixed, it&apos;s well worth looking into.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>+The cast of the movie reprises their roles. While some of the delivery from the minor characters is underwhelming, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto gave very good performances as Kirk and Spock.
<br>+Decent writing. The plot was no more ridiculous than Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman&apos;s plot for the original J.J. Abrams movie.
<br>+The soundtrack and theatrical presentation helps the game nail the feeling of playing a movie.
<br>+The tricorder scan system and research library feels reminiscent of Metroid Prime&apos;s scan visor mechanic. It certainly adds replay value.
<br>+Solid execution of shooter mechanics.
<br>+Cooperative play, when it works, is excellent.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>-No splitscreen cooperative play.
<br>-Underwhelming graphics options. Might be adjustable via a configuration file, but I have yet to go digging for it.
<br>-Default controls take some getting used to.
<br>-Dated animations and somewhat lackluster texture work occasionally undercut the dramatic tension.
<br>-Does nothing to innovate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3126553">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>.i being a massive trekker since i was 10 im 30 now i gotta say i really do not like this new reboot it is so not in the spirit of star trek this new star trek is just a action heavy, highly stylized version really in name only the game really doesnt feel like iam playing star trek and that really dissapoints me i literally gotta keep telling myself &#x201C;hey this is a star trek game its what u always wanted,&#x201D;cuz other than the name of the characters it really doesnt feel like star trek, and the  gorn in this game who are the main enemy they are soo godamn stupid its maddening they are literally DINOSAURS!!! no joke they are like really like thick velicoraptors i hate them how would these aliens even build ships and weapons and  when they walk on fours sometimes or dont even seem to have culture or anything resembling a alien race in the star trek universe.
<br>
<br>but than i just remind myself &#x201C;this is the new cool updated star trek and its in a alternate time line/dimension so basically they can do anything they want in terms of alien looks and behavior and explain it away by saying that&#x201D;.and even so they dont even seem in the spirit of star trek like in the movie what the  was the deal with the romulans i mean cmon huge face tats GOD!
<br>
<br>So it seems too me that this new trek really isnt for us old star trek veterans who seen all the shows and movies and know all about the star trek universe this reboot as much as all of us probably want more and new star trek this  is for newbies and people who know hardly nothing bout star trek cuz this new  is just a action movie with star trek characters its all flash and no soul.
<br>
<br>So the game for me was kinda boring and i always had this feeling like i wanted more from it i wish it was more open ended with more exploration.and the game seems too be really easy in terms of everything is mostly Press &#x201C;this&#x201D; button to &#x201C;open door &#x201C;to &#x201C;hack a door&#x201D; to heal to help ur teammate just felt like it was really dumb down if this wasnt star trek and it was just some generic game it would be horrible and boring cuz theres nothing special the story is good if u like this version of star trek so if u do than you will love the story if u dont the it will just be boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123560">Expand</a></span>

There was plenty of action, a typical Star Trek plot, and a good choice of weapons--although they were weak ones.  It is one of the few $50 games I have played this year that I feel is worth the price.</span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve found it difficult to put down and played a few hours. On my Asus Vulcan headphones with a top end pc and video card this game is no different in quality to Bioshock Infinite, Far Cry 3 or Tombraider all which I have played for days. It&apos;s Star Trek. I love Star Trek so I love this game more but because they&apos;ve done a lot of things RIGHT!!  I&apos;m playing on Windows 8 no problems or bugs.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere and story are great. I&apos;m really enjoying it and I can&apos;t play more because its 2 am now and I have to sleep. That&apos;s how good it is. This is NOT and never will be Call of Duty or Far Cry as it is based on an entirely different theme.
<br>
<br>I laugh when I see zeros. My guess is that those who are writing these negative reviews are a tiny percentage who had problems with co-op which I never had. I bet a large number of players, the majority are playing and love this but just never write reviews. I&apos;m one of them and I love this game and I love quality games and wouldn&apos;t go near this if it wasn&apos;t quality. My favourite game is the new Tomb Raider followed by Far Cry 3 so I&apos;m  not stupid. I know a good quality game because I play them all the time and this is a great game. Assassins Creed 3 another great game.  Skyrim  another great game. I know my games and this is a very good game NOT the rubbish people are trying to portray it as. I&apos;m an avid gamer and I&apos;m really enjoying this. Reminds me of one of my favourited Mass Effect 3.
<br>
<br>And I bet there are many, many more people that never come here that love this and would give it a 9 or 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128093">Expand</a></span>

I can understand why a lot of people are angry with co-op not working in a co-op game. I don&apos;t normally play co-op games, and the single player so far is pretty good.</span>

It captures the feel of the source material really well. Voice work is well-done. Graphics are okay to good. Combat mechanics are pretty average. All-in-all, not a bad game at all. An easy recommendation from me for anyone that likes Star Trek.</span>

<br>
<br>The game can devolve into a cluster**** when you&apos;re in combat shooting and being shot at (while wrestling with the controls), trying to listen to someone give you critical information while everything is exploding, and there are prompts telling you new interactions all at the same time. Often times, one of those things will be missed and you&apos;ll die. One time it got to the point where the best way to advance was to just run head first into danger and get to the other side before I died instead of listening to the hints/prompts.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is good at times, but not often enough. It goes from slightly fun to immensely frustrating like a never-ending rollercoaster. Absolutely not worth full retail price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3134361">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So many poor reviews, so many band-wagon uninformed.  The game is certainly not as bad as people seem to want to portray it.  The biggest issues are the rather minor, sometimes annoying gameplay problems, and the AI is certainly not very smart; but, there are many games that fail in that department.  It would seem that this game was needlessly targeted by those who do not know, understand, or care about the heritage of Trek gaming.
<br>
<br>The game is far from &quot;bad&quot; and is entertaining at the very least.  While it is certainly not worth the release sticker price, it is not bargain-bin material either.  The graphics are okay, they can hold hold their own, but are nothing to write home about.  The sets looks nice, and the texturing is good, but the effects (explosions and such) are sub-par.  The biggest graphical issue I noticed was the animations,  They look rather lackluster and awkward at times and the mouth movement on the voiced sequences are not very convincing.  Other than the above the graphics are not too shabby, just don&apos;t expect Tomb Raider or Crysis III quality.
<br>
<br>As far as gameplay, the combat feels good, so long as it is at a distance.  When enemies get close aiming can be a chore (or impossible) to hit them and melee is not good at all.  Movement (running, jumping, and maneuvering) feels normal for a 3rd person shooter (Other than the awkward animations).  The cover mechanism that some complained about is not as bad as they would have you believe; for me, it works fine.  The overall combat is not far off from Mass Effect, it just lacks the polish.  Puzzle-solving scenarios are included, though they are rarely difficult and take a back seat to the action in comparison to ST titles such as 25th anniversary.
<br>
<br>The story is actually pretty good, better than the hot-mess disaster known as &quot;Into Darkness&quot;.  Without major spoilers, It has you facing the Gorn in an attempt to thwart them from using a powerful Vulcan device.  Along the way it throws you through some rather nicely done environments (again mild on the spoilers) such as the halls of the Enterprise, a space station and even New Vulcan. Though a few would disagree, I think the level design is fairly well thought out.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is nice, especially from Pine and Quinto.  The rest of the crew are convincing, but not quite at the same level.  The score is moody and works throughout the game, with familiar melodies from the movies (2009 and Into Darkness).
<br>
<br>Oh well, people can make of it as they please, but here is my breakdown.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 7
<br>Gameplay: 6
<br>Design: 7
<br>Sound: 8
<br>Overall: 7
<br>
<br>Bottom-line:  Is it the best game around? No.  It is the worst thing to to hit the gaming world year to date? also, no.  If you are a younger Trekkie, you will enjoy it.  If you are in the older age range, it may not offer the mental challenge you would like.  The game is far from broken, or unplayable, however could it be better? Yes, but hey, what game out there could not use improvement in some aspect or another.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3297149">Expand</a></span>

I have played the full game, in coop (so no dumb IA involved) and I can say this: It&apos;s a very nice game, nice graphics (on the PC), no bugs (I have encountered none in my full playthrough) and fun experience. The production value is rather high (sountrack from the movie, good graphics and effects, good models, overall good textures, dubbing from the original actors, nice story and great dialogs) and the game itself is fun to play and even more if you like the source material (J.J. Abrams&apos; Star Trek). The reviews are unfair. The correct score, in my opinion, is a 7 or 7.5 for a non fan and 8 or 8.5 for a fan.

It gives you the sense of actually being in a tie-in movie, and sports the banter of the original series characters. The gameplay is fun and very similar to how it plays out in the 2009 movie, and the whole game is executed in the same way. For those looking for a more &quot;Original Trek&quot; feeling, you can try to take on the Commendation objectives, which are more challenging and rewarding, and require you to take care of objectives more diplomatically. The graphics hold up even under close scrutiny and fast paced action, though require a stronger system than average. They may not be groundbreaking, but they are definitely up to date and good looking. The multi player adds a layer of fun as well, and promotes a lot of teamwork.
<br>The majority of complaints about the game happen to be centered on the fact that AS SOON as the game came out, there was a Steam server problem. The error was corrected within three days, but that didn&apos;t stop anyone from coming here to write awful reviews, in an attempt to make the developers fix it faster (even though it wasn&apos;t completely the developers fault). The outrageous reviews have given it a bad name, when it is a thoroughly enjoyable game. I was part of a forum where I saw the members decide to make several accounts here, just to talk bad about the game, in their attempts to get the developers to fix the multi player servers faster. It has forever stained the review score here and was unnecessary. In the end the multi player was quickly fixed and the game is great. Star Trek fan? Buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3150079">Expand</a></span>

<br>Negative: There are a lot and i mean a lot of bugs! Cover mechanics are dissapointing. I&apos;m pressing buttons like stupid on time looking like a real retard when controls don&apos;t work. The teammate is so retarded that i wanna kill him a way befoure a mission starts. AI is horrible, staying in one place like stupid or it&apos;s killing you every time he wants so you must repeat  like 10 times. AI and teammate mood depend on the weather or maybe on what time it is. Coop problems,...
<br>
<br>My score: keep away from this game. If you are a Star Trek fan you will be heartbroken! Rather go see this sequel of Startrek named Into Darkness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-trek-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3156899">Expand</a></span>

Controls are a bit clunky, your partner sometimes gets stuck during co-op moves (forces restart from last checkpoint), and not a large variety of weapons to use or skills to upgrade. But good enough for a $5 buy. Long enough campaign and decent storyline too.</span>

The Co-op is really fun (not much co-op games are enjoyable as this one) and the voice acting is superb. The graphics are good and the game does not suffer of extreme bugs, apart for some sporadic A.I. problems (enemies).
