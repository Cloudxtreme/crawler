The art of the game has a wonderful story book charm to it and goes quite well with the writing which can be many things, from witty, quirky, light and happy to dark and depressing. The music fits amazingly to set the mood of the game. Droning, foreboding tones that give the impression of something horrible about to happen or could happen before the end. The ending/credits song fits so well with the game that it works with any ending you get, good, middle of the road, or bad.
<br>
<br>The Yawhg is basically a random story based fantasy RPG of pure choice, with the outcome of most of your choices being based on the stats of your characters, with the stats playing a large roll in what happens in the end. There are four unique (in look) characters to chose from, two men and two women. The choice of character just gives a different look at certain scenes, with each character showing different appearance from one another in each situation possible in the game. You must choose at least two characters to play as, even if you are playing alone. The game is better with friends, as you experience their reactions depending on how you or they effect the game for everybody playing, because one bad move could get a bad ending for everybody. The game is still extremely entertaining alone, finding out different story branches and outcomes.
<br>
<br>The main goal of the game is to guide the characters in their lives and build their attributes so that they can do well with helping out with the final part of the game. While the game is short, 10 to 15 minutes depending on how quickly you make your decisions and read through the choices and story points, it has phenomenal playability. Each place a character visits each day in the game has two things that can be done that day, like helping patients at the Hospital or cleaning it, or working at the town bar or drinking/partying. Each of these choices have random story bits that occur, and depending on your stats, the bit you encounter could end up differently if you encounter it more than once.
<br>
<br>With all the places one can visit and interact with, there are many story threads that can occur in each place. The places you got and interact with have an effect on the ending story of your character. There are 8 places around town that your character can go to, so right their is 8 possible story endings if you just focus on only going to one of those places for the entirety of the game, but that branches out since you have a choice of two things to do at each location, so the stories endings can branch even more. If you got to more than just one place, you can get a ending that is mix with a couple or more of the things you did.
<br>I&apos;ve played the game eight times so far and I&apos;ve encountered several new things on each playthrough. I recommend basing your decision of getting this game on the user reviews, not the &quot;professional&quot; ones. Looking those reviews over, I can tell that they didn&apos;t spend enough time with the game. Ten dollars is perfectly acceptable for this title because of it&apos;s depth within the short playtime, and it&apos;s artistic quality.
<br>
<br>In many respects, I do consider games an art-form. The Yawhg is definitely a work of art along with being a thoroughly entertaining game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-yawhg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4098503">Expand</a></span>

<br>Seems like there are countless endings, although it is short, can be played in 10 minutes, it is replayable, and it is advised to replay it many more times.</span>

<br>However the endings that are there and the build up to them is brilliant. We had a huge amount of fun trying to rebuild after the Yawhg had been to destroy the town. The music is also extremely fitting and added hugely to the atmosphere.
<br>The only huge gripe I have to make is that there is no way to change the resolution as of yet and the game was unplayable on the first monitor we tried as the stats of player one were covered by the top of the screen making the game not unplayable but reduces the enjoyment dramatically, and would avoid until a fix has been found.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-yawhg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4176732">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a tough one, because the amount of love and hard work that&apos;s gone into this game is enormous. It would be ridiculous to ask for more possibilities in the game, since every new branch of story requires so much input from the authors. In theory, they easily earn your &#xA3;7 with the effort they&apos;ve put in, but in practice you&apos;re going to see situations repeating themselves quite a lot within three plays.
