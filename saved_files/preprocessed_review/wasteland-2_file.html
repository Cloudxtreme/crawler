<br>
<br>The game is overall quite fun, it&apos;s a nice nostalgic trip back to the days of the Fallouts that were Fallouts and not Oblivion with Guns and Mutants, so if you liked those older games - you&apos;ll enjoy this one.
<br>
<br>However there are many issues; not simply bugs but design decisions and lack of polish, which scar the playability of the game.
<br>The issues range from combat situations where range is seriously limited on weapons and the enemy can run as far as you can shoot in one turn and hit you on the head with his club, to other combat issues such as how the NPCs seemingly don&apos;t run out of ammo yet you loot no ammo from them.
<br>Other issues are with how skills are used. Instead of simply using the highest skilled PC automatically - you&apos;ll have to select him, select the skill, select the object. Might not be an issue the first hundred times, but it gets bore-some as you have to drudge through ever container you can find to stock up and that means using perception, trap/alarm disarm, lock pick/electronic/safe crack and that&apos;s likely spread out over multiple characters. Something that was fine in the 90s and 00s, but even though it&apos;s an &quot;old school RPG&quot; we do not need all &quot;old school mechanics&quot;. Polish and quality of life features came into existence for a reason.
<br>The dialogue, and levelling up system is also a bit annoying and again - it gets tiresome because you have to do it over and over and over.
<br>
<br>Character creation is what creation is, but the models used aren&apos;t that &quot;pretty&quot;, so if that&apos;s your thing - then it&apos;ll cost on the score. It&apos;s not for me, so I&apos;m fine with it - but again, I can&apos;t help but think that it&apos;s 2014 and not 1994. Even if it is a kickstarter game.
<br>
<br>But the game does have that nice &quot;wasteland&quot; feeling, combat and questing is otherwise acceptable, and even though bugs exists - I&apos;ve not found any to be gamebreaking (yet).
<br>So as mentioned - if the likes of Fallout 1, 2 and/or Tactics grapped you back then - you&apos;re likely to enjoy this game, but a masterpiece of score 10 it is not.
<br>
<br>7 to 8 because is feels and plays as a solid game. I&apos;m properly leaning a bit more towards 7 than 8 now after having played some more hours because the lack of polish is a grinding factor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521554">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve really tried to enjoy this game(turn-based RPG is very rare bird) but I&apos;ve continuously felt that something was wrong. So cons:
<br>
<br>- Game focuses too much on opening chests mechanics. You have lots of skills just to open chests. And you&apos;re finding plenty of chests. With addition of few points-of-view this makes the game a Chest-Finding-and-Opening-Simulator-2014.
<br>- Character creator. Its just feels so wrong to see 1990s graphics in a character creation. Literally it&apos;s 90s.
<br>- You can&apos;t view your armour in the game since your clothes is how you look like. I&apos;m OK with that but give us a diversity! After playing for 20hr I&apos;ve found few clothing items most of them looks completely the same(brown-black-gray)
<br>- Fighting mechanics is VERY basic. You can&apos;t even lay down and it&apos;s not exactly a cover-based game(in many fights you&apos;ll have covers just for 2 members). So other members just crouching. That feels very wrong but that comes from another bad game design decision(see next).
<br>- You can fire 2 bullets or cover big distance running. So I imagine it&apos;s easier to pull a trigger 2 times than run 25 meters? Nope. Both take the same AP amount. So enemy melee will be right before you nose in 1 turn. No point of laying down.
<br>- One enemy without visible armour can eat a LOT of bullets. And that guy doesn&apos;t even have a t-shirt.
<br>- Dialogs for different NPCs under the same quest line are pretty much the same. &quot;Who is Sergeant Dickson?&quot;, &quot;How do you feel about Sergeant Dickson?&quot; - prepare to ask such questions a lot.
<br>
<br>And there&apos;s many more unpolished things.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Lots of skills and most of them are used frequently.
<br>+ Big maps
<br>+ Attempt to &quot;make it right&quot;
<br>+ Lots of words in dialogs(for those who like reading)
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>Unpolished and with horrible 3d(I would much prefer pretty 2D). Why couldn&apos;t developer play some classics like Jagged Alliance 2 before making such horrible fighting system?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4523368">Expand</a></span>

<br>Underground locations are quite confusing, piled up with stuff and you can&apos;t really understand what&apos;s happening down there: the AG center is such a mess you&apos;ll have a hard time looking for your own party members amidst all that junk.
<br>
<br>Mobs drop random stuff without logic: a guy shots you with a grenade launcher, you kill him and... you find a shotgun on him.
<br>
<br>Graphics are good for a low budget game, but then you&apos;ll find that such graphics are not optimized: sometimes I play with a gaming laptop that runs Assassin&apos;s Creed IV at the highest details at a solid 60fps, but I have to play Wasteland 2 with low details.

<br>
<br>I played the early access and was expecting the final game is better, but its not. I am very, deeply disappointed.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the post-apocalypse settings of the game, it has some smart writings.
<br>
<br>However, the graphic is really meh, even for Unity, they are not using it to its full potential I guess. Characters models really hurt my eyes. And it doesnt even change according to the armor you wear.
<br>
<br>Combat is boring and simplified, it just doesnt give you the satisfaction of fallout. Most cases that you are forced to use melee in order to save ammo instead of letting you play the way you want.
<br>
<br>main story is short and often lack of orientation, I really got lost in the railroad nomad camp. Some of the dialog are just too long and does not give you a better insight.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise the player perks are redundant such as smart ass, kiss ass and hard ass. Also you need 3 &quot;lock picking&quot; skills to open different boxes is just BS why make a differentiation for Toaster, Safe and locked boxes??
<br>And I really dont get the part where you can type keywords in a conversation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4524813">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game also seems obsessed with wasting the player&apos;s time. Skills that you click take a long time to complete, for no gameplay reason but to annoy.

<br>
<br>The good: post apocalyptic setting in the southwest US, similar to Fallouts. A group based game, decent story, initially some gameplay choices (which town to save), some hidden caches and encounters on the map.
<br>
<br>The bad: Initially the bad things arent very obvious, but they start to grind at you and after several hours of play they become really apparent.
<br>
<br>RPG system is a joke. Most of the &quot;Attributes&quot; are dump stats, and every single ranger should have 10 int, because it controls skill points per level AND action points, the rest in 4 strength and whatever else in other stat that controls AP. There are no stat checks in dialogues or skill uses. A charisma 1 character with 6 in dialogue skills would pass most dialogue checks. A strength 1 character with 6 brute force will break all fences. The difference between weapon skill of 5 and weapon skill of 6 is about 6%chance to hit and 4% crit chance, which is far more than any other stat will give you.
<br>
<br>Random encounters - horrendous copy/paste. You will be fighting the SAME group of 3 bandits x11hp each, then 3 bandits at 80-125hp each, then 3 bandits and a dog for a very long time. Random encounters like &quot;Dangerous raiders&quot; pop up every 30 sec on the map, and without having outdoorsman to avoid them, it would be a very frustrating gameplay experience to load them all.
<br>
<br>Each random encounter drops 100% identical loot - no joke, first 38mm semiautomatic, then M4. To add an instult to an injury, each random encounter map is a variation of a &quot;corridor with a single cover object in the middle&quot;- typically one car on a highway, and you are lucky if you can run up to it.
<br>
<br>Enemies do not have levels, they are copy/paste versions of each other, just with different hp - starts at 11-15-20, then rapidly jumps to 80, 125 and 150
<br>
<br>Enemy AI - the worst I&apos;ve yet to see in a &quot;Tactical RPG&quot; game. There are some nice &quot;tactical&quot; environments in game, but they go to waste because enemies spot you at 25 meters away and instantly aggro everyone within 60 meters or so. The very first turn every single enemy runs point blank to your characters, covering the same 25-30 meters.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s ridiculous to see a &quot;Heavy Gunner&quot; slowly stroll across the screen and end up standing 3meters from your sniper. Dreadfulness of AI does not stop there - like in other Unity games, it fails to focus fire a single character, instead a melee monster would run up, bite one character, move, bite another, move, bite another.
<br>
<br>The game does have random Radio banter, but it dies out after 45 min of travelling the map or so, and you are walking over a dead silent map, clicking &quot;Run&quot; to the same random encounters (or farming them for the same items over and over again).
<br>
<br>There are vast jumps in power levels between weapons that use the same ammo. So much in fact, that at any given time your choices of weapons is absolutely certain - you will not be using a 6-10 damage M4 when 14-25 or so Famas becomes available. You will not be using Famas when 30-45 M16 becomes available.

<br>Do you like Critical Hit mechanics? I do, but on top of critical hits, Wasteland has &quot;Jamming&quot; chance, which ranges between 9%-3% for most guns, so between 5-6 characters, shooting twice a round, it is very likely that at least one of your shooters will have a gun jammed each round, which is ridiculously frustrating after it happens again and again and again and again, ad nauseum.
<br>
<br>Overall the game has potential, but needs another 6 months to be polished.
<br>
<br>PS. It&apos;s ridiculous to see a 50$ DLC on day one. I&apos;ve NEVER seen a 50$ DLC in any game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4524950">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, I was severely disappointed by the game itself. It certainly has some appealing things, but most of the time it&apos;s just boring, slow fights again and again and poor level design. You always have to go back numerous times, picking this and that, hacking, breaking and so on. First couple of hidden chest locations were fun to memorise, but it became really tedious after the count reached 10.
<br>
<br>Now this one is up to personal taste, but I really think that RNG system in hacking/picking locks/disarming alarms/etc. is bad for any gamer who&apos;s obsessed with exploration and collecting things. I instantly started abusing quicksave-quickload if I didn&apos;t lockpick something successfully. Would be much better if there just was a skill threshold, in my opinion. As soon as your skill was above it, you could lockpick chests of lower level and so on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4525671">Expand</a></span>

The fights feel ALWAYS the same. It does not matter whether you are level 1 or level 20 there is no change.On top, there are just to many of them for no reason but prolong the play time. I am completely disappointed by the combat system and the leveldesign. More content on each map or less maps with the combined content of several maps and a combat system alike to Jagged Alliance 2 or even X-COM would have increased the user experience dramatically. However, some gamereview state that Wasteland 2 is first a RPG and only second a turned  based strategy game. Yet, the rpg part cannot convince me either. Skill increase means that your chances increase for lockpicking, hitting, hacking etc. but the gameplay does not change, with exception to dialog based skills. While new weapons do increase the damage output, other loot like new armor (that has an some use other than new looks) does not really exist, similar to Mass Effect 2.
<br>True, the dialogs are great, the choices have severe impacts which is always nice for multiple playthroughs. But the tedious level design and the unnecessary often and boring fights interrupt the otherwise interesting  story or sidequests, which already make my first run unenjoyable.
<br>
<br>I can only recommend this game to fans or people who like mindless grinding and backtracking for about 3/4 of the game just to see some hours of real RPG gameplay. Instead of creating a 50+ game, which game mechanism just don&apos;t fit the developers should have focused on a more dense, more capturing world by improving the combat system and reducing the size of the maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4518369">Expand</a></span>

If that bothers you, or if you must have cutting edge graphics you are better off skipping this tile.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a deep, engaging and huge RPG to sink your time into (and it will take a lot of your time) your wait is over.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s dark, challenging, frustrating at times and completely enjoyable but it&apos;s not for everyone.  The graphics and sound are passable and the mechanics are antiquated but this game is laser focused on a certain demographic.  I feel that this demographic is gamers that are well over 30 and have the time to invest in something like Wasteland 2 - probably why this was only possible through a Kick-starter campaign.  I fit this demographic and am having a blast with it.  If you fit it as well, you&apos;ll be well served by dropping 40 bucks on Steam for this one.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d go as far as 9/10 if the graphic engine was akin to Divinity : Original Sin but I take a point because as good as this game is so far (I have NOT completed it yet, obviously)  the graphics leave a bit to be desired.
<br>
<br>I think a lot of reviewers will make mention of Divinity : Original Sin in their review of Wasteland 2 - it just makes sense to compare the two.  If you could only play one of the two, as much as it pains me to say it, I would recommend Divinity.  It pains me because I adore everything Brian Fargo has done and Wasteland 2 is terrific, but it does suffer a bit in the graphic department.  Divinity : Original Sin 9/10  Wasteland 2 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4514234">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are 10 years old (I&apos;m being generous). The character models are ugly as sin and appearance options really are not noticeable while on the map. Open the character screen you&apos;ll be greeted by your guy, with forearms that are a foot too long, legs that don&apos;t match torso scaling, and head models that remind you that inbreeding is still a thing.
<br>
<br>The basic mechanics are okay. The game is very hipster~ish, in that it wants to be complicated just for the sake of being complicated. Hardcore fans will like it. Kickstarters will either madly love or burn with loathing. The Average Joe?

<br>-Combat system is a complete disaster. Enemy can run up close to a sniper which have started the fight from the maximum 30-40 meters. Sniper can get a dynamite thrown at him in a same 1st turn of the battle.
<br>No ways to spend more AP for better aid like (Jagged Alliance), no ways to aim to specific parts.
<br>Yes they&apos;ve added a head shot feature which turned out completely useless.
<br>
<br>P.S. the most pity fact of all this situation that developers will continue to cry that it is impossible to develop such games due to the lack of support and interest from gamers.
<br>While other non casual indies with Prison Architect and Minecraft make millions $.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4544565">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So where do I start first of all, I think whomever designed this game needs to sit down in front of Jagged Alliance (1 or 2), or many of the other GOOD turn based strategy combat games for a solid week or 2. It is appallingly apparent they did not. Mistake that were made 20 years ago, are coming back to haunt this genre once again and it is infuriating.
<br>
<br>Destructible cover, in a cover based game, CHECK
<br>Unable to aim at the destructible cover, UNCHECK, and cancelled the previous thing they did good
<br>Cover mechanics, as like they went into a grade school and got the kids there to help them design it, simplistic and as a result terrible, no bonuses for stand near cover or inbetween cover, only if you are actively ducking behind the cover, no 25% for partial, and as far as I could tell no better than 50%, or worse than 50%. As mentioned before I had a piece of cover get shot and destroyed (a wood box), and that was neat but unable to actually aim at the box (with a 70% chance to hit, and instead forced to aim at a 20% behind the box is insulting).
<br>No lying down, to shoot/aim/cover, especially say what you might want to do from a rooftop.
<br>
<br>Loading ammo in my secondary weapon?! Who would want to do that that&apos;s dangerous just leaving weapons loaded!! Seriously, this belongs in a beta bug category, weapons in primary slot are auto loaded (so they thought of it), weapons equipped secondary aren&apos;t loaded. How was this not spotted and fixed the first day of the Alpha?!?
<br>
<br>They make other spotted design choices that although I don&apos;t agree with 100% myself I won&apos;t fault them for, healing while time passes moving overland, or the ability to camp and heal some, was removed/never put in. Ok fine, only way to heal is to buy all the shops in the game out of healing equipment, guess it forces you to spend all your hard earned money.
<br>
<br>The apparent lack of if one of your main 4 dies, to go back and recruit a new main character, play the rest of the game with more NPC&apos;s I suppose, or just quicksave more often.. (sigh). No-one find a game fun that you have to quicksave before every combat, because then you don&apos;t live with bad luck or bad choices, because once your forced to reload once, then you start to use it twice and 3 times, and next thing you know it&apos;s a crutch/habit you&apos;re using all the time and it makes the game boring and silly.
<br>
<br>Overall the game appears to have some story in it, and what not that is enjoyable, the meat and potatoes of the game the turn based fighting however, just devolves into a quicksaved slugfest where you don&apos;t give a **** because if someone dies, you reload and get luckier next time.
<br>
<br>Overall score 5/5, maybe worth getting on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521436">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But people, please, PLEASE stop comparing this game to Fallout 1 &amp; 2. Please stop saying things like it&apos;s &quot;the true Fallout 3.&quot;
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not. It&apos;s not even close. It lacks any and all of Fallout&apos;s whimsical charm, it forces you to create a squad at the beginning instead of striking out on a lonely, eerie struggle.
<br>
<br>Moreover, the game feels like it&apos;s high on its own supply. Overhyped, oversold, generally just not ideal for someone who wants an original Fallout experience. There&apos;s a big difference between this super serious, staid setting and the wacky retro-future of Fallout.
<br>
<br>Honestly, this is like a better verison of Fallout: Tactics at the end of the day. I&apos;m not saying this is a bad game, it&apos;s just extremely misleading to compare it to the original Fallout titles. It is NOT like them. No traits, no perks, no color or humor. Not enough attribute and skill points at the beginning for an individual character, since you&apos;re supposed to make four. There&apos;s no room for character development or finding your own identity. The very first conversation, I&apos;m pushed into saying &quot;sir&quot; constantly and being a military recruit. Maybe I don&apos;t WANT to join the rangers.
<br>
<br>Maybe I want to just run out into the wilderness or find a city hub and just make my own path - like I did in Fallout.
<br>
<br>I realize everyone is different. But part of the reason I loved Fallout was that my companions had their own minds and I didn&apos;t have to micromanage them constantly. It ended up creating hilarious (and sometimes awful) situations in which my companions surprised me in combat. Overall, it was more immersive (to me) because I was focused entirely on my own character, instead of mysteriously mind-controlling a group.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s hard to say whether or not I recommend the game. I know some people will love it. But I can&apos;t get over the vast disappointment after I was lead to believe, from literally everyone, that this is like Fallout. It&apos;s not. Fallout, in my opinion, is way more fun. Mechanically, aesthetically, and otherwise.
<br>
<br>Just one woman&apos;s point of view. Take it or leave it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4532483">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s like Fallout 1 and XCOM got married and had a baby. Some people will probably hear that and expect the baby of Fallout 3 and Mass Effect. They will be sorely disappointed. But that is fine. It&apos;s an old-school type CRPG. The genre isn&apos;t for everyone. It doesn&apos;t hold hands or kiss away boo-boos. It&apos;s hard. It punishes your mistakes. It forces you to read a lot, and to think even more. It&apos;s an acquired taste, but one worth acquiring.

<br>So far, I&apos;ve described any old-school CRPG What sets Wasteland 2 apart--and you won&apos;t notice it until you either replay the game or reload an older save game--this game diverges A LOT. You&apos;re not stuck on a railroad where at best you get to occasionally select between the GoodGuy&#x2122; and EvilDoer&#x2122; dialogue option but none of that matters because you end up doing roughly the same thing none the less. Instead, your actions (or lack thereof) have very real consequences, leading to very different experiences of the game.
<br>
<br>The graphics, UI and sound effects can occasionally be a bit rough around the edges, but it doesn&apos;t honestly detract too much from the game. Also worth noting is the quality of the ambient music/sounds, greatly adds to the atmosphere of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4515680">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1. Attribute system is a joke. Take for example charisma, there is no difference from a charisma 1 player to a charisma 10 player (this does not affect dialogue options or anything else you would expect). All it does is change the radius of your &quot;leadership&quot; skill (which you need to spec into) and how much XP you gain. Other attributes are plagued with the same problem. They are &quot;dump&quot; stats, the only one you need to focus on is intelligence as it affects your Action Points and Skill Points, and then coordination if you want to use guns or strength if you want to melee, everything else can be set at 1, because they don&apos;t actually do anything substantial (unlike fallout)
<br>
<br>2. Mechanics are broken, things like &quot;initiative&quot; don&apos;t actually do anything.
<br>
<br>3. Combat is broken, the enemies are programmed to rush your characters. When one is alerted, everyone near him will then run all the way across the map and stand next to you to attack (every single time and on their first turn, it&apos;s how they were coded)
<br>
<br>4. Random events are broken. You will get attacked when wondering the map, except it is always the same fight !! you will be fighting the same 3 enemies on the same map in each random event. At higher levels, you will get a &quot;feral dog&quot; added to the fight. They will have the same items on them which only changes with your level.
<br>
<br>5. Skill system is horrendous. You are juggling back and forth between characters for simple progression. The perception skill for example is not passive (or tied with an attribute), you need to spec into it as a skill. Then you need to activate that skill on a character and use them to search an area, that&apos;s when you change over to someone who can disarm traps and then unlock gates or safe crack etc. You are doing this all the time, especially if you didnt max intelligence as you just wont have the skill points to invest in skills.
<br>
<br>Those are some of the major problems with combat and technical skills, then you have the conversional skills, there are 3 of them and they all do the same thing (just with different words). The outcome of each conversational option is coded the same. There are no &quot;dialogue trees&quot;, your options dont change how the conversion will play out. You simply click the &quot;next&quot; button to get the next piece of information, and if you have a conversational skill, you could get some extra loot / text to read or avoid combat. Remember the attribute system is a joke? You can have a charisma 1 player who is the smoothest sweet talker in the wasteland because they maxed sweet talking (with all those skills points they got from intelligence), while a charisma 10 player will have no skills to invest in anything and as such, cant pass any conversional checks. It&apos;s the complete opposite to Fallout.
<br>
<br>6. Graphics. I can go back and play Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics. They look good and are well animated. Wasteland&apos;s graphics are cheap and most importantly, poorly animated (look half finished) Things such as armor don&apos;t even change. What you create at the start is how you will look.
<br>
<br>7. In Fallout, your actions changed events in the game. Your dialogue options changed things. In this game, you are just reading a novel in each city and then have some badly programmed combat sequences, rinse and repeat.
<br>
<br>8. Dead-lifeless world. In fallout (baldurs gate etc) you felt like you were in a world. You had interesting NPCs that could join you, there were amazing cities to explore etc. In this game, you are one person (spread out across 4 different people) and you simply go from map to map, read the novel provided and then complete the combat sequence. There is no life or character to the cities or people in them. I can still remember lines and characters from fallout etc, because they had life in them. This game is DEAD and hollow inside. There is some &quot;radio banter&quot; as you travel the wasteland which livens things up, but that stops after about 30 minutes on the map, and then it is just silence. Read the novel, do the combat sequence.
<br>
<br>This game is smoke and mirrors. That&apos;s how it was coded. It&apos;s like one of those cheap Chinese &quot;warcraft&quot; clones that you see from time to time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4538297">Expand</a></span>

Both games are spectacular, but I felt the party mechanics were better in Wasteland 2. Add to that the compelling storylines, massive locations, and sprawling length of the game, and this is clearly a game that should be on everyone&apos;s radar. The combat was simple but tense, very effective. It is reminiscent of the XCOM enemy unknown in it&apos;s simplicity and potential for disaster. The factions were a blast to get to know, and there are certainly moments as memorable as Fallout 3&apos;s underground vampire cult, society of ghouls, or mutant village. Some of the factions were shockingly original. Overall, this is a game that I had a blast playing. I would recommend it to any fan of the original Wasteland games, any Fallout games, or any crpgs.

<br>I would say the game is comparable to something like the new XCOM games, or Fallout Tactics. So if you like those sorts of games, this is for you. LOT of options for character creation, and huge replay value as a lot of what you do can significant alter the plot of the game later on.
<br>
<br>I gave it a 9/10 for really only one reason. The character model graphics are awful. I mean really... really awful... I just don&apos;t understand why they couldn&apos;t have put a bit more effort into them. But then again, Gameplay&gt;Graphics so, enjoy. Maybe someone will come out with a mod that makes the character models not suck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4516006">Expand</a></span>

<br>What type of things can be named as tactical in game</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First of all - I did not expect from Wasteland 2 that game be continuer of deeds of Fallout game series. But I expect from inXile Entertainment and Brian Fargo with team of great developers of the past as minimum attention to game, to details. And if this game include itself a term - tactical game, I assume that game must be tactical.
<br>
<br>What type of things can be named as tactical in game if:
<br>Almost all enemies can cross the battlefield in one turn?
<br>If starting tactical positions does not matter, because... (see first question)
<br>If each battle just a &quot;rumble&quot; where very rare types of enemies start a distant fight?
<br>Where AI of enemies binary - &quot;0&quot; is patrol, &quot;1&quot; is run to enemies and hit.
<br>No ambush, no tactical retreats, no flank operations, no distant fights.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s the tactics, where best weapon is &quot;wrench&quot; or &quot;tube&quot;. In one interview Brian Fargo say that Wasteland 2, in principle are Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel with more freedom and free world. Absolutely not. FT:BOS is more tactical game than Wasteland in each piece of game. You can do it ambushes, you can shot in the prone position. You can use relief. You can make distant fight. And more-more-more over this opportunities.
<br>
<br>I do not want to tell about bugs, because on the starting of sales, games usual have a lot of bugs. I want tell about style of game. I mean art style. You know that Brian Fargo invited Andr&#xE9;e Wallin &quot;to help craft the world of Wasteland&quot;. But you can&apos;t find hand of this talented artist nowhere except production art and few detailed portraits. All other stuff looks horrible. Just horrible. Or poor. And the justification of this fact is the voting which was earlier. Where players - choose &quot;We want more large world and game&quot; than &quot;we want graphics as in Crisis.&quot;
<br>
<br>I think that this is incredible manipulation from the side of developers. Because no one thinking gamer never choose the graphics before game and gameplay. Does that mean that if the players choose the Game, the developers can do nothing with the Art and the Style of the Game? Not. Normal developer take care of your player. And gives him two things. Give the gamer all things. And the game. And the style. And the beauty. There are no stupid polls to know &quot;what really want gamer?&quot;. You know answer mr. Fargo. Gamer always want all. And first of all - game. Game included all components. You cannot drop one, because somebody say - is not important.
<br>
<br>So... here I can see &quot;Tactic&quot; game without real Tactic, and game without Style (Art-Style and attention to details). This monolog can leak long time. But I stop my claims. Because lot of news resources give to this pile - highest ratings and gamers too give this pile highest rate. So... I think that games of this type - thats is what we all deserve. If we silent, if we blind - we receive only thinks like this.
<br>I&apos;m not told that game is bad. I say - this is not a tactical game, and this is not beauty game. My personal rate is, roughly speaking 4 of 10, or 35-40 or 100. But not as doing mass media. &quot;Legend! Great style! If you love Fallout this game for you! Pearl of Kickstarter&quot;. Stop making this. You sing the songs for person of Brian Fargo, not for the game. If this game did not Brian Fargo - you would not notice this game at all.
<br>
<br>What you say, gamers? &quot;Amazing combat system?&quot;, &quot;Ideal Style?&quot;, &quot;Beautiful artwork?&quot;, &quot;Charming graphics?&quot;. Even raw demo of Van Buren of 2003th, which was produced almost 11 years ago looks more beauty and stylish. Brian Fargo in his twitter write about disappointment about review of Joystiq news source, and about low ratings of this review. He really thinks that Wasteland 2 deserve all of this high ratings? All of this world thinks that this... is masterpiece?
<br>
<br>Where is the next stop? I have to get off the train.
<br>
<br>Only few people in world of news make a real reviews. Make a real rate for this game. And I want say - Thank You. Thank you that you rate games, regardless person who create this game. Thank you Joystiq and VideoGamer. Thank you  Earnest Cavalli and Jamie Trinca.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4537415">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you like mindless games, this isn&apos;t for you. You have to think about things from the moment you start. You have to think about how you play to best setup your team. You have to think about how you&apos;re going to approach your latest encounter, and you can&apos;t always take the same approach. It varies quite a bit.
<br>
<br>If you don&apos;t like to read, this game might not be for you. There is a LOT of story here. Most of it is told in text. While there is a good amount of voice acting, it won&apos;t give you everything.
<br>
<br>If you like RPGs, especially those that make you think, then this game is for you. It&apos;s great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521250">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is exactly what an RPG should be.  Unfortunately, &quot;New RPG&apos;s&quot; are nothing more than action games with more options than old action games.  If you like real RPG&apos;s, you&apos;ll love Wasteland 2.  If you think that Fallout 3 was the first RPG made, you&apos;re gonna be upset, but don&apos;t say you weren&apos;t warned.
<br>
<br>This game is for the true RPG fan.  As a side note, you can change your gear as you progress through the world...you have to find new gear first, but the new gear does not have stats....it&apos;s simply cosmetic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4515356">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That&apos;s a blatant lie. This game has no DLC content. The DLC thing is a gag. And if this reviewer had spent more than 5 seconds playing the game, he would realize that.</span>

When i actually got to play it though... Generic delivery-boy quests and kill this and that all over, a game that runs extremely choppy and a fanboy community even more blind than some religious cults. Buy if you have the money to spare, otherwise buy Fallout 1&amp;2 (if you haven&apos;t already) or at least wait until WL2 goes on sale. And there is nothing special about the &quot;deluxe version&quot; either, you get some wallpapers, a couple of novellas and an updated version of the original Wasteland (with added sound and slightly better graphics, which is quite nice, though the original &quot;original&quot; is more than enough already).
<br>
<br>-4 for the game being very choppy.
<br>-1 for the horrible community.
<br>-2 for not putting out something better than they have, considering the budget and how they themselves have presented the game.
<br>+3 For it not being a total -waste- of time, and actually a pretty fun (and effective) way to spend ones free time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4535517">Expand</a></span>

Creating a game for a &apos;target audience&apos; isn&apos;t a precursor for releasing unfinished dross. Immersion ZERO. It&apos;s an exercise in map hoping, little more. The skills and attributes are bust. Useless in all honesty. No tangible progression. There is no logical reason what so ever for there to be that many loot crates around and who rigs them with TNT? It&apos;s utterly ridiculous. Managing one characters inventory is enough, but this dispersed over four characters is just a pain in your hoop. On my second run-through I named my characters after their function in my team, as you can bust the game but just going one path with each character. If you have four leads, you need 4x the complexity of game to balance the advantages you have. Disappointed to say the least.

<br>
<br>ill be totally honest with you, its not a perfect game, it has a lot of things that could be done better or expanded in various ways (i wont say which exactly as personally i wouldnt like to know before i play, as it would spoil my game)
<br>BUT
<br>it has that classic book-like atmosphere that doesnt let you to simply skip dialogues and rush into the missions. Ill give you some examples.
<br>When you start a conversation, the first thing you will get is a brief look of your interlocutor, describing how he looks, how he might potentially feel or what he might do based on his appearance. While you walk around, your personal journal (in bottom right side of screen) is popping with plenty of your insights of surrounding world. Your team members has an opinion based on their beliefs and background, and they share it whenever you approach &apos;gray&apos; areas. Also conversations are really juicy and have that vibe of fallen world (both civilisation-wise and moral). Its all subtle things, but if you play that sort of games to immerse into&apos;em youll love it.
<br>
<br>Little about game itself
<br>-graphics are good (until you&apos;re a jerk playing a classic-like rpg zoomed in...)
<br>-locations design are well made, i like them more than fallout&apos;s
<br>-music is fine (but i liked fallout&apos;s swing/blues more)
<br>-fights are hard to describe - rather easy if you plan them before  you start (and put your team around the map preparing for em) but also non forgiving if you make any mistake or just go in rambo-style (but it might be just me as i suck in fights after years of playing nondemanding crpgs)
<br>-lore and atmosphere is great
<br>-about bugs that some reviewers are whining about - all i experienced was bad pathfinding (leading to freezing your team to the ground - all you have to do is just change the team leader and make him go in the other direction)
<br>
<br>Guess its all you should know. Wasteland 2 isnt as good as the legendary games i mentioned in the beginning, but it has the same sort of subtle things that makes you forget about some graphic/mechanical issues and just dive into the game completely.
<br>
<br>my rate is 8,5/10, but for all these fools rating it 0 i&apos;ll leave a 10/10.
<br>
<br>well done inxile, cant wait for your new torment game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4523531">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game oozes late 90s and thats good because after that point cRPG gaming took a nose dive. This is REAL gaming for hardcore gamers. The only reason this game isn&apos;t rated a solid ten by users and critics is because the new generation of gamers can&apos;t handle a game which doesn&apos;t stoop to their level. If your attention span is too short, just pass on this because you have to do things like read and think for yourself.
<br>
<br>However, if you are a 30 or 40 something hardcore PC gamer that remembers fondly games where you had to figure things out for yourself, then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521099">Expand</a></span>

<br>3) Weapon customization is pointless, because it&apos;s all about DPS, no tactics involved.
<br>4) Character development ist pointless, because you NEED a computer guy, a locks guy, a conversation guy, a doctor and on top of that everybody must be able to shoot like a pro (s. 1). Pretty sure, there&apos;s ONE optimal party build and one build only.
<br>
<br>Besides the poor execution of stuff actually included in the game, the stuff that&apos;s entirely missing (after playing Fallout1 and 2) is endless. Aimed shots, combat drugs, side missions, etc.
<br>
<br>Bottom line is: The game feels like a game from 1995 with graphics from 2005. Quick reminder: The year is 2014. Maybe the devs should play a game once in a while.

<br>You can basically lump this game with all the &quot;reboots&quot; of classic games you came to love as a kid.  You know,  Jagged alliance reboot, X-com reboot, and now a &quot;Fallout / Wasteland&quot; reboot.  They took a game franchise that had tons of extra features (see above), added a bunch of pretty graphics and then sold it to the fans who thought they would be getting a graphically better version with all the same features they loved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4522250">Expand</a></span>

This is the result because in the end the developers who gather the fund have complete control on the output, so that the backers are at risk.
<br>
<br>As some reviewers are still referencing this game to fallout, one of the best RPG games. I want to point out that the similarities of this game to fallout are only limited to the character stat and the post-apocalyptic story setting. That&apos;s all.
<br>
<br>In fallout, you have the complicated quest structure with different results, opening various new quests, depending on how you act. You also have an interesting combat system, so you can choose to attack different parts of enemies, giving you advantage during combat.
<br>
<br>In this game, you have a lot of quests with fetch quest structure, so you will run around like a FedEx boy to grind for different stuff, with a lot of backtracking. In combat, you play the game in a dumbed-down version of classic xcom. So, there are not much tactics involved, and the combat will get bored soon. Basically, all the charm from fallout is absent in this game. Don&apos;t fall into the trap if you just love the critical success elements of fallout series. And the main story line is quite boring and weak as well, so don&apos;t expect too much on the main quests.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, this game is quite buggy. Getting stuck after character creation, suffering from save corruption or even crash can be quite common. You are better be prepared for this if you want to try this game. The threads about bugs or anything negative about this game seems get on deleted on steam forum. It seems the bugs are already neglected, so don&apos;t expect these bugs will probably be fixed.
<br>
<br>If this trend continues, the price of this game will probably drop soon. Don&apos;t ever underestimate the power of word-of-mouth, gamers will still discover the truth and spread the words even though there is censorship going on. So, for anyone who is still interested in this buggy and bland game, you can wait for the price drop to around $5, as the developers will soon lower the price, hoping anyone will give a try on their game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4522811">Expand</a></span>

What did I get instead of devs&apos; promises? Unpredictable crashes with saves corrupting, major FPS spikes, bugged quests which block storyline progression, inadequate support on steam forums deleting/closing bug report threads, ignoring e-mails as well. Actually, I got banned on Wasteland 2 steam community forums for creating threads simply asking for help to fix save corruption issues - thing which makes  game unplayable for me. Are developers trying to keep things quite avoiding negative reviewers response?
<br>
<br>I really hoped inXile would deliver, I&apos;m major Wasteland/Fallout series fan. But the thing is: even if some of the gamebreaking bugs gonna get fixed, will they fix blunt and atrocious storytelling? People who played Fallout/Fallout2 will understand me in terms how everything dumped down in this game is: gunplay, simplified mechanics, absence of stealth mechanics (for me, this one ruins gameplay completely), crippled character creator, bunch of useless stats, AI issues. Actually, according to feedback on steamforums, you are lucky if you manage to make your squad member to move: many people just get their newly-formed squad stuck to the ground. Re-loading savefile won&apos;t fix the issue.
<br>
<br>I am really, really disappointed in Brian Fargo as lead game designer who let this happen and in whole &apos;kickstarting&apos; thing.
<br>
<br>Maybe you shouldn&apos;t try to do things if you know for yourself you won&apos;t be able to deliver? Backing independent teams even with loud names is always risky thing. Perhaps they need like 10 years to practice things without going full public and THEN let people back their projects so customers won&apos;t feel like they were scammed?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4520133">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now Wasteland I was/is a wonderful game and story but this POS doesn&apos;t look or feel anything like the first one.

<br>Wasteland 2 captured my interest after I was allowed to play it for free for a short while. Frankly, I decided on it for the lack of games to play. This is actually my own problem for I have this rule not to spend money more than 15 euros on a game unless I am certain I want to have it. The next one I am looking forward to is Cyberpunk 2077.
<br>
<br>Wasteland 2 is positioned as an old school rpg, which is more a sales pitch than anything else. It is old, therefore it is good? Like wine that has matured over time giving us a rich bouquet of flavours? But perhaps it is more an excuse for the vinegar taste it might turn out to be? Perhaps both depending on the situation.
<br>
<br>For me a game is made in the here and now and not in the back and then and although it might have the same features in a way I hope we have progressed somewhat and learned to make things better. But next to that, a good story is a good story as a bad story is bad one. As far as I know the only difference the technology makes, for that is what discerns old from new basically, is in the delivering. And is that not what the sales pitch tries to smooth over?
<br>
<br>So ignoring the old school blurb we can say it resembles games like Blackguards, the 2014 tactical role play game set in a fantasy realm. But Wasteland stresses roleplay more and feels less combat oriented therefore. The world is also more open and allows you to travel about although there are &apos;guides&apos;  and barriers keeping you from spinning of into the wrong direction.
<br>
<br>The game strikes a decent balance between combat and role play, but unfortunately for me I never quite liked it.  One way to suck away the fun is the tedious scavenging. The country side is littered with boxes, safes and landmines which you have to discover, examine, disarm, crack, open and empty of the random generated paltry contents. Since ammunition is scare and expensive and well paying jobs are far and in between you are almost required to live of the land and the droppings of your enemies, which is at times unrelated to what weapons they bring to bear and even at times your opponents do not drop anything at all.
<br>
<br>Another annoying feature is to stuff the contents full of items listed as junk, which isn&apos;t always junk we are warned over and over so, you carry around a lot of excess baggage  just in the offhand chance it might be required for something.
<br>
<br>What I find even more damaging for this game, which is why I liked games like Torment and Baldurs Gate, is that most of your team members have almost no personality. The basic team has non and only a few of your npcs have something of their own mind. Even Blackguards gives more personality to your team members.  If this was a deliberate choice than the lack of original personalities ought to be off set by a good combat system. But wasteland doesn&apos;t deliver much. It is decent enough, but nothing special or spectacular as it lacks depth.
<br>
<br>What remains is to evaluate the story line. And here Wasteland is the most weak. It has no general story line that draws you in. The stories are fragmented and  you feel more like an emergency response team that is running from one unrelated crisis to the next. So yeah, there is the murder of Ace.  So yeah, there is the synth tale. So yeah, there are the mutated plants. But it is unrelated and often feels like a distraction for a main plot that has yet to develop.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is decent and works in a fashion, but it lacks a good story line and well develop characters. Ironically that is exactly my criticism for Fallout 4. Perhaps old school and new school have something in common?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6502176">Expand</a></span>

<br>Since I had spent so many hours, I feel stupid if I gave score lesser than 8.
<br>
<br>However, I quit the game quite early in the story.
<br>I just can&apos;t get over been forced to be part of Desert Ranger. I know that Fallout Tactics also force you to be in the Brotherhood of Steel but I have no issue with that as BOS seems competent.
<br>
<br>However, in the very beginning of the game, the Desert Ranger are hit with 2 crisis at almost the same time. Yet they only have the resource to send to tend to 1 crisis. This give me the feeling that the Desert Ranger is at a decline, without capability to deal with more than 1 crisis even though they are veterans with 15 years of experience reacting to the crisis of the wasteland, If the wasteland is as harsh as what I&apos;m been told, I personally believe that handling more than 1 crisis at the same time is quite common for the Desert Ranger when it&apos;s not at a decline.
<br>
<br>Someone told me that the Desert Ranger is stretched too thin.
<br>In Fallout New Vegas, the NCR is also stretched too thin and I always did not choose the NCR ending as I did not have faith in them.
<br>
<br>But this game forced to be in a team that I don&apos;t want to be in (for a game).
<br>Thus the more I played, the more frustrated I get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4554132">Expand</a></span>

After nearly a month of playing I finally finished it yesterday and man, it was a blast. Although the overall gameplay may seem a bit clunky at first, shortly after, you start to appreciate combat, and game plot. The game has some pretty epic moments, like when you hear a &quot;Do your really want to hurt me&quot; song in the radio, or when you do the test of politeness. I got to say, game is really mature, but also has pretty funny moments, and it really feels like  the old RPG&apos;s. It really does. It&apos;s really long and satisfying.
<br>
<br>In short, if you love RPG&apos;s, and you also enjoy the post-apocalyptic scenarios, you can&apos;t miss Wasteland 2, it&apos;s really worth trying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4789148">Expand</a></span>

I personally have NEVER played a game like this and have never played wasteland 1. Spent 300+ hours in this game it was fun. People are also rating this game 0s because it has no points of interest or fast travel well whoop go play skyrim this is a real RPG not something stream lined for skyrim fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4788589">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The wasteland is an interesting place to discover, full of both dilemma&apos;s and humor. You have to make difficult, morally ambiguous decisions and those can have consequences immediately or much later in the game.
<br>
<br>You start out with a party of 4 rangers you create from scratch and you can recruit up to 3 additional NPC companions (or more if you dump a ranger or one gets killed). Character creation is fantastic. You get a lot of different options and each can be useful for solving different situations. You can create a balanced unit or create 4 elite soldiers all specialized in assault rifles, pistols, ... and rely on recruitable NPC&apos;s for other skills.
<br>
<br>These choices influence your possibilities during the squad based tactical combat. There are different weapon, armor and ammo types, there is strategic positioning, ... The only thing they should have added was the targeting of individual body parts (fallout style).
<br>
<br>Wasteland 2 has got it&apos;s own style and feeling and that&apos;s good. InExile did a great job in my view!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5130100">Expand</a></span>

<br>The not so positive part: The game lacks portraits for characters and NPCs. Hollywood is bugged to hell (although you would be playing 70 hours before reaching that part of the game) but probably fixes are on the way.
<br>
<br>Overall, excellent game. Not perfect but great. One of the best roleplaying games out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4769226">Expand</a></span>

<br>With some flaws mainly in polishing: attributes has little influence, most weapon skills are useless and other skills seem interesting but in game has few uses because most maps seem designed to classic combats instead of multiple strategies, leaving the sensation that could be more variety.
<br>Although InXile made an excellent job in all what really matters: the game core; and the flaws can be solved by patches, DLCs or even an Expansion pack. In fact some mods have already solved things as the rebalance in combat (search them in Nexus mods).
<br>In average is a superb game core (that deserves a 10 by itself), with a tightly acceptable campaign, and minor polishing flaws (so rules and level design deserves a tight 6 only because we feel that could be much better). Patches, DLC or Expansions could easily improve all those polishing issues, but I think that when the Toolset will be released this game would show its real potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4768305">Expand</a></span>

W2 is an amazing game and F2 had numerous bugs and broken mechanics (ammo bug rings any bells...?).

<br>
<br>Very challenging but rewarding! It is a must have game for lovers of Fallout 1 &amp; 2. And I&apos;m glad to have games like this these days where everything is FPS</span>

It is truly the sequel to 1988&apos;s Wasteland game containing many of the same plot devices and situations.  I fear many of the red votes here are from users that expected Fallout 2.5, not Wasteland 2.
<br>
<br>The bad: The attributes don&apos;t have much influence on the characters skills or abilities, enemy melee fighters can walk up to your toes on their first round, and the special dialog choices I was hoping for were just a one-line comment and some xp.  The combat was fairly fun but I&apos;m not big on combat anyway.  I play crpg&apos;s for the plot twists and convoluted dialog trees so was very disappointed with the special dialog.
<br>
<br>The Good: There are some great conversations, and the inter-faction rivalries are quite clever if you take the time to screw people over and change alliances on the fly.  The game has no good/bad morality, just shades of gray.  I plan to play the game again making totally different choices just to see new content.
<br>
<br>Again, it&apos;s not Fallout!  It doesn&apos;t have prone firing or aimed shots, you can&apos;t play as a loner or search for the G.e.c.k. either.  Fallout is a great game but it is a different game.

It is heavily focused on skills and skill use rather than the traditional attribute driven style of RPG.  Most problems presented in the game have multiple solutions as do most quests.  Like Fallout,  your decisions factor heavily into the end of the game.
<br>
<br>It does suffer from a few small flaws,  the attributes really are meaningless.  Intelligence is extremely important,  Strength if you want the best armor,  and an extra point or two in Charisma is needed if you want to be able to recruit all of the NPCs.
<br>
<br>Its other major flaw is that it is very easy to lock yourself out of sidequests, or completely miss them.  Many sidequests require you to have some specific item in your inventory when talking to an NPC that is found in another area,  and it is really easy to have an inventory full of items for quests you missed because you didn&apos;t know you needed to go back and talk to someone.  Worse,  occassionally completing some other quest will block a sidequest even if the person is still present and could talk to you,  but inexplicably won&apos;t..  If you&apos;re going to play,  just spoil yourself and reference a Toaster Items spoiler or you&apos;ll miss many things.  Some of this is intentional,  sometimes an action you take alters the town you&apos;re in and it would no longer make sense for the sidequest to work (Like causing some NPC to leave town),  but IMO it is just too easy for this to happen as you aren&apos;t given a hint that it could happen.
<br>
<br>Does Wasteland 2 have some flaws?  Certainly,  but so does every other game.  Wasteland 2,  like any other great game,  has only small flaws and I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4924774">Expand</a></span>

Its deep environment invites to believe that we really are out there in a devastated environment; the deep character creation contributes greatly to the immersion as well as the clever mature dialogues where I had that constant sensation that my choices counts, instead those from Fallout 3 where you know that no matter what choose the result of the dialogue will be answered immediately.
<br>
<br>As observation it needs a complete combat rebalance because Assault Rifles and Brawling are the best viable choices for range and melee respectively, followed by Snipers, SMG, EW. Actually are mods that solves that but it would be nice an &quot;official&quot; answer to have wikis and guides updated.
<br>
<br>The average feeling about this game is a foundation of ideas that could be polished, and with the toolset will be even better, meanwhile is one of the best RPG I&apos;ve ever played and also have inspired me to write a novel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4717707">Expand</a></span>

The combat is annoying (and each of my guys is spec&apos;d into just 1 weapon type, not spread out): even with jam rates of like 2% I&apos;ll have the same guy jam up a bunch of times in a fight. Normally I wouldn&apos;t care but the AP cost to unjam is ridiculous. Plus it drives me crazy that all enemy types seem to be able to close any distance on you in a turn. So my sniper guy who I always position as far away as possible just gets melee&apos;d so I wound up having to take the brawl skill. Spent about 8 hours clearing the first area, the AG Center, which was boring and a tedious slog. I&apos;m not gripped by the story yet unlike Fallout 1 (maybe it gets better?). I&apos;m also not looking forward to a massive party size. You start with 4 which is manageable, it goes up to 7. I didn&apos;t mind 4-6 person parties in D&amp;D type games because each of them felt very unique (sorcerer vs. rogue vs. cleric etc), but in this, it&apos;s just like &quot;Oh this dude is good with this gun type&quot; and then happens to have some support skill like doc or medic. Which is helpful, but really it&apos;s just firing a different gun type. The camera also really annoys me. I just don&apos;t like the angle and way things look. I feel like I&apos;m constantly having to adjust the zoom and rotation all the time.
<br>
<br>As for the comments about being geared for people who played the original or &quot;must have an affinity to old-school game mechanics&quot; that&apos;s not really the case. I don&apos;t mind reading walls of text if it&apos;s interesting (Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc), but so far, not very exciting. The combat mechanics are just boring esp. compared to like Baldur&apos;s Gate. Hell even Fallout 1 which had similar mechanics just felt more fun what with the perks and stuff, added variety.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know. The music is great. The visuals are pretty good, I dig the atmosphere. But it just feels like a tedious party based tactics game and so far, 13 hours in, I&apos;m not being grabbed by the story. It does have some humorous writing though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542915">Expand</a></span>

Performance issues, clunky and sometimes unreliable game play, and confusing aesthetics ground Wasteland 2 firmly in the Indie / Unpolished category of games these days. It delivers exactly what it promised, but it does so in a rather poorly constructed package. The game is far from bad, but it&apos;s frustrating to play a game that you know in your heart of hearts is an absolute masterpiece hidden behind underdeveloped game play, not-so-spectacular aesthetics, and an underwhelming role-playing aspect.
<br>
<br>If you can look past its flaws and enjoy it for what it is, Wasteland 2 is perfectly enjoyable. Amazing story-telling, incredibly immersive hooks, and absolutely outstanding character writing will give you a truly wonderful RPG experience. But don&apos;t be surprised when you find yourself feeling that the game is lacking that special something that would put it over the top.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4551979">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Compared to the original Fallout games, I didn&apos;t feel like the story was as engaging, or the characters as memorable. The system is a little more modern, but often irritating as some actions just waste the player&apos;s time for basically no reason.  It&apos;d also be nice to be able to enter turn based mode for certain actions, like if a character is bleeding out after a battle. I will say though, that skills in Wasteland 2 are more consistently useful than in the original Fallout games.
<br>
<br>Compared to Divinity, I personally like the atmosphere and game world in this one better, but the Divinity combat system wins hands down. Also, while I thought the crafting system in Divinity could use some work, there&apos;s almost no crafting to speak of here, even though I think it would make sense thematically.
<br>
<br>All told, Wasteland 2 is a solid game. Not perfect, but solid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4557832">Expand</a></span>

Generally it is disappointing because combat is the worst thing about this game. After playing around 10 hours I have been frustrated by it a number of times.
<br>
<br>Ammo is scarce and PC&apos;s miss most of their shots unless you spend heavily in combat skills, which means you neglect the massive number of other useful skills which make up parts of the game which are actually fun. Melee weapons beyond a nail board seem to be completely forgotten.
<br>
<br>Most of the fights, save a few, seem to be standoffs with little in the way of tactical cover, rather two teams blasting at each other until one crew dies. This is a major let down. Even setting up ambushes becomes a tedious tip-toe forward trying not to aggro the enemy, who can run at you like Usain Bolt and get into melee range on their first turn. There is no kind of CC or even debuffs.
<br>
<br>Loot is randomly generated apart from medical supplies and some mobs. You can easily get starved of one type of ammo so the pressure is on throughout the game to conserve as much as you can.
<br>
<br>The story is quite good so far, with a hard choice early on with real consequences. The dialogue is well acted and written, although sometimes you will want to turn the radio transmitter spam off so you can actually focus on your story.
<br>
<br>The &quot;isometric&quot; (3D) view is great, although the graphics in general lack a real polish, looking much like the first &quot;Dawn of War&quot; game which came out 10 years ago this month. The maps are exactly like the old Fallout games or even New Vegas, mostly brown but with some fun variations on the theme. The sizes are fine and walking them does not take too long. Loading times between maps were around 10-15 seconds for me. I have not found any bugs.
<br>
<br>There is a lot to like about this game, and like Divinity Original Sin its probably more fun with a guide on how to set your party up (which I think is a really lame thing). The combat is tiresome but the dramatic parts are good and the environment is what you would probably want. I don&apos;t think it is worth &#xA3;30, if you liked fallout wait for it to be &#xA3;20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4557402">Expand</a></span>

The problem is that it&apos;s not a good game either. At the beginning It definitely gives you that sweet feeling of an old style RPG, but as you go deeper into the game, you start to realise that it&apos;s just the surface and Wasteland 2 is pretty dull at the inside. It&apos;s not about some major issues, the problem is that there are huge number of small ones.
<br>
<br>1) Game mechanics is not transparent. Do you know that high combat initiative allows you have more than one move in a turn? Do you know how luck affects drop rates? How charisma works, is it party-based or character-based? Do you know that formula for action points is (STR+INT+SPD)/4+CRD/2. Sure, you can dig forums and find answers to most of your questions, but you can&apos;t find them in game.
<br>
<br>2) Boring levels. Maps are quite big and full of hidden crates and containers. There are no shortage of mobs as well. It makes progression tedious and dull.
<br>
<br>3) Most skills are poorly designed. Computer science, demolitions, lockpicking, safecracking, toaster repair - in 95% of the situations you use them to get access to some loot. And you really need that loot and those skills, because ammo is sparse. I found that Mechanical Repair and Animal Whisperer to be enjoyable, just because they are not used routinely.
<br>
<br>4) There are dosens of crates, safes, and blah-blah on the map. Almost all of them contains some junk, a little bit of ammo and tiny amount of money. It makes the gameplay grindy and tedious. Instead it would be much better to remove 90% of the crates and fill remaining 10% with cool items, and give the player feeling of the accomplishment.
<br>
<br>5) The storyline is not engaging and full of cliches. It really fits theme of original Wasteland, but what was good back in 80s is boring and repetitive now. It reminds me of Fallout Tactics, which is not cool. To be fair, there are good things about the story as well: i really like emphasis on hard decisions and &quot;you can&apos;t save em all&quot; attitude.
<br>
<br>6) There are times when game really breaks the immersion.  First time you see a honey badger - it&apos;s really funny. Second time, it&apos;s ok. But when you see a whole valley full of them, you just facepalm. There are no day/night cycle (fallout 1/2, arcanum, hell - even Ultima 7 had that). And yeah - dosens of crates full of staff in what was supposed to be a wasteland.
<br>
<br>7) And list goes on and on.
<br>
<br>Note, that none of these issues are gamebreaking or something. They just take away some satisfaction of the game. So if your are a fun of post-apocalypse theme and turn based combat - by all means get it, but wait for the sale. Otherwise - avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4551302">Expand</a></span>

I love the humour of WL2 and the manner in which it ramps up the difficulty and options. It has been a long time since I have played a game with such a strong &quot;one-more-turn&quot; feeling. This game takes old-school game concepts and really brings them up to date.

<br>
<br>First, the graphics are atrocious. There is no excuse for character models that look this terrible in 2014. While it&apos;s fun to read the immersive descriptions of everything in the game, I would have enjoyed more immersion through graphics as well. Hope you picked your character models wisely at the beginning of the game, because you&apos;ll be staring at that pixelated junk for the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>Second, the combat is unimaginative and seems more like a chore than fun. You are constantly forced to melee to preserve ammo. The cover system is horribly underutilized, and there are very few tactical choices to make during combat.
<br>
<br>Third, the game has that feeling of a 1990s RPG. The UI is clunky and accomplishing tasks takes more clicks than it should. Nothing like having to pick a lock 5 times before you either succeed or critically fail. Why can&apos;t the game just do the roll and figure out if I failed or succeed? Inventory management is a pain, and comparing items to your secondary weapon is tedious.

<br>Overall, I had high hopes for this game but left extremely disappointed. Just because you model a game after a 1990s classic doesn&apos;t mean you have to retain all the junk that plagued 1990s games. We have made great advancements in gaming since Fallout 1 and 2 - use them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4541924">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First off, graphics is poor. Not only it is not artistically pleasing, it is most of the time bland, uninspired, and without trace of atmosphere. Colors don&#xB4;t work together. Animations are akward, slow, characters flow weightlessly. Quality of 3D objects wildly varies, as of textures. All in all, I really don&#xB4;t feel visuals deliver the story and overall setting correctly.
<br>
<br>Level design is pretty bad, outdated, and without attention to detail. For example, there are literally hundreds of chests everywhere, most of them trapped, like what the hell? Who left them there? In the middle of nowhere? Why? Does this make any sense? No, it doesn&#xB4;t, the world is unbelievable and feels fabricated. On top of that, you&#xB4;ve got to rotate camera all the time to not miss important stuff. In these regards, even Fallout 1 is way better.
<br>
<br>I&#xB4;ve just completed first of the bigger quests and I really wonder whether I should play on, and hope for the better. Because so far, its a drag. Boring NPCs, boring quests, all wrapped in bad visuals.
<br>
<br>Combat seems kinda ok, although monsters are nothing to write home about. Random generated encounters are really terrible, as there are like two different maps they happen upon. It gets repetetive really quickly. You don&#xB4;t expect mindless grind in single-player, but, boy, you will get it here.
<br>
<br>If I compare W2 with recently published Divinity: OS ($1mil.), Wasteland 2 looks like very indie, borderline amateurish, attempt. This is not $3 mil. game by any stretch of an imagination. I really hope Torment will be two leagues above production quality of W2. Otherwise I will question whether Fargo is able to make good games like he used to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4534663">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have two complaints about the game.
<br>First is the player models are of lower quality then I would like, the fact that armour doesn&apos;t change your avatar means you tend to stick with your original clothing. I know you can find different clothing in game, but I didn&apos;t bother with it.
<br>Second some of the quests in the second half of the game were a bit disjointed. They weren&apos;t broken, but I was left scratching my head wondering if something had broke.
<br>All in all a good game and a must buy for any fan of the original Fallout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/wasteland-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4580078">Expand</a></span>

It was the first &quot;big&quot; kickstarted RPG and it turned out to be awesome. Great writing, a lot of C&amp;C stuff, nice side-quests, tons of easter eggs ang a feeling of good old CRPG.</span>
