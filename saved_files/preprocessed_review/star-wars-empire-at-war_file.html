While the initial game isn&apos;t too large in scale by today&apos;s standards, the great modding community gives us even more depth into the Star Wars canon, and gives us a truly fantastic experience. The only fault i could give for this game is that there isn&apos;t more of it out there.</span>

This game makes for both ground and space based warfare, making it an interesting change from past games. The Single Player Campaigns were interesting. 1 Con about this game is its A.I. The AI of this game is pretty bad and easily defeatable. Online play is ok, but generates loads of lag and poor online design.</span>

For any knowledgable Star Wars fan, you&apos;ll love a lot about this game. It&apos;s a familiar and accurate Galaxy map, with logical plantery bonuses. You&apos;ll likely be surprised at some of the planets included, and you&apos;ll appreciate the good descriptions. 
<br>Two things will bother people, though. First, the size and fighting strategy and capability of the Rebellion. Despite the cool and interesting differences between the Rebels and the Empire, the overall strategy for both sides is the same. Armies, bases, and real confrontations, not quite the stelathy guerrilla warfare that would be more accurate. Also, the way certain mechanics work may by slightly bothersome, such as Rebels getting technology by stealing from the Empire with R2 and C3PO, and the fact that fleets can only be located at planets, no open space. All of these issues are excused for the sake of gameplay, and trust me, the sacrifices of strict continuity are TOTALLY worth it. You also have to keep in mind that the game lets you do it how you want to, so if you want to complain about continuity, remember that it&apos;s your fault. 
<br>
Now gameplay. There are three categories of gameplay. Galactic, space, and ground. Galactic is easy and intuitive. While there are options that you might rather have, there is little to complain about in what&apos;s there. 
<br>Space is fun. A serious fan of space battles will wish they could do more specific stuff, but there&apos;s enough strategy to be intersting, and the cool feature of targeting fire to certain hard points is immersive. The biggest complaint is the 2D plane. A 3D space ala Homeworld would have been awesome, but alas. It&apos;s still quite fun, however.
<br>Land is very different from most traditional RTS games. You capture reinforcement points so that you can bring in troops from your fleet above. You don&apos;t make units, you bring in units you made on the galactic map. You can build a few structures like turrets, but only at certain points. You don&apos;t have all the options of normal RTS games, but it&apos;s still fun and tactical, although rudimentary. It makes for a unique experience, which befits a scenario of galactic conquest with pre made fleets in the air. 
<br>
That&apos;s the important distinction that makes this game awesome. Of the three gameplay types, none are spectacular. Each one, while immersive and plenty detailed enough, doesn&apos;t have all the options for a more ambitious gamer or as much as a more specialized game. However, all three types mesh in such a way that the minor lackings of each type don&apos;t matter, because each is just a part of a whole galactic war. You make units on planets in the Galactic map, using buildings you made on those planets. That&apos;s how you build your bases, you command your resources and unit distribution from there, and the space and land battles are merely specific tactical confrontations, that honestly would not make sense as a duplication of C&amp;C. Everything makes sense and blends well as a galactic war, which makes the gameplay varied and intriguing, continuous, and galaxy spanning, and it&apos;s a fantastic immersive experiene for great fun. 
<br>
Graphics are plenty good. No complaints. Turn up the resolution and detail and it&apos;s nice. It doesn&apos;t need to be better. Turn it down and it still looks nice, and runs great even on older machines. Sound is top notch, and voice acting isn&apos;t bad considering they didn&apos;t get any original actors. As for difficulty, it is kind of easy, and strategy can be fairly basic. The AI isn&apos;t great, but it&apos;s not retarded and it&apos;s not frustrating, a good balance. 
<br>
Overall, while nothing about it is spectacular, Empire at War blends all it&apos;s parts into an amazing overarching gameplay that is immersive for anyone, especially a Star Wars fan, and enthralling. No component could pretend to be a full fledged game, for example the Space battles would be no competition for Homeworld, but each part is only part of a whole, and they all blend so well, that the game is ammazing. It&apos;s an experience that you simply can&apos;t get in any other game. 
<br>
Final thought: I have Final Exams tommorrow, and instead of studying or doing any work, I&apos;ve been playing EAW for days, and even after I pried myself from it, I came online to speak praise for it. 
<br>
Strategy fans, Star Wars fans, you&apos;ll love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=57727">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are a bit retro but are so colorful the space battles still stand up BEAUTIFULLY! And all the sounds are completely licensed from Lucas Arts. I haven&apos;t seen such a balance between abilities and weaknesses of different factions (Empire, Rebels, Zann Consortium (criminal syndicate), since Star Craft. And both land and space battles require complex balancing of mixed forces. Generally, with few exceptions, you can&apos;t just build imperial star destroyers and expect to take on swarms on rebel fighters or proton frigates, they will surprisingly eat you alive without proper escorts. To say nothing of strategically managing the planetary map (balancing what kind of buildings you build on your planets). And the AI is quite good, both tactically and strategically.  The only drag is the sometimes brutally repetitive nature of some of the attacks.  Pro Tip: If you use auto-resolve, often times you will lose seemingly hopeless battles (or win some easy ones with ridiculous loses).  BUT, if you begin the tactical combat and then use the Fast Forward button, and sit back and watch, you may very well win, and win with no or few losses.  It takes 2-3 minutes but it&apos;s worth it (Advanced Pro Tip: If you do this, I think you still manually need to fire the planet based weapons, so un-FF and then fire, and re-FF).
<br>
<br>Example, being rusty at this game, as the all powerful Empire, I laughingly got my rear end kicked all the way back to Coruscant, was invaded, and almost lost the game, but was forced to think of inventive new strategies to claw my way back up, using a combination of land based hypervelocity cannons to secure my local space, and researching powerful new techs, which also opened up new &quot;hero units&quot; such as Captain Piett (with a suped up star destroyer) and Darth Vader (with an Executer Class Super Star Stardestroyer Command Ship), which turned the tide.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants the ultimate RTS Star Wars experience done really well, even if the graphics (particularly the land battles) are a bit dated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3958785">Expand</a></span>

I really like how it is basically a strategy game for both beginners, and experts.  The game play is very good, and it suits expert strategy gamers, without going so hard on beginners.  I think that this could be the best Star Wars strategy game out there.  Then again, I actually like Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds better, but that&apos;s not to say that this game is terrible.  The one thing that&apos;s better from Galactic Battlegrounds is the graphics.  Battlegrounds was 2D, while everything here is 3D.  Not to mention that it has a game engine of its own, where Galactic Battlegrounds works on the Age of Empires engine.  However, there is one thing that I don&apos;t like about Empire at War, and that&apos;s the space battles.  The battles, when playing in instant action mode, last only a measly seven minutes, where the ground battles last up to thirty!  However, that problem doesn&apos;t totally ruin the game.  It&apos;s still a good game nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1773579">Expand</a></span>

Despite that Empire at War has it&apos;s flaws. There are two factions in this game, Rebels are Empire, and two modes of battle, those being in land and in space. Space battles are where the game shines, since they look great, and never seem to get boring, I have started up a game countless of times to play a single space skirmish battle, and it will always be a blast, going from star fighters to giant capital cruisers battling it out is legitimately great. Despite that there is a unit limit, and that takes out some of the scale of the battles. Things in land aren&apos;t so great however, they look quite ugly actually, and can be relatively boring at times, when I wanted to conquer a planet I actually found myself playing and enjoying the space battles and then simply auto-completing (a feature that I should note for single-player) the land battles in order to avoid them, I did find myself enjoying certain land battles in the campaign modes however, but that is mainly because that mode made sure the battles were more unique. Talking about modes, apart from the two campaigns, there are skirmish battles and a mode called galactic conquest, where as the name suggests you&apos;ll have to conquer the galaxy, and this is an interesting part of the game, for a good portion of this mode you won&apos;t be in battle, you&apos;ll be viewing the galaxy and the planets you control as well as your enemies&apos; planets, training both ground and space units and making buildings, as well as transporting troops and strengthening your economy, and this galactic conquest mode can extend and get really tense thanks to all of that, however it can get tedious after a while. Multiplayer is LAN only, which is a shame, since some online battles would definitely have been very interesting. A feature that this game has that is very noteworthy is the movie camera mode, it lets you see battles as if it was a movie, it can be a little distracting amidst the action, however when you can put the camera and relax it is great, but as I said it shines way more in space than land. Also, strategy-game wise it isn&apos;t that deep, there are few hotkeys and options that you would use in other strategy games like Starcraft 2. Overall I think it&apos;s a good game, but some issues lead it to not be great, I&apos;d say download the demo (which is a good demo by the way) and judge by yourself, as for me, I think my purchase was good, but the potential that Star Wars has still wasn&apos;t used to it&apos;s fullest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4137178">Expand</a></span>

P.S. idk what all you critics are talking about, that was incredibly easier than you make it out to be. &quot;grind through the game&quot; my ass, i bet you can&apos;t play a video game for sh....

Multiplayer galactic conquest is where it&apos;s at.My buddy and I are still trying to beat each other after a week of playing a 40+ planet campaign. Brilliant! Saving your game during multiplayer is also a nice touch. Also, you don&apos;t need a super mega PC to run this game, unlike the current stock out there.</span>

They have almost no different kinds of troops or veicles and the maps are very small. The only good part of this game was when i played the first 10 minutes of it.</span>

I.e - badly. This is worse. This is, quite possibly the WORST game I have EVER played. The graphics are appalling. They are irritating and cutesy, while lacking in detail, the only thing that looks good is the explosions in the space battles. Don&apos;t get me started on the inconsistencies. Just trust me, if you&apos;re a star wars fan this game will irritate you. Perfect example - During the formative years of the Rebellion, acccording to EAW the SOLE method the Rebel Alliance had for gathering intelligence was.... wait for it... R2D2 &amp; C3P0. &quot;Many camp droids died to bring you this information...&quot; Also, apparently the Rebellion is just as strong as the empire. No, really. Click single player, click the SUPPOSEDLY freeform conquest mode that - MAKES YOU PICK A LINEAR SCENARIO. Pick Galactic conquest (the only relatively freeform one, although if you replay it, they always attack the same places) try starting it from BOTH sides. Compare fleets and troops. Lucasarts? I wish I could defenestrate whoever was responsible for this pile of s**t. And the ground combat...? No, I can&apos;t. I&apos;ll cry. I&apos;d say find out for yourself, but... Ok, one quick thing, all combat, both ground and orbital reminds me of warcraft 2 without the charm. You have a set square map, with predefined &quot;terrain&quot; like asteroid fields. You can&apos;t alter the camera angle at all, although you do have a very limited zoom function. except you can&apos;t Build units. Use pre-built - hammer the crap out of stuff.

The game is highly addictive and 30+ hours of gameplay content easy. The best part, the pulled this off in the Star Wars universe. If you are a strategy fan, this is a must have game.</span>

Looking back at past SW strategy games Epire at wars seems like a good combination of all these elements and really feels like a galactic scale conquest. The battles look and feel beautiful in space and are good even on the ground. The gameplay is long lasting wioth easily 20 hours of play in both single player campaings and overall I am amazingly happy with this game. However, there was a few problems I noticed durign my play. First off battles can get reptative and tedious, but the fact your going to diffrent enviroments ever 10 to 30 minutes seems to make up for this problem. Also their is some problems with with units getting stuck. I had a victory class and several soilder units get stuck and not move from their position (even to fire) over several battles, though this is rare its annoying never the less. Another problem is with control glitches, often my cursor will not want to drag over units and i am forced to press escape bringing up the menu and returning to the game in order to get that back. However the game was just released and these problems will be fixed eventually and do not hamper the game play much. Overall some aspects could have been better and hopefully an expansion will allow the production of Super Star Destroyers, B-wings, hero&apos;s like Thrawn and other cool units that were left out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=385667">Expand</a></span>

Separation of building and battles takes a lot of the fun of stategy games out. I simply can&apos;t recommend this game. Star Wars fanatics only need apply.</span>

How much fun would a true 3D space strategy game in the Star Wars universe have been? Instead, we&apos;re locked onto 2D planes of movement. A fine attempt, but could have been soooo much better.</span>

Despite what another reviewer says, you do have full camera control and furthermore, you can zoom out further than ANY other RTS ever. Another point where another reviewer is mistaken: there is significant nonlinear play. Think of how the missions work in Grand Theft Auto. I&apos;m not sure why he was complaining about graphics--just look at the screenshots or movies from any review siite other than IGN (I guess they ran the game on a low end machine). A game shouldn&apos;t be penalized for being fully playable on low end machines! Empire at War scales its graphics to let more people play. I&apos;d recommend it to anyone who likes strategy, RTS, Star Wars, and even casual gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=385624">Expand</a></span>

I have played every major RTS that has come along. I was a little bummed with the demo and was bracing myself for mediocre game yet after going to three different stores I finally found a copy as they are all SOLD OUT. Once I stuck this baby in I was hooked. I played the skirmish and galactic conquest modes all weekend long and haven&apos;t even gotten into the MP and campaign modes. The gameplay had so many options on how to play an RTS unlike any other RTS before it. I am tired of the old gather resources, build up army, and attack. SWEAW gave me a unique way to play the game in every mode. It was like playing Home world, C&amp;C, Age, &amp; starcraft all rolled into one great game.

Cause believe it or not, &quot;Empire at War&quot; seems to be it&apos;s spiritual successor. Slightly less complex then &quot;Rebellion&quot;, but i think it&apos;s a major mistake to compare this game to other RTS&apos; on the market. The RTS element of this game is flawed, to be kind. You do not have anywhere NEAR the freedom that you would expect in an RTS. You cannot build buildings wherever you&apos;d like. You can build AA and AI turrets only in preselected locations. i think this may stun alot of people going in to this thinking it&apos;ll be like Starcraft or Command and Conquer. It&apos;s not. The strategy elements, though, are ALOT of fun, and the reason i gave this a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=385645">Expand</a></span>

Yes. It definitely does the things that Rebellion did right, and it avoids many of the things Rebellion did wrong -- it&apos;s one of the best-looking SW games around, if not the best (as long as you don&apos;t use the zoom too much!) EAW does take a long time to play out, and some of the strategy can be repetitive. Plus, if you get stalemated by the strategic map, it&apos;s hard to get past certain phases of the game. The controls are easy to use, and the game is largely bug free and smooth-running, if you have a good system. Multiplayer is actually rather fun, in that human opponents will do things the computer wouldn&apos;t think of. The multiplayer setup is through GameSpy, which can be both a blessing and a curse, but once you get past that, playing on-line is easy, at least with the most recent official patch. EAW does a lot of things and covers much ground in the Star Wars universe. It&apos;s certainly an ambitious game, and deserves some solid gaming time. However, because EAW has so many different things to do, it never quite excels at any of them, so if you&apos;re expecting specific scenarios or outcomes based on the books or movies, or even based on other RTS or Star Wars games, you may be disappointed. On the other hand, if chasing after legions of panicked footsoldiers in your very own AT-AT tickles your fancy, then EAW will certainly keep you and your online friends amused.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=385705">Expand</a></span>

<br>Con: later on in the game, you&apos;ll be able to predict its patterns and thus be able to defeat them easily in easy, middle, and hard levels. The difficulty of this game is more on stronger/harder-hit units or more amount of units deployed in combat, than on actually increasing the A.I.&apos;s intelligence that you&apos;re competing against. Increasing A.I.&apos;s intelligence would make one feel like they&apos;re playing chess against them; that&apos;s very vital on making a best strategy game.
<br>
<br>Pros: awesome CGI, the strategic/tactical challenges you&apos;ll initially encounter, some characters, units, storytelling, and pretty much everything else. This game was very addicting to me. When I&apos;ve bought it, I&apos;ve played it for hours until I get bored w/ it and then left for some time; one week later, I&apos;m still playing it again.
<br>
<br>For someone who&apos;s 1) a Star Wars fan, 2) likes strategy games like Ages of Empire, and 3) really into CGI 3D effects, this game is it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=6656656">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Though i wouldn&apos;t say that the AI is innately useless, it&apos;s probably just bugged somewhere. With the Phoenix Rising mod for instance: I&apos;ve built about 1.000 very large Destroyers with some hundred smaller Cruisers for their support, but no small fighter squadrons. With time i obliterated the enemies fleet, blew into space all of its destroyers and cruisers, but at a certain point the AI made a remarkable switch, it recognized that its destroyers and cruisers were no match for me and that my weakspot was defense against small bomber fleets. It started to create dozens over dozens of them and it began to destroy a solid 30% of my destroyers and cruisers.
<br>
<br>In the meantime i was building a lot of specialized fighter squadrons to hunt its bomber squadrons down, when i was ready i assigned to all of my destroyer and cruiser fleets a bunch of them, closing my last remaining weakspot. From there on the AI seemed to resign, it just built space station and defense structures on the ground, but never again made an attack.
<br>
<br>All in all: First playthrough with the vanilla game is great, same for the FoC Expansion, but the real fun begins with the mods, which not only bring mayor gameplay improvements, but also bring a sh**ton of SW:Expanded Universe lore to the game, they are the REAL EaW Experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-empire-at-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=7222239">Expand</a></span>
