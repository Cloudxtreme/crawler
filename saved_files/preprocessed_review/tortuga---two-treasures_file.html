It wasn&apos;t damaged. It was however a mundane, non-linear, badly coded attempt to cash in on Johnny Depp&apos;s latest movies. Combat at sea is unpredictable and luck based as your cannons range varies from being able to fire upto half a mile away and not firing at all when you are practically on top of an enemy ship. Combat on land is dependant on hammering your left mouse button whilst trying to shepherd the 6+ enemies that attack you at once into a corner before they mob you. There has been a mass of pirate-based games of recent catalysed by the Pirates of the Caribbean movies with this and the official PotC games being the worst and Sid Meier&apos;s Pirates and Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales being the cream of the crop.

Ascaron was the first with a pirates theme (way before Sid n Co) but they&apos;ve managed to take a fun game and make it dull and irritating. Button mashing deluxe. About 15 minutes of marginal entertainment. What a pity.</span>
