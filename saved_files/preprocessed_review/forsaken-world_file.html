My only experience of WoW was the up to lvl 20 trial version which I played a few months back, and I must say that I enjoyed that very much. When I first started play Forsaken World, I found that I had the similar feeling as when playing the trial of WoW, except that when I reached level 20, I still had the full game at my fingertips. WoW trial ends and expects me to play &#xC2;&#xA3;10 a month for a service which Forsaken World offers for free.
<br>While Forsaken world may lack some of the features that define WoW, it is still a hugely valid MMO that players do not give it enough credit for.
<br>It is a good looking game, and while the environments maybe slightly basic graphically, the aesthetic more than makes up for it (and that&apos;s all that matters at the end of the day really), and the characters models are extreamely good.
<br>While I only got to try out one race, there are plenty to choose from, as well as different classes, offering much needed variety and plenty of replay value once you get bored of a particular character.
<br>The world is open and varied, and there are plenty of places to explore and perform quests in.
<br>While I have heard complaints about the battle system, I found it standard for MMOs, and I have never heard any complaints about any MMO battle systems before, some of which are worse than Forsaken Worlds, so there are no issues there.
<br>Overall, I feel that this game is a very valid, free alternative to World of Warcraft, it has all the charm and gameplay, without the huge pricetag. And besides, the game is free, how can you complain. Go try it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2299771">Expand</a></span>

Yes you can try to farm all the gems the old fashioned way but still you will need real money to buy the fusion agents to combine them. Not to mention that all the good stuff is within that stupid orb system where you have 1 in 1000 chances of getting what you want otherwise you keep getting garbage from each orb. lottery? come on!!.

There are constant exploits in the game (dumb ass devs to blame), that forces them to do a complete rollback, which punishes everyone (including the new guys that are trying to level). So, 4 days of work down the drain. If u busted your ass to get from level 80 to 85, guess what? Do it all again. They took that hard work away from you. On the rollback note, they have a cash shop in this game. If you bought leaves (their form of currency) before the rollback, it&apos;s up to YOU to get in touch with them to get YOUR money back! lol Blows my mind.
<br>
<br>Bottom line is, I touched on only a few of the problems with the game. Again, it had it&apos;s time, and I miss the old FW. Unless they get their **** together, guys, I wouldn&apos;t spend time building my character or spending money. It can&apos;t fall much further down before it collapses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6788532">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m used to micro-transaction P2P but there&apos;s not much &quot;micro&quot; about this system.  Starting my first character, it&apos;s obvious that they attempt to herd you into the cash shop.  At level 7, I&apos;ve killed enough mobs to purchase 5 pieces of food for the purposes of restoring my health.  Not 5 stacks, but 5 pieces.  Looking in the cash shop, I see that for a mere $10 of my money, I can purchase 4 health potions that will restore 70% of my health.  So, I can either pay for 2/3 of a month of p2p MMO time, or I can purchase 4 health pots in Forsaken World.<br><br>Another issue for me is the controls.  It&apos;s not very smooth.  When I click a mob or NPC, it usually click-to-moves well behind the character instead of selecting them.  attempting to rotate also often sends you off into the woods.  Rotating the camera while running?  Well, that&apos;s impossible.<br><br>Finally, the environment just seems lacking and sparsely populated.  Running through the woods, I kill mobs to have them respawn mere seconds after killing them, they just pop into existence right by you within 5 seconds of killing it&apos;s predecessor.<br><br>There&apos;s more, but to be honest, in spite of the features included in this f2p(dungeon finder, planner, prayers, etc) it still feels like a bare bones MMO released to grab as much money from the cash shop as possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=1689977">Expand</a></span>

<br>Perfect World Entertainment is just licensing the use of the game, translated from Chinese by people that don&apos;t speak English.  Tons of errors and language that wasn&apos;t proof read.  Their servers get 90% of the updates that China does, 3-6 months later.
<br>
<br>The client for the game itself, is horridly unstable.  Some people on slower systems can play forever without crashing, but they take so long to load into areas/dungeons, the encounters start before they are even there.  Other people on new systems crash more and more each content update, because there is ZERO 64 bit support or compatibility.  What is PWE doing about it?  Nothing.  Their staff works 9-5, Monday through Friday.  There is no programming team at all addressing the instability issues.
<br>
<br>You can still find beta game play and interview videos with the development staff, and compare it with the game today... the grand plans were lost.  Along the way, they abandoned any sense of balancing.  They abandoned their edict of no grinding, and instituted a botting system so you can (have to) leave your game on 24/7 to grind points to build your char.  Instead of breaking the mold, Forsaken World settled into the fold.
<br>
<br>The game content itself has no flow.  When you read a review complaining about the speed of leveling being too quick, it&apos;s because that person just sampled the game over a lunch break, MMOHut style.  Yes, you can fly through 3/4 of the levels, which is almost a must because as a new, low level player, there is nobody who&apos;s going to play with you.  People are online 24/7 (see the botting comment above), but they usually aren&apos;t &quot;there&quot;.  Going from 79-80 (the level cap) is probably going to take you 2 months, if you&apos;re still playing.
<br>
<br>If you are a knowledgeable player, you probably have multiple accounts, and spend hours a day repeating the same solo/auto-path content, every day, only interacting with other people if you want to, certainly not because you need to.
<br>
<br>The in-game economy itself is rigged by people with many accounts, hording wealth, and controlling markets.  Apparently fully supported by PWE, these accounts are not required to hide their activities.
<br>
<br>Final note:  This is FAR from a free game.  Months ago, PWE unveiled the purchaser reward system.  A rank of titles that come with perks, the ranks being entirely based on how much money you&apos;ve put into the game.  Many of the &quot;gifts&quot; associated with these ranks cost money, and system itself provided far too much transparency to who they consider a valued customer.  To acquire the full gambit of what read like baseline paying customer benefits (max bag and storage space, more than 1 character build template) you must spend 3 thousand dollars.  To achieve the top rank of the purchaser rewards, you&apos;re forking out 15 grand.  This level of greed is ridiculous, and you can imagine how vast the power difference this creates is, if you are actually playing for free.
<br>
<br>I have been, and am still playing this game...  when it loads, anyway.  I&apos;ve put a little money into the game, none since the purchaser rewards came out.  When I finally convince my community of friends to play guild wars 2, this game will just be a bump in the road of entertainment history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2828376">Expand</a></span>

There is a lot of content and many things to do. There are 3 main draw backs however. First, the PvP system feel unfinished and very flat. Users will attack other users just for the sake of griefing other users. There is absolutely no risk or reward for PvP. This makes questing on a PvP server close to impossible without a party as a griefer will wait and stalk users until they are busy, then attack them. The second is the dual currency in the game. Certain items cost soul coins or gold coins. Items purchased from NPC&apos;s cost soul coins, but items purchased from other users require gold coins. There is no system to convert between the two. This makes using the auction house almost pointless because the accumulation of gold coins is very rare unless you sell things on the auction house. Users also cannot trade soul coins to help other users out for mounts or other and makes the user and their friends grind more than they need to to enjoy the game.<br>Third, there was some lazy work with both programing/scripting and how they put the world together. There are countless spots in each realm where a player can get completely stuck with no hope of getting out unless they use their teleport ability. If they have used this ability they must wait 10 minutes for the skill the recharge. There are also a lot of lazy blocking volumes where the level builder must have just went &quot;good enough, it kinda works&quot;. The pathing nodes in the game seem very blotchy and placed almost willy nilly around the world. There are also countless quests, auto-routes and NPC Ai that were scripted badly. I have a 23 inch 1080p monitor and when I can&apos;t read the text during the cut-scenes, you have a problem. The cut scenes are not the only thing wrong with the text. With special quests, the man who thought Bright red 8 point font on a bright yellow background should be shot. 90% of people couldn&apos;t read it if their lives depended on it. It was a horrible  decision and takes another huge chunk away from the games polish. For a F2P game based on MTX, this game is lacking in quality and didn&apos;t travel far past an &apos;Idea&apos; of merging guild wars and WoW. Lack of polish and development plagues the game on all angles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694106">Expand</a></span>

FW boasts a random team generating system for entering instances that allows you to quickly and easily acquire higher level equipment and complete higher level quests. There are numerous crafting jobs to engage in and everyone gets a pet, so if that&apos;s your thing I think you should enjoy this game as well. The music, graphics, and gameplay are all generally excellent and the game boasts open PvP servers. The biggest problem with this game is, as people have pointed out, a dearth of money/resources and the strange cash system the game employs. Lower level enemies are also ridiculously high on HP, which results in a series of drawn out and non-threatening (but resource draining) fights. I think FW could be at least a 9 if it would work on reducing the HP of its trash mobs a bit so that quests could be run a little faster ... especially on the PvP servers, where the open PvP makes long quests at one location a foolish waste of time unless you are in a group. I think I should also mention that this game boasts a ton of features that act a double edged sword ... on the one hand, the features are all unique and interesting to explore. On the other hand, if you fail to explore them all you may end up severely gimping yourself and spending long hours wandering about clueless and underpowered. One feature I think FW could definitely do without is Experience Aid. PWI ought to just drop this money sink and make experience slightly easier to come by while reducing the strength of their trash mobs to accommodate faster quest completion and experience gain. All in all, the game deserves an 8. It is solid and generally well designed, but it needs to overhaul its persistent world mobs, experience pace and loot tables to be a top tier game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=1761598">Expand</a></span>

But let&apos;s get back to PWE&apos;s greed. in the boutique there are some mounts and pets available for a low price, but if you really want the good looking pets and mounts you need luck, lots of luck. They are in so called orbs, if you open an orb you have a small chance to win the mount or pet, and that chance, is very small, about 0,1%, so you need many luck, or many orbs to win this mount or pet. there are many complains about this, but PWE simply ignores this and try to suck more money out of its players. Conclusion: If you&apos;re looking for a nice F2P game, and you don&apos;t want to spend money on it, or just a very small amount, DON&apos;T CHOOSE FORSAKEN WORLD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2714658">Expand</a></span>

Load crashing ruins your daily instance runs such as GT and GL. Also ruins arena score. Known issue, has never been fixed. Auction house search crash. Known issue, has never been fixed. Why worry about botting? When it&#x2019;s built into the game. No really, you can bot in this game, and its perfectly ok to run multiple clients and do so. Horrible idea. Cash shoppers are much more powerful. You can &#x201C;farm&#x201D; gems and gold to upgrade for years.. or just spend $1000-$5000 and destroy everyone. No level limit on armor quality, fortify level, or gem strength makes lower level pvp a cash shopper only arena. Rift is the same allowing only major cash shopped guilds to bid. Very poor balance. 12v12 is the only random team pvp, but the rewards take months if not a year for War God set. Most of the time its filled with cash shoppers that make it very unfair and annoying. Wrath is annoying during pvp and forces you to collect yellow balls like you&#x2019;re playing Pacman mid duels and fights. PvE is repetitive and very boring. Same quest every day. Very slow, boring and I found myself falling asleep and botting everything. Game has less and less players The skills are allll the same on every type of talent tree. Example, Ice Mage, Fire Mage, Wind Mage all use the same basic skills. Graphics are decent, but the game is CPU heavy (core i7@3.7ghz) and doesnt even warm my gtx 560ti. If you max graphics you crash everyone other screen. If you lower them, you crash less often, but still experience frame skip and need to reload client to refresh corrupted data. Tech support is the worst ever. The community is foul, unpleasant and childish. I have played Ferentus, Dialbo series, Guild Wars, and many MMO&#x2019;s. This is by far the most cash hungry company that I have ever seen and suggest to check the BBB rating of F before ever spending a dime of giving them any of your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3047961">Expand</a></span>

PWE put up an advertisement for a Bogo that people were sure to spend a lot of money on, then they waited right until the weekend, before the event is supposed to end, then they turn off the servers, leave the players in suspense, and then announce a rollback, with little to no chance of any one who spent that $XXX amount getting their money back. So, that money now belongs to PWE, and you got stuck with Zen a lot were hesitant or weren&apos;t even going to buy. Let&apos;s make it more clearly:
<br>29th of March to the 1st of April:
<br>1) 10&apos;s of thousands of dollars profit, if not hundreds of thousands
<br>2) Player base excited
<br>3) Biggest server population in over a year
<br>4) Players exploring aspects of the game that were otherwise out of their progression level
<br>
<br>1st April:
<br>1) Huge amount of downtime
<br>2) Huge criticism via forums
<br>3) 90% of player base requesting game stay as it is without rollback
<br>4) Rollback announced
<br>5) Compensation (or as some call it a &quot;bribe&quot;) in way of bound items that have no use to many
<br>6) Quitting posts popping up left right and center and or people vowing to never spend a cent on PWE games again
<br>7) Extremely Unhappy Player base
<br>8) Important feedback being ignored and irrelevant questions being answered vaguely
<br>9) Extremely Angry Player base.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ve been warned.

The classes are great, but the guys act a bit feminine in the character creation, but nothing too major. The idea of jobs is very useful, but almost a second thought to me, up to making armour.   The game is almost to easy in the sense of the auto-route, but i still think that the game was worth the play.

The worst part came when my account was banned.  I had not logged in for a month or more.  I tried to figure out why I was banned, and they took forever to respond to a customer support email.  Their website is TERRIBLE.  If you need assistance for being banned, good luck.  They tell you to report it in their support system, yet you need to log in to use it and, no surprise being banned prevents you from logging in.  I was eventually allowed back on.  I changed my password and a week later was banned again without logging back on after the incident.  I have no idea what this company is playing at, yet the forums are filled with people complaining about being banned the same as I after purchasing in-game cash.  I would suggest avoiding this game, especially if you want to purchase items.  The whole thing seemed incredibly shady and underhanded to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2281549">Expand</a></span>

I tried later with more patience, and I notice few good chance, but still quitted after sometime to the issues with money and still its extreme slow pace. Now, i&apos;ve been playing this game for a longer than than usual, and even though it&apos;s still extremely slow I really did like its change. First of all, I liked the fact that at each level the game gives you some tickets in order to get some free stuff from a different shop, which sells small helpfull items and, hard to believe, money too, making the issues of training and the mount, for instance, extremely easy to pass. Also, first time i tried this game, the leveling was EXTREMELY slow (as any f2p, anyway), but now the game gives you more exp (I think triple more exp than before, but I might be wrong sometimes), and in other words it&apos;s much easier to level up now...at some points (it still takes a lot of time, just not like before, I guess). Basically, this game became a lot more accesible than before, at least by me, and as an old WoW player I must say I&apos;m enjoying this game more than long ago, even though it&apos;s slow paced, flawed on the technical side, many bug issues (especially since Nightfall patch), and still lots of paid content to get. I suggest to try it if you&apos;re bored of others MMORPGs, or else you won&apos;t get much from it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2502039">Expand</a></span>

Other than that, it is very cookie-cutter, being similar to many MANY MMOs before it.  It is hardly different from Perfect World and emulates plenty of similar games.  The graphics are good, but I also am not a fan of how the characters look, most of the males being incredibly feminine.  There is nothing I hate more than comparing a game I&apos;m reviewing to a popular yet unrelated game, but this game really is like a free version of World of Warcraft.  Under most circumstances, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, but if you are a fan of WoW or similar games heavily based on grinding and hunting, it might be worth a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730954">Expand</a></span>

You WILL be wasting your time with this game.<br>Unfortunately the design of the game is such that you will be very uncomfortable playing it without the mouse controls being inverted, if you are someone that uses such controls.  The designers, in their arrogance, refuse to implement the option.  I&apos;m not 100% sure exactly how long it takes to add such an option to this kind of game, but from others that claim they are developers, state that such an option takes minutes to implement.  Should this be true, or even if it isn&apos;t, it is still absolutely unforgivable to not have this option, after so many years have passed where even the simplest of games have this option available.  From time on the messageboards it has come across that there are absolutely no plans to implement this option.<br>From there comes another point, the player base is atrocious as well.  Should you go on the messageboards to ask about the inverted mouse, or read about it, the responses are vile, and completely rude.  While having messageboards full of trolls and rude people is nothing new, the odds responses were in an overwhelming majority of negative and harsh.  I enjoyed hearing that inverted mouse gamers are in the minority, and therefore it isn&apos;t important to add an inverted mouse option.  These gamers being in the minority may or may not be true, and I&apos;m curious where the poster would get this information, or are they perhaps pulling it out of their rear end, like many of their responses seem to be originating.<br><br>The game itself COULD be promising, but at the same time has an art style that is definitely not to my taste.  I personally have never been a fan of making your males look as feminine as possible, but this is definitely one of THOSE games.  Granted the developer seems to be out of China, which could explain why the males tend to generally be white, and feminine, since anime, which also originates from that section of the world(more so Japan...), favors feminine, white males.<br>Otherwise, it&apos;s very colorful, but if you aren&apos;t a fan of anime or that graphical design, you&apos;re not going to be a fan here.  I personally don&apos;t mind anime stylings, as long as the males are overwhelmingly feminine, as the males are exactly that way here.  Unless you&apos;re a dwarf... or a stoneman(?).<br><br>All in all, when the graphics aren&apos;t pleasing, the controls are atrocious, you have the makings of a terrible review.  When the developers are basically giving the finger to a large section of their player base(aka the inverted mouse users), I feel obliged to give one right back, and therein lies the basis for this score, a big --&gt;1</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=2297178">Expand</a></span>

For one the control scheme is not very intuitive. Having to constantly rotate the camera with the right mouse button in order to turn my  character is rather awkward when I&apos;d much rather be able to move left and right with WASD. Another major issue I have is with the respawn rate. Now I already  have issues with MMOs making me feel like my impact on the game world is non-existent, but this is really driven home the enemies literally respawn seconds after I&apos;ve killed them. At least in WoW it takes a good 5-10 minutes before they&apos;ll respawn.  This is pretty much just a first impression review, but from that first impression I&apos;d say there are many areas where this game could use some improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171268">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Recycled graphics for monsters, bosses and NPCs
<br>-Getting max lvl in 6 months and then its just a grind of doing the same things over and over again
<br>-PvP is heavily Cash Shop orientated
<br>-Cash Shop is severely unbalanced and there are no restrictions in attempt to balance it
<br>-Game is actually quite boring  lack of lore, an up to date WiKi
<br>
<br>In the end its a typical game from PWE, where they use it as a Cash Cow before they move onto their next venture.
<br>
<br>Free 2 Play  yes. Free 2 enjoy  not at all.
<br>
<br>With the recently screw ups it seems on every weekend, mostly due to the lack of staff and their actual ability to run a game without, the playerbase is now also dead. So it leaves nothing for new players looking to join and play this game.

<br>However... Sometimes You can get lost in features of this game  that&apos;s not a negative... if You can get back on track and grasp what&apos;s going on, but You&apos;ll be sure to feel a bit lost for some time.
<br>Quests are generic but to be fair... that&apos;s to be expected.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is not bad, but it did not manage to keep me interested.
<br>But if You think it&apos;s something for You and You have some times to waste- give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3152377">Expand</a></span>

<br>But it is a nice place to hang out if your a game addict or like having it in the background and bot until ur ready to dgn dive. It is also visually lovely to look at as it opted for a 18th century age of exploration kind of fantasy feel. I like it  but mostly becasue the people that occupy my chosen server are pretty fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3636166">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Expect to be pulled in by the challenging, but not too difficult PVE environment. If there is anything worth complaining about regarding this game it is that the management has changed a few times, resulting in poorly executed maintenance issues. Highly recommended for anyone who is into flashy appearance combat MMO&apos;s (those character wings are just gorgeous!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/forsaken-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=5080940">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>-very p2w. all the cool stuff is behind a paywall, and at high levels you pretty much have to spend money in the cash shop on gear to even be able to dish out the dps you need.
<br>-auction house runs on different currency then you get from quests/mobs (still dunno where to get the ah currency from ) which makes the currency you get from questing feel much less useful. There is gear that you can buy with it early on but you end up leveling past that gear very fast at the beginning anyways.
<br>-fast leveling is a curse not a blessing: you level extremely fast in this game because the devs want you to become &quot;invested&quot; into your character enough that when they hit ya with the pay wall at end game for gear , you&apos;re more likely to pay .
