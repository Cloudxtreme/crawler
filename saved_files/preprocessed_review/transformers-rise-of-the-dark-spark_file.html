<br>
<br>The good:
<br>The game models looks as expected from a title like this
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>On hard difficulty the game is nearly unplayable, Poor design choice when it comes to map and enemies can make it hard to spot enemies, even at longer range there is pop-in of enemies of the smaller variety, as you will often find yourself dying to seemingly nothing a bunch of times, without any warning or ability to tell where the damage came from as the enemies spawn behind you and give you no indication of them doing so. This is the only game I have ever quit out of frustration, as the harder difficulty can not have been playtested at all. This seems rushed and there was no reason for the game to come out in this state. Some animations in-game are at what looks like 30 fps. So you will be following a AI companion and they will jitterly move forward as a result of only running at a peasant frame rate while as you run as a masterrace frame rate.
<br>
<br>The game overall feels rushed and unfinnished, some cutscenes are in nice ingame render while others are in what looks like 2002 video renders of the game in terrible low quality all pixelated and grainy. It has some charm, but previous titles in the series were better. This is not one of Edge of Reality&apos;s stronger titles unfortunately.
<br>
<br>I would suggest Edge of Reality stick to what they know best and that is growing potatoes for peasants.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4297841">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re a Transformers fan from the War for Cybertron series by High Moon Studios, you may feel compelled to purchase this, as it is seemingly the same style. First and foremost, it is not done by the same studio, rather, Edge of Reality was in charge, with High Moon not attached whatsoever. To get to the grit of the review, this game was lacking in all aspects. The story was short, boring, and felt much more like a chore than something truly worth playing. The story was cut up multiple times to tell the paths of both the Decepticons and Autobots while they fought on Cybertron and subsequently, on Earth. It was convoluted and dull to boot, giving you no real attachment to their plight, or really anything at all. As you could tell from the cover of the game, Michael Bay&apos;s universe inspires the Earth versions of the Transformers, with Grimlock of the Dinobots stealing the show and having the most truly joyful section of the game, albeit it was only 20 minutes long, tops. The graphics were something you&apos;d expect from an early PS3 release (circa 10 years ago), aside from the top notch character models they took from High Moons work. The Earth levels were unbelievably barren, with noticeable lack of any real substance to the world around the corridors the game was forcing you in. You wanted to explore, given that there are collectibles, but the game was very adamant about pointing you in a direction and sticking you to it. The boring gameplay, on top of the almost jarring difficulty spikes, made the single-player very passable. However, the semi-redeeming factor to this game was the return of the co-op mode, Escalation. In this mode, you fight up to 15 waves of enemies, getting progressively harder, though consistently showing less and less balance and substance to the mode. Enemies would spawn in droves from one location across the map, only to be split up once you arrived to somewhere else. You unlock Gear Boxes as you play in Escalation, as well as campaign, to which you unlock different characters to play as in Escalation, new guns, upgrades, H.A.C.K.s (difficulty settings that altered specific game mechanics in exchange for an experience boost), and Techs (smaller, less powerful abilities that could help you out of a pinch in battle or even offer you up to 6x multiplier on experience), all used to increase the customization of your experience throughout single and multiplayer. While the collection aspect is fun at first, it quickly becomes frustrating after receiving dozens of duplicates, while coming to terms that your favorite Transformer is near crippled in Escalation if it cannot fly, given that you have the option to be whomever you wish. Trophy wise, I could give it a 3/10 difficulty, and as a game I would say it&apos;s about a 6.2. Nothing really pops out story wise, and the graphics leave much to be desired, but my nostalgia as a Transformers fan helped me enjoy the sheer site of these beasts back in action, as well as the arsenal from the Cybertron series coming back in full force to blast the enemy to scrap. Verdict: wait for pre-owned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4307771">Expand</a></span>

The story is strong, (yet admittedly somewhat not expressed that way in the cutscenes) and moments such as playing as an almost youthful Jetfire and seeing the evolution of Prime throughout the ages (not to mention playing as Grimlock, that was very cool)
<br>
<br>This game sits nicely in style half way between War for Cybertron and Dark of the Moon, yet does feel significantly more like a shooting gallery than previous Transformers titles by the same company. But still, I believe this is a must buy for any Transformers fan, young or old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4348996">Expand</a></span>

Upon hearing the news that HMS would no longer be behind the helm of this particularly game I was a little hopeful.
<br>
<br>&quot;But slumpy&quot; you may ask &quot;you loved those two games, why would you wish that?&quot;
<br>
<br>To which I would answer: Because HMS made terrible ports to the PC, quite frankly, they did not seem to care much at all about that particular platform. The result was a REALLY good multiplayer game (the campaigns are decent in both games, but for me, it was all about TDM) mired in a buggy mess, never to be rectified because HMS abandons their games the minute they&apos;re released. War/Fall of Cybertron are both disastrously programmed for the PC, communities infested by hackers (one of few legitimate cases of the hacker infestation reputation actually being true) and hopelessly half assed match making systems that are just as likely to fail as they are to find a game....
<br>
<br>And yet... A community, a strong one surrounded those games. As bad as they were, I quite loved them, played them extensively and remain a player in FoC to this day. So it saddened me when I discovered that Edge of Reality were removed the competitive multiplayer modes and instead focusing only on the campaign and escalation game types.
<br>
<br>Well, the campaign, just isn&apos;t as engaging as the first two games, and frankly, it doesn&apos;t look nearly as interesting as FoC&apos;s campaign. There&apos;s nothing terribly wrong with it, per se, but it doesn&apos;t stack up, making this, ultimately, a disappointing title... With not much to offer in the Multiplayer department, I can&apos;t give this game more than a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4886525">Expand</a></span>

<br>Transformer: Rise of the Dark Spark is a disappointment. It is not as good as the first game .but there is still have some good things about the game. It has a variety of characters and weapons in this game too. The immediate switching from a car to transformer is also very cool, but it is not something impressing because this is not something new.
<br>But, the problems is that the campaign is not long enough, the graphics and the texture is very bad (If you are looking forward to a next-gen game then don&apos;t buy this one). I personally find the last one has even a better graphics. Conversation between character suddenly stop because it is interrupted by loading screen. Quite a lot of unnecessary checkpoint. It don&apos;t have a lot of new features. Most come from previous game.
<br>This game is $49.99 and it is absolutely overpriced in my opinion. It again show how greedy Activision is. If you want to try this game out wait until the price drops.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294382">Expand</a></span>

I liked the game but I think the crossover of  the movie and the previous game didn&#xB4;t match. When I played the last level in Fall of Cybertron I wondered immediately of what was going to happen in the next game. For example if I didn&#xB4;t watched the Transformers 4 I wouldn&#xB4;t even know who is Lockdown, because it&#xB4;s objective is different from the game to the movie. I think they should have made two different games, but I actually liked the game, despite some problems with the crossover.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4396899">Expand</a></span>
