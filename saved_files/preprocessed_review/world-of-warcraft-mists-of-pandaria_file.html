New class - &quot;yeah! let&apos;s make it overpowered and nerf all the other classes, so every raid must have a monk!&quot; The glitches from previous expansions still aren&apos;t fixed - when gathering quest items, You still have a chance that mobs won&apos;t drop it for 1h, eventually dropping more than needed in quest. Personal loot tables? Yeah, right... LFR = no loot at all, 10/25man - there still is a chance that boss will drop something for a class/spec that isn&apos;t even in the raid group! Too bad Blizzard again serves us reheated meat instead of cooking something new, especially when Guild Wars 2 showed how new MMORPG should look like. It seems like Blizz just want to make MMORPG for casuals - easier talent trees, &quot;legendary weapon for all&quot; and expanding LFR (item upgrades coming in 5.1) so that players won&apos;t cry when their items will have Raid Finder addition in tooltip and giving purple items for everyone - now raid level items from quests! Guild Wars 2 - new, fresh look at MMORPG and questing/grinding playstyle, WoW: MoP - the same things that was in earlier expansions, but made easier for casual players, and not so rewarding and demanding like, in example, ICC/Ulduar - for semi- and full hardcore players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728369">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>World of Warcraft has a special place in my heart, and I was thrilled by the original, Burning Crusade too, but then it started to loose it&apos;s self, and this expansion only proves the point.</span>

WoW has devolved into a rep grind.

Other than that, the story arc is the same as the last 2 expansions: 1. New world is discovered, 2. Alliance and Horde compete for colonization, 3. A great evil awakens to threaten the very fabric of existence, and 4. Blizzard takes a year rolling out the content to save the world in 2 to 4 content patches before they announce another expansion to reset the cycle. Do not buy! You won&apos;t have time to enjoy this game unless you are unemployed and on welfare.

In the end the game became nothing more than a grind that is even worse than Cataclysm at level 90.  The amount of dailies you will have to do, even after the nerfs to rep needed, will be quite high.  These dailies will take you quite a bit of time and will help you eventually get some epic gear to raid with.  But the problem isn&apos;t so much that as it is the talent system being once again revamped to an even more handheld version of its former self, the overly instanced world of warcraft, and CRZ zones which pretty much turns all zones into random groups of people who just compete for your stuff.  It isn&apos;t an improvement on the game, but rather a step back.  Sure there are more dungeons and heroics to level in and get nice loot, but it is all the same thing with new skins and set pieces to come crashing through on your aggressive romp to end game.  The farming btw is also heavily gated since you need rep with the tillers and not to mention you have to wait a day til you can even grow anything.  Honestly this annoys me.  I have no interest in playing pokemon as well.  So what do I do?  I try the Scenarios to check out this new type of content and am let down yet again.  These are essentially the older group quests but mobs have more health and can overwhelm you, if you die you just graveyard zerg back and try again.  The challenge of this game in learning to play it and become good at it are by and large so far gone it is painful to try and remember what it once was.  I say don&apos;t buy this.  In fact don&apos;t ever support Blizzard again because at this point it is so blatantly obvious they are milking this game it is a wonder the community hasn&apos;t rioted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2684504">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t worth 15USD every month or paying for the Battlechest + Mist of Pandaria if you could get a lot of fun from other games that are cheaper and interesting (like GTAV, COD, GW2, etc.). For a game that is supposed to fell like a MMO it fells like a Facebook game.
<br>The story line is really childish focused on young audience, I don&apos;t even recommend it for young children because of the addictive level the game has. So far, the worst game to play right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2659997">Expand</a></span>

If you thought Cata was bad, wait until you see Pandaria!  This game might be ok for very small children due to it&apos;s extreme simplicity, ease of play, and cartoony graphics....... if it wasn&apos;t for the vile community.   They somehow managed to dumb down the talent trees even further, taking all thought out of character development.   Graphics and gear are a joke.  Gameplay is still slow and sluggish, and feels outdated.   Out of everything bad about this expansion, the Pandas have to be the worst part.  They look ridiculous.  Even in a game full of ridiculous creatures, the Pandas stand out as being overwhelmingly childish and lame.  There are so many better mmos out there, and a lot of them are free.  There is no reason to pay $15 a month for this horrible game anymore.

<br>Save your money!  It&apos;s almost like the business model for this expansion and WOW is the same as the big tobacco companies.  The whole point of this expansion is to bring in really young players to try and replace the older player base.  There is nothing new with the game.  The first quest I did I flew in a copter and had to kill 60 mobs....but there was only one option.  Press the number one every 4 seconds while the thing drove itself.  No other choices to make but repeatedly pressing the number 1 for 10 minutes.  It was clearly designed for a little kid.  This is really sad too.  Having been  a Warcraft player since Orcs and Humans in the 90&apos;s I got this out of almost pure habit.  I should have saved my money.  Not worth $15 a month.  This game barely could hold its own in the Free to Play category.  It was a good run.

The game has become a simplistic MMO that requires very little time and effort to play, which is not what I&apos;m looking for. A dumbing down of a genre is what were seeing here.</span>

What used to be unique and interesting classes have been made really dull to play. The talent and ingenuity that was once the WoW dev team have moved to other projects, and there is nothing now that makes the game fun. While they obviously have a talented design team, the overall final product is lackluster.
<br>
<br>MoP was created only for the intent of making as much $ as possible by appealing to the lowest common denominator because the game life cycle has less time ahead compared to what has past.
<br>
<br>As a result you get stupid Pandas, pokemon pet battles, and other silly nonsense that killed the uniqueness of the game. There is nothing fun about MoP. You just get a gaggle of simplistic crap with a few new character models.
<br>
<br>I have been playing since 2005, and MoP offers nothing to an otherwise fun game. Blizzard is not the quality company that it once was. I didn&apos;t want to bother with Diablo 3 after the real $ auction house came online. I just found that trifling, and the desire to go higher levels into the game was not there.
<br>
<br>I think I am done with Blizzard, been fun 1997-2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2652943">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, you&apos;d think blizzard - with hundreds of millions in revenue, near a decade of running an MMO ... would they know how to design and run one?  It&apos;s falling apart, it&apos;s like they want to destroy it.   I didn&apos;t think there could be a step down from Cata, but there IS.  And Mists of Pandaria - is it.

In it, he talks about changes that individuals felt were necessary, but wound up contributing to his game&apos;s ultimate decline and demise. That dev was Dan Rubenfield, writing about the NGE patch for Star Wars: Galaxies. Now, 5.0 wasn&apos;t on the level of NGE, but over the years, things have begun to accumulate that make me question the necessity. The most obvious is the talent point system. Mechanically, it works and I understand why they did it. It is actually nice to be &apos;viable&apos; regardless of the spec you choose. However, A) you are making choices for your character every 20 levels as opposed to every 2 levels, taking a lot out of the feeling of excitement for levelling up.  B) oftentimes it is difficult to decide not because things are so good, but because nothing really appeals to you.  C) the change did absolutely nothing to get rid of cookie cutter builds.  D) things are seriously, seriously unbalanced - it&apos;s like they didn&apos;t listen to the beta testers. Another terrible decision was the inclusion of Cross Realm Zones (CRZ). Currently these only affect pre-MoP areas, but they have introduced a host of new bugs and issues, including lag spikes which crash your connection and auto-dismount when crossing zone borders. I play on a full server, and I was blown away when I learned I would have to share space with not only people from my server, but at least 5 other high population servers! Quest mobs are constantly camped, and on pvp servers there is constant ganking by high level players. Absolutely terrible decision. You now get Valor Points for dailies, which on the surface seems like a possibly good change, until you realize rewards for running heroic dungeons are cut in half, and you can only get full rewards once a day.  This essentially means daily quests are mandatory, forever.  I am not able to play 24/7, so the idea of doing 30+ daily quests every day really turns me off.  Anyway, this review isn&apos;t so much about Pandaria as it is about the changes that came out in 5.0. I struggled with scoring it because content wise, MoP is ok if a bit lackluster. There wasn&apos;t anything that blew my mind in MoP like there was in previous expansions, and the &quot;new features&quot; (pet battles, scenarios) feel tacked on. You will run 4 dungeons while levelling 85-90, then find only 2 new, heroic-only dungeons at 90 (the rest are heroic versions of vanilla dungeons - ugh).  I don&apos;t like to be a &apos;sky is falling&apos; type person, but the only thing that can kill WoW is WoW itself, and dammit, they&apos;re trying.  I don&apos;t believe I will be renewing my subscription.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2644149">Expand</a></span>

Oh I know! How about we take away good story elements (or any story for that matter), refuse to innovate more on the game play and reduce areas of content just a bit so that we are giving less and less (I will get into that in a bit) people might say I haven&apos;t played it enough since it was mainly just beta that I was most likely to have played, but,, for now, i&apos;m talking about content, and there really isn&apos;t a lot in this game. From what I understand, there is no new world BG, Tol&apos;Barard was horrible because it had nothing different or new about it, it was basically AB but dumbed down to a game with literally a few strategies that people couldn&apos;t understand (at least on my server) just mass attack one place while defending the other in a repeating cycle. Also, this game seems to have no story, so you would thing that they would add more or better BGs right? Well only 2, and they aren&apos;t anything too new in terms of other games that have come out, mine cart garding, really? Whats next blizzard? Oooh ooh, kill confirmed? How about a Co Op mode where you fight zombies or robots? I know i&apos;m kind of being a d*ck at this point, but really, there is nothing new and to make matters worse, you are getting less from the expansion, this wouldn&apos;t be so bad if it had an epic PVE story mode, but I have yet to find something intriguing. I think the biggest flaw since cata was creative designing,,,, where the hell is it? Everything since Cata feels like anything good stripped down to something extremely basic yet so bad that improving it wouldn&apos;t really make the core game play (Like TB) any better, it would just be masking it. I&apos;m also rating it on the fact that I can&apos;t even install the freaking optimization patch, i get internet errors from blizzard telling me to check my connection, I have, and guess what, I&apos;m fine, my friend is having the same problem, we both got good rigs and good internet, today the download  bar moved to 0.5 before giving me this error, that only took a week... Look,,, iv&apos;e been playing WoW since Burning Crusade, I was one of the first people on my server when it was starting, I have enjoyed WotLK because it had brought in cool new mechanics, but when Cata came, the quests were good in my opinion but the raiding and the dungeons were terrible, they started recycling more dungeons from the past to improvise extra stuff, we have been on a decline on brand new dungeons/raids/arena maps/Bgs since cata, we are paying 15 bucks a month and 40 dollars for each expansion that brings less and less, this needs to stop blizzard, stop being so high and mighty, and listen to your players.... Have a good one...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2645943">Expand</a></span>

Because I dont play games that consider waiting in queues for more than an hour to be the best way to gate content.    Thats not acceptable and every 10 mins of waiting lowers the score I give the game by 1.  So...  4 it is.</span>

<br>I really enjoyed classic and tbc, ive found wotlk a so-so expansion, cata an immense letdown, and pandazz... i feel pandaz is just the right expansion to quit wow.
<br>The main problem is that Blizzard at a point decided that they were going for the masses,they decided they just wanted to focus on kids with easy content and uber power ranger armors, streamlined abilities, purple epazzz for anyone, and the dictat that every player must be special, making ofc everyone plain normal.
<br>I can understand that, game industry is business ofc, anyway they sadly ruined a great game.
<br>Leveling is plain stupid since wotlk, there is never a single challenge, its boring and it gives zero satisfaction.
<br>Everyone hate leveling in wow, Blizzard instead of makin it more challening and epic, they think that to make it more interesting it must be super fast and super easy.. damnz just stop with leveling maybe ?
<br>The idea that the game starts at end level and prior to that its just a boring rush, has been implemented by blizzard itself, thats crazy.
<br>Really i think there are not anymore gamers at blizzard developing games, there are economists in Blizzard developing games, this is the main problem.
<br>PvP in wow has always been not very balanced, uber geared ppl having fun in razing no geared ppl in bgs, world pvp has been completely murdered with fly mounts, and i cant get why Blizzard continued to allow pvp gear in pve and vice-versa which always created a lot of issues, especially pve players forced to play pvp to get specific rewards to go on easier in pve.
<br>The addition of fly mounts and million of portals since TBC ruined totally the sense of multiplayer ,as if you are out of the actual content zones or the main city, you will basically play alone and will not see any other player around.
<br>Actually in wow there is not anymore the feeling of doing something epic, any item/mount is rare just for 1 or 2 month at best, anyone can do anything with little or no effort.
<br>Maybe the player base wants that, a Kung Fu Panda toon nice and funny, nonsense pet nice and funny combat, new hairstyles, super huge shoulders, lore and quests funny and stupid, LFR to make every raid a cake, basically all things appealing for kids and console gamers.
<br>Wow can go on with this formula i guess even another 10 years maybe, but its not more wow, its just a dumbed down version of itself.
<br>Tbh i could write 20 pages of reasons why wow turned from a great game to a piece of garbage, but i stop here.
<br>I can say vanilla wow stays at civilization II like pandaz stays at farmville, Go Bli$$ard earn more cash!
<br>Adios WOW it has been fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2648368">Expand</a></span>

You would pay every single coin you got in your bank if they gave us back the first WoW game... this one is not WoW in my opinion and it&apos;s never going to be WoW again. WoW kept you addicted for YEARS and you would feckin love it. In 2005 you just need the World of Warcraft Classic and nothing else for your PC. It would take you MONTHS to level up your character and HOURS to earn money for good gear. THAT WAS REALISTIC. You can&apos;t describe it in words. If you didn&apos;t try the WoW Classic, Burning Crusade or Lich King you just missed the biggest chance you could ever have in this world. You couldn&apos;t get enough. I&apos;m not a nerd :D but that game was not just a MONSTER, it was a BEAST... why? Because this game was full fun in a way it couldn&apos;t stop... it just couldn&apos;t. People were hangin around pups and drinking beer together, they were hanging around the mountains doing quests at night and eating food together.. they were communicating in a way you couldn&apos;t explain. It was good addiction. The game was FULL of gear and stuff. You could even be a workaholic because you need the money that bad to buy gear, mounts, food and much more. I loved this game. They every SINGLE detail of this game from start to scratch. That&apos;s why it isn&apos;t WoW in my opinion anymore. Why remove something your customers actually liked? Why not develope what they already pay for... the LOVE it... it&apos;s great. They just created an entire new game and called it WoW but that&apos;s not the game we once liked... that&apos;s just a totally new product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2651313">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Your time and money is better spent elsewhere. Blizzard once again continues to dumb down their franchises while gouging $ out of their customers. The setting is awful and the class changes are even worse. It is clear that the talent truly has left Blizzard and all they care about is making money. It is sad to see that a company that was once the best in the industry has fallen so hard.</span>

<br>Even the reviews on various forums, including the Battle.net forums, are full of harsh criticism for certain features that the development team forced on their customers. And in typical the fashion of Blizzard Entertaiment, all of the negative criticism is being ignored by the company. All in all, I give this expansion &amp; the development team at Blizzard Entertainment a 2/10 for their effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2645749">Expand</a></span>

Right off the bat you can tell that this expansion was designed with one goal in mind: Damage control. It is in it&apos;s entirety seems to have been produced only to attempt to recuperate subscribers. Tons of childish memes, Farmville, and a poor Pokemon rip-off don&apos;t help their case for a very serious title.    Also the fact that this game has yet to UPDATE IT&apos;S GRAPHICS, is really awful. If you&apos;re playing a race from The Burning Crusade and below, your character literally looks like it has been ported off of Nintendo 64. Quite frankly, the disparity between expansion graphics is astoundingly large, with each subsequent race appearing better than the next. I would also like to point out that most of, if not all the animations are shared, and rip-offs of animations that had already been in the game prior.    One of the worst features of all has got to be the sheer simplification of the game. The removal of most of what made &apos;WoW&apos;, &apos;WoW&apos; has had a profound effect on the game. Everything is literally handed to you on a silver platter. Gear, gold, you name it. It&apos;s yours. All you have to do is wait. Minimal effort, maximum reward.  Talents are literally must picks. As there may be smaller amounts to choose from, the obvious dps increase, or heal increase, or mitigation talents are stupid obvious in terms of picking, leading to little or no care for learning how your class actually functions.    On top of all that, recent features have given way to a near unplayable game. CRZ, or &apos;Cross Realm Zones&apos; has allowed servers to group based on population deficiencies. However, it sounds great in theory, but what was supposed to make the world feel more alive, has actually contributed to it&apos;s downfall. Zones literally overlap, and if you&apos;re an unfortunate soul on a PvE or RP server, you&apos;re currently grouped with PvP servers. Do the math, you&apos;re pretty much fair game. If you&apos;re on a PvP server initially, have fun questing. As random ganking was the norm back in WoW&apos;s hay-day, World PvP has devolved into a 24/7 gank fest reminiscent of a private server. This unfortunate circumstance has lead to a near unplayable situation for those under level cap on PvP servers.    In closing, I recommend those who view these reviews DO NOT purchase Mists of Pandaria, or even WoW as a whole if you can help it. The game has sadly devolved into too much of a mess. So much so that it&apos;s almost as if Blizzard could care less about their own game, so much as you just keep paying and don&apos;t mind the awfulness around you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2645745">Expand</a></span>

Problems with logging in to loading screens taking 5 mins to load to getting stuck questing.  Now I feel blizzard is intentionally making the game a chore to play rather than enjoyable.  NO FLYING IN MOP?!?!?! wth.  I feel like I&apos;m being punished by Blizzard.  I play a shaman, a class that has always been in the mid to bottom of the pack in pve.  I&apos;m sorry Blizzard, though MOP looks nice and interesting, the overwhelming feeling that you are punishing me for playing is why I decided to create this account on metacritic and give you this bad review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2646328">Expand</a></span>

<br>Blizzard used to be a company of gamers making fun games for gamers. Instead, now it has become a soulless extension of Activision and is failing to deliver any fun.</span>

Just what everyone was afraid of. Dumbed down talent systems, click-to-start/win everything, bringing in a species as the titular characters which doesn&apos;t fit in the game at all (they were intended as easter eggs and minor characters in Warcraft 3). A few days before this game&apos;s announcement, an employee said they would never include pandas in games, they only see them to be in comics and mangas. Well, it looks like they found out where the game is the most profitable (Asians) and they decided to make it look like as much as the asian culture as they could (Great Wall, pandas of course, the music). The only problem is, almost no one is happy about the changes (Asians included). I mean, the Deus Ex games and Tomb Raider 2 are among my favorite games, and they are influenced by asian cultures a lot, but, again, it simply doesn&apos;t fit Warcraft at all. Blizzard, it&apos;s a shame how much you let money take over this franchise and (as much as I am ashamed to say this) I hope WoW dies as soon as possible, because this game is starting to be like the exact opposite of the original WoW. Activision, I remember when you published quality games like Jedi Outcast 10 years ago, since then, most of your games are equal to pure crap. You also let yourself to be a money-hungry company and it&apos;s obvious your hand is in this, too. If you listen to me, don&apos;t buy this game if you&apos;re still playing. Go to another MMO, go to a Vanilla/TBC private realm, do whatever you want, just avoid this game like the plague.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2647331">Expand</a></span>

This was the smoothest expansion launch in the history of WoW, no lag, no server crashes, no wait-list to log on. If you had an active account and logged on during the prior month then you already had patch 5.0 installed and upgrading via digital purchase would only take about a minute to patch the game.The expansion quest line starts out with a really cartoon-ish looking cut-scene. WoW has always been cartoon-ish, but this was extra cartoon-ey. The voice-acting had lots of emotion but was very Saturday morning cartoon-like. Thankfully, once you get past the first couple of quests the game is more Asian themed with nice meditative Zen-like music than cartoon-ey. The pandas are cute in a &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; kind of way, with their big bellies and loving to eat and drink beer. Even the evil witch Panda you meet in the first zone looks really cute and cuddly. But the graphics of the Pandas and the scenery look really well done. For better or worse, this feels like a completely different game than earlier WoW expansions. Most of the quests are your standard WoW quests, talk to an NPC read a bunch of text (or ignore it if you want lol) and go collect stuff, kill stuff talk to other NPCs, etc. The bombing quest you do at the start seemed really dumbed down from previous expansions. I&apos;ve come across at least two instances where there were too many players and things weren&apos;t spawning fast enough and I had to compete with same-faction players for item nodes. I&apos;ve heard some guildies also complaining about the same thing in other zones I have yet to visit and one even logged off in frustration being unable to complete her quest due to to many players being around, this is unusual for Blizzard usually the stuff spawns more frequently when there are more players around, but they seemed to have it tuned too low this expansion. Some of the questing bosses do not have tagging so you can cooperate to kill them with other players, but not most stuff. I&apos;ve come across quite a few evasion bugs where you attack something and it starts evading you for no reason, normally I wouldn&apos;t mention it but since people are cutting other games up for bugs often on Metacritic I&apos;ll mention it here. There was also a bugged boss in a regular dungeon where we had to quit the instance because we couldn&apos;t continue. I&apos;m sure Blizzard will fix these things over the next month or so though. Questing is still fairly linear but less so than Cataclysm. The best way is to describe it as a tree, where you start out doing a linear quest chain (trunk) but later it splits and you choose between 3 quest hubs (branches) to do in what ever order you want. There is no flying in Pandaria until level 90 cap, feels weird at first but you get used to it after a bit.I&apos;ve run two regular dungeons. The aesthetics are very nice. The boss fights are interesting, you have to dodge spinning water spouts, jump into bubbles and float, etc., much more interesting than tank and spank. The greens you find start out around ilvl 372-384 so you won&apos;t be replacing your Dragon Soul tier set with them. However, if you run a regular dungeon the blues that drop on iLvl 410 so say goodbye quickly to your Dragon Soul tier set if you run dungeons. Between the random drops and dungeon quest rewards I replaced 4 of my iLvl 397-403 set from normal/heroic Dragon soul with new gear during my very first level 85 Pandaria dungeon run -- Way to make my hard-earned raid gear immediately worthless again Blizzard :/ Overall, so far not a bad expansion, but nothing special after playing Lotro, Guild Wars 2 beta and The Secret World (an amazing MMO imo), etc.. I plan to level to at least get a look at end game but not sure if I&apos;ll be subscribing again in the long run.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2668967">Expand</a></span>

Blizzard have destroyed what was once my favourite game of all time, people complein in other MMO&apos;s at the lack of endgame content at launch (of which wow had none) but nowadays WoW is only endgame with everything up to that point being dumbed down into a mindless grind. Round up as many mobs as you possibly can and easily kill them all.....no group quests, no elites anymore, no need to think at all, but hey, don;t worry because you&apos;ll have to wait an hour to kill this one mob that everyone is waiting for to respawn anyway! The new area and race are inspired by Jung Fu panda, it&apos;s alright whining that pandarens were brought in back in WC3, that wasn&apos;t really a proper introduction and the actual creation of the WoW race and area were clearly done with the dreamworks movie in mind to appeal to their young playerbase.
<br>
<br>Sick of kill stealing, sick of ninja looting, sick of PvP that is geared strictly against new players (not fun when my wife won&apos;t PvP because the heirloom people one shot her), sick of rude idiots desperatly running through easy mode dungeons whining that we need to round up more mobs, sick of fetch and return questing......back to GW2 for me!  My glorious memories of Vanilla and TBC won&apos;t be further tarnished by lazy, one dimensional expansions......oh and don&apos;t get me started on the talent system, nice new talents for some classes but godawful way of dealing with it, yet more dumbing down, they may as well just hand out level 80&apos;s and let them get on with the boring raiding from day one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2646890">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, it&apos;s still just an ez rush to endgame, one or 2 shotting mobs along the way.  Planned to take my time, enjoy the panda starting zone, but found it so dumbed down(further if possible from Cata), and really uninspiring artistically that I just left the area.  The game has finally cured me of my original amazement, and awe.  Time to move on.  Too much streamlining, too little server interaction and community brought on by the many changes over time, too little immersion.  The game is a sad shadow of its former self, where the immersion has been stripped out so everyone can get the big baddy in the end.  If no one can lose, how can anyone succeed?  The loss of tiered raiding, and true progression have made this game much less than it once was.  I have never even been a consistent raider, but I was proud of my progress, even if it was just Heroics in BC.  Eventually I moved through the raids, but I wasn&apos;t cutting edge by any means...and still there was something for everyone, a niche, where you could find friends at or near your level still climbing the progress ladder.  Wrath was filled w mostly 10 man raiding for me, and as with TBC the 10 level expansion made the leveling mean something, there was real progression in your character as you opened new areas at 77, etc..sadly this franchise is nothing more than a $ generator at this point for Blizz.  Nothing original in 2 full expacs, micro-transactions and vanity items everywhere, and no longer an ounce of originality.  Whoever is working on the game now just seems tired of it, and waiting for people to break their addiction so they can develop something new.  Sad for such a formerly great game.  Technically, the game is still sound, that&apos;s the only saving grace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2652186">Expand</a></span>

MoP is...another xpac. With pandas. Is it fun? Yes, of course. It&apos;s still the same gear treadmill and the same fetch quests, but that&apos;s always been WoW, so I&apos;m used to it. The new zones are beautiful. The music is great. Monks are a fun class, even if they did **** with them a bit so as not to offend people because they&apos;re doing drunken monkey style kung-fu like Jackie Chan and we can&apos;t offend people who don&apos;t drink. Or something. The pandas are charming enough, even if the females are really just a mildly altered redo of the female dwarf. Ji Firepaw is a fun addition. Aysa is...meh. The problem is with CRZ, which has absolutely destroyed the game if you&apos;re on a low-pop PVE server. If I wanted to PVP, I would do so. If I wanted to fight with a thousand other people for mats or spawns, I&apos;d have transferred off my low pop and gone to a place where that sort of thing went on. My economy on my server sees no benefits from this amazing new &apos;feature&apos;. Make no mistake, if you are on a PVE server and you rezone, you will get griefed, heavily. This is unbelievable and stupid. I transferred off my PVP server five years ago so that I didn&apos;t have to deal with it. To those of you who enjoy PVP, I&apos;m glad this feature has revitalized your experience playing the game. It has ruined mine. I have friends on my server. I don&apos;t need realID either, by the way. I&apos;ve been playing since vanilla, I can make pals just fine. I can&apos;t believe that Blizz would implement this right before MoP dropped. I can&apos;t believe they aren&apos;t listening to the thousands upon thousands of players on both US and EU servers who are telling them they want to opt out. If Blizz adds the ability to opt-out of CRZ, I&apos;ll resub and play again. As it stands now, I&apos;m done, and a lot of other players are too. Bad, bad move. MoP would have gotten a six and fifteen bucks a month from me if it weren&apos;t for CRZ. Bye Blizz, it was fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2649601">Expand</a></span>

The main problem of Mists it&apos;s just more of the exact same thing of the past 5 years, in fact it could very easily be a DLC. 5 more levels of the same quests, handful of more dungeons, couple more BGs, raids, and a re-shuffled talent tree. That has been the motto for Blizzard and WoW every since Burning Crusade. More importantly is the direction that the game started to take back in Wotlk, which is faster, simpler, easier and grindy. Normally those are good attributes, but not in a game. It basically stripped off WoW of its epicness, the feeling of adventure, hard work, difficulty, skill and challenge. It became a very easy, dumbed down mind-numbling grind, with no sense of challenge, adventure or worthwhile reward. And unfortunately, Mists of Pandaria is more of that, the same formula of 5 years ago heading even further down the road of streamlined dumbed down games. It&apos;s clear that Blizzard is heading that direction for a reason, to appeal to the younger newer crowd in order to continue selling copies and micro-transactions, not necessarily to continue making a better, more Epic game. Mists is very mediocre, specially when you compare it to new releases out there of MMOs and RPGs. With Guild Wars 2 being free-to-play I can&apos;t believe Blizzard has the face to charge monthly subscription for WoW anymore, or to continue to butcher their customer&apos;s pockets with elevated prices for extra stuff, like transfers, etc. The new class, slightly better graphics, new race and few other additions here and there unfortunately go un-noticed due to the other things that are just mediocre at best. Conclusion: Mists is just another WoW expansion, more of the same ol&apos;, very VERY little improvement if at all, that unfortunately goes overshadowed by the very poor direction where the game has been heading since Wotlk. Mists didn&apos;t cause WoW to lose it&apos;s Epicness, sense of adventure, challenge or skill/reward system, it hasn&apos;t been a trend since few expansions ago, however Mists continues that trend, which is bad. In top of that, we are talking about a very wealthy company with a lot of resources, and comparing to other free-to play releases (GW2) it just falls way, wayyy too short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2648184">Expand</a></span>

How could I possibly defend purchasing or even playing this game? It would be like telling everyone I enjoy iCarly for wii, it&apos;s creepy. I don&apos;t care about broken features or more of the same, I would have been happy with the exact same expansion of wrath of the lich king with just the names changed. I wanted to give Blizzard my money, but there is no way I can justify the social and personal stigma of playing such a blatant childrens kung-fu panda video game.

<br>
<br>As a matter of fact, ill let Ghostcrawler himself tell you why this expansion sucks and why this dungeon model sucked in WoTLK. --- http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2053469 --- As you can see even Blizz realizes how bad this is, but why are they making something they know is bad design? That they criticized themselves for in WoTLK? The simple answer? Money, greed, Activision. This company isnt about gaming, it isnt about making games fun or making games they care about or are inspired to make. Its to make games they couldnt give a crap about to make more $ and it shows. The whole things a bust. 11 years old and under need only apply.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2651868">Expand</a></span>

I do it all the time. However this expansion goes some way to extending the life and joy of WOW. It really is a breath of fresh air in a pretty stale, slowly sinking game. Dumbed down? Yep! Childish? Yep! Cutesy? Yep! Fun???? YEP! Truth be known the hard-core veterans of WOW with their unending sense of superiority have got to get over themselves. Maybe its time for you all to graduate to a &apos;serious MMO&apos; like EVE, and let a new generation get their panda buzz for however long WOW stays afloat. The days of vanilla WOW have long passed, and this is almost different enough to be a totally different game. Assets and story are well constructed. Gameplay is enjoyable. Except for monthly fees this really is a game for kids these days. Time for the elitists to move on to fresh pastures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2667036">Expand</a></span>

I loved Wolk and somewhat liked cata. But now they make this? This is the largest game failure that i have ever seen, sadly i bought it despite it being very childish and dumb as hell.So i play this game and it is absolutly terrible. First of all it is very easy, and second the game is designed for 9 year olds who play games that make no since.I would talk for day about the story flaws and how dumb it is, but i will sum it up: Huge island no one ever noticed gets discovered somehow,very childish storyless pandas meet you, stupid flawed story that makes no since happens, no main boss that makes since. Now i made that as short as i could because i could say all its flaws all day. So you can give this money whore blizzard 15 dollars a month to play a very stupid flawed game for 9 year olds, or you could stop and say **** you blizzard you guys need to make content that is logical and entertaining Example: burning crusade.I hate this game so much. Please don&apos;t buy it blizzard needs to learn from its mistakes and make content that is not childish and completely stupid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2649324">Expand</a></span>

<br>I find it outrageous that Dreamworks has not sued for copyright infringement of Myst Pandarian. Leaving aside the comments from fan boy that the Pandaren were present in the game since the dawn (Where? Warcraft1-2-3? Where?) The whole universe of Pandaria is a vile copy of the film Kung Fu Panda.
<br>After the month-long trial I will return on the blessed shores of free to play. WoW is an old game that fails to keep pace with the times.

At the moment I speak, this game doesn`t deserve more than a 4, from a couple of reasons. First, the game is 10 yrs old, with no major improvement regarding graphics and gameplay since it`s launch (it`s getting dumber, and the playstyle is highly repetitive). Second, this game costs 70% the price of Torchlight2, every month, adding to this is the cost of the expansion(180% the cost of T2, only for an exp). This is OUTRAGEOUS. And don`t lie to yourself that a mmo needs monthly to sustain servers etc. GW2 does it only with the initial cost of the game. For those that get into this money eating machine, you have a major fault in the stagnation of the game industry. I am sorry to say, but atm Blizz just reached the EAjunk business model and the community has a major fault for this. I have played a couple of hours on a friend`s account, and I can state that the game has passed it`s time, a long time ago. I will stick with the memories that I have with wow from BC and WOTLK.
<br>Please don`t support this game. You are not only supporting Michael Morhaime to buy another city or so, but you are also sending a clear message to the game dev community that you enjoy monthly subscriptions on utterly foolish games (see swtor).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2649974">Expand</a></span>

As most people who follow MMOs know, in Feb 2010, Blizzard announced that they were going to begin retooling World of Warcraft to appeal to a younger audience.  Cataclysm came first and took an already relatively easy MMO and turned it into something that would feel right at home in Disney World.
<br>
<br>With Pandaria, they&apos;ve further reduced the challenge and difficulty.  Even the heroic mode dungeons in WoW are easier than the standard dungeons available in games like Rift and GW2.  With a nod to Rift... that being the undisputed champion of raid depth and challenge on the market today... Mists of Pandaria looks and plays like a kid&apos;s Etch-a-Sketch in comparison.
<br>
<br>Visually, Pandaria does have more detail.  However, you have to be a fan of My Little Pony or the Teletubbies in order to like the art direction.  The colors in Pandaria are vibrant... akin to shades that belong in cotton candy or Hello Kitty backpacks carried around by harajuku girls.
<br>
<br>Now, if you&apos;re under the age of 14 and are reading this... then I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll disagree with my opinion that this game is not made for anyone outside of the 8 to 14 age group.  The mechanics are dumbed down with reduction of available abilities at a player&apos;s disposal, it has a streamlined (see: easier) combat system, reduced dungeon difficulty, reduced dungeon run times, simple quests and instant access to rewards for little to no effort.  As it was stated in Feb. 2010 in their letter to investors, Blizzard has stayed that course.  Mists of Pandaria has firmly taken WoW and nestled it right between Toy Story and Happy Feet when it comes to target audience.  Other MMOs like Rift, Guild Wars 2, and TERA offer much more challenging gameplay and content.  WoW is, in my opinion, the new king of kids&apos; games... and I&apos;ll be looking forward to see what other MMOs do to fill the void for the adult gamers of the world.
<br>
<br>Warcraft might have 8 to 10 million players... and Toy Story is still the top grossing film in its opening weekend of all time.  Food for thought.
<br>
<br>After playing and reviewing Pandaria... I have to question the rating of the game.  I don&apos;t think it belongs in the MMORPG category any longer.  It belongs in a category with similar games like Skylander&apos;s Spyro Adventures and Club Penguin.  I&apos;m an adult and I rate Pandaria a 2.  It does not appeal to me and I feel strongly that it wasn&apos;t developed with my likes in mind.
<br>
<br>Kids, however, will absolutely love Pandaria.  It&apos;s probably challenging for an 8 year old just learning how to use a PC and the bright colors and juvenile art direction would fit right at home in their library of similarly themed games.  That, and their Pandas can dance like their older sisters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2646885">Expand</a></span>

Something happened a few years back though and Blizzard is just a shell of a game company compared to what it was 7 or 8 years ago. This expansion seems more to be geared toward the pre teen crowd than the older gamer, keep that in mind before buying it. If you are looking for a challenging adult game this is not it, save you money. I would give the new content a 5 but the dumbing down of the game in general brings the score down to a 2 for me and I am being generous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2647677">Expand</a></span>

There were actually threads on the official WoW forums encouriging people to do this.  That being said, Blizzard has done a fantastic job of doing exactly what they set out to do: make WoW more kid-friendly.  By doing this, Blizzard has alienated most of their fan base.  Having played MoP, I can tell that without a doubt this game is no longer geared towards gamers or adults.  If you are looking for a deep, complex, challenging and rewarding experience you will need to look elsewhere.  I will give it 1 point because they at least attempted (sort of) to bring back world pvp.  Overall I had a very bad experience with MoP, and like many others have cancelled my subscription for good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/user-reviews?user_review_id=2648980">Expand</a></span>
