Changing to a non-native resolution makes it blurry and in my case it also stretched the graphics out of aspect.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ 8 races, each having unique traits and systems you can interact with
<br>+ High relplayability - each game will play out differently
<br>+ Lots of ways to interact with the various races (friendly actions, backstabbing, direct combat, etc.).  Each action has trade offs (passage of time, losing reputation, etc).
<br>+ Good soundtrack.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Combat starts to feel kind of &quot;samey&quot; after a while.  The same mission type will play out the same almost every time.
<br>- There are some lingering bugs and balance issues (a lot of these are currently being fixed though)
<br>- Graphics are pretty basic
<br>
<br>Overall I give it an 8/10 based on it&apos;s current state.  I could go to 9/10 if the issues are cleaned up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-federation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4150996">Expand</a></span>

<br>The setup is original (you are a single mercenary pulling the strings behind the scenes to unite the system - instead of being one of the planetary powers of the solar system), the eight races feel fresh (there is everything from insectoid killers to communist barn owls and capitalist robots) and the combat model is just an ingenious creation that I am fairly sure has not been done before - ever.

<br>Combat is incredibly unique, simple to get started but has the potential to become quite complex later on

<br>Frighteningly complex simulation underneath the hood--easily mitigated by a tutorial-esque approach (that is skippable later) and lots of useful optional data reports

<br>Feels like I&apos;m caught in the middle of a Star Trek-like political situation in the middle of mostly uncharted space. Lots of political scheming behind the scenes and brazen destruction and capture of various factions&apos; resources and such.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-federation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4145413">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At first, it seems like an interesting game. Unique idea (with a story that makes zero sense) and definitely unique and fun game play.
<br>
<br>The problem is, even at version 1.6+, it is buggy as all hell. Your outposts disappear for no reason, building outposts can cost you time and credit but the outpost won&apos;t build, overwhelmingly powerful fleets do next to no damage at times (or at all times, in some cases), weak as hell fleets can end up doing immense amounts of damage.
<br>
<br>Another thing that bothers me is that it is very, very easy for you to be surpassed, even if you&apos;re the technological powerhouse. You can&apos;t build nor capture military outposts, which multiply ship capabilities. The only way to get one is for a random event to occur. A depressurization kills everyone on board someone else&apos;s space station. The game tells you who this happened to but not where and you have to go from station to station. Once you find one that needs repairs, this is either a station you can repair and take over or a station that took damage and you can be friendly and repair it. If this is owned by an enemy and it was just slightly damaged, congratulations, you just helped your enemy instead of capturing a station.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s flaws and illogical attributes currently outweigh everything good about it, and by a fair margin. Even though I&apos;d like to give this game a good score, I can&apos;t. The developers have a LOT of work to do before that happens.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-federation/user-reviews?user_review_id=4581102">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Last Federation has you play as an almost godly last survivor of an extinct alien race, who&apos;s now made it his mission to attempt to unify the remaining 8 alien races across the solar system (or unify as many as he can and destroy the rest!). To do this he has to gain credit and influence with each race by doing tasks for them. There is a lot of alien politics involved, and each race is quite different to the others, meaning the same approach doesn&apos;t work for all the races.
<br>
<br>The game can be a bit hard to get into at first, as there&apos;s a lot of stuff suddenly being introduced at once. It can easily turn away some players, but I&apos;d really recommend to keep playing, because eventually you get familiar with it all. The normal difficulty is pretty laid back and you have plenty of time to learn the ways and can afford to make errors.
<br>
<br>The combat sections have you partake in a sort of bullet hell spaceship battle. They might seem pretty difficulty at first, but again, they&apos;re actually a lot easier to grasp than they look. The battle is broken down into turns. You select where to go and which enemy to shoot at. The game then plays it out and you get to pick your next move. In addition to that, you can even change how much energy goes to your weapons, shields, and propulsion, as different situations require you to adjust it. For example if you get swarmed and start to suffer damage - divert more energy to shields. If you need to take something out fast - divert it to the weapons. And so on.
<br>
<br>Perhaps what I liked the most was how well-developed the lore and background on each alien race was. Each of them has their own political agenda and attitude to you and the other races. Some are diplomats and peacekeepers, whilst others are very warlike and territorial. I&apos;ve had a lot of fun learning about each race and their likes and dislikes.
<br>
<br>Music in the game is also fantastic. Each race has its own unique theme music, which was a nice touch. The visuals are pretty simple though and a lot of the gameplay, particularly the political side of things, is text-based, whilst the combat looks like a regular space shooter. So that aspect might not appeal to some people. But don&apos;t let that put you off if you enjoy a good strategy and political intrigue.
<br>
<br>Just for those who are a bit unsure of how to start off and get going, here is some advice on methods that worked for me:
<br>
<br>1) Start off by giving space-faring tech to 2-3 races you find most trustworthy. Normally Andor, Skyllaxians, and Peltians are pretty reliable, though it is up to you! This will get you plenty of starting Credit and Influence early on.
<br>
<br>2) Start doing friendly tasks for those races and increase influence with them further. Cooperative Research is pretty good, as you can then gift this research to the other races and get free influence with them!
<br>
<br>3) Expanding Unused Area and Colonizing/Mining Moons is great for getting some quick Credit.
<br>
<br>4) Make sure to open up some Trade routes between the races you&apos;ve allied with, so that they start to like each other as well (this is found in the Political page for each race, not in the Friendly Actions page).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-federation/user-reviews?user_review_id=6052238">Expand</a></span>
