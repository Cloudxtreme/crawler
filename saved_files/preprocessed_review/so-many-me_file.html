The graphics are solid and the puzzles are difficult but not too difficult. I finished this game with 100% and the variation between how you solve puzzles is extraordinary and there are various ways to go through puzzles sometimes. Though the story does end with you wanting something more, the narrative in it is excellent. The game can be played without getting any collectibles at all but that is definitely not how you want to play this game since the collectible puzzles are the best by far and show where the game shines the most. Definitely a game that should be added to your collection if you love puzzles and platforming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/so-many-me/user-reviews?user_review_id=5932852">Expand</a></span>

This game is a puzzle platformer that looks remarkable. Filo and his band of clones, the Many Me, are wonderfully colorful and buoyant. They all move in such a way that it truly appears to be a living, breathing world. I like everything about the game. Visually, it&apos;s refreshing and festive. The games&apos; mechanics are cleverly utilized. It is, however, a cute game that may seem like it&apos;s for youngsters but it&apos;s really challenging enough for this adult, as there are quite a lot of puzzles to solve. I actually have to use my brain to figure out how to solve the puzzles. When I work out a solution, I feel like I&apos;ve mastered something previously unattainable. Yes! Making choices for Filo and the Many that will help me get them to the next level, is something I look forward to achieving! So Many Me is entertaining on a number of levels. I want to keep playing this game. I suggest checking it out. You will be pleasantly surprised and will be singing its praises just as I am!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/so-many-me/user-reviews?user_review_id=4368783">Expand</a></span>

The amount of polish that went to it really makes the game feel different- which is hard to do with a platformer.  All the humor helps take the game to another level.  Definitely worth adding to my collection.</span>
