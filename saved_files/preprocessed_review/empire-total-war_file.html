There is NO bugs, some of these reviews are absolutely outdated and unreliable. In my opinion, this is the most playable of all the Total War games. The tech branches are much more expansive and really do progress as time goes on and the campaign was fantastic. I felt like I was rewriting my text books. It&apos;s also one of the more colorful TW games, because it covers such an active century of domination and war. Napoleon felt sort of like a plus 20 year map pack to this gem. This game is just as good as any other TW game, it really is a shame that people wrote hundreds and hundreds of reviews within the first couple of months of the games release, yet when the game is &quot;Fixed&quot; (Because I never played it when it was supposedly bugged) everyone just lose interest in lifting a finger for a new review. I&apos;ll simply put it this way, this game is worth every dollar, pound, or euro it costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2656597">Expand</a></span>

Although I found the attention to unit detail rather dissapointing that does not hinder the gameplay in any way. The only thing stopping me from giving this game a 10 is the fact that I found the AI a little bit too glitchy and slow.</span>

Now the game has been patched its a far better gaming experience but doesn&apos;t live up to M2:TW and Rome:TW, battles just aren&apos;t as fun or engaging and sieges in particular are a mess.No longer do you attack castles/towns with the buildings from the campaign map instead you attack different forts which are pretty much the same every-time and offer little variety of strategy required to capture them. Naval combat which looked brilliant is just a pain and even after 250 hours i have no clue how it works resulting in the imperfect auto resolve option being used the majority of the time.
<br>
<br>That said the campaign map has been extended dramatically with America, India and trade routes added giving the game a much grander feel. The graphics are also fantastic really stepped up from M2:TW, giving battles a realistic and epic feel. Technology trees also allow you to research advance technology which you can see take effect on the battlefield in the form of new moves or new units, you can use technology to improve the economy or the enlightenment of your people. This adds new complexity to the game and allowing different styles of play to be used.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3246976">Expand</a></span>

The game has crashed 3 times for me in 1 month of hardcore gameplay. If you can&apos;t cope with expected issues, don&apos;t buy the game. Nevertheless, Empire: Total War is one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming you will ever come across. Yes, there are a few bugs in it (no not many), and for a title with such massive scope, that should be expected. But these problems are minor and simply annoyances, they can only detract a small amount from an overall pleasant presentation. The naval and land battles are fantastic, incorporating a mix of cannons, cavalry, infantry and battleships. The graphics are amazing on high or ultra, and it certainly lives up to it&apos;s reputation in turn based mode. Camera options are redefined, mini-maps are more detailed than before, AI has been improved - what else can you ask for? There is excessive demand on developers to produce a perfect game to the modern market. In my opinion, there are limited flaws in the game itself, and perhaps more with installation. I found Steam to be a terrible hassle, and quite unecessary. Suppose someone didn&apos;t have access to the internet but liked playing video games. &quot;The creative assembly&quot; is losing a lot of business by using this idiotic method of signing up. However, Steam can have some advantages, giving users regular updates for patches and new features. The historical accuracy of the game is something many people forget, or take for granted. This a key focus of the Total War series, making education fun. It opens our minds to the realms of 18th century mentality and the progress of the industrial revolution. It broadens our intelligence and understanding of contemporary society in relation to our past. This is what sums it up as a classic. In the end, much enhancement has been added since Medieval: II Total War, and this is, at least by me, appreciated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=423167">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Al in all a good game, unlike most people i had no problems at release. The land battles are fun as always in the Total War series, but the great campaign is so boring and the ai too easy. For a decent campaing i suggest Rome: Total War or the very unappreciated Imperial Glory, which had many features of Empire years before.</span>

The somewhat cartoony approach to history that the older games featured has been done away with for a much more serious feel, and it&apos;s pulled off very well; even if it isn&apos;t perfectly historically accurate, compared to previous games it is apples and oranges. This is not only by far the best Total War game to date, it may very well be the best strategy game in recent years. Yes, the game was released with bugs, but I don&apos;t feel that the game itself can be rated based on bug issues. Some people are giving it low scores because they are frustrated with bugs, but I prefer to rate based on content. It might be worth waiting a month or two past release, but the fact is that it runs more than playably for most people, and the bugs will get ironed out. Also, for other people, please stop rating games based on their performance. It&apos;s like saying that Disneyland sucks because your plane was delayed.

An altogether fantastic game if your computer has the sacs to take it on, however, it would make sense if you decided to wait a month or so for more of the updates to stream through. I didn&apos;t wait, however I&apos;m still perfectly happy with what I&apos;ve got.

The move to the age of muskets, rifles and cannons is a very welcome addition to the Total War franchise. The real time battles are stunningly awesome. Both land and sea battles are fun to play. They have really great graphics and seeing your units and ships fire off volleys of death never gets old. The campaign map is also nice and works smoothly most of the time. Sound is great throughout the whole game from the soundtrack to the sound of cannon fire to the command acknowledgements of your units. UI looks great and is very friendly.<br>I would say Empire is definitely on par with Rome and Medieval2 when it comes to Total War games and epicness and awesomeness. There are a few annoyances with the game though of course. The well documented initial legion of bugs that the game was released with are now mostly gone but you can still get some CTDs occasionally. Diplomacy and AI leave a lot to be desired but what else is new about Total War games? Rakes are almost useless, small ships fire longer than bigger ships, some factions have too few unique units, France is represented by a single region etc etc. There are a lot of minor stuff that you can complain about but with a game this big in scope it is only natural.<br>Empire: Total War is one of my favorite games from recent years and I probably won&apos;t stop playing it until I have played all the major factions in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2217273">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, back in 2009, I was causing Steam after I lost my first account and the ability to play Empire Total War. Recently, I managed to find my account and activate ETW; so here&apos;s a first impression review. Empire is certainly quite spectacular with a heavier emphasis on gunpowder weapons and yet the stragegy has been lost somewhat now that your units use guns rather than physical weapons, making them less significant and somehow more dull than Medieval 2. The interface has been redesigned, and by that I mean it&apos;s completely incomprehensible thanks to the confusing styling and randomly rearranged functions. One of the most significant additions to the game is naval combat; so now you can actually fight the battle rather than clicking &quot;auto-resolve&quot; with every battle, followed by &quot;clear defeat&quot;. The naval combat is spectacular, more so than land battles, but is virtually impossible to control. If you select a ship and right click on an enemy, they flat out don&apos;t attack; they just dither in circles while the enemy picks away at your hull. The world map isn&apos;t much better thanks to a confusing HUD and apparent lack of the flag colouring from Medieval 2 which made it much easier to tell which cities were weak and which we&apos;re overflowing. So, after first impressions; Empire Total War is spectacular and mind bending, but suffers from an unintuative interface and confusing AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2459899">Expand</a></span>

I found it to be a good game overall, with a mix of great improvements and disappointing letdowns. The available world is at least twice as large as that of previous titles, as this game introduces North and Central America and the Indian subcontinent to the playable map (as well as a few more distant trade destinations). This gives much more potential territory to conquer and enemies to face, though it has the downside of requiring you to spread further and quicker than in previous games in order to win the campaign. Diplomacy is further developed from earlier games, and there is now much more incentive to be a faithful ally or honest enemy--although countries tend to have the annoying habit of hating you forever once you go to war with them. The introduction of the research system is nice, since it gives you another way to gain (or lose!) the edge against your rivals, and the ability to buy, sell, trade, or steal research can be handy. The battles are somewhat different in this game, since many units now use guns of various sorts, but Empire follows the same basic style as previous titles. I loved the addition of defensive works for besieging armies (mines, trenches, stakes, etc.), which allow one to prepare for counterattacks, as well as the ability of most infantry to use stone walls as cover. There is a pretty good diversity of unit times in this game (especially if you have the DLC unit packs), and this is keenly seen in the vastly improved array of ship types, which make the naval theater much more exciting. For the first time, players can choose to control their fleets directly during naval battles, allowing for strategy to play into the outcome instead of just numbers. Personally I gave up on figuring out the relatively complex controls for naval battles and just used the auto-decide, but I&apos;m sure next time I play I&apos;ll find them easier. There are too many other aspects of this game which I&apos;d like to mention, but I&apos;ll leave those to others and just say that this game is definitely worth playing if you are a fan of the Total War franchise, and even if not, I&apos;d recommend giving it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563455">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>When the game was first released there were plenty of bugs but the patches long ago have squashed them all for me. Never before has a game pushed the boundaries so much and seemed so grand in scale, I was in strategy heaven! Introducing interactive naval combat for the first time in the Total War series, 3 different theaters, a technology tree, a completely new era, and the list goes on. To me, Empire Total War is the time when Creative Assembly really dug down in their creative spirits, took risks by breaking away from the safety of their melee heavy games (which are great by the way) and delivered a unique experience that every strategy gamer should experience.
<br>
<br>If you like strategy games, this is a must have for your collection in my honest opinion. If you can appreciate the risk the developers took with the introduction of so many new mechanics and a scale unmatched by any Total War game before or since; I think some of you may find a game taking its place among a short list of all time favorites.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3469181">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Some of the problems that hold it back is that the AI still has problems that were in rome total war and have never been patched, such as the cavalry charge the enemy does on your units. They sometimes throw a quarter of their army doing this. The AI in siege battles are pretty bad too. It is also a bad idea to auto resolve battles (trust me). The game also doesnt have just simple open fields to fight in. There is always trees and hills which is fine but i would have liked a completely open map with nothing but flat land. beside these its the total war and its amazingly fun. Making armies with wacky strategies and tactics is priceless. I recommend going long range light units and musket cavalry only.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3584230">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the added complexity almost appears to be a half-baked after thought. Diplomacy in the game is almost comically horrible. Military alliances have been replaced by a general alliance system which makes it almost impossible to ally with certain nations due to factors outside the control of the player. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to develop a peace treaty with combatant nations regardless of who started the war or if territory changed hands leading to wars that have lasted for over fifty years (hardly realistic of the time period). Battles also appear quite buggy with animations being performed at the wrong time. While purely cosmetic, it does put a dampener on what is supposed to be the game&apos;s main feature. Another problem with the battles is their repetitiveness. While I don&apos;t mind fighting a battle for 45 minutes, I have used the same two tactics in almost every battle with either very few losses, or losses that are disproportional to those inflicted on the enemy.  Finally, we have the steam element. After purchasing this game, be ready to wait for a roughly 1.5 gig patch to download through steam, and be sure to run steam offline if you have a bad connection. Otherwise, you will be unable to play as you have to be online to turn on the offline mode for steam (go figure). One distinguishing plus to add, however, is the naval battles. Although these are incredibly slow (even with the fast forward button), it is a legit step above simply having ships auto battle each other (especially when your nation is Dependant on a navy to hold its empire together. Graphics are also amazingly good save for the bugs mentioned above. Unfortunately, these are only present in the battles themselves where in general, you&apos;re too busy fighting to notice them. In general, Empire Total War is a great game if far from perfect. Admittedly, it was somewhat of a let down for me in comparison to Rome Total War. While fun at first, the problems I mentioned take quite a bit of the fun out of the game. Furthermore, the complexity, which does add a challenging layer, is one more thing to have to have to look after while still implementing the same interface present in Rome Total War which presents its limitations quite quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1640104">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay, oh the gameplay, theres a vast amount of tactics and strategies you can devise against opponents, some nations requiring a different approach because of their methods of warfare and tech.  It offers more interactive and varied approach to the campaign, offering a wide amount of variation from not only nation to nation, but region to region as to what you use each one for, be it for military, economic, or even technological advances to your country, or perhaps enhancing its national prestige.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540565">Expand</a></span>

<br>some how doesnt do it all for me though, in comparrison to say Medival total war the game play is just far better on that, If it wasnt for the sea battles this rating would be a flat 5. I feel that with the release of the patch in may that alot of the lag and jerkyness can be remidied.</span>

You will have to defend and expand your empire to get a victory.  But this is not easy, you will have to manage city tax policies, deal with revolts, use religion to convert population to the one of you&apos;re empire, deal with happiness of cities, train land and naval units, use research to develop technology (by constructing science buildings in cities) and other complex things typical of strategy games.  This series of Total War games is special because in here you can manually fight your battles.  What i mean is that if you choose to fight an army with your army (or whatever) you have 2 choices: 1) Auto resolve: based on your unit strength stats against the enemy unit strength stats (and other factor like terrain)  one will automatically emerge victorious.  And 2) you will fight the war yourself.  You will direct your units in real time in the battlefield.<br><br>You have several Empires to select from.  Just to name a few: Spain, England, Russia...etc.  But you are not in a modern era setting.  The game starts somewhere (i don&apos;t exactly remember) in the 1750&apos;s.  So you have to make use of archers, catapults and swordsmen (althought in time you will be able to use cannons and some rifle units) to fight your way to victory.  This game is almost as good as Rome: Total War.<br><br>Enjoy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2256661">Expand</a></span>

The land battle are awesome, you can make your very own Barriers to avoid musket fire i would say to give this game atleast at metascore of 96!</span>

Congratulations to the team.</span>

The use of rifles cause the player to use amazing diffrenct tactics, the addition of a large number of very small countries and the increase in trade abilities make this a welcome addition to the series. However was clearly rushed out, the game crashes repeatedly in various parts of the game for many of the users, the campain AI is laughable, even when at war nations (or shall i say EMPIRES) will rarely attack in land battles, only attacking fleets causing very dull gameplay. Couped with the extreme lag faced during unit selection and turns and the all over feel of unreadiness makes this game nearly unplayable. If you are new to total war get any of the previous ones, if you aren&apos;t then go play M2TW. Clearly the &apos;professional&apos; reviewers once again haven&apos;t actually played the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=79953">Expand</a></span>

All the &quot;critics&quot; must be playing a different game than the one I bought. First and the most infuriating of all is the AI. Out of all the total war games I have played in the past I can never remember it being so bad. The units are often unresponsive to your commands and when you do manage go get them to do what you want they usually have terrible pathing. Try taking a enemy fort without any cannons to see what I mean. Tell your units to grapple the wall and what usually happens is a few of them bounce up and down the rope while the rest of them sit at the base of the wall doing nothing. It&apos;s an exercise in frustration. Next is the load times. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just my computer or what but it takes upwards of 2 mins sometimes for a battle to load. Add it to the fact that after your AI does another idiotic thing and costs you a battle that you want to reload it. You spend more time at loading screens than actually playing the game. I don&apos;t know if this game was rushed out or something but it feels unfinished and it is almost unplayable in it&apos;s current state. And this is even after the patches downloaded from steam. In closing, I just want to give a big F.U. to all the people who had anything to do with this terrible, half-assed, pile of garbage. I used to like this series very much but after wasting 50$ on this embarrassment I will not be buying any more total war games in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=423559">Expand</a></span>

It looks absolutely amazing on paper. Unfortunately this is a PC game, not one played on paper. There is an absolute deluge of bugs which range from rending the game unplayable to making it just not fun. Examples include save files becoming corrupted, the AI not having the ability to attack over the ocean, units gladly firing into their own lines, cannons going off whether you tell them to or not, numerous sound bugs, the list goes on. To top it off most of the countries play just about the same, with the same units (different names) and not-unlockable minor nations. They also took out things like family trees. Aside from the terrible AI battles are pretty fun. The graphics are good and the underlying mechanics are good. I like how cities develop more in this one than in MW. Overall I&apos;d wait a while before buying this. It&apos;s at least one major patch away from being any real fun at all, and likely an expansion away from realizing it&apos;s potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=423607">Expand</a></span>

Enough of an apologia.  This game has a lot going for it.  Stunning graphics.  A much better balanced economy.  Actual naval combat!  A tech tree!<br><br>Lastly, know that the Total War mod community has delivered some great mods for this game.

Line Infantry are the same across the board, even if they&apos;re called something else in some armies. Artillery is extremely powerful and can rip approaching armies to shreds due to the AI being unable to avoid it or close with your lines quick enough, but at the same time it needs to be micromanaged always, because the fire at will function will kill more of your own men than the enemy&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=746213">Expand</a></span>

The game itself is great and very well done, i hope no one listens to someone who blames the game being bad on steam, because steam didnt make it.</span>

Don&apos;t buy it for at least a few months - the fact that they&apos;re apparently using fans of the series to do play testing rather than doing it themselves is frustrating, to say the least.</span>

Granted it looks great close up, but the AI is poor and the features are alot more limited than we were led to belive.</span>

It crashes constantly (after downloading the first patch) The AI is weak and unit pathing is terrible.  I can&apos;t recall buying a game as bad as this one.  I doubt that I will ever purchase another totalwar game, what a piece of junk!  Buy Rome Totalwar if you want to play a good game.</span>

The game is unfinished and requires a huge amount of work to become playable, let alone enjoyable. It is very buggy and will crash to desktop several times per turn. The AI is crude at best and it&apos;s almost impossible to lose the game. The developer, The Creative Assembly, has been slow to patch and if you read the gaming forums, has created a huge backlash through the gaming community with this release. My recommendation for anyone considering purchasing this game is to delay that purchase until it has become evident that the game has been fixed with appropriate patches and updates. At this time, the game is broken and unplayable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=80117">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is the worst game of the series Total War. I found the gameplay and the strategy of the entire system to be flawed and annoying. On easier difficulties the enemy would just enter your line of sight, get shot at, flee as they were being butchered, 10 seconds later they decide to make another attempt because well - nothing changed. Again they enter the line of fire, take a few losses and run.

<br>How is this better than Rome 2? A Total war game in which the AI ran through my volley of catapults (barely on Hard difficulty) to reach my few melee units, circled my general with pikes and closed in for the kill, that I barely escaped from. I don&apos;t get how some people&apos;s brain works, when games like Empire total war is considered to be awesome and Rome 2, is crap. Rome 2 has it&apos;s flaws still, but years later, Empire total war is still a piece of crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4775169">Expand</a></span>

I dont see this game having much of a future and in time I bet players will unistall this game and focus back on playing Rome and M2. To bad the nice graphics and naval battle option was fun.</span>

I haven&apos;t lost a battle yet because the AI doesn&apos;t protect it&apos;s artillery.  This means that things are a (very pretty) pushover.

The game has some awful bugs that couldn&apos;t have been missed in playtesting so I can only assume the publishers concluded a public beta was the cheapest way forward - the most game breaking bug for me is the inability of the AI to invade across water - it simply cannot use land armies and ships to land invasion forces. In effect nations like Great Britain are invulnerable at the present time. Its depressing that most reviewers (both professional and otherwise) are simply scoring it on the basis of the game they hope it will be rather than the game it is today, to what extent this is down to them simply not noticing the poor AI and attributing their success to &apos;skill&apos; is an interesting question particularly in relation to those who do this for a living.
<br>
<br>It will almost certainly be a great game once patched up, but anyone considering the purchase may be better served holding off for a few patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=80176">Expand</a></span>

<br>The scope of this game is fantastic, it includes 3 land theatres: Americas (from the Hudson Bay to Guyana), Europe (Iceland to Mesopotamia, Sweden to North Africa) and India (Mesopotamia to Calcutta); and four trade theatres: East Indies, Strait of Madagascar, Ivory Coast, and coast of Brazil. Together, all these spaces combine to give the player a game that truly spreads across the world.
<br>In this game, there are 12 major factions, 11 of which are playable. They include Great Britain, France, Spain, Austria, Prussia, Poland-Lithuania, Russia, United Provinces, Ottoman Empire, Sweden and the Maratha Confederacy. The United States is also playable in a separate campaign. These factions all have different starting positions, victory conditions, economic and military strengths and diplomatic relations. Even with these factions and the more than 50 others, the game still runs smoothly and naturally through history.
<br>The graphics are great, especially with the new sea battles, they really help bring the action to life.
<br>Most of the other reviews complain about Steam. STEAM IS NOT THE GAME! Steam can be a little annoying at times, especially the fact that you cannot play the game without Steam, however, once the game is installed and updated, Steam will hardly ever bother you again.
<br>To those who gave the game bad reviews because of crashes, it&apos;s not the game&apos;s fault that you have a faulty computer, if your computer were up to the task, the game would run fine.
<br>This is my favorite game, and I have played many games. It will be hard to top it, so Creative Assembly should keep up the good work!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1456703">Expand</a></span>

While some new features were extremely welcome, such as more robust diplomacy and research, ultimately what stopped this from being great were the tactical battles. There was almost no interesting dynamics to the battles. Cavalry and artillery were under-powered, and you could win the entire campaign with only massed line infantry. Naval battles were spectacular to look at, but controlling more than one ship was a headache. As to the campaign map, while the epic scope was appreciated, the fact that the map was so large that it made the campaign slow and unfocused. Compared to such masterpieces as Rome: Total War and Medieval II: Total War, this one was a let-down. Anyone interested in the Total War series I recommend you get Total War: Shogun 2 and skip this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707845">Expand</a></span>

Also, I have a problem where the campaign map won&apos;t scroll, so I need to click on the mini-map. Auto-resolve of battles always yields a crappy result as compared with what you can do yourself, so you end up fighting a lot of battles that really you could skip over.<br><br>Overall, although my list of cons is lengthy, the the joy of beating off multiple nations at the same time, and the gorgeous battles makes this game a winner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1543786">Expand</a></span>

Never mind how bad it was at launch, I will tell you my experience as of the last CA patch, when they announced they would no longer be patching this game.
<br>
<br>I played the campaign long enough to play a single battle. I was defending a fort from an enemy assault. Mere seconds after the battle started the opposing AI ran his general out, sweeping across his front lines, and opened fire on my fort with his cannons....directly through his general&apos;s unit, thereby killing his own general within about 15 seconds from the battle start. Probably trying to cut around my fort at my reinforcements behind and to the left of the fort.
<br>
<br>That was the start, then about a minute later I had moved my two reinforcing units up to flank the attacking force, when the AI decided it would meet my reinforcements head on with a cavalry charge. I had elephant cavalry and some sort of hybrid ranged/melee unit, so I switched my ranged unit into melee mode, and counter charged, relying on the elephant cavalry to break the enemy charge and my other unit to overwhelm them. Then I switched back to manage the assault on my fort, which was going well for me, only to switch back to the conflict outside my fort to find that while my elephant cavalry had charged, my other unit had not. At first I thought I had misclicked, but come to find out, when I had put the unit in melee mode, it froze in place. I couldn&apos;t move it. I had to toggle it back in forth multiple times before it &quot;fixed itself&quot; and I could move it again, but only in ranged mode.
<br>
<br>As my general was part of the now gutted elephant cavalry, I was actually at risk of being routed. I held the fort, but the AI was reforming for another attack, and all I had to stop his cavalry outside the fort was a unit that I couldn&apos;t switch from ranged mode or it would stop moving. Meanwhile his cannon had done serious damage to my wall. Reviewing the damage I realized his cannon were no longer firing, why not? Well, that is because the AI decided to abandon his cannons, which still had plenty of ammo, and charge the fort with his cannoneers, while his other units stood and watched. The marched right up to the walls, where I had local number superiority, then broke and ran, as did the rest of the forces. Giving me the victory.
<br>
<br>Realizing battles where not a test of skill, but a test of whether the gameplay crippling bugs the player experiences are worse than the horrible, suicidal. AI, I stopped playing then and there and have not touched the game since. i honestly think anyone who rates this game a 10/10 is either being paid, is not a gamer at all, or is playing on such easy difficulties they don&apos;t really notice how terrible things are. keep in mind, my experience, was post the last CA update, after they had &quot;fixed&quot; the game.
<br>
<br>TLDR: As of final patch, game was still broken with massive bugs and a non functional AI. Not worth playing, not to mention paying for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=6425728">Expand</a></span>

The battle graphics are horrible, especially when you zoom out, and the diplomacy is also terrible. The custom battle maps are also very bad, with the fact that there are barely any buildings, and the AI players are absolutely horrible! The campaign is fun, but Africa, South America, and at least parts of Central and Eastern Asia should be included. The unit detail is fairly good, but the men all look exactly the same; even the militias, Native Americans, and minutemen! Empire: Total War is okay but Medieval II: Total War is, without a doubt, the best video game ever made, and no one should ever make the mistake of comparing Empire to Medieval II or even Rome: Total War. I would give it a higher score because of the campaign, and even with all the problems it is a good game, but I must give Empire: Total War a 4 because it is a terrible game in comparison to the rest of The Creative Assembly&apos;s games. I only hope that Napoleon: Total War is better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/empire-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=746093">Expand</a></span>
