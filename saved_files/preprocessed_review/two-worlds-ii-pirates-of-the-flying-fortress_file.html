<br>I did like their new story, and i enjoy their new Graphics. So i got allot of hours, and it&apos;s just totally worth the money.
<br>The story is about pirates, the Expansion title, explains it all!
<br>Basically if you like ships you should give it a try.
<br>There&apos;s Almost new spells, A new campaign, Ships, Weapons, Games, Voices, Characters, Maps (And even more)
<br>Very good expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds-ii-pirates-of-the-flying-fortress/user-reviews?user_review_id=1974937">Expand</a></span>

This expansion pack is the best content in the entire two worlds franchise. The quests are tighter, the story makes more sense - and it&apos;s even less content bare than 2. After this the future is looking bright for the two worlds series.</span>

( the TW2 was max. 25-30 hour) The TW2PoFF  is a new chapter in Antalor&apos;s history with new monsters, armors, and of course with new boss fights and multiplayer maps! I only gave 9, becaouse (for me) was too easy. ( i played at first in medium-and after in hard)</span>

There is a definite improvement to the graphics, especially the lighting. Hold a torch up inside the ship and you&apos;ll see not just shadows, but detail from bump mapping as light plays off various textured surfaces. Gameplay is much the same as the original TW2 (sailing has been tweaked for the &apos;landlubbers&apos; to be easier) but the enemies are more robust, hence the requirement for a high level character. My only complaints are that you cannot return to the &apos;real&apos; world to kick ass and take names, and there is also some pronounced audio stuttering when looting and opening inventories, which carries over to the main game as well. This didn&apos;t happen before the expansion, but oddly does not affect multiplayer. Otherwise, if you&apos;re a fan of TW2, this is well worth getting for the additional play time and the new loot (thank the gods, I can finally ditch that stupid pointed Mage hat!)<br>though the price point is too high, IMHO. When it comes on sale , definitely get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds-ii-pirates-of-the-flying-fortress/user-reviews?user_review_id=1804353">Expand</a></span>

Let&apos;s start with the enemies.  Almost everyone is either a mage or range specialist. The range specialists do a tremendous amount of dmg and you&apos;re generally surrounded by 2 or 3 of them in addition to melee.  The mages are even worse because they basically start spawning in enemies and never stop until you kill them.  The result is that you have to quickly find the mage and kill them while avoiding the increasing enemy count and range specialists.  It would be fine if it wasn&apos;t every battle...
<br>
<br>Even worse is that strategy got thrown out the window.  In TW2 you could sneak up on an enemy and kill them.  In the expansion I wasn&apos;t able to sneak up on anyone.  In fact if I got within range of a bow they immediately knew where I was at.  This is the (few) times that you actually see the enemies. The expansion has almost every group of enemy spawn around you when you enter a new area.  Get to a crossing in the path, enemies spawn in.  Walk down a ravine, more enemies spawn in.  It isn&apos;t like these are ghosts or anything.  All the enemies do it with predictable frequency.  The enemy counts have gone up, the amount of dmg they can take and dish out has gone up and they always spawn surrounding you.  Combat went from fun to boring because it was repetitive and unbalanced.
<br>
<br>The expansion introduced a boat but the only purpose of using it is to get from one plot area to another.  Once there then the teleports were available.  It is really nothing more than a gimmick.
<br>
<br>The only redeeming quality of this expansion was the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds-ii-pirates-of-the-flying-fortress/user-reviews?user_review_id=3910951">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- A whopping 15+ hour new campaign with an intriguing storyline.
<br>- (almost) all the pluses of the original Two Worlds RPG: good combat mechanics, awesome soundtrack.
<br>- Humorous and engaging side quests.
<br>- A huge new map to free roam.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Although NPC voice acting is ok, avatar voice acting is beyond horrible  especially when combined with the fact that the voice is different from the original character (that you possibly continue with).
<br>- The game solves all the puzzles for you (even more than the original campaign).
<br>- Same with the original campaign, no female avatar possibility.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds-ii-pirates-of-the-flying-fortress/user-reviews?user_review_id=3582255">Expand</a></span>

It makes sense to me that there was a fairly broad mix of enemies, and that taking out the mages and ranged enemies first is a logical tactic. Tactical positioning and timing is important, knowing when to use special moves matter, having retreat avenues or preparing beforehand matters. This game is a long way from being the worst I&apos;ve played combat wise, it forces you to think tactically rather than button mash.
<br>
<br>I like games where you can roam around and explore, there&apos;s plenty of unique and interesting quests, and the characters have well... character, and this game provides that. It doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously, provides plenty of humor, and the ending was satisfying. It&apos;s not without its problems, and there are many minor annoyances, but overall it was a good experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds-ii-pirates-of-the-flying-fortress/user-reviews?user_review_id=5460903">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Awesome story, except the ending of the main story. Otherwise, the quest is meaningful and realistic, your character can speak and his response is meaningful throughout the story and side quest. This make the game become more interactive (in other game like Skyrim or Neverwinter night, you can only response with dialogue, no voice, no speak back and forward between you and NPC)</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Pros:

<br>-Charming music
<br>-Graphics is beautiful for a game from 2011. Vast desert, corrupted lands, dark dungeons, fresh forest. The world is smaller compare to skyrim but more quality and less repetitive.
<br>-Day and night circles. NPC go to work at day and return home to sleep at night.
<br>-NPC response to your action, they run and scream when you hit them, then guards will try to beat you and they are while powerful. If you pull out your weapon when guards are nearby, they will surround you and ask you to sheath your weapon. When you break into people&apos;s home. If the owner see you they will ask you to leave and if you don&apos;t leave, they will call the guard.
<br>-Combat system is realistic and fun:
<br>Melee is included block, counter attack, combo, passive and active skill, dodge, step back and strike, while blocking you can strike at choose direction by pressing move button + left click. Due wielding, two handed, one handed with shield or touch or nothing, all these options have skill to support them, for example you can strike enemy with the torch and deal %100 of your physical damage as fire. Different weapon have different skill to support them: axe strip enemy shield, mace stun them, etc. Some skills can be use with any weapon.
<br>Range is very powerful, you can snipe, you can shoot power fire arrow/bolt deal area damage, shoot arrow/bolt that create a decoy, when decoy expires or dies, deal % of your physical damage as spectral damage. Poison and frost arrow/bolt that slow enemy. Frost option deal a small area damage while poison is single target but deal damage over time. With the pirate dlc, you get access to the crossbow, which provide a different using mechanism and fighting strategies.
<br>This game has the best magic system, you can create a lot of spells by combine magic cards together. You can make stone rains from the sky and then create a tornado that make these stones flying around you and hit enemy. These are hundreds, even thousands combinations. Air, life, lightning, fire, power, force, water, ice, psyche, corpse, poison, decay, trap, summoning, area, etc.
<br>-Crafting and alchemy system
<br>-Teleport system: besides the fixed teleport gate, you can create your own teleport gate as many as you want and spread them across the world.
<br>-Nice lockpicking system
<br>-Fun mini games
<br>-mod-able
<br>Cons:
<br>-Lack variety landscape: no winter, fall landscape.
<br>-Lack variety of races, the variety of monster is okay but I still want more.
<br>-Only one dragon.
<br>Conclusion:
<br>Two worlds 2 is a must play game. I played Skyrim and Oblivion, the worlds is vast with a lot of side quests, but everything is repetitive and dust story. When it comes to quality, I choose Two Worlds II and its DLC pirate, meaningful quest chat-chit and dialogue, different quests outcome, rewards and different ending in DLC. This the first open world game which I truly want to replay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds-ii-pirates-of-the-flying-fortress/user-reviews?user_review_id=4886039">Expand</a></span>
