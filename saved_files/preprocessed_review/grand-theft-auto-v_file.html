I&apos;ve seen many users on here complaining that GTA V is bad because it doesn&apos;t run well on their PCs, most of these people are PC scrubs. They either have a bad PC, and they&apos;re trying to max the game, then getting mad at the game for their mistakes, or they didn&apos;t get the latest drivers for GTA V, and are mad at the game for their own mistakes. The game is great, from its story to its online, it brings excellence. Heists and all the DLCs that have been released for GTA V are available right out of the box, and are as good as expected. My only gripe with the PC version of GTA V is that the mouse &amp; keyboard controls are not the best, although this can be fixed with custom configuration in the options menu, I do emphasize that this game is more relaxed and fun with a controller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5315067">Expand</a></span>

The role play in this game beats any other, the graphics are amazing, and you can do literally everything, You can just wonder in a store, and do a stick up, go and join some races, or even do some jet fighting/races, customize your own character to the pinnacle of customization, freckles, dimples, wrinkles, size, eye colour.
<br>
<br>Then if you are feeling up to it, you can even change your make up, hair style, literally everything.
<br>The races are fully customizable, to however you want them, weather, cops, own vehicles or basic vehicles.
<br>
<br>There are events , like the $10,000,000 challenge if you complete all heists with the same team without dying once, you all receive $10,000,000.
<br>
<br>Some of the downsides include connectivity issues, there is a lot of loading, and sometimes you can load for 5 minutes and then get disconnected, or if you attempt to join a heist, and it&apos;s full, you have to wait a few minutes of loading. therefor, I say do your best to not mess up the mission when you are in one, because if you mess up, means more loading time, and it gets annoying.
<br>
<br>Also hackers, Rockstar seems to be on the ball with banning them, but there is a lot of them, only yesterday a guy was blowing things up, and everything he blew up, turned into money bags, was quite funny, but the day before, someone got angry at me and repeatedly killed me, I tried to kill her, but I did 0 damage, she even ran towards me unarmed as I shot her, and nothing happened, and she killed me with her fists, it was funny, but at the same time, very unfair.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5290776">Expand</a></span>

<br>So now you just need to multiply it by 10 and that is GTA V on Pc.
<br>Any one who thinks this game is bad, either has a bad PC or he has a problem with Rockstar!
<br>I cant find anything wrong about it!
<br>Enjoy it!</span>

It is not like 60 fps all the time, but more than comfortable. I am happy &amp; proud to have this legendary masterpiece in my collection!

<br>Respect to every single person that was involved in creating this unique and excellent MASTERPIECE.
<br>
<br>I was just thinking today...if they would say to give them more money so they can create another title that is this good - I would give it to them.
<br>
<br>And I am certain I will NEVER preorder any single game after the experience with Ubisoft, EA...and those other companies.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t remember a single game in the last few years that worked flawlessly on day 1.
<br>
<br>Did not encounter single bug so far, 33% into the game.
<br>
<br>Graphics out of this world.
<br>
<br>Optimization insane.
<br>
<br>Audio - great and YES, now I remembered there is a issue - 5,1 sound not working properly. Positional audio is great but no sound coming to subwoofer. I play in stereo now.
<br>
<br>Gameplay - GTA fans know what to expect.
<br>
<br>Controls - fluid and easy to learn.
<br>
<br>Buy it.
<br>
<br>Play it.
<br>
<br>Enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5207545">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was lucky and got the game through Steam. Other then the 14h download on launch day I don&apos;t have anything to complain about. It&apos;s running perfectly fine on my five year old i7 920 quad core with a two year old GTX 770 and 8GB Ram. Got almost everything on High (used Geforce Experience to automatically set the right options). About 20h in now and also none of the crashes others reported.
<br>
<br>The game looks absolutely gorgeous. There&apos;s so much detail around every corner. After the first Heist I spend easily two hours just walking around in 1st person admiring all the little details Los Santos has to offer and another hour taking Chop the Dog for walks or just randomly running into pedestrians until they start attacking me and then watch Chop bite their heads off. The Tennis mini game is not half bad either if you like Tennis. You can even use your phone to call a Blimp and then go sightseeing from the air.
<br>
<br>The missions are.. well they are original GTA. Really well written dialogue good mission design, a lot more fun than GTA IV for sure. To me they are on the same level as San Andreas and Vice City were. Over the top action and not as serious and dark as IV was (not counting the IV DLC, Lost&amp;Damned and the other one with the gay guy, those were great too). Speaking of which, you meet some characters from the old games again in this game.
<br>
<br>Like I said I&apos;m about 20h in now and the stats tell me I&apos;ve completed 16% and did 17 of the 69 main missions. Then again I spend a lot of time just running around or riding a bike (they are as fun as they were in SA). There&apos;s just so much to see and I&apos;ve only uncovered about half of the map so far. Although a lot of what&apos;s still missing is probably ocean or country side.
<br>
<br>The only thing I&apos;m somehow having a problem with is the Cop&apos;s behaviour. For some reason you can&apos;t just outrun them by driving away in a fast car like in past games. You have to somehow get out of their range and then hide behind buildings preferably putting your head down (there&apos;s literally a button for putting your head down). It takes some getting used to and leads to strange situations where sometimes I can try to escape from them for minutes, driving half way across the map and they&apos;re still tailing me. And sometimes I just drive around one corner in a narrow road between two buildings and they&apos;ve lost me.
<br>
<br>That being said I can easily overlook this one strange behaviour with everything else being as fun as it is. I&apos;m heaving a great time playing the game and these past three days the reason for me to put down the controller always was the clock showing 2am.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5197592">Expand</a></span>

The best GTA in the series in my opinion, and I&apos;ve played every one of the 3d titles. The PC version is a masterpiece. No other platform does it justice.</span>

<br>
<br>It was a 10/10 game on it&apos;s original release on the 360, and I&apos;m grateful that they took the time to work on improving the game to make the most of PC hardware. It has the best physics engine of any game I&apos;ve played, there is so much attention to detail in the city, and the AI pedestrians really make the place feel alive. Stellar voice acting and writing (if a little puerile, but that&apos;s part of the charm). My only complaint is the loading times between multiplayer jobs, but the single player alone warrants 10.10, it seems silly to mark something down for having extra features.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5210777">Expand</a></span>

This is a breathtaking and wonderfully emergent labour of love. Finally PC technology is taking us to the countryside of San Andreas and city of Los Santos. These fantastic playgrounds the designers have always had in mind for us. A true piece of  gaming history and a massive chunk of fun. There&apos;s so much could be said but you&apos;ve read it all elsewhere. I&apos;ll just say this after 30 hours playing I know I&apos;ll still be landing my helicopter on that moving freight train, moving down random fishermen with its rota blades and escaping the cops on a nearby speedboat for years to come. Oh yeah finally first- person perspective is awesome and you absolutely must, must must get to see this in NVIDIA&apos;s 3D vision. They nailed it.

Since San Andreas, I had started to hate the series. Then they announced a release date for PC. At first I wasn&apos;t going to buy it, but then, All the things people had said encouraged me. I feel blessed. in technical view, you don&apos;t feel like your playing a game from last gen. It&apos;s completely polished and feels like it&apos;s been built from the scratch for PC. The game is fluid and I didn&apos;t face any problem despite my modest hardware. Controlls are responsive and gameplay is really fun and engaging. The whole Los Santos and Blaine County look absolutely gorgeous. The story and the characters are really compelling and I fell in love with every aspect within the first few minutes. GTA V is an actual parody of the current state of the world with a focus on the U.S. and how corrupt the authorities are. I disagree with those who say it is sexist or racist or transphobic or homophobic. It deals with such issues in one of the greatest ways I have seen in a game and I&apos;m a gaymer myself. The criticism of Hollywood and celebrity culture that is plaguing the world these days was really apropos. Every dialog had a meaning and was important to the plot. The satirical humor was mind-blowing. Grand Theft Auto 5 is a true masterpiece and a must-have for any gamer. That&apos;s why I&apos;m giving it a perfect 10/10 score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247566">Expand</a></span>

<br>GTA 5 is absolutely amazing and one of best games I&apos;ve played. There&apos;s a metric f*ck ton of content, the world is huge and looks fantastic. The game is very well optimized for PC, there are options for everything you can wish for and the controls are great. I&apos;ve never seen such a good console port and a game that is technically so close to perfection. The graphics are stunning and I get 60 FPS on a high-mid range PC.
<br>
<br>The story shows in an entertaining and satirical way how f*cked up the U.S. intelligence services are. Switching between the main characters offers a nice change of pace. There are also a lot of side quests, some with their own story and some generic, but all fun.
<br>GTA Online offers just as much content as the single player. Coop missions, races, PvP, side activities and now also heists, which are awesome if you can find a good team.
<br>
<br>---
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a pity you can&apos;t choose your own car for the story, as the default cars are very unspectacular. You can of course use another one, but you risk losing it during the missions, along with all upgrades - even if it was stored in the garage.
<br>The other thing that distracted me a few times is the weapon selection: Hot keys don&apos;t make sense, because instead of equipping the selected weapon, they cycle to the next weapon and equip that. Your weapon choices also aren&apos;t saved properly.
<br>
<br>GTA Online sometimes has connection issues and doesn&apos;t have any kind of cheat protection. Heists were a great addition, but unfortunately only the host can progress his heist quest. Rockstar Social Club is pretty bad all around (UI flaws, not enough server resources, lack of functionality).
<br>
<br>Sadly, the game also has DRM which forces you to go online every so often.
<br>
<br>===
<br>
<br>Overall GTA 5 is an outstanding game that sets the bar higher for the quality of all future games in most categories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5206810">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am loving 1st person and how you can hear every little detail of noise that is going on around you, if you are drinking from a bottle, to in the car or just walking outside in a busy or non-busy place.
<br>
<br>This game has made it to one of my favourite games of all time (on PC).
<br>
<br>I just can&apos;t wait to get back playing it when I come off.
<br>
<br>I give GTA V on PC a 10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5205545">Expand</a></span>

As a former game-lover and now game industry-critic, i want to say that this game is the complete opposite of what the majority of game studios are doing right now. The industry is full cheaply produced, unfinished and generally boring games. Some of them may be fun sometimes, but you can clearly see developers more and more caring about things like graphics instead of good stories or many details. GTA is - even though the graphics are great - the opposite. Never have i ever seen a game script so carefully written, with so many logical cohesions, details and great humour. Witty dialogues, a huge, open but yet fairly detailed world in which you can truly feel the passion and effort that was put into it. Nothing about this game resembles the current industry which is so great. Also, it&apos;s full of elaborate features and techniques which make the experience of Grand Theft Auto even more fun. Also, probably no developer except rockstar is able to kid american culture so well, and in a way that is not only relatable, but understandable. You clearly understand what is being teased, but yet you&apos;re not pelted with puerile and obvious jokes.
<br>
<br>Generally one of the greatest game experiences ever, and a true longtime-runner in my library, thus a solid 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5234031">Expand</a></span>

I found the player characters diverse, comical and endearing. Switching between them kept the experience fresh and engaging.
<br>
<br>This is the first game that really tested my rig, though I still managed to stay north of 60 fps with nearly all settings maxed. Graphically GTA V dropped my jaw and gave me several &quot;The future is now!&quot; moments. Even my artist wife would stop to gawk and admire what was on screen.
<br>
<br>A great balance between mostly linear plot and sandbox rampage, I found driving and combat to be smooth with the right amount of challenge. My one game-play gripe is the clumsy-feeling pedestrian experience, where it is all to easy to accidentally jump face first into a wall that I intended to scale.
<br>
<br>I found the plot to be engrossing through the final scene, and can see myself retreading the story in a month or two. I originally was going to wait for the first price drop to purchase, but a couple videos of gameplay graphics at 1080p was enough to persuade my wallet to open. I have no regrets.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure if I can say that GTA V is my favorite game of all time, but I think its the best game I&apos;ve ever played. Would score it as a 97 if I could, so rounding up to a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5234641">Expand</a></span>

<br>In this era of poor quality ports, it&apos;s refreshing to get something on PC that has had a lot of work put into it to let the advantages of PC gaming shine. The game looks spectacular, playing at 65fps @ 2560x1440 everything maxed (except grass &amp; AA), it almost looks photorealistic at times. At least the city, environment, and cars. The people still look like rubber. Edit: My specs are core i5-3570k @ 4.4ghz, AMD R9 280x 3g VRAM, 8GB RAM, SSD, Qnix 2560x1440 monitor @ 120hz.
<br>Gameplay is a blast. I&apos;ve put in over 100 hours - on single player. And still haven&apos;t finished. I&apos;ve been taking my time, exploring, enjoying the activities and adventures. The level of detail, quality of models and textures, care put in, is all amazing. Take Dying Light as a comparison -- there are about 4 different building types, and about 10 different objects inside buildings, all looking the same  (chest, basket, drawer, closet, first aid cabinet.) Still a fun game, but in GTA V I don&apos;t see models and texture being reused over and over. The massive, sprawling world is full of unique little nooks and crannies.
<br>The Online portion is fun, but sessions are often ruined by hackers. It&apos;s best to just play with friends. It loads painfully slow (on my SSD no less), and starting heists, the best activity, can be difficult and time consuming to get people invited and successfully started. Same with the random jobs. Even if you get someone to join you, it loads painfully slow, and if they glitch out, you bomb back to Freemode with yet another long load time. Sadly it seems most people in Freemode are just running around death matching.
<br>I didn&apos;t buy it for the online, but I consider it a huge bonus. At its best, GTA V Online, doing heists with competent friends WITH MICROPHONES, can be a totally wild gaming experience. Unfortunately only about 10% of people seem to have microphones, and they are crucial for coordination. Not to mention the goobs who bail halfway through a heist and bomb you back to Freemode. At its worst, GTA V Online is still somewhat entertaining; driving around and shooting at people and ramming them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5332727">Expand</a></span>

The keyboard and mouse controls are perfectly implemented, controller support is of course present. Even the haptic feedback from the Xbox One controller is perfectly translated from the console. The game offers a wide array of graphic options to customize your experience and take advantage of the powerful hardware the PC has to offer. The video editor feature is a lot of fun to play with, and you can even customize the radio stations with your own music! Rockstar took their time to iron out any mayor issues, so this is as good as it gets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5209616">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer had endlless fun and laughs when I was with my friends and gave me over 100 hours and counting and I still laugh my guts out.

Amazing game as the Grand Theft Auto series will always be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5320907">Expand</a></span>

<br>The use of mods (offline), complements the game, and your ONLINE mode there are no words. Simpleste the best game of all time.</span>

<br>
<br>Driving is better than the old one and there is much more depth in the missions. Object interaction is pretty awesome as is the world detail. I should note that I now have an Xbox controller I use for driving and mouse/keyboard when I need to shoot.
<br>
<br>Optimisation is fairly good too they spent some time polishing it for PC which is nice to see. 90% smooth performance on an i5 with an ageing 2gb 7870. Only minor downside is the 60gb download since my DSL is just average so it took a while to get it down, plus good thing I just upgraded to a bigger drive.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a contender for best game of the year no doubt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5235345">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Grand Theft Auto V was already considered one of the best video games of all time, but on a technical level this is in my opinion the absolute masterpiece in video game history. Its 60FPS and 4K support makes it miles ahead of the PS4/X1 versions. If you have a good enough PC rig then really do get it for the 60fps and 4k. A true masterpiece</span>

The graphics looks great, there are a s#it load of graphical options, to customize the graphics for your liking! The story is average, but long. Only negative in the game is that R* fighting against mods, latest patch disabled them all.</span>

You&apos;re giving one of the best games created a 0 because it isn&apos;t running on your computer.  So you aren&apos;t reviewing the game at all, you&apos;re reviewing your experience in trying to play the game which is not fair at all.  The score of the game shouldn&apos;t suffer because you can&apos;t play it.  If you&apos;re gonna blame something, at least blame the developers.  The game itself is fantastic, just give it time and they&apos;ll patch it.
<br>
<br>Now that that&apos;s out of the way, let&apos;s get on with the review. This is one of the most fun games I&apos;ve played, and online is outstanding with a group of friends or even random people.  The heists are a welcome change to the somewhat repetitive game modes/missions in Online.  The graphics, if you can max them out or get them close to max, are jaw-droppingly gorgeous.
<br>
<br>If I had to point out a negative, there are some minor glitches in Online that I&apos;ve noticed but that&apos;s to be expected.  They&apos;ll patch it and everything will be fine as usual.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t listen to the 0&apos;s, you&apos;re gonna enjoy the hell out of this game!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5197068">Expand</a></span>

This game seems to me like a combination of San Andreas and Vice City on very detailed graphics.The world is immersive and the graphics are amazing.The optimization of the game is the best if you put in balance quality of image and frames per second that you have.I recommend it!

I&apos;ve played GTA V on consoles since the release but have all the time just been waiting for the PC version and I can say that it was worth all the wait. Just download the latest drivers (which I forgot) and the game will run perfectly with just a mediocre computer. GTA Online allows up to 30 players and doesn&apos;t lag at all (if the players are in the same part of the world, still not that laggy). GTA V is a must buy and everyone with a decent PC should get it. The graphics and overall gameplay is massively upgraded from the consoles including animations, textures, particles, depth of field, motion blur, shadows, reflections, cars and pedestrian density and animals, just to name a few. The game also feels supersmooth in 60 fps compared to the console fps at 30 fps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5213754">Expand</a></span>

I have a relatively high end pc and have little issues, at 1920x1200 it runs smoothly with a Geforce 690 GTX but I did have slowdown when I tried to play on 2560x1600 resolution which is my monitor&apos;s native resolution.

<br>
<br>The world is huge, everything feels right, the physics, the animations, the graphics, the detail, the sounds.. Every little bit feels in the right place.
<br>
<br>The characters are quite unique and have their own story that the game tells you in a great way, the transictionbetween every character is flawless and innovative.
<br>
<br>The missions are extremely good, an easy 10, they&apos;re not rage inducing, they&apos;re extremely well designed, they barely have any flaws and the dialogue in missions is like it always was in GTA.. Amazing and mostly sarcastic funny.
<br>
<br>The story is probably the best in the franchise, with a decent ammount of choices and lot of explanation given so you don&apos;t miss any detail.
<br>
<br>The guns feel good, the world feels alive, the cars feel real, the NPC&apos;s feel alive and not for one second this game felt nothing less than a true masterpiece.. Easily the game of the century.
<br>
<br>An easy 10/10.. Probably one of my few 10/10.. Probably the first one since GTA San Andreas. (And that tells you something)
<br>
<br>About the PC Port.. Ye, it&apos;s simply quite amazing, the definite version of GTA V is on PC, either 60fps or 30fps, it won&apos;t matter.. The game is good both ways, it scales extremely well and has almost no issues. (Some small issues like some stuttering at the most) This game will also run in almost any PC, be it a cheap laptop or a old pc with a dual-core and a 9800gt or even a 5670.
<br>
<br>I played at 1080p on a 560ti.. You can easily achieve 60fps in a 560ti at 1080.. That&apos;s how well optimized the game is.. At medium settings btw.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5240020">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s more then enough though to contextualize the action. The sheer unmachted brilliance is Los Santos though. The amount of detail on every single corner in this games simply blows every other game maker out of the water. Even a hall of famer like skyrim tends to look like a sterile alpha compared to rockstars world building. just stand at a crossing for a couple of minutes and watch  this world being alive.
<br>
<br>As usual the soundtrack alone is a reason to buy the game. heard the online part is a lot of fun as well.

<br>I have only done one mission and have over 25 hours and I only got it Friday 17th April, It really is the best on PC but especially in 4K ....... 4K is no gimmick it truly is wonderful and you have to see it to believe it  . My time has been spent taking the world in, I am in no rush because its an amazingly detailed world to explore .
<br>I have been playing tennis wife the wife ( which is awesome ) and then going a spin in the car all in first person, playing in FP in GTA is so immersive and I have rarely took it off the setting because they nailed it .
<br>You have skills in this game that increase over time by using them but you can go to gun ranges and take flying lesson to increase them faster before a job .
<br>The story looks class and 3 characters are all equally interesting ............. no point reading any of this, just get it .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5208123">Expand</a></span>

Considering how well the game looks, I&apos;m surprised. The optimization was done so well. Driving in general is tons of fun, missions are hilarious and well thought out and the combat system is fantastic. The addition of first person mode is also a welcome treat.

<br>
<br>First of all I would like to say that I managed to download the patch before the servers supposedly went down. When I got in the game it was a bit laggy at the beginning but that is because my PC is not amogst the strongest machines out there by far. The game has very in depth graphical settings so after tweaking some, it felt incredibly smooth. What surprised me was the fact that the game seems to be running smoother with vsync on which is not the case with most of the other games but then again it might be only me and my PC.
<br>
<br>The controls might feel a little bit wonky. Especially having the special abilities set to caps lock might get very annoying. So I would recommend looking in the key bindings and playing with the for a little bit till you find something that works for you. Or you can play with a gamepad.
<br>
<br>GTA V is a very well made port. Which is a nice change after GTA IV. The optimization is great. And although it still has some elements from the console version that might not feel too great, the gameplay is amazing. I would maybe make some small improvements the driving model. What I also like about the game is that they brought back some stuff that was lacking in GTA IV like car customization. That was one of the best things to do in San Andreas and I was really sad when I found out it was not going to be in GTA IV. They also made some really big improvements to the multiplayer which is a blast with friends. One more thing I would like to point out is the first person mode which completely changes the way the game is played and it feels a lot more immersive.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t gotten far enough in the story to be able to fully review it but so far it is pretty intriguing.
<br>
<br>With all that said if you are wondering whether or not to buy this game I would recommend that you do. without any doubts. It is well worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5192431">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay, and the story, you can call it yourselves from the console version. By far, this is the perfect game for PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5196080">Expand</a></span>

<br>Technisch ist GTA5 auf dem PC hervorragend. kein anderes spiel hat eine so gute performance auf alten wie neues Systemen, mit diversen Einstellungen k&#xF6;nnen selbst Alte Computer fl&#xFC;ssig und ohne ruckeln oder anderem spielen. Auf Highend Rechnern geht es dann richtig ab. Die unglaubliche Sichtweite des Spiels giebt einem immer das Gef&#xFC;hl nur ein Winziger Teil in einer Grafisch sehr Sch&#xF6;nen und Riesigen Welt zu sein.
<br>
<br>Der Online Modus ist Natlos, auch hier konnten die Entwickler ihr k&#xF6;nnen demonstrieren, die Openworld funktioniert Lagfrei und selbst bei einem verbindungsabbruch zum Host geht das spiel Natlos aleine weiter, keine unn&#xF6;tigen &quot;Verbindung unterbrochen&quot; nachrichten oder dergleichen. Das Lobbysystem ist einfach und gut zu f&#xFC;hren, lediglich die langen ladezeiten im Online Modus fallen mir st&#xF6;rend auf, aber bei der Masse an Content nicht verfwunderlich.
<br>
<br>ich gebe GTA V definitv ein 10/10
<br>Dringene Kaufempfehlung f&#xFC;r jeden Open World Spieler.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5201316">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I don&apos;t care they took 1.5 years to make it to PC or delayed it for 2 month. It was well worth the wait, and I&apos;m even glad I got a much better game than the console version thanks to that.
<br>
<br>I had some hiccups cracking open the game to play for the first 2 hours but that memory is long gone thanks to what was inside the game.
<br>
<br>In the sea of crappy AAA titles copy-pasted every year with gazillion DLCs to milk the gamers to death, this game shines like a diamond so I just HAD to make a review of it.
<br>
<br>GTA has been around since 1998 and a core franchise of Rockstar but there have been only 5 main titles yet, which says something.
<br>
<br>Thank you Rockstar, not just for the wonderful game, but for the respect you&apos;ve shown to us. 11/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5196032">Expand</a></span>

<br>Developers dont want to port games because you people slander their product without ever having tried it.</span>

The game is very well optimized and has already been patched 2 or 3 times in the 2 weeks since release to fix crashes/bugs/minor performance issues. This is Rockstar&apos;s best release in their history.</span>

<br>
<br>I am frankly quite astonished that the game runs perfectly smooth, with everything maxed out. It looks really pretty, and quite honestly much better than any console version I have seen.
<br>
<br>There was a small issue with the game crashing at one certain part of the map, but since I am not a moron, I understood this had to do with a corruption issue of one of the *.rpf files. I verified my game cache through steam, and it found two files which needed to be reacquired. After this, the game has run flawlessly.
<br>
<br>My gaming experience has been wonderful, and I really enjoyed the story. Now what I have left to do, is larking about, causing havoc. :-D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5211145">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s something unique about GTA, which transcends the limits of a simply great game. Tapping into the core of modern humanity; the ability to speed, steal and slaughter with reckless abandon is the purest incarnation of our inner desire.  As expected, Rockstar delivers the next level of the series with the high quality we&apos;ve come to expect, all the while keeping true to their style; overlaid mockery of our societal values, leaving no aspect of our culture untouchable, including themselves.  This PC port contains a few bugs, which I expect will be ironed out in time.  Only thing I could wish for is owning better hardware to experience the game in its full glory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5197886">Expand</a></span>

Character models look improved, the first person mode is improved, more over all, there is the new Rockstar Editior in which players get to make their own mayhem. The game supports mods, and a lot of them will be popping up on community forums, and many websites. The game looks better than ever, the lighting is spot on, and everything runs at smooth 60 fps and Ultra 4K. If you have a good rig, GTA V will look spectacular, it is a game to be played if you haven&apos;t already (are you living under a rock!). Rockstar has given a new meaning to PC Open World Games, and one that delivers what is promises (4K, 60 fps, better graphics, improved textures, lighting, controls, first person mode improvement). This game never gets old. Part of the reason why it has been released 3 times now. Go get it! 10/10 Masterpiece!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5193067">Expand</a></span>

<br>For my version... Runs smooth as silk. I own this game on PS3, PS4 and now on PC. Of those launches the PC is by far the smoothest. All server wait times are faster, I don&apos;t get kicked incessently. A few issues trying to get in servers with crew members but they might have been full or something. I&apos;ve seen some janky cars around during some missions but other than that smooth as hell. Graphics are gorgeous, first person shooting and driving feels fantastic. First person shooting feels just about as good as dedicated FPS&apos;s, but the game has so much more.
<br>
<br>Single player is fantastic, online is fantastic. Loving finally getting to play this game with my PC friends. Brought my character over from consoles, went nuts on the server, drove my mental state into the abyss and spent about $30k in ammo. Worth every penny. get this game...thru steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grand-theft-auto-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5193949">Expand</a></span>
