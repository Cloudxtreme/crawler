The campaign is short, but the four classes and large variety of weapons and equipment to choose from makes missions a joy to revisit.  The graphics are dated but perform well.  Animations are smooth and the game hardly slows down with tons of crap on the screen.  I recently purchased this game through Steam, and boy, online is dead.  I haven&apos;t tried to play the campaign co-op, but I could not find a single person to play survival.  This is a shame because this is clearly a game designed around co-op play.  Your AI squad mates in the campaign are competent, but things would go so much more smoothly if I had a human player or two.  The survival mode is a wave defense game type that is also highly replayable.  The downside here is, unlike the campaign where you have multiple classes, you can only choose one class for survival - the trooper.  You can still equip him with the trooper specific unlocks you acquire for him during the campaign, but why the developers chose to limit class selection for this game type is beyond me.  It severely detracts from the game&apos;s lifespan.  Since this game has been out for a while, I&apos;m beyond hoping they will patch it in.  If you have some friends to play with or are simply dying for some chaotic old school shooter mayhem, pick this one up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/earth-defense-force-insect-armageddon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2245485">Expand</a></span>

The missions are pretty basic: Go here, destroy that, have a stand off with swarms of giant bugs and alien robots, ect.  Nothing complicated.  You pick (or unlock) one of 4 slightly diversified classes.  Trooper, Tactical, Jet, and the big nut buster brute.  Each, of course, has it&apos;s pros and cons.  Next, you have 2 weapon slots to fill with about 6 classes of weapons, everything from SMG&apos;s and shotguns, to rocket launchers and sniper rifles.  As you progress, you can unlock/buy/pick up new weapons for each class.  The Tactical class gets to choose a third slot for turrets, mines, ect.  Now, onto the fight!  You have unlimited ammo....and for good reason.  The bugs and alien robots don&apos;t stop coming.  Swarms.  Massive waves of pincers, mandibles, webs, acid, and plasma.  You do, however, have to reload.  It works almost like Gears of War, except when you hit the bonus section on the reload bar, the only bonus you get is a faster reload.  That&apos;s good enough for me, because just a few more seconds of not squeezing that trigger could mean being overrun.  Now, the baddies (well, not the ticks) can knock cars and such at you (much like the tank in L4D), but because the entire environment is destructible, and if you&apos;re quick, you can blow that Honda right out of the sky...or step aside.  Buildings, including the skyscrapers, will come crashing down with the right amount of explosive firepower.  Benefit? A clear line of grenade launcher fire at the next mass of ants. In addition to a deadly arsenal of bug busting guns, you may come upon a mech, tank, or turret every now and then.  The tank even has two gunning positions for your buddies.  Good stuff. I can&apos;t say it&apos;s hard to die (or at least lose the mission on Normal) because in the wake of insect guts left behind by your frantic firing, there might be health pickups.  If you run out of health, a buddy has to defib you (which the trooper does fastest).  Teamwork is key in this game, but not entirely required (such as L4D).  It&apos;s hard to set a demo charge on an anthill when nobody is blasting the ants off your back.<br>Bosses, or just &apos;the big guys&apos;, are rough.  You have quite the variety, and in most cases, more than one to fight at once.  Some can be hit anywhere, some have sweet spots, some have sweet spots that you have to wait for an opportunity to hit.  All will try to make your life hell.  Whether they shoot directly at you, or constantly drop lesser baddies to overwhelm you, they all have one thing in common: Squish the humans.  Many of these big guys are HUGE! (think Painkiller) For instance, the sweet spot opens, you fire your missile, and you watch the rocket......and watch....and hope the spot doesn&apos;t close before your rocket gets WAAAY up there.  Timing makes a big difference.  Oh, and it sounds like they took audio from Cloverfield or something for the really big bosses...that low pitched groan or &quot;wtf?! You shot me! That HURT!!&apos; scream every now and then really adds to the anxiety of getting out of the way.<br>My only real issues with EDF is that the dialog gets too repetitive. You know, the dialog that happens randomly just so it&apos;s not dead silence between fights?  The rest of the dialog, like from OPS, or Intelligence is clean, slightly humorous, and kinda pokes fun at mission based games with commo links between operative and intelligence.  I bought this on special for $15.  It was worth it to me (I&apos;m not very picky anyway).  Regular price, I believe, is around $20.  The trailer gives you a good idea of the action, but I would suggest trying this game out first before you drop $20 on it.  I think this is one of those games where you either love or hate it.  I love it, but I can see a lot of negative reviews coming from those that nit-pick about everything, hate themselves, and are never happy with anything unless it is perfect in every way and free.

I understand this game is not being sold at a full retail price. However I find it hard recommending this game to anyone at any price.
