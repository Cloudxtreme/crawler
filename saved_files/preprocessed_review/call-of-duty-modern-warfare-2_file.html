Oh maybe VAC will detect the PUBLIC hacks, and ban them a few weeks later...maybe. It just keeps being worse. Lack of a console to tweak settings or even to display your frames per second!!!! Laggy as f*ck, as expected with no dedicated servers. Worst of all, IW is ignoring the community, and even insulting our intelligence. Deleting threads and petitions on their forums. Also what would appear to me, having their employees or simply people they pay to blatantly lie saying how good the game is. All of this for $10 more then PC games go for.....what a rip off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743579">Expand</a></span>

The multiplayer on the other hand is complete garbage. The PC community was completely abandoned when dedicated servers were taken out, its not that the game is garbage really, its mostly that the loyal gamers were completely ignored. The community is completely destroyed. Meeting familiar faces is no longer do-able. Just another console game with a mouse, its all MW2 is. Stick with MW1 if you are a skilled fps player. Did I mention that the hosts get 0 ping, while everyone gets 70+ in every game? Really big disadvantageous if you ask me, not to forget to mention that the nub tubes are still in the game. And theres NO WAY to take them out. Skilled FPS are a thing of the past, its all about &quot;nice&quot; graphics and consumer dollars. Don&apos;t support this game, it was my mistake for not listening to the podcast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=744863">Expand</a></span>

It is hard to say which single player is better comparing mw2 to cod4 but the results would be pretty darn close. Special Ops was a nice edition, with enjoyable challenges and missions to complete. Multiplayer for this game was awesome but not as great as Call of Duty 4&apos;s multiplayer. The only issues making the game not fun and frustrating at times is the overpowered grenade launchers and one man army &quot;the perk&quot; that allows you to reload classes so you can gain back your grenade launchers for instance. And, sadly no dedicated servers, using the same system of online as the consoles. But forgetting these issues the multiplayer is a masterpiece. Well balanced weapons and superb map design. Hacking is also an issue. Challenge lobbies bringing you up to level 70 or max prestiges are hosted almost daily, along with those little noobs ruining matches using aimbot, godmode, etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2545334">Expand</a></span>

A little while back, I reviewed this game&apos;s prequel (Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare), which I hated at first, but then loved the next time I played it.  It was an insanely fun action game that must be experienced, in particular for its single player.  Its multiplayer was good too, but I couldn&apos;t help but feel like it was missing something.  Eventually, I decided that I wanted to play its sequel, so I downloaded it off of Steam this weekend.  So, does this game improve upon its predecessor enough to make me love it, or is Call of Duty 4 really the last good Call of Duty?  Let&apos;s find out.  The gameplay of this game is very similar to its predecessor.  It is a first-person shooter that has both single player and multiplayer modes of play.  There is also a cooperative gameplay mode this time around, but most of the missions in it are the same as those of the single player, just with one extra player.  In Call of Duty 4, I preferred the single player over the multiplayer.  I went back to play missions from the single player in Call of Duty 4 more times than I can count.  This time however, it is the exact opposite.  Here, I prefer the multiplayer over the single player.  The single player in this game is a continuation that picks up five years after the events of the previous game, and it is insanely fun to play through, like just about all of the early Call of Duty campaigns.  However, there are two major problems that hold this game&apos;s campaign back.  For one thing, the campaign is once again too short.  I completed it in only five hours.  Another problem with this game&apos;s campaign is that its story is terrible.  It is so convoluted and hard to follow, that I am always confused as to what is happening.  That did not stop me from loving the campaign from start to finish, but that was only because it was insanely fun to play through, and not because of the story.  As for the multiplayer, I feel like this is where all of the effort in making this game an amazing game went into.  The multiplayer of this game is actually better than the single player this time around.  Not only is this game&apos;s multiplayer better than Call of Duty 4&apos;s in every way, it is one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played.  It really is that good.  After playing this game&apos;s multiplayer enough, I finally realized what Call of Duty 4 was missing in its multiplayer.  There were not enough different kill streak rewards, perks, weapons, and other features.  To tell you the truth, after playing this game&apos;s multiplayer, I honestly felt like Call of Duty 4&apos;s multiplayer was just a beta version of this.  This game&apos;s multiplayer is much more fleshed out, and it also added Capture the Flag, the one mode that I felt was missing from Call of Duty 4.  Overall, the single player of this game may not be as good as Call of Duty 4&apos;s, but the multiplayer more than makes up for this.  This game is worth playing for its multiplayer alone.  As for the graphics, this game also looks fantastic.  They are not the best graphics I have ever seen in a video game, but they do look very good nonetheless.  This game pushes its engine to the limits of its graphical potential.  All of the environments and character models are rich with detail and very pretty to look at.  Overall, this game&apos;s graphics are every bit as awesome as its gameplay.  This game also has really good presentation.  On a high-end gaming PC, this game could look fantastic.  However, there are some troubles with the endlessly respawning enemies in single player.  I have never really had a problem with these in the past, however, this time I can&apos;t help but feel like there are too many.  I honestly have had a lot of trouble dealing with this many enemies coming at me at once, and I did not have this trouble in any of the previous Call of Duties.  However, this is just a minor complaint compared to how good the single player really is.  Overall, this game has excellent presentation.  Overall, this is a fantastic game, especially for multiplayer.  What most people are wondering is if this game is better than the original Modern Warfare.  I would say yes for the multiplayer, but no for the single player.  The single player of this game is still really enjoyable, but not as enjoyable as the previous game&apos;s.  I recommend this game especially to those who love a good first person shooter, action game, or multiplayer game.

I see tons of reviews bashing the community (which is horrible), but that&apos;s not the game&apos;s fault, so no points taken off for that. Balance, however, is a major issue. Most of the players use either the ACR, which literally has perfect accuracy, or an explosive weapon, which have earned their bad reputation. I&apos;ll take -2 off for that. And then, the latency issues. Even when my Internet connection is top notch, I still get the occasional 200+ ping while the host has 0. -1 for that. In the graphical sense, it actually strikes a nice balance between graphics and performance, and has given it a reputation of being able to run on nearly anything. I was able to run this on a Pentium core and a Radeon 4550 HD GPU, and the game looked quite good. If you are a fan of Call of Duty, get this game, but not for the multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4562243">Expand</a></span>

Theres no way to vote kick vote ban vote anything really, the best you can do is mute someones microphone but that doesn&apos;t stop racism. As of the last patch the game consistantly crashes and I get booted back to the initial screen. IW literally spit in PC gamers faces when they called the people who signed the petition to implement dedicated servers (250,000 signatures, more than you see online at any time.) If you have a cheater in your game, you might as well leave because your gaming experience will be ruined because there is no way to remove the cheater from your game. Yet at least, I would assume they would give the host the ability to kick players in later patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=744455">Expand</a></span>

Also perks are annoying. Especially commando, being knifed from across the room is not fun. The singleplayer was good for but nothing special and nothing that will stick to you memory. All in all I give this a 0. The gameplay is plain terrible the the horrible anti-cheat, hackers, and down right annoying things.

                                        <span>Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 is an action packed game full of gunfights, explosives and objectives. The problem I see with the game, is the unbalanced guns in the Multiplayer and the lack of features from the previous CODs (such as Zombies). Other than that, the game runs very well and will be fun for most people.</span>

Then you will have the true definition of fail.  Infinity Ward is the better developer of the two companies that battle back and forth developing the CoD series. I&apos;m willing to bet that most people are not even aware of that, Treyarch gives Infinity Ward a bad name.  Infinity Wards games; &quot;MW1&quot; &quot;MW2&quot; &quot;MW3&quot; are far better than any of Treyarch&apos;s &quot;Black ops series&quot; hands down.  I have been playing CoD since the very first release several years ago back in the WW2 era of CoD.  Most people didn&apos;t even start playing until the first CoD 4 Modern Warfare came out, the overall feel of MW2 is great, the physics are great, graphics sound are great. I feel that the multiplayer is very well balanced online, if it ran like  then maybe your pc isn&apos;t up to spec?..if you bash the game saying its unfair or unbalanced maybe you should switch up your tactics a bit instead of raging around looking for that kill?..I have never had any issues playing this online..I always had a blast.  I&apos;m clearly reviewing this from a quality aspect..how well the game play is designed, how well the game is structured.  Bottom line MW2 to this day is still one of the best CoD games to this day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3905787">Expand</a></span>

As for the game&apos;s infamous multi-player mode, the weapons were unbalanced and every now and again you&apos;d run into a hacker or a modded lobby. The multi-player was hugely addictive, it was similar to the one in CoD4, but for some odd reason it was just so much more fun. The maps are fantastic and it was great fun running around with a sniper rifle trying to quick-scope people. Theres also tons of easter eggs in this game of little hiding spots and ways to get on top of maps like on the map &apos;Karachi&apos; and &apos;High-rise&apos; there are little ways to get onto roofs that might not have noticed. Overall the game could be frustrating at times and the guns unbalanced, this game was just incredible fun to play and I honestly don&apos;t know why.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952435">Expand</a></span>

<br>You cannot release a game with a full single-player mode and then say: &quot;It&apos;s all about the multi-player&quot;. Some people actually don&apos;t care about MP so you cannot be a unbiased reviewer and only talk about one part of the game.
<br>So let&apos;s begin with the single-player. It is a complete mess. The AI is beyond stupid, they will just run at you until gunned down. They won&apos;t use strategy, they won&apos;t use cover, they won&apos;t flank or even do much to kill you at all. The sound design makes the guns un-satisfying to use as they lack any real impact.
<br>The story is your usual &quot;America good. Middle-East terrorist.&quot;. It&apos;s getting tiresome running around desert-filled streets shooting anything that isn&apos;t white. The story is presented in such a bad way that you have to piece together the whole thing by yourself. It took me more than one playthrough to even understand what was going on. Characters don&apos;t act realistically so you will never understand their motivations. It seems they came up with a half a dozen set-pieces and just built the story around them.
<br>In the first Modern Warfare it was shocking when your character died in a nuclear explosion so naturally, they thought that they would try to recreate that in this game. You are killed (as part of the story) about 4 times. I really hope that I misunderstood this because it&apos;s not surprising when you do it every 10 minutes.
<br>And speaking of minutes, there aren&apos;t that many in the story. The main campaign might take you 4 or 5 hours. This is unacceptable and absolutely pathetic.
<br>Alright, multi-player. It&apos;s broken. The weapons are so imbalanced that less than a dozen guns are actually used by players and if you try to use anything else you will be mauled to the ground like a baby by a dozen rabid pit-bulls. Rewarding kills with even more ridiculous ways to kill people is just plain stupid. If you are not extremely skilled  at this game you will be killed repeatedly by the same guy and when you think you can kill him, he comes back in a chopper. And then he drops a nuke on you. The maps are awfully designed and don&apos;t encourage anything other than the run and gun technique. They are way too small and cramped and the amount of players on each server is laughable.
<br>You also don&apos;t have any dedicated servers, you can&apos;t kick/ban, you cannot choose maps and so on. The FOV is freaking ridiculous as well and it gives me eye-strain just looking at it for half an hour.
<br>This game is a mess and Activision must have been sucking off a lot of critics out there to recieve an 86 on Metacritic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3481060">Expand</a></span>

The single player isnt the issue its action packed and has a few decent twists. The Mutlitplayer is another story, the lack of dedicated servers completely kills the game for me and the replacement often send you into rubbish servers. To add insult to injury the amount of DLC for this game means that every other map im kicked out of the server due to a map i haven&apos;t bought being up next.....if only there were dedicated servers so i could stick to a server that didn&apos;t use the DLC maps.
<br>
<br>If i could rate the single player and co-op alone it would receive a 8/10 its a little short but the spec ops makes up for that and some of the challenges and timed events are good fun.
<br>However the shocking multiplayer which would get a 0/10 drags the whole experience down, if the call of duty games didnt rely so shamelessly on multiplayer to be worth the money they cost maybe i could justify buying them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3245651">Expand</a></span>

IW has added a CO OP option which sets you in places  from the campaign and offers a challenge like fighting off a bunch of solders in protective armor with only explosives or fight off hordes of enemy&apos;s in a building with you&apos;re friend even on veteran difficulty it&apos;s pretty fun. And the multiplayer is a mixed bag there is overpowered guns and killstreak and cheap death streaks such as you go into a last stand with you&apos;re pistol or when you die you drop a grenade and then there is One man army with it equipped  you can switch to a different class at any time  is   people over use it and attach a grenade launcher on their assault rifle and every time they run out of ammo they switch over to their one man army and equips the SAME CLASS WITH A GRENADE LAUNCHER AND ONE MAN ARMY AND DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! so would i buy it? yeah you can find it a gamestop for 12 or 11$  Pre Owned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3412544">Expand</a></span>

<br>Multiplayer isn&apos;t really special but it also a great deal of fun, too bad now days it&apos;s mostly filled with hackers.
<br>I&apos;d say one the best features of the campaign is the different surroundings and like I said the story-line itself.
<br>Also every Call of Duty game since MW2 is pretty much the same.
<br>It&apos;s not getting a full score because the story is short and linear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3827916">Expand</a></span>

The game is produced as the first of Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The first game in the series was simply perfect, but the second failed to be quite so good as some reviews say. The story is not perfect, but it seems for little kids, I would say more but it would be ok to not give spoilers. The gameplay is simply awesome, the game uses the same graphics engine just improved. Graphics is also improved and bring great pleasure over the campaign. Game sound is ok, as well as those who have contributed voice acting. In conclusion the game worth playing, it is a good FPS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4803347">Expand</a></span>

This game have all of these, I can release my stress with it. but story is also awesome. I really love this story. It seems like well made Hollywood movie. More them five years passed since it was came out but still, it is a best game of my life .</span>

This inherently is a playable game, but the over the top shenanigans and terrible online capabilities are a slap in the face towards gamers and military personnel like. Infinity Ward is done, and Activision brought this on themselves.</span>

Even then, I was disappointed how Infinity Ward could brush aside their PC gamers like this. No dedicated servers, no lean, no PC specific anything. The lean and the rest of the stuff PC users lost I can deal with, but for the love of god bring us a patch with DEDICATED SERVERS! If this does not happen, I will no longer support Infinity Ward, and I know many others won&apos;t either. It&apos;s foolish to take the Xbox game, and slap a PC badge over it. Shame on you Infinity Ward. We may not be the biggest purchasers of your game, but we are the ones that started it all and made you what you are today.

Stop trying to rewrite history claiming Call of Duty is all about multiplayer. It wasn&apos;t until AFTER COD2 that I.W. realised the following the multiplayer had on PC. However after being mildly disappointed with COD4 MW1 because of the rather idiotic AI (both friendly and enemy) and quite disappointing set pieces (not a patch on those in COD and COD2) imagine my disgust to find that I.W. has done absolutely nothing to address either of these issues and indeed have now added a non-nonsensical story to go with even crappier set pieces and unbelievably it seems they have made the AI stupider! (I know it&apos;s not true but WOW does it feel like it) the sheer idiocy of the AI will leave you breathless. Turning up the difficulty just seems to result in more enemy AI targeting you, even if one of your friendly AI&apos;s is literally 1 meter from them and you&apos;re on the other side of the map. Simply Stunning in it&apos;s ineptitude and laziness. Even HALO&apos;s AI craps on this from a great height. I.W. had me with COD and COD2. They showed me the future with COD4 MW1, and it came to pass with MW2. Absolute crap. Save your money and wait for Battlefield Bad Company (I can&apos;t believe I just endorsed a Battlefield game! See what you&apos;ve made me do Infinity Ward!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743535">Expand</a></span>

Also the multiplayer is just laggy and bleh, If you like FPS games, but want a more challenging multiplayer/bigger maps go buy Bad Company 2, its not as popular, but i think its just because Call of Duty is way to heavily advertised, the game developers just want our money, (also the price is rediculous, and they just use the same graphics animations and sounds as the other call of duty games just a little improved, and if you watch gameplay of the original call of duty when you shoot someone they do the exact same thing in this game)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462946">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> just few words. Single player in my opinion is too short. I&apos;ve finished it in just 4 hours and the end is so foreseeable. Multiplayer without dedicated server, without anticheat is shit; too much lag and too much hackers. Very good work iW. i think that it&apos;s the worst cod that i ever played.</span>

Historia absurda para mentes absurdas. Infinity podria haber mejorado este juego en su totalidad y hacerlo mas atractivo, pues es bastante oscuro y existe poca diferencia de uniformes con el enemigo. NO VOLVERE A COMPRAR NADA MAS QUE SEA BASADO EN STEAM y de INFINITY WARD MIRARE ANTES CON LUPA SUS NUEVOS PRODUCTOS. Gran decepcion en Multijugador por sus cortes de servidor, su modo dictatorial de enviar a server, escenario y equipo a quien se conecta. En pocas palabras.

MW2 I think got only 1 or 2 patches before they abandoned it (on PC), leaving the community with imbalanced weapons and unstable online support &amp; match making.  So far im seeing a handful of issues with online play and connectivity.  Survival is glitchy, often kicking your partner out of the game all together.  Skyrim had a patch on Day 1, just saying.  With the millions and millions of money that they made I hope they put some of it back into the community with patches and support.

The campaign took me about 2 hours to complete, and it&apos;s exactly the same gameplay as any other Call of Duty Game (You know, you&apos;re in a spot and eliminate the enemies, move on, breach a few doors, infiltrate some secret location for intel, etc.).  The Spec Ops levels were almost addicting as the player strives for high scores so that they can unlock more levels...  At times, both the campaign and spec ops can be extremely frustrating, but once you beat it, it&apos;s rather satisfying.  The visuals throughout the game are impressive and greatly customizable so that they run on low-end PCs and laptops...  But then, there&apos;s the multiplayer.  This is why people are critical of the game on PC.  It&apos;s highly addicting and very simple. Many skilled gamers find this worthless and a waste of time, but most gamers like the fact that you can get fast, non-stop action without the use of too much skill.  However, as in many PC multiplayer games, there are hackers.  This is where many negative reviews come in.   The hackers are not the fault of the game itself.  It&apos;s the people who hack that make the game worse.  The game itself deserves a high metascore for being an excellent addition to the series.  The hackers deserve the lowest metascore possible.  If you wish to enjoy the game without worrying about hackers, get yourself a MW2 Config program (search Google) and backup your stats!  And, in reality, only about 1 person in 10 lobbies hacks, so that&apos;s 9 good games in a row, then all you have to do is quit the lobby and join another one, and you&apos;re set!
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a great game with intriguing (but Short) Single Player and fun Spec Ops levels along with addictive multiplayer that make any gamer want to strive to achieve the highest level while completing challenges and acquiring prestige.  The graphics are good enough so that there is realism to the game but still customizable enough so that the low-end pcs can run this game without a problem.  If you are careful, you can have a lot of fun with this game.  BACK UP YOUR MULTIPLAYER STATS and you WILL have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2573136">Expand</a></span>

I am not scoring low because of IW&apos;s bad service or lack of dedicated servers. I am judging on the game itself. Infinity ward have 8 years under their belt, yet seem to only have mastered the very fundamentals of a basic shooter. There is nothing in this game that deserves the ridiculous hype it has received from such respected reviewers. In terms of the game in itself, it is fine and offers a few hours of fun, however, in the face of hundreds of other FPS games on the market, there is NOTHING to put this game ahead and earn any well-deserved hype. The game is completely featureless, and only seems to be the bare bones of what a shooter should start off as.. Only with average graphics added. It sits uncomfortably in the middle of the realism scale, not being too unrealistic for a fun game, and not realistic enough to be considered.. Well.. Realistic. There are many other games on the market which can also offer far more enjoyable online play (tf2, l4d, cs:s, arma, any other game, etc..) All in all, the game is a mediocre shooter which has the same gameplay as shooters released over 5 years ago. There is nothing to put it ahead of any other game on the market, as whatever aspect of a shooter you&apos;re looking for, it&apos;ll be better utilized in another game. Don&apos;t get sucked in by the hype. This game is rubbish</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=744000">Expand</a></span>

If you want fancy graphics, with a decently engaging storyline with FAR more availability for PvE action and tactical manuevering, (And dedicated servers lol) and have a computer to play MW2, I&apos;d advise you buy Crysis. Atleast you can then brag to your friends you have an as beautiful looking game (Cause that&apos;s all they care about apparently as we&apos;ve seen), that actually allows you to approach objectives in any manner you see fit, instead of running down the same narrow direction and admiring all the pretty colors around you. I was thinking of giving this a 1 rating, simply because I got to see Russians invading America, but then I realised that would contribute to anything but considering this game is a total utter failure and waste of 60$, which is exactly what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743268">Expand</a></span>

For one thing, the spawn points are far more random instead of being vaguely on opposite sides of the map, so now you may end up having someone spawn directly behind you OR you may spawn on a grenade and so on. It just was shoddily done and the respawn system should of had a lot more work done. Knifing is just ridiculous in this, sure it should be a little viable at least for screwing around, but right now it&apos;s pretty much dominating, how is sneaking around stabbing everyone even remotely how modern warfare is carried out? Noob Tubing is still existent in the game, one of the only other real problems in the first modern warfare (the other being martyrdom and how rampant it was) and it isn&apos;t entertaining when players will just rush in, use up their grenade launcher shot and then die, usually killing someone else in the process. All of these and more could of been alleviated slightly more if the PC version had dedicated servers (moderators to keep things in check and custom rules, along with people knowing where they can go when they just want to play with a specific ruleset). Also no modding = less replayability for a game after you&apos;ve gotten all you can get out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=740738">Expand</a></span>

The campaign was extremely good and very fun with some jaw dropping moments such as the invasion of Washington DC. The graphics are truly amazing with events such as said invasion of Washington DC looking hellish and very real with recognizable monuments such as the Washington Monument and the White House being partly destroyed. The multiplayer which, oddly enough, is the main attraction, is very fun, I found it extremely unbalanced at times and plagued with glitches. The new weapons, attachments, and perks made it much more fun. While not at the same level as say, Half Life 2, it still is a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1362175">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is better as you level up and the special ops will challenge your skills in evading, defending, attacking, support and many other ways.</span>
