Pride of nations is set in the Victorian / Industrial Age between 1850 and 1920. The game focuses on leading one of eight nations to glory through warfare, colonization, diplomacy and trading. If you are already a fan of some of the other Ageod games, you will feel right at home, but the UI will take some time to learn. This is painstakingly also one of the games shortcomings. If you are a newcomer to the Ageod games you will feel frustrated because of the how little you will actually learn from the tutorial and how much you will have to learn by making mistakes by playing the game. Warfare is handled the same way as in former Ageod games, you move counters around like a board game and it will show you how many days it will take for a unit to get there. Each turn is 15 days. If you are familiar with Victoria II than the combat is far superior in Pride of nations. Terrain, weather and supply plays a huge important role when doing warfare. All in all i give this game 7 out of 10, i would have given it higher but bugs in its current version makes the game near unplayable. Lucky enough you can go to the pride of nations forum at the paradox forum and grab the latest beta patch 1.01F (it is steam compatible). Which makes a huge difference!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pride-of-nations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1672780">Expand</a></span>

<br>This portrays the Victorian Age in a cartoonish fashion, with warfare as an afterthought. But don&apos;t get too encouraged, the economics and political complexities are lacking. The turn-based mechanics of the game give the AI incorrect calculations and they do odd things more often than not. Multiplayer is incompatible with Windows 8 and more than 2 players the game CTD&apos;s every five minutes or so. The sprites need an upgrade as well. not to mention the complicated and outdated GUI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pride-of-nations/user-reviews?user_review_id=3110452">Expand</a></span>
