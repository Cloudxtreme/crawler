<br>
<br>But ... i found it to be quite boring after too short a while.
<br>
<br>The positives:
<br>- great optimization - runs amazingly well on low end computers
<br>- great customization/options
<br>- clear UI with most informations readily on screen
<br>- very good combat mechanics with enemies signaling attacks in a mostly fair way
<br>- good death mechanic with real punishment
<br>- excellent salvage mechanics
<br>
<br>the negatives:
<br>- it felt VERY repetitive - not only because the game is a huge trial and error run - but also because a lot of enemies require very similar tactics ... and the enemies are not exactly spaced much. So i felt like fighting like 10 identical dudes with 2 handed hammers one after another in very similar environments - which of course - became rather dull quickly.
<br>- grinding - yes, there is a lot of grinding involved that is not the best kind of grinding....
<br>- unimaginative upgrade system - and the upgrades offer no real feedback in terms of increased power (usually they just remove a little more health from the enemy per hit)
<br>- very little variance in visuals - but maybe it is cause i did not get THAT far in the game. I would have loved to see more enclosed or even fully enclosed exo-skeletons, armor parts with more utility gadgets
<br>- no ranged weapon (aside from a drone pea-shooter) .. yes, that was a great disappointment for me. So the game does not allow sneaking or sniping - nor real tactical movement. If you want to get from A to B ... and there is an enemy in between - you pretty much have to melee it.
<br>- no character customization ... i do like to pick gender and looks of a character. But if that is not offered - i am usually happy if the character is at least somewhat exciting. (and i do not mean in a heroic way, but maybe he should not look like a 90s janitor on pain meds and acute depression)
<br>
<br>My conclusion:
<br>
<br>Technically good - and those that enjoy the melee are well served. There is not much variation though... ( pull, dodge, hit, dodge, dodge, hit - repeat)
<br>
<br>If you want a little more free will and possibly a greater focus on story - this is not for you.
<br>
<br>For me personally - it is average ... but not more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7447841">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After the novelty of the combat wears off, the game offers very little in terms of motivation to finish it or even to play it again.
<br>Worse, the flaws in the combat and the supporting systems become glaringly obvious after a couple of hours, destroying even the last bit of incentive to play.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, this game is ok to buy right now if your really enjoy 3rd person action combat but don&apos;t care about anything else (i.e. story, plot, characters, level design, balancing, other activities than combat...)
<br>If you have standards, but still want something new to play with, buy this once it&apos;s on sale.
<br>For anyone new to the genre, this is definitely not worth full price, probably not even worth getting on a sale.

<br>Robot Souls
<br>The Surge is a souls like rpg all about the grind
<br>Here you play as either a technician who&#x2019;s agile and quick or a brute who does more damage but is slower,
<br>Each have their own advantages and disadvantages of course, I chose to play as a brute.
<br>I was surprised how much I initially enjoyed this game&#x2026;
<br>This game is definitely challenging but not quite at the level of the souls game or nioh&#x2026;
<br>The maps are fairly self-contained and compact here&#x2026;
<br>This makes it very easy to memorize enemy locations when it comes to the grinding and crafting portion of the game
<br>the combat with regular enemies is pretty decent and feels fair.. at least when its one on one&#x2026;
<br>you can lock onto them and target specific body parts to attempt to saw off certain gear&#x2026;
<br>Sometimes you&#x2019;ll get new gear like weapons&#x2026;
<br>but mostly you&#x2019;ll just get parts along with other scraps to craft armor from schematics you find in the world&#x2026;
<br>there&#x2019;s really no true loot system here&#x2026;
<br>The scraps are essentially your souls..
<br>And like in the soul&#x2019;s game if you die you have to go recollect them...
<br>But you are able to bank them in your medbay which is where you go to heal, level up, install new implants for added perks like consumable health, craft new weapons and armor, upgrade them, and refill your consumables&#x2026;
<br>Leveling up just requires scraps while crafting and upgrading requires scraps as well as random items you have to pick off of enemies based on luck of course&#x2026;
<br>and also like the souls games, going to this room respawns every enemy you&#x2019;ve killed which is a gift and a curse..
<br>A gift because you can grind...
<br>worlds are small and bosses are brutal&#x2026;
<br>youre definitely going to grind for levels and upgrades...
<br>a curse because once you do finally make it to a boss theyre all in your way trying do some damage to you before you even get there&#x2026;
<br>But before we get to the bosses..
<br>There is definitely some cheapness going on outside of them&#x2026;
<br>Things don&#x2019;t really start getting cheap until the 2nd section of the game&#x2026; here you get a drone friend which is nice&#x2026; though to use them you have to fill up your energy bar a bit, but by time that happens you&#x2019;ve usually already killed the enemy.. So it&#x2019;s pretty useless&#x2026;
<br>but this is where enemies start using ranged gun type weapons that you can&#x2019;t do anything about but take the damage and push forward...
<br>And there are no health pickups here... youre relient on your implants to replenish your health except for the extremely rare refill stations... and by rare I mean like 1 in a map&#x2026;
<br>But still it was fun to push forward, grind, find alternate paths, unlock shortcuts like demons souls so when you do die you can skip giant sections of the map to get right back to where you died
<br>These cheap moments were annoying and unfair... but I still didn&#x2019;t mind them.. At least not as much as the boss battles&#x2026;
<br>The bosses here aren&#x2019;t hard by themselves...
<br>Theyre pretty simple and easy to figure out...
<br>the difficulty comes in the games design both level and combat&#x2026;
<br>For starters.. Enemy attacks go right through solid objects... there is no hiding behind beams&#x2026;
<br>That aside, This combat system was not designed for the boss battles... at least not with both classes in mind&#x2026;
<br>the 2nd boss in the game is where I stopped&#x2026;
<br>And I did so not because it was a tough boss&#x2026;
<br>I knew its patterns, I knew how to defeat it...
<br>the problem was, as a brute... maybe this is just a brute problem&#x2026;
<br>But as a brute the problem was the timing of this bosses attacks&#x2026;
<br>Enemeis will telegraph their attacks..
<br>Give you some time to get out of the way
<br>But you&#x2019;re locked into animations here...
<br>You&#x2019;re able to dodge in combat, but only when you&#x2019;re not attacking&#x2026;
<br>And this boss demands quick hits and dodging...
<br>And this just isn&#x2019;t possible to do efficiently as a brute&#x2026;
<br>don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I&#x2019;d definitely get lucky and have a flawless first stage of this battle&#x2026; but the 2nd stage when you have to attack it from underneath is when things really start to get unfair because your character doesn&#x2019;t get out of animation fast enough for you to have time to dodge the near insta kill slam this enemies does when you&#x2019;re underneath..
<br>Cause theres bad hit detection
<br>Both from enemies as id randomly lose damage during fights without being touched, and from you as your attacks will do nothing at times especially to bosses&#x2026;
<br>Based off of what I saw though, The Surge is still a good game&#x2026;
<br>its addictive in the way the souls games are&#x2026;
But at moments it falls into the category of unfair more than it does challenging and that sours the addictive and great moments that are here too
I give The Surge
a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7304830">Expand</a></span>

But it&apos;s such a lower quality combat that I just wish I was playing Bloodborne instead. Bosses feel gimmicky so they kept that going from Lords of the Fallen (which I consider a superior game to The Surge). Characters or places have no feel to them, like I finished the game last week and I can&apos;t recall what the places or characters were called while I can recite every single zone and character from DS1 that I haven&apos;t played in over 8 months.
<br>
<br>Overall, if soulsborne never happened it would be a great game, but that series just reigns supreme and nobody comes even close when it comes to this type of games and their depth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7329782">Expand</a></span>

I wish there was a bit more diversity in the level design and enemy types, but in general its very enjoyable to play. The combat feels fluid and fair, the weapon types are great, and the theme is refreshing. If you&apos;re a Darksouls / Bloodborne fan, you&apos;ll probably really enjoy this game.</span>

It&apos;s a bit weird to respawn (in Dark Souls it made sens) but the added counter to retrieve your scraps add a good pressure. It could be a major game and a step to a new fun and excitng IP. It&apos;s better than many recent released games (DOW 3 still a big disappointment to me, uninstalled it and gone back to COH2). Hope that it does well and that we can have a second iteration and what the hell, some DLC for this one. I&apos;m not done with it yet, and at 40 hours, i still have to finish the main story (i&apos;ve took my time to experiment different weapons, armor, upgrades, implants .... This is a must buy for people who love scifi, DS, rewards after difficulty ... The only downside, it could have used a bit mope diversity (some area are real mazes and it&apos;s hard to go back since it kind of all looks the same, but also making a real coherent universe). Well done Deck 13 !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7306899">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yeah, if you are a souls fan, buy it. If only to experience the beauty that is the level design of this game. I am not talking about beautiful visual setpieces, or breathtaking panoramas. No, I am literally talking about the design, and how much thought went into it.
<br>
<br>You think DS1 had beautifully interconnected level design? You consider that the peak of clever map design?
<br>
<br>Think again, because this game makes DS1 level design look like its **** amateur hour. There are, as far as I can tell, only 6-7 respawn points IN THE ENTIRE GAME. And its a big **** game, trust me. And it will never, ever bother you, because the entire map is interconnected. It feels like an actual superfactory made by an actual master architect designed for fast navigation. The second map literally has something north of 15 shortcuts, and ever last one of them meaningful and effective.
<br>
<br>On to the gameplay: The gamedesign is tight. Narrative and gameplay are perfectly intertwined. Everything in the game makes sense within the gameworld, especially the way progression works. Combat feels good. Its sharp, impactful and fair. Stamina system could be better; it functionality seems out of place; and with that I mean how the more stamina you use, the bigger the delay will be before it recharges. Very. ****. Annoying.
<br>
<br>Now, the enemy design; there are 2 types of enemies; the humans, and the robots. Both of these require a radically different approach and you will find yourself being smashed on by the robots often early game due to how different they fight from the humans. The humans fight like you; they will try to work on reactions if they are still thinking and just try to thrash you if they are brain fried. You just try to chain combos and use your reflexes to dodge their strikes. They are very souls-ish, and if you played souls, they will feel familiar.
<br>
<br>The robot enemies, and by extension 80% of the bosses, are a completely different case: Their attacks are brutally abrupt, and it is impossible to trade with them. If you try to fight the bots like you fight humans; with the git-gud philosophy of dark souls, well, prepared to get smashed several hundred times. I see many **** about the boss design, but there is nothing wrong with them;
<br>
<br>To win over robots, you must exploit their AI; it is designed to be extremely predictable. You can basically make the enemy do whatever move you like if you get to grasp the AI, and then abuse the end-lag of their attacks to sneak a hit in before setting up the next bait. Bosses are the same. The second boss for example; it has this fast leg smash attack with one of his 6 legs that can very quickly chip you down if you keep getting hit. The trick? The AI trigger happens the moment you step in range, but it doesn&apos;t track nor adapt, so if you dodge immediately to the leg next to it, the bot will just smash where you were half a second ago and you get to punish the hell into it. Its great design, not bad design, and is designed specifically to require even the most ruthless of soul vets to do it over multiple times.
<br>
<br>The main downside of the game is that weapon progression basically stops being a thing a quarter into the game. Now, all weapon catagories feel amazing, have great animations, and it really just allows you to play your style. But, there is always a clearly better weapon in each catagory; internal variety is non-existant. They all have the same movesets, all do comparable damage, and the real difference between them is their impact, their skill income and their energy gain, and between these there always tends to be one that wins at all of them anyway. Then you also have the drone system which feels completely useless to me because in a game like this, energy is much better spent on executions and energy heals.
<br>
<br>Compare this with no multiplayer, completely fluid character progression that can be completely redone at will, and the ability to grind every upgrade currency basically at will, and you do end up with a regretable lack of replayability.
<br>
<br>nevertheless, its an amazing experience, and I am giving it a 10 just because, must like the souls games &quot;It is a diamond despite its flaws&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7313852">Expand</a></span>

<br>I loved the level design and the enemy attacks, learning the layout of each level and every enemy&apos;s attack patterns and weaknesses was very satisfying. The first time you encounter a new enemy they seemed impossible, but as you learned their moves they all got easier, to  the point where I was clearing out whole levels without returning to medbay by the end.
<br>Tag a limb, block, parry first attack, jump back to dodge next attack, then dash forward into high low high combo, to finisher. Next victim.
<br>Then, just when you get comfortable and cocky destroying those enemies, you move on to the next level and have to learn a whole new set of moves and remember a new map layout.
<br>I loved nearly every minute of it (I nearly rage quit on the fourth boss fight, had to use google&apos;s help to get me through that one}.
<br>Seriously, I see all these bad reviews and it just obviously didn&apos;t click with some people.
<br>If you are good at memorizing complex patterns- like learning a new song on a musical instrument- and you are a focused and detail oriented sort of person like me, this game is a gem. If you need the GPS in your car to get to the milkbar and back, and you think the only way to beat an enemy is go back with a bigger gun, maybe look elsewhere.

<br>
<br>Runs wel on max settings (3570K RX480 average system) the mechanics are cool, the fighting is cool, unlike just about every console port action rpg released in the last 10 years it doesn&apos;t hold your hand.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t perfect, but it&apos;s a load of fun and i&apos;m giving it 10/10 simply because it&apos;s so refreshing to have a dev respect their audience, it&apos;s not dumbed down to thesame level as witcher 3, batman games or just about every other action rpg console port, in this the AI actually puts up a fight, unlike the witcher 3 or batman you CAN and WILL die if you screw up.
<br>
<br>just about every other action RPG you can chew on your mouse, roll your face over your keyboard and your guy will beat the enemy with all kinds of crazy moves, you don&apos;t make those moves, you aren&apos;t playing, games play themselves these days.
<br>
<br>This one, you play, just for that it&apos;s brilliant, devs don&apos;t do that anymore, they think we want cutscenes and games that play themselves.
<br>
<br>So thank you guys for making a game and not a movie with some minor interactions.
<br>
<br>Screw you batman, witcher 3, mass effect andromeda, if i want to watch a movie, i&apos;ll take my wife to the movies. The surge beats all 3 of you because it lets ME play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7305372">Expand</a></span>

Runs great
Smooth
it a good mix of Darks Souls and Lords of the Fallen with a touch of The Technomancer.
It has a slight learning curve but not nearly as hard as Dark Souls.  You will get used to it fast.
Using Xbox Controller and very comfortable with it.
Combat is great if you like Dark Souls kind of feel but a little easier.

<br>Menu is simple
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Audio Voices seems a little low
<br>Story could be more developing but still good.
<br>There could be some more graphics menu options
<br>FOV especially and Controller isn&apos;t slow but could use a sensitivity adjuster, but there is a Camera Adjuster to clarify.
<br>
<br>Worth $60 for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7304386">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Graphics is just good enough but game content is bad.
<br>- There is no Mission/Quest panel to  track or maps system at least.
<br>- Poor level design and gears system.
<br>- Useless conversation system from NPCs.
<br>If you Google any info about The Surge, less people play this game.</span>

<br>A worthy predecessor to the &quot;Souls-like&quot; family.
<br>For people who enjoy a challenge, Wanna get into a souls-like game but couldnt cause you couldnt get into the aesthetic of how Dark Souls and bloodbourne looked.

Quite possibly the worst Sin committed by The Surge bar none is that while in the Souls games, if you want your souls back you just avoid getting murdered so you can reclaim your bloodstain. In this game, you&apos;ve got a timer to get your **** back that can be very slightly refilled by killing targets, which is most likely just going to get you killed again, given the frankly heinous amount of damage enemies deal.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve been absolutely dying for sci-fi Dark Souls, It&apos;s okay at best, a cheap imitation at worst. I&apos;d recommend just buying or pirating the Souls games, and just waiting for a more promising contender.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7326416">Expand</a></span>

<br>Combat takes a well known and tested formula of Dark Souls and makes it, its own. It flows clean and feels so right.
<br>Graphics and visuals are two things. Unique and beautiful to say the world they created is something truly special is an understatement.
<br>Story honestly like I said I am not far enough in to truly say much but so far I&apos;ve found it extremely captivating and the intro sucks you in so hard and never lets go.
<br>
<br>I truly hope this company is just hitting its first home run and I hope they turn into the next big name in gaming. (Although let&apos;s hope they go the CD project red route and stay true to themselves in the process)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7305725">Expand</a></span>

People say the story isn&#xB4;t good , i must disagree . It could be presented better . Maybe it&#xB4;s because that there is a possibility that this can really happen with a bit of bad luck , i dont know. Great Game Deck 13.</span>

Every weapon just didn&apos;t have the the impact or the flair of Dark Souls weapons and there&apos;s no magic or Ranged weapons to use for when your melee weapon isn&apos;t cutting it, all you have is a terrible drone that does god awful damage. The grind to upgrade gear really gets boring as the game goes on and most significant upgrades are locked behind doors that you have to progress to get through meaning even if you do grind you can&apos;t over-level the content. Armor is basically useless as everything hits you like a truck and the level design tried to be like Dark Souls but failed pretty terribly. Sometimes you&apos;ll open like 5 shortcuts in a row and other times play for hours straight without unlocking a short cut leading you to have to backtrack or fight through the same enemies over and over if you die. The controls are pretty terrible as well forcing you to activate Damage boosters as you fight but having them be in the same category as your healing items, so not only do you have to pay attention to the fight but you have to scroll through all your consumables while you&apos;re fighting. With no way to bind healing and damage buffs onto different keys. (In Dark Souls for example, Estus could be bound to always being 1 button and consumables being a different one)
<br>
<br>Where as in Dark souls you have abilities at your disposal to deal with multiple enemies. (AoE spells, Grenade consumables, etc) the only thing you can do in the Surge is abuse the pathing, try to pull one enemy at a time and if that doesn&apos;t work pull them till they turn around and go back then hit them in the back. Which just leads to annoyance when dealing with multiple enemies as the lock on system is basically required for your character to not move like an idiot but he can&apos;t dodge 2 enemies for **** while locked on.
<br>
<br>I never really cared for the aesthetic and would&apos;ve preferred a more Warhammer 40k type of Sci-Fi Dark Souls over this futuristic Construction Worker art style. The story is given to you insanely slowly and it&apos;s not open to interpretation like Dark Souls, it&apos;s just a rather bland Post Apocalyptic setting with not much of a twist and lacks any interesting characters.
<br>
<br>As bad as Lords of the Fallen was I actually enjoyed that a lot more than this. Hard Pass from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7330655">Expand</a></span>

Now we have Sci-fi, which is refreshing in the genre. The game is not gloomy at first, she is actually quite bright, but we quickly moved to the nondescript walls of plants and there all becomes quite sad. The problem with this game is the monotony. In all. From the opponents to the design. Enemy types are few and their design monotonous, as they are boring. Opponents are not interesting, but hit you very well on any level hero. In General, the second location, the difficulty of the game increases. If the first location I was killing enemies in seconds, but since the second group starts dancing around the enemy: hit, jump, hit and jumped all the way up the strip xp of the enemy is at zero. Sadly. Here saves the combat system is excellent and not boring until the end of the game. The game is very dynamic, the hero moves briskly, even a rolled up. But one of the main innovations of the game is dismemberment, cut off the enemies limbs is very nice! Sometimes you do it to pick up the enemy any detail, and sometimes, to once again see a spectacular dismemberment.
<br>The Surge friendly game. Hero mobile, quickly uses first aid kit, and managed perfectly well with mouse and keyboard. Schedule does not cause excitement, but she well, don&apos;t, just average, although the game looks quite nice. The design is good, but, as I said, monotonous. Bosses also do not vijavat admiration. They do not surprise their design is also not surprising ,they are not original, not interesting. You bistor understand how to kill the boss and then start dull gameplay to reduce strips of xp from the boss, and bosses can kill you with just a few strokes. One mistake and you&apos;re dead. and again, the half hour to circling around the boss. If the combat system works fine with regular enemies, but bosses have just sadly beat.
<br>This game is a typical example of games for sale. Now the price is too high. But to buy the game is worth it! If you had your fill of Dark Souls series, then this game is for you. If you have not played Dark Souls, then try The Surge, to destroy the enemies is a pleasure!
<br>I want to praise the Deck 13 and Focus Home Interactive. For them, this game is definitely a new level of quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7330691">Expand</a></span>

While the combat is well done, the graphics are very well done and it boasts a smooth frame rate it is missing certain things and there are certain design decisions that make this game more of an exercise in frustration and a feeling of cheap deaths that make it one that should only be purchased on a deep sale.
<br>
<br>it&apos;s a shame that the story is buried under such frustrating design decisions.  There is no attempt to explain your respawning after death; no &quot;homeward bone&quot; to use to return to save point, requiring the installation of an implant to be able to see enemy health, extremely poor environmental cues for finding your way in a level.  And then there are the deaths that simply feel cheap.  As a Souls Like if you will, this game is far inferior to Nioh, another game that borrows heavily from the Souls series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7333508">Expand</a></span>

Theres a lot of weight to every action you decide to take and the game gives you a lot of leeway into letting you play however you want. If I was to rank the combat system alone, it&apos;s definitely more engaging then darksouls combat, but definitely not as smooth or interesting as nioh&apos;s combat.
<br>
<br>However, the combat has one giant flaw. The way the lock on system works in this game makes fighting more than one enemy at a time an absolute nightmare, it&apos;s a seriously annoying process to lock on to one enemy, completely drop the lock on, then hope it locks onto the right enemy, then focus on his weakspot, the entire action of doing that can take several seconds. The way the game deals with this is rarely ever forcing you to fight more than one enemy at a time, and making all the enemies very similar. It&apos;s no lie to say that 80% of the enemies you fight are functionally identical with different armor. Theres some robot enemies, but they are never frequent or interesting enough to break up the monotony of the actual 50th human enemy in a row.
<br>
<br>Grinding is literally required. Gears come in levels, and in order to complete an area you basically need the gear level of that area. If you were already doing no-weapon fatroll only challenge runs in darksouls, maybe this won&apos;t bother you, but if you want to enjoy the game, you are expected to do a fair bit of grinding for grinding sake.
<br>
<br>Everything is unpolished, it feels like nobody playtested the game, or they tested everything in isolation and then were like &quot;it works.&quot; and never tested how it works in each situation. Enemies frequently get stuck on objects, unable to move or attack. Enemies frequently hit weird bumps in the map and start uncontrollably vibrating. Whenever you enter an elevator if you walk in too fast the elevator wont register that you are in it, so you need to leave the elevator and walk back into it. Whenever you approach a terminal to use it, there is for some reason a small area in which it&apos;ll tell you that the button is a button instead of using the button. (seriously) So you&apos;ll have to walk a bit closer and try again. The Drone companion misses far too often for a mechanic you have absolutely no control over. (When you take out your drone it&apos;ll wait a bit then do it&apos;s attack which you can&apos;t aim or effect after you take it out, if the enemy is at a brisk walking pace it&apos;ll often miss.)
<br>
<br>This list goes on and on. Nothing works just as it should, everything is just a little bit buggy for the entire duration of the game.
<br>
<br>The areas are all on giant factory, and look nearly identical to eachother, no one area stands out as a particularly well designed or different experience. Often the direction the game wants you to go is completely hidden in a web of identical hallways. You&apos;ll go far far too long without reaching a shortcut, and the shortcut is always free of enemies for the most part. Often a single short cut will force you to wait through three to four psudo loading screens. (wait for the elevator, wait for the exolift)
<br>
<br>The game is 6 areas long, theres 6 bosses, the game did literally laughably so theres almost no chance of it getting DLC/Expansion/sequel. Which is too bad because theres just not enough content in t his game. The souls-like difficulty, the loss of tech scraps don&apos;t feel like a fun or planned mechanic (Even thoughthey were) they feel like padding to keep you playing a hilariously short game for longer so they could say it&apos;s 20 hours long instead of admitting it&apos;s got 8 hours of content.
<br>
<br>The bosses are the best the game has to offer, enemies that are completely unique and different, and... they kinda suck. It&apos;s really too bad. There&apos;s absolutely no indication of how exactly you are supposed to deal with any boss when you first meet it. In most games, even the hardest of games, your healthbar is forgiving enough or the bosses give you enough room that you can scout out the situation, get a feeling for what the boss is going to do, or what moves it has, where it&apos;s weakpoints are, and when it&apos;ll let you hit them. IF they have a pattern, or whatever.
<br>
<br>In the surge every boss has a fairly in depth process of picking at it till it dies, some bosess even have multiple phases with it&apos;s own specific process, and good luck figuring out what they are, you are trapped in a very small room and they will kill you in one or two hits. You can die several times upon meeting a boss without learning a single thing about the boss or what it does.
<br>
<br>5/10, it barely justifies continuing to play it to the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7316760">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is good in ways it doesn&apos;t even need to be - audiologs, NPCs, all with really good voice acting - and the story is appropriately interesting and grim. It also has fantastic level design. There&apos;s only one checkpoint per area and as you progress you open up new shortcuts to get back to it.
<br>
<br>I really hope this sells enough to warrant a sequel, because this is one of the best games I&apos;ve played in years.

<br>The Surge is a surprisingly successful Dark Souls clone set in a Sci-fi dystopian future.  Attempting to emulate one of the most unique and loved (equally hated) RPG genres is a huge undertaking and for the most part The Surge succeeds.   Dark Souls games are known for their brutally difficult combat, immersive environments, and unique self-overlapping level designs.  For two out of three of these items The Surge hits the nail on the head.   The same nerve racking, slowly expanding exploration you&#x2019;ve come to expect from a Dark Souls game is duplicated to near perfection.  New environments can be brutally tough until you&#x2019;ve run through them a few times.  The risk versus reward factor in exploration is clearly present.  Developers Deck 13 interactive also created a beautiful and intriguing dystopian world.   In slight contrast to Dark Souls, where the environment merely sets a tone, The Surge uses it to continue the narrative introduced in the opening cut scene.  While playing Dark Souls I continually find myself captivated and equally horrified by the enemies, environments and overall tone of the game but I&#x2019;m driven by Soul greed and completionist desires. With The Surge I&#x2019;m also compelled by the storyline.  On the less successful side is The Surge&#x2019;s combat. While fast paced, challenging and fun there is an overemphasis to emulate Dark Souls style combat.  Some weapons and attack animations seem artificially weighted.  Ranged combat is also severely limited.  The Surge is also missing a multiplayer component which has become both a saving grace for brutally difficult boss fights and a major dose of anxiety for when you are invaded, in the Dark Souls titles.  The Surge does however successfully incorporate some of its own nuisances into the scrap heap.  Rather than multiple classes to choose from, The Surge only has two.  You can however dramatically alter your stats by swamping implants at the medbay, The Surge&#x2019;s equivalent of a bonfire. When leveling up rather than locking in Stats such as Strength, the Surge has only one option, upgrade your power core.  This increases the maximum amount of power available to apply implants and gear.  Implants can greatly alter the way your character plays.  You can alter your energy and health levels, change your consumables and apply other skills by changing your implants. While exploring I would generally alter my implants for a prolonged survivability build, using skills such as regaining health during kills.  Then I would alter my implants for max health or damage for boss fights.  This gave me an exciting degree of customization not found in the Dark Souls games.  Ultimately the Surge is an exciting and successful addition to the Dark Souls Recipe.  With that being said, if you don&#x2019;t like the Dark Souls series, you won&#x2019;t enjoy this game.

The first playthrough took me roughly 6 hours and the boss fights weren&#xB4;t even the hardest fights. I got this game for about 40&#x20AC;, but within this 6 hours, i havent felt i spent my money well on this game. The weapon system featured a lvl system, which enhances your dmg the higher your lvl with said weapon class is (5 classes overall: one-handed, two-handed, stab, one-side attached and two-side attached). So after spending the major part of the game (the first 70%) with one-side attached, because i havent found one single weapon which might surpass my current dmg, i havent felt the urge to lvl another weapon class for another 4 hours, just to find out that it actually sucks and i waisted time. The story was ok at best, but the lack of enemy variety and difficulty havent got me play the ng+, and the fact that almost nothing would&#xB4;ve changed in the next playthrough, according to the most walkthroughs i found.
<br>Even though the combat system was new to me, i still dont think it is worth mentioning,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7389639">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re gonna go into this game, let alone rate/review it, I feel you need to go into it from an unbiased point of view; an open mind per say. Depending on your play style, combat can be a challenge to relatively simple; with a variety of different weapons you can switch among on the spot, whether you enjoy swinging a big hunk of metal around, or the quick style of poke in get out. It has so much to offer for however you want to play.
<br>Sure some enemies are difficult, and you may die to them several times, but that&apos;s how it is with so many games. You encounter a new enemy and you take your time fighting it; studying it&apos;s moves and what its weaknesses are. If you just rush right in expecting to beat it easily, then you have the wrong mind set. As with any game, your first time playing is going to be slower and more methodical because you&apos;re getting used to how it plays. Once you&apos;ve mastered enemies&apos; moves and weaknesses, then it becomes a bit easier on future playthroughs.
<br>Of course, this game isn&apos;t perfect; the one major case for me was that I got shot with a large projectile and it went through geometry it shouldn&apos;t have; and that was only once. Other than that, any time I felt cheated, I reevaluated how I went about certain encounters. Multiple enemies, try bringing them out one at a time; one enemy can two hit you to death; try again with different equipment and/or be more careful about how to fight them. No graphical glitches or anything like that, but even then, not every game is always gonna be perfect.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a game that plays like Dark Souls/Bloodborne, then don&apos;t play this game; but if you&apos;re willing to go into this with unbiased eyes and give it a genuine try because you&apos;re interested in it, then get it and play it for all it&apos;s worth.
<br>
<br>So from a majority of the lower ratings that I&apos;ve seen, so many people are hard comparing this to Dark Souls. You&apos;ve probably also done the same with Lords of the Fallen and Nioh. The problem is, these games are nothing like Dark Souls, so of course you&apos;re going to be disappointed when playing them. In my opinion, you have to look at the game(s) as a standalone rather than comparing.
<br>WARNING, below this I call out multiple reviews for giving poor reasons as to why they gave a low rating, and I counter their reasons with my own logic, facts, and experiences.
<br>
<br>-&quot;I can&apos;t recall what the places or characters were called while I can recite every single zone and character from DS1 that I haven&apos;t played in over 8 months.&quot;
<br>-Vilquar
<br>That&apos;s such a poor comparison because you&apos;ve most likely clocked in hours to days of gameplay in DS1, where this game you probably stopped playing after the first playthough.
<br>
<br>-&quot;In this game, you&apos;ve got a timer to get your **** back that can be very slightly refilled by killing targets, which is most likely just going to get you killed again, given the frankly heinous amount of damage enemies deal.&quot;
<br>-OberiousLocke
<br>Or you could just take the time to figure out the best way to defeat the enemies in your path so that they don&apos;t kill you so quickly. Also, as I&apos;ve heard ENB say about Dark Souls (paraphrasing): don&apos;t worry about losing your souls, you can always get more. Plenty of times, on the way to recover your scraps in The Surge, you&apos;ll have collected the same amount you lost, doubling your scrap count. So there&apos;s no reason to rush to your death.
<br>
<br>-&quot;Bosses with unclear mechanics and an exceptional amount of trial and error to finally beat them.&quot;
<br>-Caliburn89
<br>Are you just not invested in playing the game then? Out of the other games you play that take trial and error, how long does it take to figure out the bosses weakness, and then follow through on actually beating them? I&apos;m not sure how you examine boss fights, but for me, the weaknesses were pretty straight forward, it just took time to get into a groove and then beat them. Any game that has good difficulty and is a challenge is going to take time to examine and beat. If you want bosses that lay out their weaknesses right in front of your face and are a breeze to defeat, then you&apos;re in the wrong place.
<br>
<br>-&quot;...barely any armor sets and weapons. i had to delete this game half way through due to how boring it was...&quot;
<br>-elitepredetor99
<br>I&apos;m sorry, do you even know the mechanics of the game and how you get armor sets and weapons? I crafted all the armor sets and pretty sure got all the weapons; there is so much variety. As for &quot;halfway through&quot;, how do you know you uninstalled halfway through if you didn&apos;t even finish the game? Also why are you rating/reviewing the game if you didn&apos;t finish? Wouldn&apos;t that mean your opinion is impartial since you don&apos;t know what &quot;half&quot; of the game still had in store?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-surge/user-reviews?user_review_id=7474275">Expand</a></span>
