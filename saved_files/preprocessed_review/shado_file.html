I have to wonder if the voice actors knew English or were just giving a script and asked to read what was on the page.</span>

The main idea is interesting but the achieve is not good. Only the visual worth visiting as long as you have a good computer. But this game is not a good tower defense. If you want a good one rather buy Kingdom Rush.</span>

It&apos;s a really nice change from other TD games. And there&apos;s plenty of variety available in how you choose your towers and spells to keep it interesting and make some replays worthwhile. One of the few negatives with the game is the sub-par English (from French) translation. It&apos;s not awful, but the flaws in the translation are noticeable when they show up. I really appreciate the psychological and philosophical focus of the story. You&apos;re trying to save the mind of a little kid, using the Light of consciousness to fight back the darkness. Take a look at some screenshots of the game. If the art appeals to you, I highly recommend buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shado/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822866">Expand</a></span>

The game play is based around William, a nine year old boy whose memories have been lost and its up to you to recover them.  The story unfolds as bits and pieces of his memory return to him.  The storyline is intriguing as you continue to find out about William&apos;s past.  William&apos;s &apos;friends&apos; you summon are upgradable in game, as well as &apos;spells&apos; which you learn cause global effects to change game play.  The sound track is outstanding and the visual graphics I&apos;ve seen are very nice. I like the fact that you can re-challenge a level in &apos;nightmare&apos; mode and there are mini games inside the game which change up the style in which the game is played. I truly appreciate the fact that the developers who are located in France have done an excellent job in providing both a French and English version of the game. I find the higher levels are appropriately challenging as far as tower defense game play is concerned, although for hardcore gamers, they may be too easy. What I would have liked to have seen is the ability to change the difficulty level at the Main Menu. Easy if you wanted to have your children play, Normal for most folks like me and Hard if you are an experienced tower defense fanatic.
<br>
<br>I appreciate the fact that the developers are interactive with the public and overall, the game appears to be free from glitches. Which means that the team spent a large amount of time making sure everything was in order -- which is good. With that said, a limited beta test at the beginning would have helped overcome the Quicktime installation issue that so many users encountered on launch -- which is bad. First impressions are important, but willingness to help if something does go wrong is equally important. I don&apos;t feel as if the game offers anything new to the tower defense style of game, other than an excellent storyline surrounding the mystery of William&apos;s disappearing memories and the gradual unfolding of the elements therein.  It&apos;s noteworthy.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a refreshing change of pace which doesn&apos;t cater to the teen and tween crowd of over-popularized mega violence and gore.  The money is well spent and I am a true fan of the game.   A solid 9 because its a great game, simply fun to play and deserves to be in your library of games.  It&apos;s perfect for those young or young-at-heart!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shado/user-reviews?user_review_id=2642114">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m about halfway through the game right now and I&apos;ve found it to be very enjoyable. Controlling the friends of the young boy William, you need to fight back the darkness which has enveloped his memories. Graphically, this game is wonderful. The maps are dark, a little creepy, and at the same time accessible to younger players. The towers have a cartoony, quilted, stuffed animal look to them which fits very well into the overall theme. The gameplay is nice enough; the gimmick in this tower defense is that you can only build in areas from which the darkness has been driven, which limits your initial tower placement and makes tower placement very important. You can spread your towers out to try to reach more advantageous areas of the map, or clump them together for a more focused result. The spells available in the game are also interesting and varied; there are a few attack spells, spells to protect your towers, spells to heal your memories at the expense of your towers, etc. Overall, the spells are balanced and they are all useful. Shad&apos;O also includes some &quot;puzzle&quot; maps, which have their own set of rules. One map, for example, has towers pre-built throughout the map, but you can only activate one at a time - leading a series of hectic yet strategic decisions on which tower should be active at any given time. These special maps aren&apos;t necessary to complete the game, but finishing them does give you small advantages on all maps. Unfortunately, aside from the darkness mechanic, this game has very little to offer mechanically that other tower defense games don&apos;t already have. Also, even on fairly powerful machines, you may experience some slowdowns. For some reason it is very demanding on one&apos;s video card and CPU. Still, it is very fun, well produced, and well worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shado/user-reviews?user_review_id=2612390">Expand</a></span>

The basic premise, and tactic, of this game seems to be just to zerg out towers, which is sort of the problem with the game. You can upgrade your towers, but why would you? Just zerg out a bunch of towers and you will be fine. One of my biggest greifs with this game is that it fails to tell you in a clear way where the enemies are coming, and what enemies you will encounter on the level. Since most mobs are very tower specific it would be nice to have a little info box at the start of each level telling you what monsters will come so you can prepare, its one of those &quot;you-need-to-die-your-way-thru-the-level-to-know-where-enemies-come-so-you-know-how-to-build&quot; type of TDs. Just a small not on the story, its pretty good, not that common with a TD that has a good story, but the voice acting and the grammar in the game is, well, atrocious to say the least. Graphics are also nice. If you are a TD fan this is a must play, but dont expect anything indepth here, its very casual, even thou it can be very frustrating at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shado/user-reviews?user_review_id=2616028">Expand</a></span>
