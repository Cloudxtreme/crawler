<br>If you require your hand constantly held through your games, and big flashing arrows pointing which way to go and what to do next, this game isn&apos;t for you. If you like an atmospheric, charming, exploration game that will provide you with an amazing experience, give it a try! I found it a very satisfying and relaxing experience, and on my second play through noticed things I hadn&apos;t previously, and was greeted with a new landscape to explore.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend this &quot;relax-em up&quot; (not sure what else to call it!) to anyone who wants a new experience and wants to get lost in an interesting world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2933916">Expand</a></span>

Just being able to spend time in this amazing world was enough to help me relax and feel prepared for the next day. Everything about the world feels alive and invites you in. The music responds to your current position, the animals and plants react to your presence and at night lead you onward to the next part of the experience.
<br>
<br>I must have played Proteus all the way through at least five times at this point and I still keep finding new things every time I sit down to play it.
<br>
<br>I believe that, ultimately, your experience of the game will depend on what you want out of it. I had a real need for something like this when I came across it, I loved sitting up on the mountainside, watching the mist roll down the sides and the sun set in a beautiful red off in the distance. But if you feel bored or hyperactive, I wouldn&apos;t recommend this particular title to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3972263">Expand</a></span>

And you wander around, unwinding and enjoying the scenery and finding little eastereggs everywhere. Day and night have their own secrets, as do the seasons. Still the game does seem to be a bit short lived. The island is just not that big and after a couple of playthroughs (which mostly take around 40 minutes or so, depending on how long you choose to linger) you&apos;ve seen all there is to see in this world. It would be wonderful to see this changed in either an update or a sequel. Bigger islands, more elements. That&apos;s basically it as far as I&apos;m concerned. In the end I enjoyed Proteus, although maybe not for its full &#x20AC;10,- price. It left me with a taste for more; I might even acquire Journey, or replay PS3&apos;s Flower just because of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3020050">Expand</a></span>

Avoid this hype-bomb at all costs.  Speaking of costs, I wouldn&apos;t even play this for free.  I was excited about this &quot;game&quot; based on critic reviews, and jumped at the humble bundle chance to grab it.  What a miserable disappointment.  You will be absolutely done and bored mindless within 30 minutes flat, and all I could think of is &quot;but why? this had such a cool concept.&quot;  And that ladies and gents is exactly what this is....it&apos;s basically a proof of concept, or rough sketch of what this title should have been.  So I assumed I was overly harsh, despite having a leveled expectation of what i was to experience, and turned my 7 yr old girl onto it, thinking that her patience and creative mind would find redeeming value in it.  Nope!  About 20 min into it and I got a &quot;daddy, this is really boring.&quot;  Yes....yes it is.
<br>What a waste.  If games like this are making money then I think i&apos;ll fire up visual studio and slam my ass cheeks into the keyboard a couple hundred times, compile it, and then release it to the public.  With the money I earn I&apos;ll use that to buy an expensive apology for wasting my daughter&apos;s life for 30 minutes.
<br>So in review.....this is not a game....it&apos;s is not an &quot;experience&quot; and it&apos;s not even visual narcolepsy to knock you out late at night (I tried that too, seriously!)....it&apos;s a joke and we&apos;re the punchline.  You&apos;ve been warned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3431567">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an interactive experience with no goals or objectives and that&apos;s fine  it&apos;s simply about exploring it&apos;s beautifully realised retro world set to its soothing musical score. And for what it does, it does well. It&apos;s just that it doesn&apos;t do a hell of a lot. Had the developers included the ability to interact with the world beyond it&apos;s simple movement mechanics, I can&apos;t help but think it&apos;d be a more delicious, meaty package. How about adding the ability to build and destroy the world ala Minecraft? Or what about sprinkling in a few secrets to reveal more about this pretty world? Or how about just letting me commit massive-horrible-frogicide on those irritating little things?
<br>
<br>I feel uncomfortable giving Proteus any kind of numerical score because for what it is, it&apos;s good, but it&apos;s a niche product that won&apos;t appeal to most, especially those looking for a &#x201C;game.&#x201D; So ignore the number  the developers have done well realising what they have. I just think that with a few more mechanics and things to do it&apos;d be a more interesting, meaty package.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2999847">Expand</a></span>

I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, and I was not looking for a &quot;game&quot;. What the game does, it does well, but my gripe comes from the lack of options and the lack of content.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>This game has a pleasing art style, although at times it begs for a little more depth in the details. Still, it doesn&apos;t come off as ugly by any means. The sounds is great too and it is fun to chase around certain objects to see how they will react with the sounds they make. Everything has it&apos;s own melody, and some objects actually interact with the player although these seem to be limited.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>This would be an amazing title to play when you just want to relax and listen to some ambient style music to get your sense of wonder going. The problem for me is that it is way too limited. Every time I start a new game I get a randomly generated island to explore, but the islands are relatively small and it&apos;s always the same stuff just in different locations. Within 10 minutes, I realized that I have pretty much seen everything there is to see in the game so the only reason to keep playing is for the sound and visual.
<br>
<br>How it could be improved:
<br>It is hard to complain too much about games that run ten dollars or cheaper, but even at the light price tag this one just leaves much to be desired. As I stated above, you can literally see everything this game has to offer within a matter of minutes. With a game that has no goals and no penalties, it should really have beefed up the exploration a bit more. The island should be a lot larger and take at least a half hour to go from one side of the shore to the other. Also it could really benefit from having some caves or underwater areas.
<br>
<br>Another problem is the game moves at a snail&apos;s pace. This is fine for the most part since you&apos;ll want to move slow and take in the scenery, but it would have been nice to have some sort of flight option available so you could get some different viewing angles.
<br>
<br>The game itself doesn&apos;t need change so much as it just needs more substance to give a reason to keep coming back. If you like ambient music and you enjoy exploration this title may be worth looking into, but I can&apos;t recommend paying full price for it. Anything over five dollars is just asking too much for the very small amount of content you get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3159283">Expand</a></span>

It generally left me confused, which would be fine if it were going somewhere, but there didn&apos;t appear to be any ultimate &quot;point&quot;  or there was, but well beyond the very short 20m I gave it. For example, a ring of fireflies formed at one point and made a large pillar appear, which must have released some type of invisible sleeping gas. It was probably the coolest moment of my experience, leaving me thinking &quot;Mm. Okay.&quot;
<br>
<br>I did try to like the game, but I guess I&apos;m not nearly patient enough, nor interested in a game which doesn&apos;t adequately present itself as more than a distraction. Ultimately, I found myself wishing there was no interactivity at all, and that the character would progress by himself while I ate a bowl of ramen noodles.  And then I wondered why I don&apos;t just eat outside before realizing I had frustration to unload here (and it&apos;s 2am!).
<br>
<br>It did have soothing graphics (I think &quot;beautiful&quot; is an exaggeration  it took me a while to figure out when I arrived at the side of a graveyard [and now I&apos;m doubting my perception], partially because some of the tombstones were swaying). The music was soothing, too  kind of reminded me of some of the early music in Rotohex. Proteus is very different, and bold in that originality, but I can&apos;t say it was refreshing. (But it is definitely thought-provoking  reviews here are particularly polarized)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3129558">Expand</a></span>

<br>Music is great btw, and the visuals are well, acceptable, i mean the colors are fine but e.g. the Sun is too crude and all this super-pixelation doesn&apos;t look nice or even cool. Yes, I got a short-lasted joy when running after a  few critters and enjoyed the music, but as a gamer I don&apos;t see any entertainment here. For $10 one can get a used Diablo 1 CD and play for days and days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128187">Expand</a></span>

But the second play through was so much like the first, that I lost interest rather quickly. Yes, you get a different island to explore each time you start, but each island has the same things on it, just laid out differently. There are some cool things that happen, but it&apos;s the same cool things every time. If you&apos;re really keen to check it out, play your friend&apos;s copy. I can&apos;t recommend spending even the low price of 10 dollars on a game that only offers an hour or two of original gameplay.  The &quot;Interactive sound track&quot; doesn&apos;t resemble music.  It&apos;s more like noise, albeit noise that you have some control over.  I could see Proteus being really enthralling for someone on psychedelics, but if that&apos;s not your cup of tea, you probably won&apos;t play it more than twice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2971507">Expand</a></span>

These two games are somewhat similar in concept but no matter how much I despise The Path for pretending to be fancy art with deep meaning, it is still ways better than Proteus. At first sight Proteus seems to sport a nice retro pixelized look, but that is soon disrupted by all the low-polygonal stuff that just does not work with all the big pixelized sprites, most notably the terrain itself. Then there are the points of interest on the island  only thing one can do is to check them out. There aren&apos;t many of those and (unlike those in The Path) none are really interesting in the first place. So you check the places out, then the night comes, circle of light appears, game shifts into next season. Things change color, and that&apos;s about it. You can go check out the places again, but there is no point really. Then again you won&apos;t have anything better to do in this &quot;game&quot; so you might as well do so. Then the night comes, next season, and yeah, why even bother. Go get some food from the fridge, take a piss, while games shifts to the next season again. Proteus is ugly, not interesting at all. At a few rare occasions the music is kinda nice, but most of the time its headache-inducing cacophony of bleeps. Mostly it does not feel like a game at all, even next to Dear Esther it does not feel like a game. Damn there is a game called 4 minutes and 33 seconds of Uniqueness (made by the Crayon Physics guy I think) and all you have to do there is to run the game for said time as the only person on Earth and it still felt more like a game than this one does.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3080942">Expand</a></span>

It has interesting visuals, it&apos;s unlike anything I&apos;ve ever played before, and it&apos;s relaxing and ambient. There are subtle goals and puzzles (so to speak), but the game isn&apos;t about progress so much as, for lack of a better word, &quot;flow.&quot; You meander about your randomly-generated island for quite a while your first time through, until you realize how to (again, I use this word loosely) progress. While you amble, you are subjected to an ever-changing, gorgeous audiovisual landscape that is quite pretty (if a little sparse). You learn how to interact with the world around you, beginning with chasing animals around and culminating with the &quot;solution&quot; to the island&apos;s main &quot;puzzle.&quot; Once you figure that out, you can explore the island through the seasons; the relaxation of spring, the hot, sometimes blindingly bright summer, the strange (and sometimes outright eerie) fall, and, finally, the sad, delicate sparseness of winter. Each season does have an effect on you, and Proteus is sometimes outright moving. It may not say much directly, but there are some definite themes going on here, and they&apos;re quite timely, too. Proteus is certainly an &quot;anti-game,&quot; but that&apos;s the point; we, as gamers, have become too open to distraction and destruction. In these respects, Proteus succeeds. What it fails at is pure and simple longevity. It takes no more than an hour (two if you really enjoy it) to explore your first island and from there very little changes. Each island looks different, yes, but the themes and elements are all exactly the same. You might go on one or two more playthroughs just to figure out how a few of the more esoteric elements can be interacted with, but that&apos;s about the extent of it. It&apos;s also far too easy to get incredibly lost, but perhaps that&apos;s another theme of Proteus. The ambience would definitely be defeated by a HUD. This game is well worth a look, especially if you&apos;re into non-traditional gaming. If not, you ought to avoid this game. My final word on the matter is that this game is a part of the Humble Indie Bundle 8 right now, so long as you beat the median price. I highly suggest looking into this independent developer friendly, charity-boosting organization; you can get this game packed in with other interesting and (typically) more-traditional games on the cheap (or not-so-cheap, if you&apos;re feeling generous). That&apos;s the way to go for this game; that way, if you hate this game or find it boring, at least your money was still well-spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3184577">Expand</a></span>

The music is generated based on the season and where you are. I did enjoy playing it, because it made me happy for some reason. That and the fact that it was less than dirt cheap is why I don&apos;t rate it lower. Overall, if you have extra money on steam, buy it.

This may sound odd to hear as my review is a 10, but I&apos;ll explain something as short as I can.
<br>
<br>This game is meant for people who like wandering around in Minecraft, who like listening to music and observing. If you bough Minecraft purely for building things and don&apos;t ever even think of wandering for a few minutes you are wasting your time with this game.
<br>
<br>So, this combined with the fact that there is little to the game means that you can go on YouTube and watch about 5 minutes of gameplay. If you don&apos;t like it, don&apos;t buy it. If you do like it, buy it. And if you aren&apos;t sure, watch it more and maybe even buy it. It&apos;s only 10 bucks (though people will try to make it seem like that 10 dollars is way too much, but they often are 10-year-olds that have barely any understanding of money).
<br>
<br>And, this IS a game. No matter what people say. Just because there are no goals does not make this not a game. Garrys Mod is a game and doesn&apos;t have any goals, objectives, or anything like that and I don&apos;t see anyone saying that it&apos;s not a game. And every video game is an &quot;interactive experience.&quot; So, there is my 2 cents on that subject.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3969893">Expand</a></span>

<br>Proteus is an exploration game that takes place on an island.
<br>There&#x2019;s not much to say about this game.
<br>You just walk around, that&#x2019;s it.
<br>Every time you start a game the island is different, all you have to do to beat the game is go through all 4 seasons, you go to a new season by waiting for night time and then going to these glowy white orbs, the colors and changing seasons are great pieces of eye candy, but only for like 12 seconds
<br>then your over it
<br>I found nothing engaging about this game at all beyond my initial introduction and trying to figure it out.
<br>The randomly generated islands are all solid, so there aren&#x2019;t caves, or buildings to explore through, just hills to climb over, and musical animals to listen to as they hop around.
<br>There&#x2019;s really nothing to explore here, get to the island, look at it for 10 seconds, this is all you need to see, game over.
<br>I do appreciate the ambient music, and could see the potential of someone going to proteus to just escape to a colorful land, but maybe I&#x2019;m just saying that to find a positive, because there are games out there with tons more to do that you could get that same experience from like Minecraft.
<br>There&#x2019;s nothing to do here but do mundane tasks like walk around the island, or follow the bath from end to end for trophies, that&#x2019;s about it.
<br>Not worth exploring.
<br>There&#x2019;s nothing to see here
<br>Proteus isn&#x2019;t a bad game, it&#x2019;s just not a good game either... it&#x2019;s kinda just nothing.
<br>For what it is
<br>Exploration game 5.0/10
<br>overall: 5.0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=5860558">Expand</a></span>

Within about 5 minutes, you&apos;ve seen just about everything there is to be seen. The &quot;music&quot; is extremely lackluster and it feels as though almost no time was spent on working on the sounds to create something that would actually sound good when strung together.
<br>
<br>And while it has the barest pretenses of a goal and a plot, there really isn&apos;t much desire to continue on, because, as said above, the music generation is awful and the things to see aren&apos;t really worth seeing. It was potentially a very, very interesting concept, but it falls completely flat due to a complete lack of effort by its designer. I can appreciate wanting a minimalist style game, or having a game that&apos;s different from the standard fare, but this entire game was so poorly executed that its cringe worthy. Don&apos;t waste your money, time, or computer resources on this.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a decent take on an artsy game, go with the much, much better Dear Esther.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201189">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the novelty of the game wears off very quickly, which justifies its low price I guess. Overall, a relaxing experience but nothing to write home about.</span>

The music is relaxing and ambient, and you have a beautiful world to explore. However, the world is very limited, but that doesn&apos;t stop me replaying. The main problem i have is that I&apos;ve played it for 2 hours and have already seen everything in the game.</span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of exploration, and are also ok with a game that has very little as far as challenge goes, then i would recommend Proteus heartily. If you need a game to be a little bit more fast paced, then there are plenty more to appeal to your liking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3164575">Expand</a></span>

Despite its retro-graphics, I rank it as one of the most beautiful games I&apos;ve played in terms of artistic merit. It deserve damn sight more than 80 when crap like Mass Effect 3, Dragon Age 2, and BLOPS routinely earn. If you approach it with an open mind and judge it on its own merits you won&apos;t be disappointed.

<br>World generation, although the elements are limited, is quite good. All the islands I played on seemed very different in an unexpected and sometimes startling way.

<br>Overall, I can only see myself playing a few hours. As good as it is, you can&apos;t roam in a pixelated world forever.

Games being an artform has always been a contested debate, but this is the most pointless game I have ever witness, failing to being an artform whatsoever. Bad, just bad.

This is definitely an &quot;art&quot; genre game, less about goal directed activity and more about the experience, and if you are so inclined, philosophy of life.  That said, there is a &quot;goal&quot; to each season leading to a definite end to the game.  After having completed the game, I&apos;m still not sure exactly how I reached the goal each time which bugs the side of me that likes strategy.  There are several memorable, scary, and beautiful moments in the game.  The detailed interplay of sound with visual is really the highlight of the game in my opinion.  I&apos;m not sure that I would buy this game at full price mainly because it doesn&apos;t have a whole lot of replay value (for me at least) and it is a very short game (I finished in under an hour).  I&apos;d say this will appeal to a very specific crowd and is worth getting while on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3908632">Expand</a></span>

My advice:  Take time to stop and just look around - in a way the game seems philosophical in that aspect.  I won&apos;t give any spoilers, but there were several sensory variations that kept me interested in exploring, and at the same time it kept me thinking, somewhat immersed in what was going on.   I find it likely that I&apos;ll play it through again - just to see other variations.  I enjoyed this - kudos to the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=4276283">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros
<br>+Great immersive environment and design
<br>+Sound effects go nicely with what happens and the animals you come across
<br>+Music is surreal
<br>+Game focuses heavily on exploration and getting lost
<br>+Animations and events occur differently depending where you are
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Super short, takes 40 minutes to beat the game
<br>-No other substance in terms of story, characters, goal of the game, etc
<br>-Not much replay value
<br>-The content within the game does not make up for the price of the game (recommend getting it in a bundle)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/proteus/user-reviews?user_review_id=7301894">Expand</a></span>
