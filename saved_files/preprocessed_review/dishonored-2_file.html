<br>
<br>BUT
<br>
<br>There are so many things dragging it down right now. On PC anyway
<br>
<br>-Optimisation is terrible, with an i7 and GTX 1080, at 1080p im struggling to even maintain a 50-60fps framerate on ultra settings, with anti-aliasing at TXAA 1x
<br>
<br>-Mouse sensitivity is tied to FPS, so it is extremely hard to aim, especially with how jumpy and unpredictable the FPS is currently.
<br>
<br>-Pre-order bonuses. For most this doesnt matter, but trying desperately to tempt people into pre-ordering is always a bad sign in my opinion. And in this case it seems like they were doing it because they knew reviews would be mixed with its current state.
<br>
<br>Overall, a very good and exciting game and a fantastic sequel to the original. But the port and optimisation need some serious work. i would not consider this game &apos;finished&apos;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6803714">Expand</a></span>

Do not recommend this game on PC at all. i recommend the inferior yet playable console version. This is far to poor of a game port to play in its current state. Embarrassing when juxtaposed to Doom. Developers SHOULD be embarrassed by this horrible stigma it has now ascertained.</span>

<br>This could not have been a surprise. Any testers would have logged these problems 2 mins into the game. If these problems are fixable in a few weeks like the devs hope, then the game could have been release in a few weeks. They gambled that they&apos;d get worse press if they postponed. I&apos;m calling it a bad bet.
<br>
<br>My GAMEPLAY review is of course limited to a couple of hours, but there doesn&apos;t seem to be anything new in the story or game mechanics. It feels like new maps for the original game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6807414">Expand</a></span>

The story so far is fantastic and the level and art design provides fans of the original with an evolution on the original game&apos;s painted cityscapes. Overall, I&apos;m excited to see what this game has to offer.</span>

<br>
<br>just for the record I have an 2560x1440 monitor with an i5-3570 @ stock and an rx 480. I get 35-40fps on maximum settings. I mean everything at max. I get 45-55 when I turn them slightly lower (no noticeable changes) I haven&apos;t tried minimum settings. take in mind that these are in WQHD not FHD. I assume you get 60fps with my card on 1080p</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7250675">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is brilliant, a highly polished version of the original Dishonored. The paths through the levels are improved. The stealth and ghost modes are improved. The player choices are increased. The story is improved. Everything about this game is a major improvement, and I already thought Dishonored the original was top-notch.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended. If you haven&apos;t already played the original Dishonored, play that first and the DLC as well. The story can be hard to follow without that background.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7226892">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m surprised how much of an improvement this game got. Story, gameplay, combat, stealth, map design, enemies and AI, you name it. I didn&apos;t get bored playing and I didn&apos;t feel like it was repetitive, unlike the first game.
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>In the beginning, you&apos;re given the choice of playing as a grown-up Emily or reprising your role as Corvo. Your decision will vastly change the perspective of the story as well as the abilities available at your arsenal, as if two sides of a coin. You will not be able to make any contact with the other throughout the game.
<br>
<br>The developers designed the game with the intent for you to play more than one run after completion, so that you can play as the other character or attempt different approaches to missions.
<br>
<br>The script is a lot more concise and the story is a huge improvement. It is no longer vague and characters no longer speak about topics that are irrelevant to the mission at hand.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>Dishonored 2 now plays like a true Hitman game, unlike the simplified one the first game was. It&apos;s entirely up to you whether you want to be a ghost or if you want to go in guns blazing.
<br>
<br>I recommend trying out stealth to make the best of your experience, but if you want to rush through, you&apos;ll still get a thrill out of the combat because it is no longer as simple as the first game. The game will punish you for carelessness. I recommend playing on Hard difficulty.
<br>
<br>For weapons, you use the classic sword/pistol/crossbow combo. There are many more upgrades now and money is even more scarce than before, so it is crucial for you to plan out what you want to buy.
<br>
<br>As for powers, there are new ones introduced for Emily while Corvo mostly uses the same ones as before. Emily&apos;s powers are more focused on stealth than Corvo&apos;s. Unfortunately, some powers in this game are completely pointless, which is a shame.
<br>
<br>The game introduces a Bone Charm crafting system where you recycle charms into new ones consisting of 2-4 modifiers and only taking up one slot each. Even though there&apos;s a chance of corrupting them, the corrupted modifiers are mostly laughable. For three extra Runes, you can use each modifier up to four times, which is even more broken.
<br>
<br>There are new and improved enemies in this game and AI has been vastly improved. Even with the &quot;wall hack&quot; power fully upgraded, it&apos;s difficult to play.
<br>
<br>EXPLORATION
<br>Maps are a lot more open-world than before and items are scattered throughout. If you only focus on the missions, you will miss out on plenty of exploration. If you only focus on special items, you will have a deficit of funding and will be limited on ammunition.
<br>
<br>The Heart reprises its GPS tracker method of detection. All of the items are exposed on the map again. Many of them are located in stores or safes now, which require additional effort to acquire.
<br>
<br>Sadly, there are a bit too many Runes in the game, making powers easy to obtain. Bone Charms are generated at random, which makes the search for them somewhat pointless once you&apos;re near the end of the game, since they might not have good modifiers. Unless you&apos;re planning to do another run, of course.
<br>
<br>Like the first game, this one has nine missions and a central hub. If played quickly, it should last around 10 hours. If played stealthily, then easily at least 20-30 hours.
<br>
<br>UNIQUE LOCATIONS
<br>There are two locations in this game that are unique: Stilton Manor and the Clockwork Mansion.
<br>
<br>Without spoiling too much, the former introduces &quot;on-demand&quot; time travel gameplay. This is an interesting new system with lots of potential, but the developers only limited it to that map.
<br>
<br>For the other location, it is essentially a dynamic labyrinth. It&apos;s incredibly fun to play and very challenging with the clockwork guards. It&apos;s difficult to acquire all of the special items on this map because half the time you&apos;re just trying to avoid getting killed.
<br>
<br>PERFORMANCE
<br>A lot of reviewers here complained about poor optimization and gave low ratings because of that.
<br>
<br>I too experienced sub-optimal FPS, but I managed to stabilize it at 40 average on 4K resolution at mostly-low with mid-range hardware, while streaming. If you fear that your system might not be able to play it, Steam offers a refund policy which offers you the chance to try it out.
<br>
<br>SUMMARY
<br>Dishonored 2 is a huge improvement from its prequel. There is a lot more variety in combat and more freedom to plan out your approach. This is definitely a worthy successor to the original game and I highly recommend it even if you haven&apos;t played the prequel. You can hop straight to playing this game as the story isn&apos;t too reliant on the prequel.
<br>
<br>Disregarding performance issues, I&apos;m giving this game a generous 9/10 for being the sequel Dishonored fans wished for. It is well-balanced and challenging in every way. I would&apos;ve preferred there to be a bit more money available on the maps to loot, but it&apos;s not a big deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7522999">Expand</a></span>

<br>After just a couple of hours I&apos;ve been absolutely plagued by freezes and crashes. Not sure what&apos;s causing it, but they&apos;re pretty frustrating. They occur randomly in-game, but the game also has a bad tendency to crash out of even a menu.
<br>
<br>Additionally the game runs really poorly on my hardware to begin with. I&apos;m running an i7-4790 with 780ti SLI on an SSD, all my drivers are updated, and I&apos;ve got patch 1.2 installed and it still runs terribly on even the lowest settings. It&apos;s not even so much that I see a low framerate -- Even though I certainly do, I&apos;m averaging about 35 fps overall on medium settings -- It&apos;s that the framerate fluctuates wildly for seemingly no reason. For example, I&apos;ll play through a certain area and see around 45 fps, then quick reload because I screwed something up, and play through the same exact area averaging 28 fps. It makes no sense. And toggling graphics settings seems to help nothing: I get maybe a 5 fps variance between the lowest settings and putting everything to high. Something is severely wrong with this game, and seeing how broken it is removes almost all of my hope that it&apos;ll ever be fixed. From what I understand it even runs poorly on consoles: I&apos;ve seen many complaints about crashes on the PS4. So maybe this is a Void Engine thing, I dunno. But I sure wish they had just built Dishonored 2 on the Unreal Engine, like Dishonored 1 was.
<br>
<br>The poor performance and terrible overall stability make this game almost completely unplayable even on super high-end systems: Even people running 1080s are experiencing frame drops and instability, so you can&apos;t even brute force your way into hitting a constant, stable 60 fps. As for the crashes, who knows? They could be caused by any number of reasons.
<br>
<br>All-in-all this is the worst running PC game I&apos;ve played since Assassin&apos;s Creed Unity&apos;s release back in 2014. I&apos;ve heard people say this is as bad as Arkham Knight, though I can&apos;t say whether or not that&apos;s true since I haven&apos;t played that one. I&apos;ll update my review should this game ever stabilize, though even that is no guarantee. Once a game releases in this bad of shape it&apos;s rare to ever see it run well again.
<br>
<br>Now we know why Bethesda didn&apos;t want to ship review copies to journalists covering the game. Because it barely works. Shame on you Bethesda for such shady business practices, and shame on you for releasing a game with so much potential in such a sorry state.
<br>
<br>Note: I&apos;ll edit this review if it ever manages to run decently, but for now I don&apos;t really have anything to comment on aside from its performance since it&apos;s nearly unplayable in its current state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6830300">Expand</a></span>

Bought the DLCs and loved them. So I&#x2019;m coming into Dishonored 2 with high expectations. And I&#x2019;m feeling let down. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	First off, I&#x2019;m playing on a Windows 10 machine with a Core i5 and a GTX-970. I&#x2019;m through chapter 6 and I&#x2019;ve had one crash and noticed a few minor graphic anomalies like walking around a corner and seeing a wall appear, but that&#x2019;s it. Nothing that really impacts playability.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	I&#x2019;m playing as Emily (as I&#x2019;m guessing many are since we played as Corvo in the first game). I&#x2019;m not enthralled with her powers. Outside of her Far Reach, Dark Vision, and Domino, I&#x2019;m not using much. I&#x2019;ve done the Shadow Walk once or twice, but I probably could have accomplished the goal with Far Reach as well (and the animation when you knock someone out with Shadow Walk power is just freaky &#x2013; as in make me cringe freaky).
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	I&#x2019;m going for low chaos, so all the powers about killing and more health, strength and shadow kill are wasted on me.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	The world feels empty. Yes, there are now people on the streets in some places, but they don&#x2019;t really do anything &#x2013; they just stand there and shadow box or saw wood. In fact I find it annoying because I can&#x2019;t tell who is an innocent and who will try to attack me until I interact with them.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	I hate the hub &#x2013; the Dreadful Whale. D1 had the Hound Pits pub, which 1) had several people around that gave the place a sense of life, and 2) was a great playground to try out abilities. I could practice blink-racing across the area, or see how high I could climb and get a good feel for how to manipulate my powers. I&#x2019;ve tried a few times to get to the top of the mast and stand on the little platform up there but I fail every time. Bummer. I also enjoyed the rivalry between Piero and Sokolov in D1 and watching that play out, but I haven&#x2019;t found any &#x201C;life&#x201D; like that in this game.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	*** SPOILERS **** There are some collectables that seem really oddly placed. In D1 I recall that there were multiple paths to get anywhere. In D2, for example there is this rune in the basement of the Asylum that you can only get to by taking the elevator to the top and then cutting the cables to send it crashing into the basement &#x2013; neither obvious nor stealthy. There is another one in a locked room in the basement of the Conservatory that you need to find a key for. In D1 I&#x2019;d expect a rat-tunnel or window transom as an alternate path.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	Hate the new Dark Vision. With the orange on orange is really hard to see what&#x2019;s what. D1 did this much better.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	Finicky Controls &#x2013; Far Reach and it&#x2019;s pull are really hard to aim right. There seems to be a really small window when aiming that will get you &#x201C;up&#x201D; on something. As an example, I was working my way across the Conservatory level and ended up on the spinning light tower in the middle. I could see the balcony I wanted to get to. I walked out on the end of the &#x201C;gangplank&#x201D; and as the tower was spinning there was a small window of time where I was close enough to make the leap. But I could never get the aim right. After about 10 failures I gave up and found an alternate path.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	Lack of feedback when your actions affect the world. As an example, there is one area that requires you to walk across pressure plates to move some walls. I was seeing the walls moving but had no idea I was making it happen. It took some research online to understand what was happening. After I knew that, looking down at my &#x201C;feet&#x201D; (which aren&#x2019;t really there) I could see the plate depress when I &#x201C;step&#x201D; on it, but if I&#x2019;m not looking at the floor I never would have seen that. An audible click would have helped immensely to let me know at I just did something.
<br>
<br>&#x2022;	Overall feeling of sadness. In D1 I was Corvo, wrongly accused of murdering the Empress and thrown in jail, only to escape and work with a band of crusaders to overthrow those responsible. In D2 I&#x2019;m Emily, my throne has been usurped and I&#x2019;ve been thrown in my room, only to escape and &#x2026; slink off to another city to try to uncover the backstory of my usurper, all the while spending my down time in a rusty stinky hulk of a ship.
<br>
<br>There are more things that bug me, but that&#x2019;s enough to give you a feel for it. In the end I&#x2019;ll finish the game to see how the story plays out, and then shelve it. Very doubtful I&#x2019;ll replay it or get any DLCs if they come out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6811525">Expand</a></span>

Now down to the point: this game is a labour of love from one of the very best game studio around the world. The art is breath taking, with mind blowing designs, render, and mad amount of skills pouring from every pixel. The level design is totally insane. Each level, even more than in the first game, is a show of gameplay twists build upon cool ideas and a powerful engine. Sound and music are wonderful, and the world itself is probably the best world creation at least in visual entertainment from the last decade. If you love gaming - and especially first person games - but don&apos;t play that one you&apos;ll be missing one of the most amazing creation in the field.
<br>Also the game is very generous. My first run lasted 37 hours. And I am positive I&apos;ll play it at least a second time. Then if you go for the full ghost run, you&apos;re in for even more hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7060450">Expand</a></span>

<br>Least Favorite Thing: Trying to takedown someone sitting in a chair.

<br>They really should have upgraded their UE3 to UE4 instead using a such **** Engine, i really wonder what got into them.

I have two computers one old one new and both can now run the game smoothly if you take take the time to adjust graphics settings properly. On the new computer (nvidia 1050 ti) the game looks very good with very high texture quality. On the old one it looks satisfying and still runs smoothly. So the review will be based on game play rather than technical issues.
<br>
<br>The problem with this game is that it employs RPG mechanics (various perks that improve your character) while being very different from typical RPG games. An RPG game will reward you for all the standard activities you do in the game: fighting, discovering new locations and completing quests. You can then use the experienced gained to improve you character. In this game doing all these things gives you nothing, literally nothing. You can go through successive missions with only minimal increase in your character capabilities until you reach the situation when the further progress is impossibly hard because you are simply too weak. In a standard RPG game you can then change your quest, go elsewhere, farm experience and return when you are ready. But not here. Dishonored 2 is in fact a strictly linear game where you go from A to B to C ... and you can never return to previous locations once you finished them. It is even worse than that. Whenever you reach an essential quest location (typically a large building) you will be locked there until you finish the quest. No chance for extra farming at all. And the farming consists in looking for runes which are dispersed all over the world in hidden locations that have nothing to do at all with doing any questsl. So you will have to waste your time scavanging empty building or sewers just to find runes without which you will not be able to play at a decent power level. But you will only learn that this is so maybe 2-3 missions into the future when there will be no coming back and the only option will be to restard the campaign. I find such design tiresome and a pointless waste of time.
<br>As to the combat it would be interesting and challenging if it were not for the fact that the loading times after getting killed are atrocious. And you will die over and over again if you try to fight your way (especially when being undefarmed) because you die after receiving just 2 hits and multiple opponents will wield pistols. Then there are clockwork soldiers that are totally immune to all your basic attacks. They are essentially invincible. They are in fact 2x worse than deathclaws in Fallout as deathclaws can be beaten even with basic weapons if you have the skill and patience. But the clockwork soldiers just take zero damage from your attacks. Fun like hell. After dying like 20 times to them in a locked room and fighting for 10 seconds and reloading 1 minute each time I called it quits. I will restart the campaign and try again developing my character more carefully but I am not sure if I will want to waste my time crawling in sewers which have nothing to do with the main quest. So this is a strictly linear game with shallow rpg mechanics that forces you to waste your time on boring activities detached from the story and quests. 7 is the resulting score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6832612">Expand</a></span>

Now, going back to the original game ( uninstalling the patch ) will require another 24.5 GB download. How is that for a f***** up game.

<br>The only reason I give this game a 3 is for graphics, game play and story which are OK.
<br>Way to go Bethesda.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6819816">Expand</a></span>

The actual gameplay and some of the new abilities are fun.  The writing and story composition on the other hand, is absolutely terrible.
<br>
<br>The main character can&apos;t seem to shake the uncontrollable urge to spout endless exposition at every opportunity...this not only destroys immersion(I don&apos;t need to hear about how my character feels when killing a guard), but often divulges information that you as the PC couldn&apos;t possibly know at that point in the story.
<br>
<br>All the characters felt really flat, as if they had no connection to eachother or anything else anywhere in the game.  God help me most of the time they actually sounded bored.
<br>
<br>All the individual story elements felt like badly composed episodes of a procedural TV show, w/o even having the benefit of the overall narrative to pull everything together.
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the main city of this installment...Karnaca.  Supposedly being oppressed by the duke, it instead felt like I was visiting a European Villa.  Everything looked way too sunny and bright, and served rather poorly to deliver what I can only assume is the intended theme.  The bloodflies felt really forced, as if they were just thrown in to give the player &quot;fodder&quot; to deal with.
<br>
<br>tl;dr--With the exception of the actual gameplay itself, Dishonored 2 is the polar opposite of the first game in almost every way.  Even if you are a die-hard fan of the original I would wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6928896">Expand</a></span>

<br>Still it has 2 problems, same as first one.
<br>1. Lack of likable characters.
<br>I did like the faceless and voiceless Corvo, ok.
<br>However now - i dont care about Emily (becase I know nothing about her that can make me start doing so) she is faceless. She is not beautiful, she is not charismatic, she is not fun and in same moment she doesnt have any dark of gloomy sides of character to counter this and make her interesting.
<br>She is boring. I understand that world of the game is not a funny one, but do she really has some personalities that devide her in a good way from Corvo? Emotion spectre that they bring to you is the same (and its gray).
<br>Corvo also doesnt really work for me this time, he doesnt open up as a new deeper more complex person he is just old dad/man with quite a boring motivation.
<br>2. Lots of ways of killing - but concentration on peacefull playthrough. I dont know, maybe some kind of non-deadly bullets (from rubber idk) for pistol and more ways of disabling folks might change this? Cause its quite strange when you have a gun in your arm and dagger in another, but try your best to not use them a single time throughout the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7359098">Expand</a></span>

<br>Completely about the plot, I can&apos;t tell yet, but he&apos;s good, and certainly no surprises. Just a good, clich&#xE9;d plot. About Royal assassin you can guess already sailed to a location associated with it.
<br>The most important part of the game is gameplay, and it&apos;s great. I play for Emily, she has a brand new ability, and that&apos;s cool, they are very good; I was particularly pleased with &quot;Domino&quot;. Teleport her too, but looks a bit different - she is attracted to the place and it looks stylish.
<br>Locations are beautiful, sometimes eerie (for example, the place where the &quot;good doctor&quot;). The passage still variable as in the first part. But it seems to me that the enemies now are some seeing too.
<br>Fans of the first part just have to play the game, it is as good. But you will have lag or not to guess never. I bought and prepared myself for the horrible lag, but I probably was lucky, and I enjoy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7074380">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its quite a big improvement over the first game though, bigger more open areas to explore (i have been on mission 2 for 5 and half hours just looking around and looting), far more ways, items and powers to take down enemies if you are playing low chaos stealth only, just as many new really cool kill animations and dismemberment if you are not, lots of lore in books and notes to explore.
<br>
<br>If you are in any way interested in the formula of a Bioshock or the first dishonored game then buy it. You can patch issues with performance (definitely wait for this to happen if you have anything less than me) but you cant patch a bad game and this will likely be my GOTY.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6807089">Expand</a></span>

I want to say that gameplay is greatly improved and there is plenty ways to pass levels with stealth and clean hands also there is plenty ways to murder your enemies. New skills are enjoyable, level design is way too good and puzzles are excellent. The game itself offers many things to do. Graphics are probably worse than many Triple A games such as like Deus Ex, Witcher or MGS but they obviously are not the worst and I didn&apos;t have any problems with Dishonored 2&apos;s visuals (except some animation problems) or I haven&apos;t faced with any bugs yet.
<br>
<br>The worst thing about the game is probably the ending and differences between Emily and Corvo (at least for me.) Dishonored&apos;s endings were astonishing and touching even the High Chaos one but in Dishonored 2 story and characters are still ok but endings are not. Both of Low and High Chaos endings felt lame to me at the first sight. In fact Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano are pretty same. There is only small dialogue and ending differences but I&apos;ll get over with it.
<br>
<br>Dishonored 2 is masterpiece and greatly improved and the cons are too small to notice. It seems like Arkane Studios did their best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6808962">Expand</a></span>

Performance would become utter **** at certain areas in the game. At one point the fps would be 60 (vsync enabled), then at another area it would drop significantly, stuttering badly. Changing the graphic options doesn&apos;t really seem to make much of a difference. If you can put the performance bugs aside, this game is fantastic. Don&apos;t let these low user reviews put you off this game. I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6809585">Expand</a></span>

The games world is amazing to explore with many secrets to find places to see and people to interact with. The combat is fun whether it be stealth or direct attacks and with the powers you have make you a killing machine.

<br>However the performance is such a let down. My PC should be running this game without issue, yet there seems to be a constant battle of unstable fps, dipping and dropping regardless of settings. Even tested the lowest settings on my Rx480 8gb Vram and it still bounces. This is a great game ruined by a poor port. This is becoming a far to common problem for PC, and only hurts the industry when such potential is released in such conditions like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6878554">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are a lot of complaints about hardware issues, but these could just be some sort of organised troll camapign to bring the developer down.

<br>I&apos;ve submitted a service ticket to Bethesda without any reply. This seems to be the norm as one person has been waiting over 25 days for a response from Bethesda and so far NOTHING!
<br>So by what I gather if your NOT playing on a PC this is a great game! But one PC be ready to save the game after you:
<br>Enter a room
<br>kill a person

<br>More like Dishonored .5
<br>if you&#x2019;re expecting a more polished and more awesome version of dishonored with Dishonored 2...
<br>Sorry to break your heart, pun intended&#x2026;
<br>But this game feels more like a cheap DLC than a proper sequel
<br>it even looks like dishonored 1... A 4 year old ps3 game
<br>the game starts out with you conveniently training the now Empress Emily on being an assassin&#x2026;
<br>It introduces new ideas and mechanics to the dishonored series like sliding and jumping... but you use none of this throughout the campaign&#x2026;
<br>Emilys Aunt comes to take her place on the throne and its then you choose who you play as, Corvo from Dishonored 1 or the Emperess Emily,
<br>I chose Emily as she introduces a new set of magic to the game&#x2026;
<br>And you have to save whoever you don&#x2019;t choose and retake the crown&#x2026;
<br>Your choice does not change the campaign, but will of course change the story.. So there is incentive to play twice...
<br>Which unfortunately if you want to feel you got your moneys worth youll have to do as my run through with Emily took only about 5 hours and 40 minutes&#x2026;
<br>Nothing has really changes since dishonored 1, except level design got noticeably worse&#x2026;
<br>There are 2 levels that are pretty cool puzzles that will definitely test your patience, but these 2 levels are the only 2 of the 9 that live up to this series standards..
<br>The rest all feel uninspired, and therefore I felt no urge to explore them&#x2026;
<br>And creating such boring worlds to explore is bad for the player and hurts the gameplay because of how inaccessible magic and upgrades are in this game&#x2026;
<br>If you aren&#x2019;t willing to try and figure out how to get to a rune behind some annoying locked door.. you&#x2019;re not going to have fun at all playing this game as upgrades and magic are so expensive and are mistakenly not unlocked with story progress&#x2026;
<br>I felt the same about the original.. But it&#x2019;s even worse here due to how inaccessible everything is...
<br>Magic should be given to you as you progress through the story and the level design should be crafted around this magic&#x2026;
<br>There is an option to do a no magic run here as Emily, but even still&#x2026; theres potential to turn this into 3 different campaigns centered around each characters magic or lack there of&#x2026;
<br>Instead theyd rather annoy you by hiding the runes in frustrating spots like they don&#x2019;t want you to have fun with their game..
<br>Well congrats Bethesda, you win...
<br>I didn&#x2019;t have fun at all&#x2026;
<br>Upgrades are also only available at shops&#x2026; and for ridiculous prices that you won&#x2019;t be able to afford unless again, you spend the time to explore these poorly designed levels with horrible progression indication&#x2026;
<br>I understand the whole point of dishonored is to place you in a world and let you go..
<br>But there should still be some sort of direction designed into the world&#x2026;
<br>For example one of the later missions I was stuck in a room forever trying to leave, only to google and find out everyone else had problems with this spot to&#x2026; there was a button next to the door you were supposed to hit.. The game never tells you to look for a button to proceed, it just gives you a locked door... and it&#x2019;s a Bethesda game so naturally one would assume, this is a bug... no... Just bad design.
<br>The hand to hand combat here is just as bad as it was in the original, now however there are ways to just knock enemies out instead of killing them in combat which makes a non-lethal run much easier to obtain, but the stealthy approach is still the more satisfying option&#x2026;
<br>Dishonored 2 is everything we already got&#x2026;
<br>Sneak around, take people out, get detected and sword fight or gun fight&#x2026;
<br>Disable electric walls A dash of magic  all in a less inspired world&#x2026; with like 1 and a half hours of awesomeness from 2 levels.
<br>Set your standards low&#x2026; It&#x2019;s nowhere near as good as the original.
<br>I Give Dishonored 2
<br>a 5.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6809309">Expand</a></span>

This game is beautifully crafted and worth the $60. They have also added much more of a challenge and better kill animations. I only have one problem with the story and that is , other then that i have minor issues like there is no animation for picking up or throwing objects.</span>

However, with my GTX 1070 and i7-4790k, I can play on Very High to Ultra settings with minimal issues. Also, for those of you that do have problems, the game likes to set its priority to low after each loading screen, so changing it to normal or above should do the trick until there&apos;s a patch. Now, onto the review.
<br>
<br>The first Dishonored is my favorite game of all time. Obviously, I was anxious for the day to come where I could reprise my role as Royal Protector Corvo Attano, or I could possess the role of Empress Emily Kaldwin, whom has a slew of new abilities. As of now, I am around 10 hours into my playthrough as Emily and I must say that this is exactly what I expected from this sequel. Of course, there are multiple ways of reaching your target and also multiple ways to take down your target. Each power now has a more in-depth upgrade tree in which you can allow Corvo&apos;s Blink to be redirective, as Daud&apos;s was in the Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches, or you can upgrade Emily&apos;s Doppleganger ability to create copies of yourself that will fight for you.
<br>
<br>A new feature that I was very excited for was Bonecharm Crafting. This works by sacrificing a bone charm&apos;s trait so that you will be able to create a single bone charm with multiple traits taken from a sacrificed charm. You can create a single charm with two, three, or four traits, however, corrupted charms have made a reappearance from Daud&apos;s DLC. The more traits you add onto a crafted bone charm, the more likely it will be come corrupted and apply a negative attribute along with the traits you applied to it.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know much about graphics, but I can tell you that this game&apos;s graphics are outstanding. I will occasionally stop and stare at the scenery, which will sometimes appear as a beautiful painting. The art style has remained the same and it helps with its look that much more.
<br>
<br>There are new enemies, such as the Nest Keepers and the Clockwork Soldiers that will help gameplay from feeling repetitive. There are new faces, as well as old ones. There are new powers that can be heavily upgraded (if you can find the resources to do so), and old ones with new attributes to be added onto them. There&apos;s an entirely new system for bone charms that can be ignored if you do not care for corrupted charms. There are new places to explore, and there are old, but familiar ones that make this sequel feel that much more like Dishonored.
<br>
<br>This game has gotten a lot of criticism for its performance, but looking past this minor inconvenience, Dishonored 2 is yet another masterpiece created by the masterminds at Arkane Studios. In my opinion, Dishonored 2 is hands-down my Game of the Year and I would recommend this piece of art to each and every one of you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6830935">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now, onto the positives. Not exactly a mesmerizing 10/10 game, but a damn good one that beats the original. With a high fun factor and high replayability, this game is worth every penny. Somewhat like (but better than) the original, the story isn&apos;t perfect and the characters aren&apos;t always as intriguing as they should be, though your interest will still be kept the whole way through. Regardless of story, you get a lot more powers and such to play with, blasting up the aforementioned high fun factor.

<br>
<br>For reference Im running a MSI watercooled gtx 1080 with i4-4790k oc to 4.6ghz and 16gb ram. I was excited on the initial level because fps seemed fine around 80-120 fps but then as soon as you leave the first level it all goes **** up, fps dropping to 40-50 and it feels so stuttery.. I would say to decrease the visuals which I tried, I even tried going to very low/low settings and the results were so similar to running at very high/ultra about a 10-15 fps difference for what was a massive drop in visual quality sometimes no increase at all... showing that the game is very poorly optimised which is a massive let down
<br>
<br>friends on console loved this, but until they fix the optimisation issues on pc i would say don&apos;t waste your time. The game clearly has promise but stuttery and sluggish game play is not what I&apos;m after</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7083721">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I wasn&apos;t a fan of first Dishonored so I wasn&apos;t expecting much of it&apos;s successor. I play games from literally every genre and I am enjoying them, but Dishonored is this kind of game that doesn&apos;t do it for me. In my opinion the plot is not interesting and the steampunk setting is very odd in this game, but I can understand that others can enjoy it, that&apos;s why I have to say that if you liked Dishonored, Dishonored 2 you&apos;ll probably like as well.
<br>
<br>What I can say is that the graphics and audio are really good, I wasn&apos;t expecting them to be on such a high level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6905365">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, while the visuals are nice and the game runs decent on my system, I can&apos;t help but wonder about the fun factor.
<br>I&apos;ve managed my way into the third level and have so far neither experienced any attachment to the characters nor am I really interested in the story so far.
<br>
<br>It all seems kind of vague - go here, do this, go there and do that.
<br>While the game tries to somehow pack these single missions together, it really reminds me about the random quests one has to endure in countless RPGs.
<br>Somewhat detracting from the fun as well is the AI, which has spotted me several times, while I was cowering behind walls or obstacles.
<br>
<br>So to sum it up, I&apos;ve bought a game that hasn&apos;t got a great story going for it, the plot missions mimic fetch quests from RPGs and even though the game tries to place itself as a stealth game, enemies are able to detect you behind obstacles and walls.
<br>I had a great time exploring the first Dishonored and was really looking forward to this sequel, but so far I&apos;ve got the feeling that I didn&apos;t get my money&apos;s worth...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7371124">Expand</a></span>

It certainly does not make the game unplayable but is a bit annoying. Aside from that, during my 9 hours of play-through I did not encounter any bug. The story is just as interesting if not more compared to the original Dishonoured. The art design and graphics are just breathtaking. The combat and stealth feels refined and refreshed compared to the original with some new powers. The new powers are super useful and make the game very enjoyable. In its current state i would give the game 9/10. Without the technical issues it would&apos;ve been a 10/10. I have played the original dishonoured like 6 times full stealth and for me dishonoured 2 is everything i wanted from a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6804075">Expand</a></span>

Not only does it have a good story to play through that you can learn more from just picking up and reading all the different documents laying around, but the gameplay is outstanding and so entertaining.  I have been playing on very hard the whole time and I am close to the end of the game. Now, I will say like the first it was very frustrating in the beginning when you had barely any abilities at your disposal.  Although, that all changes and you can easily adapt yourself to the way you want to play.  I tried the nonlethal approach for a bit and loved the challenge, but once I started gaining powers from collecting the runes it all changed fast. Eliminating unaware guards could never get old and there are so many ways to do it.  So what if I have a high chaos ending at least it was fun the whole time and still quite the challenge at my difficulty setting. Lastly, I really despise people that leave reviews of games and give it awful scores because of their own hardware issues or FPS issue that will be patched.  I purposely waited until the issues were resolved with updates and driver updates until I made an educated decision about this review.  I will even say I had FPS issues with my combine GTX 970 SSC and GTX 670 (Dedicated PhysX GPU) running the game. Now, I am running the game on ultra settings and I have zero issues. So hopefully this is helpful because regardless I think this has a really good chance of being Game of the Year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6813233">Expand</a></span>

There is also apparently different endings depending on if you kill to many people or don&apos;t kill them, so that is like four play through i&apos;m never going to be able to get enough of this game.

<br>I played on a PC and a laptop both with solid CPUs (i7 intel), Game Cards (Radeon R9 390 8GB; Geforce 1070 8GB), and plenty of memory (32GB and 16GB).  I had no frame rate or stuttering problems, and no crashes, but can say that I appreciated the improvements over time in mouse functioning.
<br>
<br>I am an older gamer (66), a clinical social worker, and an artist.   The game is rich and challenging - full of encounters requiring meaningful choices, including morally and psychologically challenging ones; and it is a beautiful work, as well.  I did experiment a little with high chaos, and low chaos suits me better.  Point: you can play any way you like, and there is enough game there to play every way you like.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played through multiple times, as both Corvo and Emily, in 170 hours, preferring the powers of Emily until Game+ was released and then the difference all but disappeared.  Game+ gives the player enough powers (runes earned in earlier completed games that can be used after The Streets of Dunmore) to more easily explore the game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going in again, once more from the top, to see if I can explore every inch of every level in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6910618">Expand</a></span>

It took days of getting it to start and trying to get it run acceptable. And after finishing it, I regret playing it for the most part.
<br>
<br>It looks terrible and has strong performance issues even on recent hardware. Gameplay is actually quite good, but unforgiving when playing it ghost stealthy. Story and characters are a cheap rehash and it get&apos;s worse the closer you get to the end. Nearly every mission plays the same, and hardly any new gameplay element is ever introduced. They dishonored a honorable franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6963926">Expand</a></span>

It&#x2019;s one of the best stealth games out there. And I really wanted to like its sequel. But Dishonored 2 has a critical flaw: It was rushed to market. For PC gamers, D2 was a debacle at release. Nearly one year later, it&#x2019;s still a substandard heap of been there, done that. Not only is D2 a giant leap backwards in graphics and performance, it doesn&#x2019;t push other franchise elements forward. Ultimately, D2 drops the ball in every conceivable way. Arkane Studios and Bethesda ought to be ashamed.
<br>
<br>I was as excited as a kid on Christmas morning when it came time to download and install D2. 48 hours later, I uninstalled it without progressing past the second level. I gave it another go 8 months later. Still trashed. Graphics are despicable. Draw distances are incredibly short. Textures constantly pop in and out. Jagged lines everywhere. Some environments look flat and washed out while others are blindingly oversaturated. Character models and animations are comparable to  N64 games. D2 is like a 15 year old title which was patched with a free HD mod by a novice coder.
<br>
<br>It gets worse. D2 implements horrid motion blur that makes me sick. Others have the same complaint. Even after adjusting the settings, I get motion sickness playing D2 for just an hour or so. So what should&#x2019;ve been an enjoyable weekend experience took over a month to complete.
<br>
<br>To top it all off, frame rates are pathetic. Lowering the settings and resolution way down doesn&#x2019;t fix problems. D2 runs poorly because its garbage. It&apos;s so incredibly unoptimized, my rig runs on average of 8-10&#xB0;C hotter when playing it versus other major games. I installed an additional 120mm fan to compensate. Otherwise D2 will melt my computer, literally.
<br>
<br>Sound design is terrible as well because directional audio is broken. NPC&#x2019;s and enemies will be across the street, but their voices are heard next to the player. Footstep locations can&#x2019;t be accurately pinned down. I can&#x2019;t tell if enemies are above me, below me, or if they moved right or left. Since nonlethal playthru&#x2019;s require lots of creeping, locating enemies by sound is vital. Arkane also recycled ambient music from the original game. Lazy.
<br>
<br>The original Dishonored is no visual masterpiece, but it&#x2019;s still superb in its own right.  It successfully achieves a bleak aesthetic by resembling the dreary portraits featured in game. More importantly, the original focused on gameplay over graphics. So performance is slick and visuals are crisp even if things look a tad basic. The developer&#x2014;Arkane Studio&#x2014;used the Unreal Engine 3 engine which is a tried and true platform. And Arkane had prior experience with UE. For D2, Arkane used the Void Engine, a rebadged id Tech 5 engine. Only 3 or 4 developers have implemented the Tech 5 engine, so it&#x2019;s a relatively unused medium. And based on my experiences with Rage, Wolfenstein:TNO and Dishonored 2, I can see why. I bet Bethesda pushed Arkane to use an in house engine to cut cost. And gamers suffer. If Arkane had stuck with the Unreal Engine, I&#x2019;m certain D2 would be significantly better.
<br>
<br>D2&#x2019;s story is average and dull. The opening scene is so over-the-top that I rolled my eyes and set aside all urgency. Basically, a wizard lady turns people into stone, orders the immediate execution of imperial supporters, but inexplicably spares a deadly assassin who&#x2019;s friends with an ancient deity that imbued him with mystical powers. Next!! The hero&#x2019;s sudden helplessness doesn&#x2019;t fit, unless of course there&#x2019;s a wizard lady with amazeballs powers. Sure, the first Dishonored followed a similar formula, but it&#x2019;s executed more thoughtfully. The story and the world feel believable. The characters are more relatable, and treacherous. At the end, I was happy to get sweet revenge.
<br>
<br>In D2, I was happy when it finally ended, except the ending sucks. The narrative is weak, characters aren&#x2019;t compelling, and the lore isn&#x2019;t accurately represented in the atmospheric settings. Voice acting negatively impacts the story as well. The heroes&#x2019; whiney expositions are ill-suited and clich&#xE9;. It&#x2019;s a mixed bag despite the Hollywood talent.
<br>
<br>The ONLY thing D2 gets right is gameplay. It&#x2019;s more of the same except gamers can now assume the role of Emily. She has different powers than Corvo which encourages multiple playthru&#x2019;s once the motion sickness passes. No thanks.
<br>
<br>For me, D2 is unplayable. Motion sickness aside, D2 runs so poorly I can&#x2019;t enjoy it. I didn&#x2019;t expect the sequel to be as remarkable as the original Dishonored, but I expect it to be at least technically superior. Bioshock: Infinite and Mass Effect 2 are shining examples of games which improve on their predecessors. D2 could&#x2019;ve been one of those games. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s the exact opposite. Even on sale, I can&#x2019;t recommend D2. But I wholeheartedly recommend Bioshock: Infinite and the original Dishonored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7460846">Expand</a></span>

<br>I will talk about annoying shortcomings:
<br>Graphics, world looks really nice, in overall it looks atmospheric, but soap is everywhere, for 2010-12y game I will say it&apos;s a good visualization for photorealistic game, but for 2016 and with its performance can&apos;t give it good score, below medium is maximum what can I give, also people look strange, ugly as in every Bethesda game, but more plastic, hair is also plastic, whole objects in the world look plastic, detalization and object quality is also bad for photorealistic game and for that performance, also game can&apos;t allocate all 6GB VRAM, textures, shadows and resolution quality does not affect VRAM at all and use RAM instead of VRAM (looks like console emulated game and not ported), also can&apos;t properly work with all CPU cores. Not stable FPS, after Doom Vulkan I really expect same quality Graphics, Performance and Stability, but it&apos;s not even close to RotTR, FPS can jump from 120 to 20, in combat sometimes you can get freezes, game does not even use VRAM, and use RAM instead of VRAM, and even RAM is not fully used, when it goes over 16GB it start to use SSD instead of allocating whole 32GB of RAM or use whole VRAM instead of 15% of it for GPU side processes, shortly Emulation, reminds me old console exclusive games that was played on PC by emulators.
<br>Controls are most annoying problem of this game, you can&apos;t control where to blink no matter where you&apos;re pointing at game always decide to where you will blink, under wall, at the wall, on the enemy, in front of enemy, but not where you want to, on the wall or behind the enemy... Ctrl block+grab also does not work properly, sometimes it does not have problems, but mostly instead of silent grab you will continuously Block...
<br>Texture and Geodata blackholes, yes like in old fashioned MMORPGs you can stuck in textures and even fall through, enemies can hide in walls or under the floor and shoot....
<br>Sound, not biggest problem after Fallout, but game can&apos;t work with dolby sound, directions are mixed, so you can hear voice from behind when enemy who makes that noise is in front of you, left from right, atc... Also no echo effects.
<br>Mostly game feels like Early Access game, not finished, and poorly coded, what developer should be to make so badly coded game on id tech for PC, if it will be a indie game, then will say OK, for small studio, but from AAA game and for its price I expect more than that.
<br>But, Other parts, like story, atmosphere, music, characters, enemies, are really great, interesting.
<br>
<br>Sorry for my bad English.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7358553">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. The game looks just *amazing*! I mean it&apos;s like Crysis 1 back in 2007 - you just walk around and enjoy the beautiful environment throughout the *huge* levels.
<br>3. The game play is even more enjoyable than in the first game. As always, you have a lot of options to complete your objectives. I personally prefer a complete stealth (no blood, no see, sometimes even ghost-like), and I&apos;ve enjoyed both my playthroughs (ATM) very much.
<br>4. Both protagonists are nicely voiced, and they both talk a lot. Since I&apos;m a devoted Stephen Russell&apos;s fan since 1998, I personally prefer to hear Corvo&apos;s voice :).
<br>5. The world around you is alive. The Karnaca&apos;s street musicians sing *nice* songs, and the people around hear and applaud them. The City Watch cops whine about their cloths and boots, and even sing sometimes, too :). People at Karnaca&apos;s port are doing their own business: fishing, sawing, selling, discussing, looking for job. You can share a coin with beggars, and they can tell something useful in return. You can save an innocent people from the City Watch&apos;s tyranny, and they will thank you for this. Also, there is a time travel in the game, and you&apos;ll have to change something in the past to reach your goals in the present. My first playthrough took more than 60 hours - isn&apos;t that nice?
<br>
<br>Bottom line: 9/10. Must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6879896">Expand</a></span>
