I&apos;m going to try and give my opinion. Anyone that beats on this game for its &quot;p2w&quot; status has obviously not played it long enough, or is blatantly lazy and demands that everything be handed to &quot;it&quot; on a silver platter. This is my view. I have not spent a single penny on Blacklight Retribution. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt;The graphics are pretty good, the environments are colorful, and its cyberpunk theme is presented very nicely. However, if you&apos;re looking for BF3 level graphics, go play BF3. It&apos;s a shooter. If you&apos;re too busy staring at the wall textures, then you should really be doing something else.---------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt;Many people have also hit on this game on its &quot;complexity&quot;, stating that it has too many elements, the gun customization is too complicated, the tutorial is too complicated, HRV is too complicated. They are all impatient idiots who are all unwilling to just sit down for a few minutes and learn. The system is not hard. It just requires some getting used to. If you want a simpler game, go and play some **** generic Korean FPS like Combat Arms. --------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt;The cash shop/paying IRL is another thing I&apos;ve been seeing as a complaint here. It is also one of the biggest parts of an F2P game. As such, this section will be the longest. Let me get this straight: --The ONLY things that are only obtainable in BL:R via money only are heroes, cosmetic items, taunts, a few profile customization options, and a COUPLE gun receivers. That is it. Everything else, and I mean everything (every single gun part, every single piece of armor, every single piece of equipment) is obtainable permanently by just playing the game. ---------------------------------------------------``Premade weapons(only permable by zen) can be obtained by gp for a very low daily price-200gp. That&apos;s about 1.5 matches, which will take a MAXIMUM of 15 minutes. That&apos;s a hell of a lot better than other F2P games. -----------------------``Just like other F2P FPS, you can earn Zen(in game money) by doing surveys or offers via the BL:R website. ---------``Items are unlocked on a per level basis. HOWEVER, every single time that you level up, you automatically get a free weapon tag as well as 1 of each item that has been unlocked for 3 DAYS. --``ALSO, People who think that you can only unlock weapons for 1 day with GP are illiterate, lazy, and do not follow the tutorial. In the purchase option, hit the little arrow next to &quot;1 day&quot;, and choose a period of time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------``Perming items is not that hard with GP. Your most expensive weapon part is a receiver at 5000 GP. At 150gp a game, that&apos;s only about 30-40 matches. Those that whine and complain about the game being a &quot;grind for gp&quot; need to take the immediate gratification/item needing dick out of their ass and go back to COD. The game is fun, even with the standard equipment. Need proof that standard equipment isn&apos;t pure **** and is actually viable? Go search &quot;z3roarmada&quot; on Youtube. &gt;&gt;Next, the gameplay. BL:R has a mechanic called HRV, in which you can see the location of every single player, depot, vehicle, and objective on the map for a limited time, with a set recharge. &quot;AHMAHGAWD THAT&apos;S OP&quot; It&apos;s not if everyone can do it. With that added mechanic, situational awareness is key, and ambushes are nigh impossible. Many players are unused to this and throw their anger in the form of a bad score. The gameplay is straightforward and recognizable, with your typical DM, TDM, CTF, and KOTH, and escort. It also has Kill Confirmed (a spin off of TDM), as well as Netwar and Domination(similar to KOTH). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt;One last thing. The customization in this game is amazing. The guns(all of them) you use(as long as they&apos;re not premade) can be customized with a unique receiver, muzzle, barrel, magazine, stock, scope, weapon tag, as well as a skin. Fun-wise, I think that this game is one of the best that I&apos;ve played, especially for the price of free. I have dumped a few weeks on this game, and it has not bored me yet. This overview, while definitely not the best, covers what I think should help clear some things up. Damn Metacritic and its lack of allowing me to organize my wall of text.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2610310">Expand</a></span>

Controls are solid, player builds are very well balanced, pace is fast and exciting, maps are varied and interesting. Customization is deep and complex and very satisfying. Gaining experience points in matches to level up and unlock more gear is also very satisfying. This is an excellent game overall!</span>

<br>
<br>The other reviews are very one sided, the &quot;Wallhack&quot; in the game is called HRV, it is to prevent people from camping in corners, and locating your team, the objectives, and any possible threats nearby.
<br>
<br>There is no aimbot, that other reviewer is completely retarded.
<br>
<br>The servers work fine, maybe your connection is bad?
<br>Maybe the servers were down for maintenance, or game was updating?
<br>
<br>Also, it does not cost $10, it&apos;s  100% free.
<br>
<br>People are ignorant and stupid, and I&apos;m not going to be that person, so I&apos;ll say some bad things about the game.
<br>
<br>The zombie mode doesn&apos;t have many maps, and it&apos;s really fun.
<br>
<br>Wearing the best armor in the game only makes you have 50% more health, and it completely destroys the ability to run.
<br>
<br>The Speed demon pants are way too awesome when you&apos;re using a SMG.
<br>
<br>The guns don&apos;t sound that powerful, maybe its because of the future though.
<br>
<br>And camo is cheap, but people assume you&apos;re a P2W if you have camo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441123">Expand</a></span>

This game also features smooth controls and plays great with a massive amount of customization  Why is this only a 9? Because of 2 reasons, 1: there are issues with the servers at times 2: There are hackers and the publisher doesn&apos;t seem to do much about them and while there are not many they are quite annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3238680">Expand</a></span>

Now, let me tell my experience with the game. I have played upwards 150 hours in the game, many of which I have enjoyed. This game possibly has the most expansive customization in an FPS ever. Personally I&apos;ve never seen anything like it, and it should be downloaded just to see it. But we&apos;ll get back to that in a moment. now, unto the game play. you have your usual pew pew action, but those who say its primitive haven&apos;t played since early 2012. they changed the recoil system so its randomized similar to Counter-Strike, and is very engrossing. there are multiple weapons besides the guns as well, such as exploding tomahawks (yes, they are insane), stun shurikens, mines, along with melee weapons and grenades. as you unleash carnage and PLAY THE OBJECTIVE (c&apos;mon, people!) you unlock in combat credits. these are credits to be spent in battle, and disappear once the next round starts. you spend these at &quot;depots&quot;, a future soldier&apos;s Toys R Us, where you can get rocket launchers, Hardsuits (mechs) and airstrike markers, alongside more common fare like ammo replenishment and heals. after a match, you are awarded a small chink of the in-game currency, GP. GP, alongside the paid currency, Zen, can be spent on permanent items. Now, here&apos;s the thing. the default weapon is actually really good, and someone who says different is probably just bad at FPS games, and should be disregarded as such. But, if your preferences are not fit for the specific strategies and builds of the gun, there are a variety of other guns to choose from, alongside different components, changing its stats, like firing rate, recoil, and damage dealt per shot. If you are going to play without spending money, let me tell you, it will take a rather long time to unlock things. but here&apos;s the thing: the game is so good, you won&apos;t mind waiting that long. not to mention, the developers created a system by which, after one or two matches you could rent a weapon for 24 hours. however, please note: the publishers of the game, PWE, have decided to remove the one day rental option, so one would have to play for upwards of 4 matches to get it for 3 days. But may I remind you, unless you dislike FPS games, you will have a fun time during those matches. In summary, Blacklight Retribution is a fun, fast-paced shooter with enough to set it apart from the crowd, and, if you find the action satisfactory, you won&apos;t mind its few problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3239049">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fantastic Weapon and Character Customization
<br>Good Number of Multiplayer/Co-op gamemodes
<br>Great Graphics
<br>Fun Maps
<br>Unique Gameplay style
<br>I&apos;d give it a 10, it takes a long time to level up and is not easy to get new items if youre not willing to pay.
<br>If you are a pc gamer or just plan to get the ps4 DO TRY THIS GAME!</span>

For the most part, this is true. But once you get into the meat of the game, you&apos;ll find that it&apos;s just another cookie cutter modern shooter and there is very few that is unique about this game. Beginning with the pros of the game, for one it is beautiful. The graphics of this game are even better than Battlefield 3. The futuristic style of things really adds a nice touch. The maps are also great and textured well, so you wont be disappointed here. Another pro is the customization. This game allows you to customize many different elements of a weapon to fit your liking. For instance, you could sacrifice damage for lower recoil, have a gun with explosive ammo that shoots really fast, etc. It&apos;s terribly customizable, but a con of the game goes hand and hand with the game is the free-to-play model. There are two types of currency in this game, GP and Zen. GP is a currency that can be earned through doing matches. Zen is (as with all free-to-play games) the game&apos;s pay-real-money-for-this currency. Most items will allow you to use both GP and Zen on it, and that&apos;s great. The problem is that the GP is earned really slow. If you wanted to purchase a permanent form of an item, it would take a multitude of games, which is unfortunate. For the most part, you&apos;ll be found renting items for anywhere between 1-30 days (except items seem to require at least a 7-day rental, I hope this is fixed). If they were to increase the amount of GP earned per game, it would make the game a lot better, because you would unlock more parts for your guns faster and would stop having to use the default AR over and over.
<br>
<br>To discuss the combat, I have to say it&apos;s hardly different from Call of Duty or Battlefield 3. It&apos;s based on twitch-reaction accuracy which is really, really annoying. This is something that not everybody can do, and it takes awhile (if possible at all) to train your hands. I am one of these people. Whoever can jerk their mouse the fastest will win the gunfight. It&apos;s sad too, because the same thing applies to any modern shooter. And that&apos;s basically what the combat is, and the combat is what a first-person shooter is about. Now there are a unique caliber of guns, ranging from assault rifles to sub-machine guns, but in all honesty most assault rifles and higher-caliber guns are just too recoil-heavy to use. This game teaches you what real recoil is. In conclusion, it&apos;s a free game, and it&apos;s a great casual game. It offers stunning graphics along with a high-amount of customization. However the combat is way too fast paced and the free-to-play model kind of ruins the casual part of it. If this game was pay-once, things would be a lot better, as you&apos;d unlock everything in game either by leveling up or just using GP. However this is not the case, and there is no use hanging on that point.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3119217">Expand</a></span>

The fact that majority of what you can pay real money for is temporary makes it worth it to work hard and buy the in game cash permanent items. At first I hated the &quot;Visor&quot; that allows you to see where everyone is, but then I realized that you don&apos;t have a radar and you can&apos;t fire while using the visor. That makes it a very useful tool and since everyone has one you end up seeing each other coming and are forced to make quick decisions. If you don&apos;t have the time to dedicate to 40+ matches to get the points to buy a few things, I think you should refrain from reviewing. Many of the negative reviews on here are from people who likely picked the first server they saw with payers way above their level and didn&apos;t give it enough time to EARN their equipment. Once u get around 200 matches, more or less if you win/lose, you can really start to put your player together and put the customization system to use.
<br>
<br>Outside of the poor/confusing menu design the game is a lot of fun to play once u get into the match. Sadly because of the customization being a core feature and the menus being so bad, with somewhat generic gameplay I have to give it a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3269800">Expand</a></span>

It is incredibly balanced for a free to play shooter, receivers having their own weaknesses and strengths. Customizations to the receivers are also balanced in my opinion, besides the scopes. Holoscopes are the best by far for automatic receivers such as Assault Rifles, but then again, it&apos;s MY opinion. Graphics, sound of the guns firing are very satisfying. Nothing is like the sound of a light machine gun shooting in the morning. Those who say this is P2W is obviously deluded. For every level, you get temporary items so you don&apos;t NEED to buy ANYTHING for a while. The classic Assault Rifle (the receiver you start with) is very comparable to other receivers, making it balanced. An element that makes this game differ from other shooters is HRV. Some may say it&apos;s broken, others say it&apos;s a good because it changes the gameplay from other shooters, which is the POINT of the game. If you want to play without it, join a server that disables it or just go back to COD. This game is far from pay to win.

Forget what the negative people say, they complain that &quot;Wallhacks&quot; ruin the game, when they don&apos;t even know the real meaning of them. The &quot;Wallhacks&quot; prevent campers from actually dominating the game and ruining the game like COD. It also has its cons like It is extremely duration time and you are unable to fire when using it. They also complain of Zen (Special Premium Currency) Users to have a advantage over Non-Zen users. That is a complete and ignorant lie because every item has its cons and pros and Zen does not buy any special un-obtaniable item that is bought by Zen only. Everything can be unlocked with GP unlike other games like Combat Arms where the majority of the weapons cannot be unlocked by GP. Most of the people complaining have no idea how to play the game and ignored the tutorial completely which reviewed the game basics as in: Weakness points for Hardsuits, Using a grenade, aiming. This game is the best of its kind, and you will not find anything better because this game fixes all the errors other FPSs have made. The only problem with this game is the match-making system because Level 12 people get paired up with Level 35 people. Do not pay attention to the ignorant kids in the Negative section because most of their complaints are pure rubbish and crap excuse. This game is excellent overall and I would HIGHLY recommend you telling your friends about this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2621633">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is FREE!, meaning you DON&apos;T have to pay for it. But while pay to win may be the angle the developers decided to go for it doesnt mean you have to. I think too many of you are judging this game for something that it is not. It doesnt bear the symbol of EA or Activision so many of the players are writing it off as bad spin offs. Dont. I spent about 3-5 hours playing this game on my day off and i found the game amusing! I did not however find any difficulties in beating the living crap out of other players whose level and gear greatly dwarfed my own. It came down to weapon skill and player skill. I feel many of the reviewers that gave this game a &quot;blam&quot; mark wrote their reviews in frustration. I can understand why as many scenarios i found myself I would ask myself &quot;how the hell did that happen&quot; as i was picked off from across the map by a sub machine gun. Thanks to BF3 I have difficulty playing many FPS that dont use the &quot;bullet drop&quot; affect. However, hats off to the Dev team, because this game is a win. Not a smash hit, but will totally keep many FPS fans entertained for quite a while. Im in.
<br>
<br>P.S.  Read all the enraged players that gave this game a &quot;0&quot;. They are mad at their own lack of gaming skills and try to redeem their feelings of relevancy by putting down the game. It is just a game. A free one.. do not be angry when you decide to put your wallet into it and are disappointed when you dont get what you are after.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2603949">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, many people complain that it takes too long to earn GP to get new guns and equipment, but ignore the system enabling 1 day rental, 7 day rental, and permanent items. This can make people choose whether they want to invest into building up a permanent class, or buy their favourite items playing through a week during the holidays, or every so often for a day when you have the time. The ability to change the muzzle, barrel, stock, scope, and every piece of the gun you can think of  makes you think about what you are going to get, and it rewards you for playing the game well by what you do in a game.I, myself, do not often play this game for days in a row, yet have many permanent items that I like to choose between when tweaking my guns, which often happens every time I play. Often, my friends would rent their favourite pre-made so that they can own with their style of play, and this is often a good way for some people to work for permanent items. Notice when I say favourite, since some people will play extremely well with their own SMG while another person wouldn&apos;t live without getting a sniper. The gameplay is great, and changing out only a couple of pieces of your gun can make you notice recoil differences, change in sound, range and spread, showing they really made the customization have depth, with so many different class arrangements you can find by picking up a friendly or enemy weapon drop, which can really help to pick up If you think you need to give the other team a taste of their own medicine. Some people do not want to spend time perfecting their weapon, so they can decide to buy non-customizable pre-mades to keep them happy. But what if you don&apos;t want to buy new armours and equipment either? You can get whole character packages that let you drop into play whenever you want, with tailored equipment and guns, with new characters popping out all the time. From snipers, to back-stabbers, to mech-xperts (funny, right?), to heavy gunners, to speed demons. Find the right thing for you and you can enjoy this game as much as you try to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3088213">Expand</a></span>

The game play feels great along with the shooting mechanics and game types. It feels like a pretty even battlefield playing against people who spend money; it doesn&apos;t feel like they have a huge advantage over people who don&apos;t spend anything on the game, it feels like a skilled player could beat any player who puts money into the game. Graphics are amazing for a F2P game to tell you the truth, they are up to par with some triple A games. It also gives you choices to change you video settings if your pc can&apos;t handle some of the graphics which offers other players with just regular computers like myself to play it without any problems. You can also customize your weapons, character and equipment to fit your play style and there is enough depth there to keep it interesting. The only thing that could spoil this great game is the ability to see enemies through walls with HRV (wall hack). Its over used a lot by every player and takes out some tactical elements to the game. It frustrating trying to go around and flank an enemy, but being caught by the HRV and getting killed. Besides this small problem, it is a great game and I recommend giving it a try since it&apos;s free and cost nothing at all to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2669785">Expand</a></span>

The gunplay feels tight, and no weapons really feel overpowered than others (Unless you have a low recoil/low spread LMG setup).  Speaking of gun setups, its amazing to see all that stats that you can modify by choosing different attachments.  Almost anything you can think of relating to your weapons or armor can be customized to your exact play style.
<br>
<br>And the reason why I&apos;m liking this game so much - The maps feel well thought out with plenty of alternate paths.  With the exception of HeloDeck, the maps have a great mixture of places to snipe and places to get into a total **** of a gunfight.  For a F2P game, nobody could have asked for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2548031">Expand</a></span>

I personally find the HRV (feature that lets you see through walls) to be a huge bonus as far as the speed and strategy of the matches; after all, everybody&apos;s got it. The maps are interesting and well laid out and the &quot;F2P + cash extras&quot; model is very well done; it&apos;s not intrusive to the game and the cash-bought items do not give you an advantage in each match; you can buy it all if you spend time playing. Bottom line: if you want a Counterstrike-style game with a few twists, it&apos;s worth the $0 to download it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509844">Expand</a></span>

I have spent no money and I am almost always on the podium and frequently first place.  The bad scores and complaints I have read about are usually by people who have hardly played Blacklight  or just aren&apos;t very good and get owned, then cry &quot;pay to win&quot;.  Things like the mechs, the HRV (wall hack), depots add strategic interest to the game.  After playing for as long as I have I have realized that this game is very well balanced and well designed.  I think this game is as good and as fun as BF3.  If you like competitive online shooters, you are missing out if you don&apos;t give it a try.  New content is always being added, it&apos;s easy to find and join servers, no crashes.

I wont say I am a tournament winning Ace in the Shooter department but Im no slouch either, Im emptying clips into folks from the standard rifle using controled bursts and then getting seemingly 2-3 shotted by opponents who have upgraded weapons. When it shows the killcam I can see their health is almost gone &amp; when im firing I see the redbox registering hits but so often this happens where they seem to pip me at the post. To win 1 on 1&apos;s i generally have to be behind someone on get a headshot in the opening exchange.
<br>
<br>In any case upon further playing I retracted previous statements about being pay 2 win.
<br>
<br>Apparently I was playing on the non level restricted servers, instead I should have stayed on the &quot;Proving grounds&quot; set of servers for players level 1-10. Having tried the level restricted servers I found it was actually pretty good fun, sure the odd person has slapped down RMT and bought something a little overwhelming but not many. The Default Assault Rifle Reciever with a couple of 3800GP (GP being Game Points earned ingame) modifications is actually really good and premade weapons of other types can be rented for as little as 200 GP a day (thats just a little less than 2 full matches worth of GP).
<br>
<br>In any case Skill does come back into play and the Counterstrike Style per match unlocks are good fun, i particularly like the flamethrower &amp; hardsuit which is kinda like the Mech in District 9.
<br>
<br>I am out of the Proving Grounds now (locks you out at level 11) and have earned enough GP for a couple decent weapon upgrades for my A/R and managed to get some items from the free offers around the net. More than enough to hold my own against hgih levels in the open matches now. Worth a look if you can get it working, but it does have some technical issues. When you run the launcher and it starts to patch (particularly the very first time you run the patcher) just leave it running. The progress bar wont update until it gets to like 90%+ or if it does it will show like 3% then no movement till its finished, which is what it did to me. If it cant patch it actually returns an error fairly quickly, I left mine patching overnight when I first installed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2670083">Expand</a></span>

The &apos;wall-hack&apos; mechanic has an extremely positive side effect of keeping action up by directing players towards each other, which someone like me really appreciates. The nade mechanics are on point, you can cook a nade, the throw arch is very intuitive, nothing feels wonky or out of place, the gun balance seems fine, granted I&apos;m not lvl 10 yet so I haven&apos;t accessed the late game stuff. I mean I went into this game having extremely high standards for FPS and I am just amazed how satisfying the game experience is.

                                        <span>This game is good, although some of the weapons are OP and I&apos;ve come across some hackers, but other than that it is a really good game, I don&apos;t see why all these people are giving it bad reviews. It does deserve higher than what the users and critics are giving. So don&apos;t listen to them, go and get it for yourself, besides, it is FREE!</span>

Thats because there&apos;s a sort of prejudice that there are no &quot;free games&quot; as well as the notion that success isn&apos;t possible without SOME payment, here&apos;s a game that disproves this theory, as victory is more than possible without special gear.
<br>The best thing that Blacklight: Retribution does is to make everything a side-grade, (With the plausible exception of incendiary ammunition, which gives 110% damage, but over time). this means that even the highest level items and most expensive heroes are only about as useful as the user is at managing them. Someone could have a cheap build with a powerful pre-made weapon and demolish any user with sheer skill and strategy. (I did use zen, to buy camouflages and a taunt)
<br>The HRV (The so called &quot;Wallhacks&quot;) isn&apos;t something you&apos;ve seen in FPS games often, the effect it causes is to increase game speed, avoid camping, and encourage players to take a strategic approach to the enemy. Thus overall improving every matches&apos; dynamic flow.
<br>The biggest joy I have encountered in Blacklight, is playing enough of it to find the right weapon loadout for me. Each weapon part makes a big difference to how your weapon handles, and it&apos;s ideal to find that great balance between decent accurate stopping power and mobility.
<br>Map design is very interesting, most maps seem to have a style of play built around them, and the spawning algorithms are something to be impressed about, The chance of any enemy being behind your spawn are pretty much 99% against in all of my time with Blacklight. (The times it happened was in teeny tiny maps, such as Helodeck).
<br>One of the things i particularly reward this game on, is the fact that it has a massive collection of pre-made weapons, all available at level 1, all at the one day rent cost of 200GP (a match and 1/4 of play)
<br>This way, each day, you can try out as many guns as you&apos;d like until you find one for you, and when you do, you can replicate the weapon using the customization menu. Armor is something most people complain about being too expensive, yet they are unaware that the standard armor is very good to start with, and a single armor rental can provide with survival over any bolt-action rifles. leaving you with enough speed to dodge the next bullet.
<br>Rather you want to be a huge sniper tank or a tiny speedy peashooter, Blacklight provides with the items for the task.
<br>Did you know it&apos;s free to play? what are you waiting for?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2855612">Expand</a></span>

It does have some in game purchases but it is not pay to win because these weapons, gear etc can be bought very easily using in game xp credits, and this is easy because the amount of credits it takes you to buy said weapon is about 2 games. Very good game and it is FREE!</span>

This game is free, deep and looks great-why pay a ton of cash if you want a mediocre, yet addictive multiplayer game; when you can get deep, engaging and addictive multiplayer for free? The feature that is lacking is the inclusion of a campaign or coop-seeing as how the controls and shooting mechanics are better than COD, but that&apos;s a minor gripe. The whole game contains; Standard, deep, COD style multiplayer, a tutorial and Bots. The character and weapon customisation is immense and the menu interface is great. Getting and staying in a match is easy, while the consecutive point steaks you can earn are inventive. The cyber, techno, future theme means that the game&apos;s sound track is great and that the environments have a distinct feel to the game. Obviously lag and bug issues come in, but most are removed and don&apos;t decrease the score.
<br>
<br>In Short; Blacklight Retribution is the multiplayer game of the year, the only problem is the lack of a desired campaign or coop mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446872">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s totally free 2 play and zen only gets your items faster because you have to level up to unlock it with GP, but you can buy anything with GP which you can earn from games so i say you should review the game again if you havent already.</span>

The matches are fast paced and are perfect if you do not have much time.  The weapon customization is incredibly deep and I do not feel it is pay to win at all.  Almost every item can be had eventually without spending a dime.  Renting gun parts for 24hrs is cheap, so I have been renting and trying tons of parts.  Once I know which parts I want, I simply save my points to buy them permanently and soon will have my perfect gun.
<br>
<br>I understand some of the complaints on here, but most are non-factors if you stick with the game a little.  The rent vs permanent option is hard to find at first and it seems like some people sour on the game quickly when the item they think they got permanently expires.  Once you figure out where to choose rent vs permanent, this is not an issue.  There are tons of menus that definitely take getting used to.  The other thing is the servers.  Right when the game went on Steam, the servers where kind of a mess and quick match was broken.  I believe this has been addressed because I have not had any issues the last week or so.
<br>
<br>Overall I would definitely recommend.  I even bought the starter pack just to support the developers a little.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2546913">Expand</a></span>

No, not even just for a F2P. It&apos;s outright an amazing game. The graphics are excellent, the soundtrack is sweet, the gameplay is fluid, the audio is crisp, the menus are well designed, and just about every round is intense. Anyone who believes this game is a pay to win game is just a sore loser. Shelling out cash only gives you fancy skins, silly emotes, XP boosts, and lets you hang on to some items permanently. None of these things give you an edge on the battlefield. It only grants you the ability to personlize your soldier freely. It&apos;s rare that I feel the need to get online and recommend a game but this one does it for me. I am honestly sick of the MW series and really no FPS games have impressed me in a long while. To have spent so much time away from the FPS genre and to finaly come across Blacklight Retribution (and its free!) has been a breath of fresh air.

<br>The game plays feels like Call Of Duty (which is almost the best a FPS can get), and its better then most FPS&apos;s out there, like War Rock and Team Fortress 2.
<br>The graphics are awesome and for an online game its amazing, and the guns are beautifully made.
<br>The sound is just amazing, it feels like a real war, because of the guns shots, explosions etc... I love the feeling of battle while playing the game, so to play this game in full awesomeness grab some headphones and prepare to blow some heads up!
<br>Also a lot users are giving it negative scores like 0 and 4, but its impossible for this game to get a negative, because the game play is like your &quot;beloved&quot; Call Of Duty, the graphics incredible and in each match a new experience!
<br>So if you don&apos;t know how to play don&apos;t review this game. Or if you don&apos;t like just don&apos;t play it and stop bashing on it.
<br>And Has you can see I gave the game and 9. Why not a 10? Because its not 100%. It has some errors and bugs but besides that, and if you like FPS&apos;s get ready for lots of hours of fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577705">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. It&apos;s free to play, but not pay to win, and do not believe the misinformed/ill intended people who say otherwise. Everything gameplay related can be bought with game points (GP). While you don&apos;t have to buy anything with real money in order to improve your odds, you may end up buying things with money to support the game.
<br>2.

Most people posting here either like it or they don&apos;t. People are not like professional reviewers, they don&apos;t waste time in every single detail of the game. In fact, what most people do is to log in and start playing and they don&apos;t care about anything else. Also, people are not like reviewers in the sense that they are biased by everything around them: those things might include other games, other people, the media, or they might even go along with what everyone else is saying, just because everybody else is saying it...they don&apos;t want to be the oddball who actually liked the game, while everyone else said they didn&apos;t. But you don&apos;t have to be! Nobody is forcing you to not play a game just because they think it&apos;s bad, ultimately it is your choice because you can do whatever you wish with your own computer and you answer to nobody. You never know the truth about a game, until you install it and play it yourself. With that said, I believe Blacklight Retribution is a great game: 1) The graphics are awesome, this game runs on the Unreal Engine with DX11. We all know Unreal Engine, it runs great on many varieties of computers. It has many choices, among them tessellation, bokeh, and depth of field. But that is nothing to be worried about, because entry level cards can max out this game, no problem. 2) Dedicated Servers are amazing, the ping is below 100 (on a basic AT&amp;T connection) and there is always plenty of people to play with at any time of the day. You can filter out servers, and find your place in a game easy as 1,2,3 (Well, at least I haven&apos;t had any problem with that). 3)I like the maps, they are great. They are medium sized and are designed so that you never spawn in the same place twice. They are also colorful and shiny, but you may need to turn the brightness up on some. 4)Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;wall-hack&quot; visor doesn&apos;t really change anything. You can&apos;t shoot through the walls, and you can&apos;t even shoot while using it anyway. 3) Everyone dies. IF you are new to the game, no worries, because higher level players can be killed just as easily as you, no one has an advantage, even if they paid (I&apos;ve killed dozens of them no problem, head-shots even) . 4) There no advertising in this game. That is amazing, considering it&apos;s F2P and all.  A couple of cons, yeah you have to rent things with GP which only last 2 or 3 days and you also have to dish out a lot of GP for weapon parts, but I believe that is a small price to pay, because in real money you have the chance to pay $0 = )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2879244">Expand</a></span>

What makes this one unique is the &quot;HRV&quot;, a kind of limited-use wallhack that lets you see everyone on the map as a red or orange silhouette, depending on their team. This is Blacklights take on the minimap you might know from CoD, and it has an enormous impact on the game.
<br>The HRVs use is limited by a timer which slowly recharges. You can&apos;t fire while it&apos;s active and switching on and off will take a second as well. Used well, the HRV can give you great awareness and with a bit of foresight it can be one of your strongest weapons. The least it can do is reduce downtime, because you won&apos;t have to run around the map looking for the enemies in a deathmatch game.
<br>In objective based modes it can help you find less defended spots and plan out your actions. As I said, it is game changing, and you&apos;ll have to keep in mind that your enemy could see you as well... which is not to say you cannot sneak up on them.
<br>If you don&apos;t like the HRV or try to ignore it, you won&apos;t like Blacklight. I for one think it&apos;s pretty great. It&apos;s a matter of taste as well, but it&apos;s definitely an original feature that sets this game apart.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s graphics are nothing groundbreaking technically; it&apos;s Unreal 3 engine, nuff said.
<br>Visually, everything is loosely cyberpunk oriented, with designs and locations reminiscent of movies like Ghost in the Shell or Appleseed. Blacklights version of the flashbang is an EMP grenade that will give everyone it hits a virtual bluescreen while the helmets OS has to boot up again, resulting in 2-3 seconds of blindness, which is pretty cool if you ask me. It&apos;s little things like these that give the game a soul and personality.
<br>The whole cyberpunk motive reflects pretty well within the gameplay itself, as taking objectives in certain game modes means &quot;hacking&quot; nodes, and Blacklights variant of TF2s Payload is a map where you have to escort a slow moving spider tank in which one player can sit and use the turret. If you want, you can even pilot your very own robot called a &quot;Hardsuit&quot;, which can lay waste to entire squads in seconds, but is also easily countered by a smart player using a rocket launcher.
<br>
<br>There is a metagame that lets you customize your equipment and specialize in HP, speed, low recoil or weapon spread. The amount of customization options can be overwhelming at first, but the default equipment is balanced and completely viable throughout the game.
<br>You can rent or permanently buy almost everything in the game with the currency you gain by playing, called GP, and while it can take a lot of GP to permanently buy some of the parts, the game is very generous with letting you try out everything. When your character levels up, you get an in-game mail that contains all the items you unlocked as 3 day trials. The cost of renting something for 1 day is about the amount of GP you&apos;ll get by playing two matches. What this means is that in Blacklight, unlike games like Tribes Ascend, you&apos;ll never spend huge amounts of ingame currency on something and then find out it wasn&apos;t what you wanted after all. If you feel like sniping &quot;just today&quot;, you can cheaply get a sniper rifle without spending a lot of your GP. As far as F2P goes, this is as fair of a system as I can imagine.
<br>If you just started playing and feel helpless and weak, let me assure you that this is NOT because all the other players bought their way to victory.
<br>
<br>Okay, so I said that I was going to be objective, which also means talking about the downsides. To be honest, I can&apos;t find many flaws with this game. There are some smaller bugs, the biggest one I encountered was when the game decided to spawn both teams right next to each other, which resulted in quite a bloodbath, but that was one out of literally hundreds of games.
<br>As with every game, some things are up to individual taste. You might not like the HRV, you might not like how the weapons handle. Blacklight doesn&apos;t reinvent the wheel either, but the whole HRV thing is something we haven&apos;t really seen yet. Ordinarily I&apos;d say 7 out of 10 for a very solid game, but since BLR brings something new to the table as well, that&apos;s one more point - 8/10. A very awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2566912">Expand</a></span>

Kind of like the Call of Duty MW3 map &quot;Dome&quot; Just the right size to still be fun. But for all your long-range lovers, don&apos;t worry, there are still some pretty large maps, and a few great ones for sniping. Now i&apos;m going to transition to the guns. You can literally customize every aspect about your gun. You can customize receiver (assault rifle, sub machine gun, light machine gun, heavy assault rifle, combat rifle, and bolt action rifle), muzzle, barrel, magazine, scope, stock, weapon tag (little charm on your gun that gives it bonuses), and camo. And for each of the categories there is usually 10+ options to choose from. Now for the armor. The armor is very easy to customize, with around 5-6 options for either upper body, helmet, lower body, or camo. Then there&apos;s depot items. These are special items that you can buy with points you earn throughout the game (kind of like COD kill streaks but not really). All together its a really fun game, and its free!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2291150">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s all based on gun skill. As far the the graphics go, it looks great. I have a higher end gaming pc, and with the settings on high, it looks like almost any other shooter on the market, and for a free-to-play, I think it looks pretty great. The price for gold and zen are pretty high, but then again, the game IS free. The maps are pretty balanced and the spawning blows CODs out of the water. All in all, Blacklight: Retribution is a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2525391">Expand</a></span>

Barely any glitches, the HRV (pretty much wall hack) makes sure no one really is able to camp at all. And it&apos;s not P2W either. Sure if you spend money you will have a lead, but i did not spent any zen at all and is still rocked. This game is much more about skill than gear. And it does not take a full day to unlock a single accessory. Play 1-2 matches, get about 200 -400 GP and you have enough to either buy a premade weapon, which you can not customize but can give you a feel for certain weapon builds, or slowly build your own. Granted to perma buy anything costs a crazy amount of gp and zen, so i can see why ppl go for zen. But each time you lvl the game sends you a mail with some items for your lvl which last for three days, that is more than enough time to earn enough gp to be able to keep renting your gear for say 1 day, or 7 days until you can earn enough gp to buy that thing forever. So i would suggest this game for everyone, this game is better than some major titles as well, BF3 comes to mind,  BF3 is just plain **** fail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549566">Expand</a></span>

If they increased the time to kill and took away the built in wall hacks this game could easily be a 9/10 but instead it&apos;s just a f2p annoyance. Do yourself a favor and skip this. Play NS2 or Hawken instead. If you like COD maybe this game is for you otherwise just skip it.</span>

There is no ultimate weapon. If you are constantly loosing - it means you are a beginner at the game. There is also the hack issue - but compared to other F2P games here are a small number of hackers. You don&apos;t have to pay a cent - almost everything is attainable by playing the game. And about the grinding - this is a less grindy game than Battlefiled4Free, or Warface or AVA. A helpful forum community - can answer questions in a friendly manner. The game just has to have more maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2684186">Expand</a></span>

If you are just starting, you would have no lacking compared to the higher level players except maybe in gear, but that is rather minor. What this game focuses more on is skill and experience, although I must admit that occasionally its a simple spray and pray situation. There are a few balance issues with some of the &quot;cheap&quot; gear that requires no real skill to use and get kills such as the exploding tomahawk and the stun shurikens, but they have been balanced recently to make them less of an annoyance. Overall, this game is one of the best fps I&apos;ve ever played in my life and I always find time to play it because it&apos;s simply fun and engaging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3733542">Expand</a></span>

However, there is maybe 1 flaw in the whole game: it just seems very hard to play and get the hang of. It takes a whole lot of practice to get it only slightly easier. However, the game is very fun. Hardsuits? Just awesome.</span>

Surely better than Team Fortress 2 after it was made free-to-play.  Here&apos;s why.<br><br>Of course, the first concern for anyone interested in the free-to-play model is, can free users still play competitively. The answer is a resounding yes. The balance in game mechanics is incredible, and the developers are working very hard to tweak everything perfectly. Free users are in no way at a disadvantage. There are a large variety of play-styles that are possible, and each one feels well balanced and fun. Games are played up to 16 players at a time, in 10-minute matches ranging the traditional gamut of gametypes: capture the flag, king of the hill, deathmatch, team deathmatch, domination (holding control points), with a few more yet to come.<br><br>Map design is top notch. All the maps are very well balanced, and very fun, each one incorporating a good variety of close-range and long-range combat options. The two unique game mechanics in this game are 1) the power to temporarily see through walls and identify where all your opponents are for a few seconds, and 2) the ability to summon a mech to jump inside once you&apos;ve gotten enough points in a match. Both of these features add a healthy variety to the gameplay and set this game apart from other FPSs. The see-through-walls feature significantly increases the importance of team tactics to achieve objectives.<br><br>The player customization is very extensive. Gun parts can be customized down to every last detail. A delightful leveling system assures that there is always another piece of equipment you&apos;re eyeing to unlock. Unlocking all the parts can take many hours of playtime, however. But none of the upgrades are overpowered or game-ruining. They all confer slight benefits and they all come with trade-offs to other stats. (Stronger armor will make you run slower, a more accurate gun will do less damage, etc.)<br><br>Overall, this game is very polished, and it&apos;s incredibly refreshing to see a free to play FPS that isn&apos;t a circus. And content will continue to be released! The developers are working very hard and they&apos;re intimately connected with the community via the official forums. So even though this is free to play, I&apos;m more than willing to shell out some cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2301036">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s the same low-recoil, hit-scan style we&apos;re used to seeing in CoD and similar titles. This doesn&apos;t make it bad, but it&apos;s not all that great either. It&apos;s just average. And true, there is a device that could be called a &quot;wallhack,&quot; in the form of the HRV. But since everyone has it, I really don&apos;t see what the problem is. If anything, it&apos;s a positive addition because it makes camping impossible and eliminates the need to walk around the map aimlessly looking for an enemy.
<br>
<br>The real meat of the game is in its customization system. This is the first FPS where you can actually build your guns from parts, to have a weapon tailored exactly to your play style. Despite the large number of parts, it seems they&apos;ve actually got the balance right as well. There are still a few problems with certain parts, but the vast majority are almost perfect sidegrades.
<br>
<br>The graphics are also pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but at least it&apos;s not another brown-and-grey shooter. The futuristic aesthetic also helps, as it reminds me of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, a game which I absolutely loved. Now, graphics and aesthetics is a touchy subject as most of it comes down to personal preference. I like the way it looks, but you might not. Either way, nobody can argue that the graphics are so bad it hurts your ability to play the game.
<br>
<br>But here&apos;s where the games starts to have problems. Blacklight: Retribution has a serious case of what I like to call &quot;CoD Syndrome.&quot; CoD Syndrome involves having a level-based unlock system which forces you to play the game not for fun, but rather to get something you want. Not only that, but after you unlock something with levels you also have to buy it with in-game currency, called GP. Now, this has nothing to do with the business model. I just hate the idea of having to run on a treadmill for something which should be down to personal preference. For example, if I subjectively prefer a shotgun over a light pistol, I have to wait until level 20. But if I want a heavy pistol instead, I only need to get to level 2 or 3 (I forget which). This is like an ice cream shop letting you buy mint chip, but making you run on a treadmill for 10 minutes if you want cookie dough. What&apos;s more, you still have to pay for your ice cream whichever one you pick. Now, some people may think differently about this problem, but honestly it was this that got the game a 7 instead of an 8, 9, or 10.
<br>
<br>Now, this being a free-to-play game, the way the company makes money is by allowing you to buy the gun parts with real money. Because (almost) everything is sidegrade, there&apos;s no buying power. You&apos;re not getting better things; you&apos;re getting the same things faster by bypassing both the GP cost and the required level. Additionally, the part renting system makes it so you can try things for either one or seven days before you buy them. However, in order to really judge an F2P system, I have to compare it to what the game would be like if it were full price. If it was full price, would they still have the level-based unlocks? Or would everything be available from level 1? If the former, then I would most certainly rather keep it free. If the latter, then I would rather pay for it. That&apos;s right folks, call me crazy but I would pay $60 just so I don&apos;t have to run on a treadmill for my cookie dough ice cream.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507655">Expand</a></span>

The game is the best FPS developed to date. By the time you are level 35 (max) you will have enough game points to unlock full set of gear, custom gun, armor and a secondary. Permanently. That is if you weren&apos;t running with starter items. Otherwise I would say at lvl 30 you will have everything you need without paying for anything. There is no pay2win since everything in game you can unlock with game points relatively fast (compared to games like tribes), only cosmetic items such as camos and taunts cost money. The physics and general mechanics are excellent on unreal engine, gun mechanics are great and have an intuitive feels to them. Customization is detailed right to where it needs to be. Not overwhelming and not under informative.  Recoil spread and run speed is all you need to know to build a perfect weapon for yourself. The customization is also very varied with tons of different mods, scopes etc. Occasionally developers release new maps and gamemodes, and have nice events and giveaways. The game has some bugs that occasionally appear but developers fix them in timely fashion (not too annoying). For all it&apos;s worth, try it out until you&apos;re at least lvl 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2589282">Expand</a></span>

Customization is awesome and meaningful. Lots of it. Starts to feel like an MMO or RPG with how much customization there is to character and weapon stats. 3. Free vs Pay player system is balanced very very well. My one complaint really: You are FORCED to buy more load-out slots. You can&apos;t use in game points to get more load out options. I think this is the only &quot;chumpish&quot; aspect of the pay system. Pretty upset about that feature. Solid game, and I recommend every fan of FPS at least give it a look. It can&apos;t hurt as it is free, might as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2429356">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay aside, the unlockables in the game are a joke. Expect to sink 200+ hours using the default loadout before you can permanently unlock a set of even the bottomest of tier equipment and gun mods. After 86 hours of gameplay, I have only been able to afford 1 gun stock, 1 gun muzzle, and a deployable turret--that&apos;s at experience level &quot;27.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3040022">Expand</a></span>

Free unlocks take quite a while, but personally, I managed to get permanent gear that allowed me to compete with high level players after around 15 hours of playing. More impatient people can also unlock gear for 1/3/7 days with much less (free)  ingame currency.<br>DON&apos;T trust any review claiming this is a pay2win game.<br><br>Blacklight: Retribution might be a stupid title for a game, the barebones approach (no real lore, no single player, very little marketing, etc.) might make the package look a little unattractive, but in my opinion there&apos;s a real gameplay gem behind the bland fassade. And with new modes and weapons coming up, it looks like it will only get better. I haven&apos;t had this much fun with an FPS in years, and I&apos;ve been playing FPS for over a decade.<br><br>P.S.: The Gamespot review is nonsense.<br>&quot;Hardsuits are clunky and awkward&quot; ... seriously? Join any game of Blacklight and you&apos;ll have people complaining how they&apos;re overpowered, how they should be slower, how they should even be removed altogether. &quot;New weapons and gear are costly&quot;... yeah, god forbid you should be forced to actually play a game you enjoy to unlock stuff. And if you don&apos;t enjoy it... why care that unlocks are slow? Just don&apos;t play.<br>Also, Tribes: Ascend, the main current F2P competitor for Blacklight has MUCH more expensive unlocks, yet this magically doesn&apos;t qualify as a bad point in Gamespot&apos;s review.<br><br>P.P.S.: Yes, I signed up just to review this game (for now).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2318587">Expand</a></span>

Everything that affects gameplay is buyable through GP (earned in-game). Everyone who enjoys FPS games at all needs to at least try it out.  Post Steam launch edit:  Yeah there were server issues because of the massive amount of new players, that&apos;s to be expected. Don&apos;t rate the game a 0 for that...  And people are saying the graphics are &quot;OK.&quot; Sure, if you have a 10 year old PC. Get a DX11 card, then show me a FREE game with better graphics.  Seems like people are comparing this to $60 titles, but guess what?  You don&apos;t have to spend a penny to FULLY enjoy this game.  TL;DR - Don&apos;t trust the scores on here.  Play the game yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2318802">Expand</a></span>

Now, I get the fact that these guys have to pay for servers, staff, and licensing of the Unreal engine, and for this reason I can see myself paying approximately $20 to 40$ for a game, even if p-2-w.  But if I pay between 20$ and 40$ I expect to get premium value.  But with Blacklight, this is not the case.  20$ dollars gets you the few items that you think are top-class, but as you find out very quickly, turns out to be spectacularly bad and overpriced investments.  Now, it is true that you can accumulate ingame cash for playing, but the problem here is that you can only rent the items for a day or seven days at an affordable price.  The prices to actually have the item forever, unlike other online shooters like Tribes: Ascend, is ridiculous.  Meaning that it will take approximately 100 games to own the cheapest clip for your pistol - and as you get several guns, several mods for guns (clips, stock and barrels) and several pieces of armor for about every part of your body, your &apos;blood-and-sweat&apos; new pistol clip just makes you end up looking like a right tool.
<br>
<br>However, the setting, atmosphere and sound is quite good and has a decent cyberpunk feel.  The game also uses the Unreal engine, meaning that the gameplay and mechanics are quite solid.  The matchmaking is however pretty much the same of most online shooters. You cant spectate in the middle of a match so as to wait for an open spot.  No, you must either have perfect timing, look for an open spot on a server without having the time to check the server&apos;s details (server map or type of mode (the details of which arent apparent on first glance), or waste your time by clicking on the broken &apos;auto-join&apos; button.  Basically, in the end, you are stuck having to sift through servers finding an open spot.  When you do eventually get an open spot in a server, odds are you are stuck on a server which is the same map, all the day, every day.
<br>
<br>If you dont want to shell out atleast 100$ for playing a game properly, dont bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2529137">Expand</a></span>

You can also unlock and buy the items by just playing and buying them with GP which in my opinion is also balanced well, what ruins this game is the Wall hack. The argument of it removing campers from the game is null, because wallhack camping in this game is a viable strategy, pick a safe spot on the map where you can only be attacked from 1 direction, cover and pop out using wallhack when needed and you will kill more then you die. The mechanic is silly, yes it&apos;s different and it is what the developers wanted.
<br>
<br>Think about it for just one second before defending it blindly, everyone has a wallhack, you are instantly removing an entire module of skill in regards to positioning and intuition, this element of positioning is vital for a skilled player.
<br>The only skill you need in this game is decent aim, nothing else is required, you don&apos;t even need sound, you don&apos;t need to take into account positions of your team mates, and communication isn&apos;t really needed either. since you know where everyone is.
<br>
<br>If they wanted to speed up game play to avoid camping, there is many ways to do this without using a global wallhack.
<br>
<br>The wallhack evens out skill levels, hindering better players by giving all players the ability to see through walls. You are removing all intellectual aspects and decision making via this mechanic. You are just a mindless robot that locates an enemy through walls and then press the shoot button, the most lazy mindless shooter that rewards no risk reward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2508766">Expand</a></span>

It probably takes around a full day of play to get the exp needed to unlock a single accessory for a gun (of which there are douzens). I get they want to make money with this game, and I&apos;m also a type of person that&apos;s willing to pay, but in order for me to get a decent build I could 2 to 4 full A- rated games on Steam. So you&apos;re being faced with two equally unattractive propositions. Though I&apos;m an experienced MMO player and I can deal with grind just fine, however, I cannot deal with clunky mechanics that feel wooden if not rusted. Being able to see through walls isn&apos;t as big of a deal as people make it out to be, it just makes you think twice if you&apos;re trying a stealth move. Just that once you try to shoot that person you saw, it gives zero satisfaction, they don&apos;t feel like guns and don&apos;t sound like guns. The aforementioned attachments you can unlock do offer noticeable differences and you can adjust them to your style, it doesn&apos;t make up for the lack of feel. Though the very worst that with an i7 3770k and a GTX690 I was getting pretty bad frame drops (down to 20&apos;s), which is probably just a compatibility issue, but that doesn&apos;t make it excusable or less preposterous. It being free and so customizable are its only redeeming factors, despite all the negative reviews I decided to still give it a try, and I encourage you to do the same. I however was deeply dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2541421">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are MUCH better F2P FPS games out there, To list a few that are TONS better than this:
<br>
<br>Team Fortress 2-Probably the best FPS ever made, For free
<br>Battlefield Play4Free-Battlefield 2, another one of the best FPS games ever made-For free
<br>Warface-This one is especially good! Battlefield 3 standard!
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t ever play this, any other good reviews are people who have clearly never played the games I listed above</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501045">Expand</a></span>

BLR is not a horrendous game; its graphical shine makes up for everything else, but it does lack many mechanics that players want. Hit detection is a very common issue, that I don&apos;t even know Zombie Studios is on the case to fix or what, but that&apos;s one main reason this game is partially playable. Many of the premade weapons in this game lack A LOT of advantages. What I mean is many of them have very very sh*t advantages over say, a lot of the other OP guns other high ranking players have, which they BUY with real cash. The standard tactical knight alone (main gun) is even better than a lot of attachments and gun add-ons. You are only limited to level 1 pre-made weapons, which I&apos;d expect, you would unlock new weapons each time you advance a level. But, I was wrong. You can only purchase the &quot;good&quot; weapons, as well as godly nodes that make you near invincible and give you a HUGE advantage over &quot;GP only&quot; players. Servers are another problem. Many of them are over capacity, and quick joining usually puts you in an unwanted game. Ping, lag, bugs, all the works, even with smooth running internet. HRV has a delay when switching on and off. Gameplay is repetitive in most cases. Maps, game modes are getting worn out. Same old fps mechanics like other shooters. No new updates. Nothing really UNIQUE. Futuristic has been seen too much and overdone in fps based. Overall, if this game does not have a turnaround soon, I&apos;ll probably leave my rank in the 20 range.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631370">Expand</a></span>

You are given a starter weapon set that is nothing more than bare-bones and you gain points at an unbearable rate. These points are then put towards purchasing new weapons and armor and other upgrades. The problem? These purchases are temporary. After a short amount of time (a single day I believe), your recently purchased items are automatically taken from you and if you want to keep using them, you need to pay real life money. This is the epitome of the failure of the pay-to-play model.
<br>
<br>While I do agree that the graphics are impressive and the game feel is superb, it does not make up for the controls which is to no degree comfortable. Regardless of changing up my controls, my attempts to make the game control well went to no avail. I could not get used to it at all. Stuttering and slow-downs are so numerous, it is a wonder I can even feel good about getting a kill. It feels like I&apos;m playing the system more than playing the game.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game has an interesting model, but it collapses in on itself with it&apos;s pay-to-play model, it&apos;s horrid controls and all and all bad delivery.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=3607528">Expand</a></span>

The lack of maps/game modes/weapon variations that are viable means the game gets boring quickly. The flamethrower can somehow burn through a completely sealed armored suit and allow another player to take control of it, from the enemy team, not sure how this makes any form of sense, what-so-ever.
<br>
<br>The SMG is the only weapon to ever use, any other weapon just fails in comparison. I did the closed beta for this game and continue to play today, its not bad, like I said, but it is discredited for the reasons above. On top of this the games new content comes at a very slow pace. There is also a lack of permanently purchasing weapons for in game currency.
<br>
<br>One pet peeve I have with free to play shooters is that they are hosted in america or canada, typically, for NA servers and they are overrun with players who speak Portuguese and Spanish, thus killing the teamplay elements, I did knock off one point for this, lack of teamplay, issue the developers caused by not segregating the players from south/central america from the USA/Canada servers. Yes I realize it costs money but you are a massive corporation with a lot of money and since perfect world entertainment owns the game there is no excuse for this since they are a multi-million dollar company.
<br>
<br>===========
<br>Side Note
<br>===========
<br>
<br>This is a peeve of mine that did NOT go into rating the review...
<br>
<br>It is overrun with people who cant aim and the devs do not want to segregate the playerbase from the &quot;good players&quot; to the &quot;bad players&quot; which is something that is killing the competitive portion of shooters.
<br>
<br>To sum everything up it is a moderately entertaining shooter but does not deserve over 6 out of 10 due to obvious management, content, and balance issues in a game that really requires it. On another side note, the critic who rated it at a 90% and said its better than cod was right about it being better than cod, but was wrong to give it a 90%.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2514860">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unbalanced: People that have &quot;unlocked&quot; guns are far better than you, Why? well all the guns aside from the garbage starting SMG are about 35.9x more effective than your SMG (you will be getting one-shotted constantly). Choppy: The game has a FPS of a SNES running BF3 (My computer is fast and it still runs like garbage)
<br>The animations are bad they lag quite a bit.
<br>The grenades are...... I can&apos;t even describe them
<br>
<br>Disgusting: This game is a pay to win, ok in PTW games you can unlock things but in THIS game guess what...... YOU F***ING CANT UNLOCK THINGS!!!!!!! you have to pay for everything and those things only last for 1 day so you HAVE to pay to play in a marked as &quot;free&quot; game

But unfortunately, the game is far too complicated and has too many elements to make it a viable game even if it is free. It took me 2 days to activate my account, and when you finally log in to the game you will spend most of the time being bombarded by tutorials and messing around in the options menu and customisation trying to figure out what anything is. And when you get in a match (which is complicated even still) you will experience lag, confusion and get points randomly. Even respawning is more complicated than it needs to be. I have never come across a more complicated shooter ever. OK the graphics are good for a free game- you get DirectX11 features like Tessalation. But since it&apos;s set at night the game doesn&apos;t look pretty cause it&apos;s too dark. The customisation is far too complicated. If you want a free shooter that is fair in all manors i.e. doesn&apos;t depend on your PC specs, connection or how well you&apos;ve customised your layout try CrossFire. It is by far a superior, much more simple and far more addictive and skillful game than this pathetic attempt. If you want a real game, get Batttlefield 3. There&apos;s no reason to play this game over BF3 or CrossFire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/blacklight-retribution/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507462">Expand</a></span>
