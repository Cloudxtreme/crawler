The game has no real flaws, a nice and very fantasy-like presentation, a well-done (but not perfect) interface, a large variety of well written quests and a beautiful level design. I missed some more NPC interaction within the party, but the quests and levels easily compensate that. I would give it 8.5 out of 10, since it still could use some more refinement, but the game runs smooth and stable. Furthermore I like the more strategic and tactical, party-based gameplay and the classic fantasy setting. So if you&apos;re a fan of oldschool party RPGs (BG, Torment, IWD) it&apos;s surely worth a look.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=730137">Expand</a></span>

<br>You don&apos;t apply hair color.. and nasal width but you have ALOT to choose from as far as heros and they end up under armor anyways..  the NPC&apos;s are great the party characters are just freakin awesome.
<br>If you enjoy this genre you&apos;ll kick yourself in the a** for not playing this.  both are packaged on Impulse right now for 30 bucks and i&apos;d pay 50 now that i know how good it is.  One of the best RPG&apos;s i have ever played..  and i have a 25 year span from way back in the day  the entire Baldurs gate series..  i started on MUDS before graphics came along..  TY FOR DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB ON THIS!!  some of this pride could certainly be used with all the patch monsters and messy release 60 dollar craptastic games i baught this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=2145598">Expand</a></span>

There are certainly some great aspects to it. In particular, the skill development system is one of the best I&apos;ve seen. Not only is there a large set of varied skills to develop, but not so many that I found it overwhelming, the game also takes a somewhat unique approach by letting you spend experience points to raise skills at any time and not only when reaching a new level. Instead your level limits how high you can raise skills. I thought this was a very good approach to skill development. There are also several other nice touches to the game, like for example how you early on get your own house where you can store items, easily travel anywhere on the map and you can install workbenches to use for crafting. The game has a good crafting system and there are some items that can only be obtained by crafting them. Other nice touches include the ability to use perfume to temporarily raise your charisma and some unexpected humorous moments the details of which I won&apos;t reveal.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately there are also some negative aspects to the game that keeps it from being the great game that it could have been. In particular, there is too much dull filler combat. While there are a few interesting and challenging battles in the game it mostly keeps throwing the same enemies at you in gradually increasing amounts. A bit more variation would have been appreciated and it only rarely felt like battles had been designed to require a bit of strategical thinking. I also found it unecessary that locations where locked after finishing everything related to the main quest there making it impossible to return to them. This just made the game feel somewhat more linear without adding anything (but perhaps it was required for technical reasons?).
<br>
<br>The combat system is similar to that in the Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale series. Combat takes place in real time but with the option to pause at any time to issue new commands to your characters. There is also an autopause option that essentially makes combat turn-based. This works fairly well in general, but I found that the autopause option sometimes made combat feel slower than in most other turn-based RPGs.
<br>
<br>The story is a rather standard unoriginal fantasy RPG story, although it does have a few fairly interesting twists along the way. The intro and ending felt totally unoriginal, though. I did not find this to be a major problem, however, since I don&apos;t play this kind of game for the story anyway.
<br>
<br>In conclusion this could have been a great game if the combats had been more varied and better designed. As it stands, I found it to deserve a (somewhat weak) eight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498135">Expand</a></span>

First thing you will notice is the bad camera, though it&apos;s not clunky enough to ruin things but just feels very uncomfortable. The other thing that not very good is the linear gameplay and dialogue. There are nearly no story branching in this game and combat gets repetitive the more you play. At last the game&apos;s journal system is poorly written and it does not offer enough information for quests, so most time you have to run around to find the destination. Generally Drakensang is a game for die-hard RPG fans, but I do not recommend this to people just play RPG for stories.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=1817806">Expand</a></span>

There are some difficulties in comprehending the rpg mechanics for anyone, like myself, who didn&apos;t play Das Schwarze Auge, but nothing that can&apos;t be fixed with a little bit of effort. The best CRPG since The Witcher, and equally interesting and entertaining from my modest point of view.</span>

I loved the presentation and the details. It was fun to sometimes just walk arround and really look at the scenary. The Dialogs were fun - but only partially voiced. I almost never felt the urge to just click me throught. Sometimes I even followed people arround or stood next to them to read their Dialogue with each other. I loved how most Qests were told. An the other side the its sad that the avaiable companions have so little active Dialog (nor Romance or such) the world doesn&apos;t make a difference if you play an Elf or a warrior - thus some Dialogues don&apos;t seem to fit your choosen character - they seem to have been written with a warrior class charakter or similar in mind. There are a lot cliques in the game - some entertaining - some not so. The underlying rules may be a bit confusing for those not familiar with the TDE system - and for those that are it is clear that SOOO many features and possibilities have not been included. Especially the fighting and magic has little to offer in the beginning - but it gets better. But if you know the P&amp;P rules the possibilities in the game are not even a joke compared to what&apos;s in the books. Nevertheless if you like Baldurs&apos;s Gate or Neverwinter Nights (II) you will probably like this one. If I had to rate this game aggainst the ones mentioned above I would say it is better than Baldurs Gate I on par with the singleplayer campaign of NWN II but quite a bit away from NWN II - Mask of the Betrayer or even one of my favorites good Baldurs Gate II. So: 8/10 points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=730118">Expand</a></span>

Another plus is its great optimization and scalability - you don&apos;t need 1,500+ EUR computer to enjoy this great game. The only reason why I&apos;m giving it a 9 instead of 10 is a lack of hard, far reaching choices (such as the ones in the Witcher, for instance). Sure, rules might be somewhat different than in Forgotten Realms (DnD), but learning something new (for instance: what&apos;s the meaning of &quot;dwarfnosed&quot; skill ;) is a lot of fun here. This is not an AAA title, but made by the people who obviously love RPGs and refuse to dumb them down for the masses (respect!). All of those who loved playing such ground-breaking titles such as BG or Icewind Dale will enjoy themselves with Drakensang.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=729806">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I cannot express the joy I felt when I spied the inventory which was almost directly taken from another old-school RPG gem called Siege of Avalon. And while Siege had a more elaborate inventory and item combinations Drakensang stands on almost equal footing. The overall design and combat are as classic as it gets and I&apos;d not change it for anything in the world, even if it meant the game suffering from low sales on account of those very things turning the less-than experienced RPG gamers away. For a game made in 2008 on a minuscule budget it looks quite fetching.
<br>
<br>The story is nothing special,so I had to deduct a couple of points for it, but it serves the game well I&apos;d say. Some alterations could have made it even better but, well, hindsight 20/20.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game comes highly recommended from me. It is a considerable time sink and completely satisfying until the very end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=4713962">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps critics have become so jaded they will happily ding any game without a large marketing budget, and knock it hard for things like sub-par voice acting and actually having to read text. By and large though, RPG fans only care about gameplay and atmosphere, and this game has it in spades. This is the funnest Baldur&apos;s-Gate style game since.... well, Baldur&apos;s Gate really. It&apos;s long overdue and I hope more people pick it up and give it a try. It&apos;s a gem of a game and it&apos;s sad that nothing like this is ever produced in the USA anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=731101">Expand</a></span>

The developers over at Radon labs hit their stride and kept on going. They nailed the details, and the essence of tactical rpg games. The game is based off the Dark eye p&amp;p game, very well titles have been released over the years, off such a well polished system. The combat rolls system rolls can take a while to grasp, for those unfamiliar with this niche of rpg&apos;s. The mathematics for the combat system are not on any physics level so, don&apos;t sweat it. The game resolves around the old pause, setup party and engage. The fights are quite challenging, the mobs will fight as if they are another player. The AI was well done in combat situations. The scripts are well written, the dialogues have options. The game lacks full range voice acting, this was obviously due to their budget. The character customization is lacking, especially on looks and cosmetics. The atmosphere and immersion is first class. I&apos;ve nothing really negative to say about this game, pick it up if you&apos;re into tactical RPG&apos;s. There is possibly over 80 hours of gameplay, maybe more. Look forwards to Drakensang: River of time to be released in the &apos;near&apos; future.

If you like spending 40 minutes fighting mobs for 2/3 EXP each while you get from the bridge into town, a run that takes you two minutes after the mobs are cleared, then this game is for you. If you like filling your bags with an endless stream of daggers because all the same type of mobs drop the exact same type of loot, this game is for you. On the other hand, while the voice acting is uneven there are times where it hits the right notes, with even some humor thrown in.  The story is acceptable: dwarfs, human, elves with &apos;Amazons&apos; thrown in for spice. Honestly, this isn&apos;t a bad game but River of Time shows an attention to creating a quality experience that this game lacks . If you like River of Time and want more of what Drakensang has to offer, then buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=1562445">Expand</a></span>

I think the game is in the level of all BG games and NwN, and somehowfelt kind of new, the story is well thred and enjoyable. The only problem is the load times, there is a lot of them and you have to wait for a long time.</span>

There is a huge number of things to spend your points on and it can be a little head scratching as to where the best place to put them but on the flip side it does allow you to mold your characters in many different ways.<br><br>It lacks a little on the depth  side the characters may voice there approval/disapproval over certain actions you do but there is no consequence or reward for ignoring or listening to them and this could really have gave the game another dimension. and made you think a little more on the choices you make.<br><br>As i said before if your an RPG fan there is lots to love here but if your thinking of dipping yout toes in the RPG world for the first time there are a lot simpler and more rewarding games to try out first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/drakensang-the-dark-eye/user-reviews?user_review_id=1540540">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a classic RPG - way different from the current crup of ActionRPGs out there. It has all the stats tweaks, the dice throws and all the other goodies made the old school RPGs fun, but still manages to be accessible for newbies to the classic RPG genre.</span>

The character creation is too dumbed down, there is a lot of time consuming walking about but worst of all the camera makes the game almost unplayable in parts. On the plus side, the graphics are nice and it&apos;s not a system hog.</span>

<br>Speaking of storyline, there is only one. It is a perfectly linear story that you cannot alter and there seems to be only one ending. Which makes this game an adventure-power gaming one instead of a role-playing one.
