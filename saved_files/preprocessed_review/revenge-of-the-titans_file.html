This game is marketed as a Tower Defense type game, but the reason I say RTS elements is that in any other Tower Defense game the enemy approaching is on a linear path. However, this game the bad guys have almost free range of where they want to move.  The starting points are visible, but the enemy after moving in to the starting path can move more or less where they want.  3 modes are playable: Campaign, Endless, and Survival. The campaign mode is a little different than other similar games because you can pick and choose what goodies to acquire after each level as opposed to forcing you to have any particular weapon, defense tool,  etc. The game play is basically you plant some refineries to obtain cash to purchase blasters to kill the enemy. Simple and fun in small spurts. However, the game isn&apos;t very satisfying overall. There are some big boss type enemies that you will focus on once in awhile, but usually it&apos;s a small horde of aliens for a very short amount of time and then the level is over. In a better Tower Defense called &quot;Defense Grid&quot;, that game will have you go on a arduous journey setting up so many different towers and after awhile you can almost sit back and watch the mayhem ensue. This game not so much. It seems to be over right after it gets going. I suppose endless or survival would be better suited for that purpose, but it seems that the campaign mode should have more to it then what it currently offers. I bought the game for about 14 bucks, which is a fair price. However, I would wait for this to go on sale for even cheaper before purchasing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=1542095">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;d be more memorable, in all honesty! RotT is just so painful to play. It is a shallow and boring experience, one which never really captivates you, save it were for the aforementioned trinkets - which quickly lose their appeal, anyway. No one wants to chase after a carrot made out of fools gold. There is no substance here, none, whatsoever. Every level feels the same. Every turret, feels the same. Every power up.. you get the idea. Yes - they do different things... but the FLOW of the game remains *unchanged* no matter what you implement. The problem here boils down to the very bones of the design. Fancy organs and healthy skin will only create a fleshy puddle if you have no skeleton - and that is exactly the case with RotT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557817">Expand</a></span>

Now, in 2013., it&apos;s a wonderful game. Great visual style, brilliant soundtrack, plays really quickly, no fussing to get to the point. Also, sandbox mode  editor is great DLC.</span>

Why? Instead of monsters just running through the level to get to the other side, they are instead aiming for your main base in which you have to defend. This game gets challenging for sure but you are also rewarded unlock-able tower weapons, defence buildings and repair units to make life a bit easier. That also depends on how one uses these properly by placing them in their most effective areas to get maximum efficiency. That&apos;s where the RTS comes in.
<br>
<br>Way more interesting than normal straight tower defence, I bought this game a while ago and still find myself playing it. It&apos;s got huge re-playability which is also a huge plus personally.

Thus, there is no paper/stone/scissors principle at work here. And indeed there couldn&apos;t be, considering the fact that you don&apos;t have all your different weapons available in the campaign. Instead, you decide to focus on one particular area of research, and whatever weapons you get out of it will have to do the job. Then its just spamming turrets of whatever variety you decided to research, and the rest of the level is spent frantically replacing barricades all around. The game is hectic, there&apos;s little tactics to it, and every level looks the same and plays the same. I like the retro-look, but thats about it. If you want a really good and enjoyable TD game, go play Orcs Must Die instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=2117491">Expand</a></span>

All Titans look exactly the same, some are just a bit bigger. All your towers look almost the same. So, considering there is no information window, no tooltip info, most of the times you just do not know what is going on the battlefield - are your defenses holding or not? Is the incoming wave easy or hard.<br>2. Research. I like the concept of research, with new features unlocked every level. But again, lack of information takes out most fun of it. You do not know what a technology will do, until you research it. When you combine it with the fact, that most technologies have 3-6 prerequisites, it can lead to situation, when after 6 missions you just discover that for example Assault Cannon technology is completely useless you you and you just wasted 6 missions to get it. You cannot plan your strategy in any way.<br>3. General punishing attitude of the game: You carry cash from one mission to another in the campaign. So, if you overspend in one battle (which is easy, considering lot of randomness in the game), you are pretty much screwed for all the campaign. If you mis-research, you are screwed as well.<br>Considering this game costs more than standard Tower Defense game - and is much worse than many free flash TD games - I do not encourage anyone to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765004">Expand</a></span>

RotT is nice twist on the ever-more-stale tower defense game, where your defenses are far from invincible and your management strategy necessarily hands-on rather than watch-and-wait. It&apos;s rewarding if at times nailbiting, and I found myself switching to a lower difficulty to figure out levels and then replaying them back at normal just because the waves of enemies can be so brutal. Adding the problem is a tech tree with a zillion options but little guidance as to where to actually go, which had me more or less brute-forcing everything rather than trying to craft any sort of intricate strategy (which I usually find more fun). Still, it&apos;s decent enough for $15, so long as you&apos;re willing to put up with a few rough edges.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604392">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Just another indie tower defense game. Has a low-tech look to it but all the enemies and most of the buildings look the same so it&apos;s hard to tell stuff apart. If you&apos;re looking for a tower defense game on steam, try Defense Grid or Warzone Earth instead because there isn&apos;t anything special about this one.</span>

The gameplay is great and challenging, I only had one real dliemma that prevented it from being an easy 9, and that was the graphics.  I enjoyed it for what it was worth, but now adays most of us gamers go out and buy newer computers/graphics cards etc. to make things look more and more amazing.  If they updated the graphics to post 1990, and closer to 2010, it would be an amazing game and a blast to play/watch.  Because honestly, when you play RTS games, isnt it fun to watch all the new graphics and special effects as big armies clash? Well, I just hope that they have a TD game that does so, and we can watch the mayhem unfold as they run into our towers.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: If you are a tower defense enthusiast, its worth getting definitely.  If you are uncertain, the only setback should be the graphics, and if you can see past that then I would also recommend buying.  Its an all around great game with an older looking/sounding environment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=1591197">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like the game overall, so i&apos;ll jump to things that would improve it for me:
<br>- please make a pause button, at least in the beginning of a level so an initial defense template can be laid out.
<br>- better upgrade tree!  Agh!  Icons are cool, but lines or arrows with required technology highlighted would make things so much clearer.
<br>- explanation of bonuses would be welcome (for example - do i get bonuses if my factories gather from two or three crystals, or do i actually loose efficiency that way?  are some several guns of the same category better when chained together? etc.)
<br>- so, classical tower defense games try to (at least in the beginning) to lock the marching hordes of enemies into lines which are restricted by the landscape.  Titans seem to be attaching from predefined points, but it&apos;s anybody&apos;s guess as to their invading trajectory.  That pushes the ring of defense toward the HQ right from the start of a level.  Kind of stale and repetitive in this sense.
<br>
<br>Asides from minuses - solid tower defense game that if improved can become AWESOOOME!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=5648132">Expand</a></span>

First impression you will get is the graphics. In my opinion the retro style of the game works very well and looks great. There is a little lack of variation when it comes to all the different aliens or towers, but in fact that you get them one by one by research, you will surely learn to differ between them. Beside this the graphics bring you a very nice atmosphere and they work great.<br>The Sound are also very retro and they sound like in the old days, when music in games were composed with beeps from you Computer. For sure the quality of the beeps is better, but it&#xC2;&#xB4;s still made in the old way. The pieces are very nice composed, especially the fugue in the endgame is very nice.... well if i remember it right it&#xC2;&#xB4;s a bach-cover ^^<br>The gameplay is often a point were people complain. I felt the same in the first hours. After every level you can research new technology and new aliens will drop in. Later in the game, you may feel, that your research decisions were wrong, because you get a hard time killing some new special aliens, so you feel like starting all over again. This annoys some people. Well: At first, there every level still available, so you can go back 3 levels instead of all levels, to make your research. Second you maybe will have a hard time to kill those guys, but it&#xC2;&#xB4;s still very possible. It will cost you a lot&#xC2;&#xB4;s of money and you will lose a lot of buildings, but that&#xC2;&#xB4;s war. Don&#xC2;&#xB4;t predict that you can play this game in a save and flawless way like other tower defense games. Third there is always a &quot;make it easier&quot; button, after you failed a level.<br>In the End it&#xC2;&#xB4;s also a very retro gameplay as in the old days, were games were freakingly hard to beat. Remember great games like xcom, were you have to restart and try different stuff so many times, until you get a working research and economy.<br>I love it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/revenge-of-the-titans/user-reviews?user_review_id=2096892">Expand</a></span>
